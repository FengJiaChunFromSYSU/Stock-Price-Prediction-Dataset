As for your benchmarks they like all those blogger tests are contrived and do little to eliminate the noise giving a true apples to apples comparison. You can find arguments to the contrary all over the web. More importantly what you guys at intel seem to forget is what made you is what is now your downfall. Content...mobile devices are content consuming devices that perform operations that in many cases are not dependent on the CPU alone. Generalized processors are becoming overwhelmingly commoditized (not good for intel) and the differences and benefits come from all the hardware and software around it. Intel has unit scale for a general purpose micro controller and companies like nvidia and apple have everything else (no longer are they the only player like the win-tel days). Style, vision and an ecosystem that is far superior in the mobile market. So they reap the rewards of higher margin specialized systems while intel becomes more like Atmel. Intel dominating the mobile space - maybe. However, they should be more concerned about arm eating into its desktop and server monopoly - a potentially hobbling blow that will surely pressure their cash flow and mobile investment alike as their high margin market begins to get eaten away at.</Msg><Username>brokeagain73</Username><Timestamp>1359956431005</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-04 00:40:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359957484447-5</Id><Title>AMD is starting a price war with Nvidia on high end graphics.

Seems like an incentory liquidation but that kind of ill fated attempt hasn't worked in the past especially on high end products. Would a BMW still have the clout as a world class car if they gave away a motorcycle with it at half the price? Amd's CEO already said they will no longer give away their products taking a page from nvidia so either they ar trying to move stagnant inventory or they are exiting the GPU business as reducing their margins doesn't help their already sick cash flow issue.

However, there are some affordable quad core phones released using the Nvidia Tegra 3 and the Samsung Exynos 4412 quad core processor. These processors /SoCs do not have dual sim capability in them so they are just simple SIM phones. If you need the dual SIM capability then you will need to wait for the MTK6589 phones to appear. I will now give you guys an overview on these very affordable quad core phones priced at USD $300 and below. I think the quad core phones that are above $300 are too expensive as you can easily get a quad core used phone like the HTC One X for that price. This list is by no means in any particular order.

"Taking the prices of these GPUs into consideration, the Gigabyte 1GHz overclocked HD 7970 sells for $379.99 and scores as the fastest single GPU in our 3DMark Fire Strike Extreme benchmark, even though, the GTX 680 Classified has more VRAM and is supposed to be faster at $599.99. Looking at the rest of the market, the HD 7970's cheapest variant (on Newegg) is in fact the Gigabyte card, and the cheapest GTX 680 is $449.99. This still represents a price difference of $70 even though the GTX 680 is just a tad slower than the HD 7970. HD 7970 walks all over the similarly priced GTX 670, albeit, there are some cheaper GTX 670 versions than the cheapest HD 7970 on Newegg. Needless to say, this new 3DMark has definitely brought out some surprises and we look forward to using it when the new GK-110 based Kepler desktop cards come from Nvidia and Sea Islands from AMD. We hope to use most of the new 3DMark as the Android, iOS and Windows RT versions begin to roll out. We will continue to update you on the progress as it develops."

I looked at the article, it's testing the current offerings and to me, it shows the top end cards being VERY close with a slight edge in the top cards from AMD but not in all categories of these extreme tests. The surprise was that Nvidia wasn't a clear performance leader overall and that AMD was still comparable with the new benchmarks. Also, in terms of percentage drop in stock price, AMD dropped more than Nvidia today, 3+% vs 1.70%(which isn't far off the overall drop in the NASDAQ).

It would make you think they have an across the line redesign coming shortly, but they don't. 2) Nvidia is not following AMD in competing on price or bundling. What do they know that we don't know? perhaps the sale of the AMD Austin campus did not go through or the terms are at a Junk status rate. After all Fitch downgraded AMD debt to Junk Friday one cut above default. Also, Anybody else note that Intel is still being Intel and has slashed prices on Celerons, core duo chips etc. and is now undercutting AMD chips at the low end. AMD cannot survive as a graphics only company without slashing another 70% ofthe remaining staff. Even HP announced a Chromebook with an Intel chip rather than one of those cheap AMD AMU's. One last thought is recently AMD hired a Nvidia channel guy. Perhaps he took a look at the inventory in the channel applied the metrics he learned at Nvidia and positively went into Panic.

AMD is the world's second-largest maker of microprocessors, behind Intel Corp. Both companies are struggling with a shift in consumer demand away from personal computers, which use their chips, toward smartphones and tablets. The company has cut jobs and sold assets to free up cash for new projects. The Sunnyvale, Calif., company reported last week that it lost $473 million in its fourth quarter on declining revenue but still beat market expectations. It said its first-quarter revenue may fall short of market expectations. Fitch lowered its long-term issuer default rating for AMD by two notches to "CCC" from "B." Both ratings are below investment grade, or "junk." The rating agency's action affects approximately $2.1 billion of total debt. Fitch said the company's negative free cash flow in 2013 could drive it below the company's minimum operating level. The agency said that the market must embrace the company's new products, which largely focus on non-PC markets, in order for it to recover. The rating agency said it expects revenue to decline in the mid- to high-teens for 2013, driven by weak consumer spending, robust tablet sales and excess inventory. Revenue growth could turn positive in the back half of 2013, assuming strong sales of AMD's new products. This will drive its profitability lower in 2013, despite restructuring efforts, Fitch said. __________________________________________________________________________ The lease back sale of the Austin status at Junk credit ratings will carry a horrendous lease rate for AMD if they can get a buying. So you go to the next thing to sell Inventory in Channel! If you buy an AMD card be sure and pay extra for the 3rd party warranty....Driver updates assume you might not get any! Of course AMD could announce the sale of their Austin campus...but let's face it JP Morgan has been trying since Nov. 29 2012 to make the sale fort hem!</Msg><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1360015852403</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-04 17:10:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360015975244-61</Id><Topic><Title>PE is a bit high and about to go even higher</Title><Username>whyriskit</Username><Timestamp>1360014119817</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-04 16:41:59 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>12x pe is too high???

(NVDA) in its first offering of uridashi bonds linked to a U.S. stock amid gains in the North American equity market. The bank, the sixth-largest issuer last year of the securities denominated in currencies other than the yen and sold to Japanese individual investors, issued $12.2 million of reverse-convertible notes tied to shares of the U.S. chipmaker on Jan. 21, according to Bloomberg data going back to 1997. Barclays joins Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) in selling uridashi notes tracking single U.S. stocks after $75 million of such securities were issued last year. The Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 Index advanced 58 percent in four years since the end of 2008, the year when the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. roiled financial markets. “Naturally, they’re bullish products,” Naohide Une, head of equity-derivatives trading at Goldman Sachs Japan Co., said by phone. “If the market doesn’t go down and gradually goes higher, then they are good yield-enhancement products for retail investors. The U.S. situation fits into the theme well.” In return for paying high coupons, reverse convertibles convert into their underlying stocks at maturity if the shares plummet, potentially eroding the buyers’ principal. High Coupons Barclays’s five-month notes yield 9.02 percent monthly as long as Nvidia shares are at or above 90 percent of the stock’s Jan. 31 closing, while the coupon drops to 0.5 percent if the price falls by more than the 10 percent buffer, according to the prospectus for the product. If the shares gain more than 10 percent, the notes are redeemed at their full value. Should the stock close below 90 percent of its initial value on any day between Feb. 1 and 10 trading days before expiration on June 21, the notes convert into the Nvidia stock at maturity, according to the marketing materials. Nvidia shares closed at $12.26 on Jan. 31, after losing 34 percent of their value through last year since the end of 2009. In the latest earnings release in November, the company reported quarterly profit surpassing analysts’ estimates, helped by sales of chips used in tablet devices. Marina Totsuka, a Tokyo-based spokeswoman for Barclays, declined to comment on the reasons it picked the stock for the notes. Barclays first-ever offering of uridashi bonds linked to a U.S. stock -- and they pick nvidia. "Should the stock close below 90 percent of its initial value [90% x $12.26 = $11.034] on ANY day between Feb. 1 and 10 trading days before expiration on June 21, the notes convert into the Nvidia stock at maturity, according to the marketing materials." And there you have it -- the world's first reverse convertible uridashi bonds linked to nvda.</Msg><Username>i_read_best</Username><Timestamp>1360032619969</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-04 21:50:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360032799578-79</Id><Topic><Title>AMD's high end graphics price war could be because of Haswell.

Intel is charging something like $45 on the low end while a tegra is billed at $25. Secondly those manufacturing improvements are not a luxary but a necessity in order for its x86 architecture to stay competitive with arm at the closest form factors in power, form factor and compute per watt. RISC scales much better than those micro-op yielding atoms so you can get more compute (in parallel) power at lower voltages. This goes the same for srvers and if ARM is even marginally successfull in yhis space it will be even more hurt for intel. So as I said when those margins begin to evaporate so do its ability to stay competitive via manufacturing.</Msg><Username>brokeagain73</Username><Timestamp>1360034142113</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-04 22:15:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360034188713-82</Id><Topic><Title>AMD's high end graphics price war could be because of Haswell.

Sylvie Barak 12/10/2012 4:30 PM EST SAN FRANCISCO -- Intel will describe its 22-nm tri-gate (FinFET) SoC technology for mobile applications Monday (Dec. 10) at the International Electron Devices Meeting (IEDM) here. The chip maker introduced a CPU version of its 22-nm offering in June, but Intel senior fellow Mark Bohr said in an interview that the recipe has been tweaked in order to scale down to a more mobile, ultra-low leakage version. The change means Intel will now be able to boast product support from high performance servers down to cell phones on a tri-gate 22-nm process, with transistors covering a wide range of performance barriers. Intel’s new SoC technology also includes high voltage I/O transistors, precision resistors, capacitors and inductors that were not included on the original CPU version of the chip. The SoC’s will be ready for high volume manufacturing in 2013, Bohr said. Intel had tended to focus heavily on performance, but is now looking to widen its transistor scope. On the performance side of the scale is the CPU version of Ivy Bridge, which also exhibits higher power leakage. On the lower end of the scale, however, Intel is seeking to offering a range of choices There isn’t just one version of our SoC technology," Bohr said. "We [will] offer a rich menu of options to pick and choose from, both different transistor options and different interconnect options,” said Bohr. Why FinFet is good for analog design Bohr said it was now abundantly clear that 22-nm tri-gate SoCs outperformed 32-nm planar devices by a margin of 20 to 65 percent, while covering four different orders of magnitude in current leakage Intel said its 22-nm tri-gate product also exhibits superior short channel control, with optimum sub-threshold slope and drain-induced barrier lowering (DIBL). The sub-threshold slope allows for low leakage but could also function well at low voltage, making them “much better than the very best planar devices," Bohr added. Bohr said the low numbers for DIBL seen in testing were a measure of good performance in short channel control, with the new SoC pulling in DIBL numbers of 30 to 35mVs, while comparable products had DIBL’s closer to the 100mV range. Bohr said that when Intel had first announced it would be using tri-gate devices, other companies had argued that FinFET transistors would not aid analog design. “Well, they’re wrong,” declared Bohr. For analog designers, he asserted, an important transistor metric is trans-conductance by power out (GM x Rout). Bohr said that while this value had been steadily degrading over the past few generations, it had shot up again in 22-nm trigate SoCs, making it easier for analog circuit designers to use than Intel’s previous three generations of planar technology. Bohr also touted the technology's advanced passive features, including precision resistors, MIM capacitors and high Q inductors Scalable roadmap Ultimately, said Bohr, the distinction between regular processors and SoCs is blurring, with even CPUs like Ivy Bridge incorporating typical SoC elements like multiple computing cores, graphics, high performance IO circuits and cache. SoC,s however, are still taking those components to the extreme. “It’s a matter of degree,” Bohr said. Indeed, Intel’s SoC is almost identical to its CPU version in terms of structure, including only some “minor tweaking” to provide either the lower leakage or higher volatage. It could even be described as a “superset” of the CPU version with expanded features. The SoC and CPU versions share many of the same process features; the same transistor structure and pitch along with similar interconnect and fab process equipment. “These two technologies can be run side by side in the same factory,” said Bohr, noting that all the yield learning for Ivy Bridge had been translatable. Bohr acknowledged that SoCs had presented Intel with new challenges. “When you talk about leakage, once you get down into the below 30 pico amp range, you have to deal with multiple sources of leakage, whether it’s through the gate oxide or leakage from source to drain or leakage from the drain to the substrate,” he said, adding that it had taken a lot of “tweaking an balancing” to finally get it right. The turning point had finally been reached, he said, with the firm’s 32-nm Medfield SoC. “You’ll see some pretty impressive SoC products coming next year on the 22nm generation,” he said. In terms of how Intel’s 22-nm SoC process stacks up against the 28-nm low power or forthcoming 20-nm processes from TSMC, Bohr claimed Intel had “far surpassed” the performance and low leakage capabilities of competitors. “We have a significant lead over our competitors,” he asserted. Intel is also banking on he new technology process having a long tail. “We know that it’s scalable to 14-nm,” he said, concluding that tri-gate was not only a big power advantage for Intel’s CPUs, but for other low power SoCs.</Msg><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1360036101783</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-04 22:48:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>30</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360036334921-86</Id><Title>NVDA ranked # 8 in a top ten most Overvalued stocks list at the site Extreme Value Stocks Worth a quick look.</Title><Msg>NVDA ranked # 8 in a top ten most Overvalued stocks list at the site Extreme Value Stocks Worth a quick look.</Msg><Username>shaquita3456</Username><Timestamp>1360036334921</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-04 22:52:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360036645843-87</Id><Topic><Title>Took My Profits</Title><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1311623376000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2011-07-25 15:49:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Took My Profits In Nvidia, AMD, and Intc.

But historically when Intels's fab loadings approach 50-60% they lay of fab personnel. You can tell how the production people are are edge simply by the increased Intel postings on message boards every where. Simple math....Income flat + die shrink = more capacity = less wafers needed = less fab personnel needed. It's the Semiconductor Way and has been in force for 40 years.</Msg><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1360038026300</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-04 23:20:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360038540419-91</Id><Topic><Title>AMD's high end graphics price war could be because of Haswell.

OK 5 or 6 Monster Fabs today - 4 at 22nm and 2 at 32nm = X number of wafers. Let's shrink the die 50% like you say. Good now we have 10 to 12 Monster Fabs producing wafers in 2 years. Sounds really good, except what in the world will Intel produce? Current fabs are running at 50% to 60%. Shrink the die 50% and that means they will be running at 25% to 30% of capacity. Again what will they be producing? When you can answer that then someone will take Intel seriously. Until then I hope you do not get caught in the Fab personnel layoffs that are surely coming.
