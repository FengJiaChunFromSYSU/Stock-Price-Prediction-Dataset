You seem to have Omitted where all those highly talented Freescale high-end SoC semiconductor engineers are going next. "Freescale itself is not disclosing the specific numbers of layoffs, but a recent report in Israel’s Globes business news said the firm’s local division was laying off 100-200 of its 500 employees. Sources have also claimed AMD [Advancing Micro Devices] has Hired the team Freescale let go in Israel to take a run at the high end SoC app processor market, though those rumors have yet to be confirmed. Freescale’s i.MX 6 product line has been Extremely Strong, with a broad array of design wins secured with leading manufacturers across a range of application spaces.” Looks like nvidia gets even MORE competition. In the high-end SoC business. From the 200 or so new AMD engineers hired-away from Freescale. Now, this can't be a good thing for nvidia, right ibbey?

No time at all, boys. Maybe even beating nvidia's long long delayed "Wayne" to market.

There was a 4.5% dip in overall graphics shipments in Q3 from last quarter. The news was terrific for Nvidia and disappointing for everyone the other major players. From Q2 to Q3 Intel slipped in both desktop (7%) and notebook (8.6%). AMD dropped (2%) in the desktop, and (17%) in notebooks. Nvidia gained 28.3% in desktop from quarter to quarter and jumped almost 12% in the notebook segment. This was a not a very good quarter. The shipments were down -1.45% on a Qtr-Qtr basis, and -10.8% on a Yr-Yr basis. We found that graphics shipments during Q3’12 slipped from last quarter -1.5% as compared to PCs which grew slightly by 0.9% overall (however more GPU’s shipped than PCs due to double attach). GPUs are traditionally a leading indicator of the market, since a GPU goes into every system before it is shipped and most of the PC vendors are guiding down for Q4.</Msg><Username>ryanhiggins</Username><Timestamp>1353968428703</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-26 17:20:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353968505698-22</Id><Topic><Title>Jon Peddie Numbers</Title><Username>ryanhiggins</Username><Timestamp>1353968357768</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-26 17:19:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Year to year for the quarter the graphics market decreased. Shipments were down 20 million units from this quarter last year. Market shares shifted for the big three, and put pressure on the smaller two, market share in shipments as indicated in Table 1 (units are in millions.) AMD saw a change of -7.7% in total graphics market share from last year, and -1.5% quarter to quarter. Intel’s market share increased 0.9% from last year, and -2.4% from last quarter. Nvidia showed an increase in market share of almost 15% in overall market share from last year rising to 19% from 16% last year. Graphics chips (GPUs) and chips with graphics (IGPs, APUs, and EPGs) are a leading indicator for the PC market. At least one and often two GPUs are present in every PC shipped. It can take the form of a discrete chip, a GPU integrated in the chipset or embedded in the CPU. The average has grown from 1.2 GPUs per PC in 2001 to almost 1.4 GPUs per PC.</Msg><Username>ryanhiggins</Username><Timestamp>1353968505698</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-26 17:21:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353969546982-23</Id><Title>Dropping like a rock in AH's Ha ha</Title><Msg>This will hit $10's no problem.

Maybe they are posting about Cramer now. I have so many on ignore, I wouldn't know :). The text from Cramer's show actually states part of what he says in the video. In the video, he states that the stock is expensive when there are no clear catalysts. So the stock is doing 'nothing' during this period. I find that humorous since he has said he likes dividends and doesn't even mention that, and then a couple of calls later tries to steer the caller to buy his favorite tech stock as usual, Apple. He also was referring to a chart of the last three months for Nvidia when he said it was expensive to own (or buy) now. All this on a day when we have news confirming that Nvidia is gaining shares of other tech companies share through Peddie and then separately on a couple of video's about what's selling for the holidays, Surface is at the top in many places for tablets. The irony or should I say hypocrisy is glaring. The real action for accumulation seems to be happening right now actually. Cramer will tell people to buy when the next catalyst is out there or when he can manage to get investors to buy more Apple and thinks Nvidia isn't threatening his 'charity' stock pick.</Msg><Username>roundhouse_c</Username><Timestamp>1353977544978</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-26 19:52:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>13</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353980381545-29</Id><Topic><Title>Cramer's Back . . .</Title><Username>roundhouse_c</Username><Timestamp>1353977544978</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-26 19:52:24 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>NVDA is dead money - no one will buy it with techs all going out of business.
