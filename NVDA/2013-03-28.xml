Although the PC supply chain had pushed the Windows on ARM (WoA) platform aggressively, the Windows RT's name, which has misled most consumers into believing that the operating system is able to support all existing x86 Windows programs, the lack of apps, as well as compatibility issues have all significantly damaged demand. The next-generation of Windows is expected to make its first appearance at the Microsoft Build Developer Conference 2013, hosted from June 26-28 in San Francisco, the US. The sources believe that Wintel PC demand is likely to drop significantly before Intel and Microsoft's next-generation products show up in the second half of the year."</Msg><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1364443561362</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 00:06:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364450793397-2</Id><Topic><Title>Digitimes - Next-generation Windows OS</Title><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1364438295441</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-27 22:38:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What does this mean?

Windows RT in trouble? Report makes cryptic claims Windows RT merged into Windows Blue? An Asia-based report doesn't provide much clarity for the claim. Digitimes' reporting can sometimes be frustratingly vague. A new report continues the tradition but makes a potentially important claim that Windows RT will be merged into Microsoft's "next-generation Windows, codenamed Blue." Here's what the Taipei-based news site said is the basis of merging RT into Blue, citing Asia-based suppliers. Although the PC supply chain had pushed the Windows on ARM (WoA) platform aggressively, the Windows RT's name, which has misled most consumers into believing that the operating system is able to support all existing x86 Windows programs...the lack of apps, as well as compatibility issues have all significantly damaged demand. The report could be written off as just more odd musings from the "supply chain" if not for persistent negative comments from PC makers about Windows RT and outright rejection of the platform from some of the biggest PC makers such as Hewlett-Packard and, more recently, Samsung. That said, it should also be noted that supply chain gossip can often be misinterpreted, as things get lost in translation when they go from the source -- in this case Microsoft -- to the supplier and then to the media. And it's not clear what merging RT into Blue means exactly. Microsoft has been equally cryptic about what Windows Blue is, saying only that Microsoft is working "on plans to advance our devices and services, a set of plans referred to internally as 'Blue.'" And as recently last week, Microsoft said that Windows RT is just fine, according to a CNET interview with Michael Angiulo, a corporate vice president.

Many hedgies have left while others added significantly. to their long positions. Overall the number of hedge funds involved in NVDA are fewer.....thus the lower volatility and volume. I personally think this is a good thing, as fewer rapid-fire tradingbots will improve the overall quality of NVDA sponsorship which is an important criteria in evaluating a stock (Ref. INvestors Daily News). In the longer term, NVDA will be gaining steadily without the active traders taking profits on hourly or daily basis. No dramatic spikes either, perhaps, and that should be fine with most long holders, myself included.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1364489210559</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 12:46:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364489250569-13</Id><Topic><Title>Nvda will never compete in Qualcom's space.</Title><Username>dakdeoply</Username><Timestamp>1364489052265</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 12:44:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why are you wasting your time here???

The supercomputers, installed in Illinois and Texas—each requiring about the space of a basketball court—use new combinations of semiconductor chips to tackle complex scientific problems in fields such as climate change, earthquake prediction and medicine. Other laboratories have been adopting their own hardware variants, underscoring new movement in a field that until recently was dominated by technology that evolved from personal computers. "We have a lot of architectures," said Buddy Bland, the project director at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. He helps oversee Titan, a $100 million supercomputer recently rated as the fastest in the world. "We have more diversity today than we've had in a very long time." Speed crowns haven't lasted long recently. Research institutions in the U.S., Europe and Asia have stepped up the race to assemble larger, faster systems, as supercomputer prowess has become closely tied to national security and economic competitiveness. Business users—such as drug companies, auto makers and energy producers—also have increased purchases. Sales of supercomputers priced at $500,000 and higher jumped 29% last year to $5.6 billion, research firm IDC estimated. That contrasted with demand for general-purpose servers, which fell 1.9% to $51.3 billion, the firm said.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1364500542313</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 15:55:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364501044541-24</Id><Topic><Title>WSJ just in: Demand suddenly SURGES for supercomputers</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1364500542313</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 15:55:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Part 2: Cray Inc., CRAY +3.34% a Seattle-based company that has sold supercomputers since the 1970s, reported that profit rose 11-fold last year to $161.2 million. Revenue increased 78% to $421 million. "We had an amazing year," said Peter Ungaro, Cray's chief executive. The activity underscores the increasing popularity of computer simulation as a way to conduct science, augmenting theoretical research and in many cases replacing physical experiments. As supercomputers get more powerful, scientists can examine animated models of objects and phenomena with much greater detail than before. As a result, the U.S. Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation have been funding purchases of new machines and the research conducted on them. The NSF, for example, is funneling $226 million into support of Blue Waters, a new machine built by Cray that was dedicated Thursday at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The foundation also is providing $57 million for Stampede, a Dell Inc. DELL -0.07% system at the University of Texas at Austin's Texas Advanced Computing Center that had its coming-out party Wednesday. "We are finally getting enough horsepower to transform the way we do science," said Alan Blatecky, the NSF's director of advanced cyberinfrastructure. Blue Waters is being used by researchers for tasks such as creating detailed descriptions of the behavior of the HIV genome, simulating more than 60 million atoms in the process, the agency said. Chores for Stampede include predicting the frequency of damaging earthquakes in California. The advances in horsepower stem largely from changes in semiconductors.

Supercomputer makers once designed their own internal circuitry, but manufacturers in the 1990s began assembling systems using hundreds of PC-style chips from Intel Corp. INTC +0.04% and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD -0.20% Boosting performance further became difficult by simply adding more such x86 chips, in part because the approach takes too much electricity. So companies such as International Business Machines Corp. IBM +1.17% responded with special low-power chips for supercomputers; the current version, called BlueGene/Q, is in four of the 10 largest systems. Other companies more recently began augmenting x86-based supercomputers with specialized chips—notably the graphics chips used to render images in videogames—that can perform more tasks simultaneously to get computing work done more quickly. Cray's Blue Waters and Titan systems both use Nvidia Corp. NVDA +1.42% graphics chips alongside AMD microprocessors. Blue Waters, however, takes an unconventional approach by incorporating much more memory than other systems, which the NSF's Mr. Blatecky said makes it much more practical to handle other kinds of computing jobs. Stampede, meanwhile, is the first large-scale deployment of a new Intel accessory chip that contains 61 simplified x86 processors. Besides standard Intel server processors, the machine will have 6,880 new Xeon Phi chips, which Intel contends are more familiar than graphics chips for people writing supercomputer programs. "What we like about Xeon Phi is it leverages everything people have learned about x86 technology to date," said Jay Boisseau, director of the Texas computing center. wsjDOTcom/article/SB10001424127887323361804578388531030341090.html?mod=djkeyword</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1364501164302</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 16:06:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364502095003-26</Id><Title>Nice close, huh kvimax1?</Title><Msg>Let's hope we can build on this in a big way in Q2...</Msg><Username>mslans</Username><Timestamp>1364502095003</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 16:21:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364504636908-27</Id><Topic><Title>Nice close, huh kvimax1?</Title><Username>mslans</Username><Timestamp>1364502095003</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 16:21:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I told you when the swing traders were selling NVIDIA share to buy Intel, our stock will rise.

I had to leave right after the close, and already tried, once, to respond, but once again they deleted my post. No clue why. Do you see why I've been talking about The Final Hour? While I did think this was going to happen, yesterday, I mentioned earlier that I had a "feeling" that it might happen, today, but given that it was the day before a holiday, and there was only 3.68mm shares at 3PM, and the stock was right at 12.71-72, I had my doubts. Even at 3:20, it was still only 4.008mm shares, and the stock was STILL at that bid and ask. But, at 3:50, the volume was 5.229mm shares, and the stock had broken to a new weekly high at 12.78, but there was still plenty of time to see a repeat of yesterday and have them walk it back down. Then, the Bulls used their saved up "ammo", and in those last 10 minutes we had over 2.5mm shares and the price surged WITH the volume, to close right at the high of the day and week, and 11 cents OVER the 200DMA, for a weekly AND a monthly close OVER that level. That is HIGHLY significant to "technicians". Just look at that chart to the right of this post. Two failed attempts to take it down on low volume, followed by two days of stronger relative strength, and today's volume was the highest of the week. And, for the 2nd day running, there was LARGE buying of the January 15 calls, over 1500 both days. There was also another HUGE block of 663k shares in the aftermarket, bringing the total to 8.73mm shares, and my "guess" is that "something is coming", maybe next week. And, at SOME point, we'll blow right through 13-13 1/8 and there is "air" between that level and 15. So, don't be surprised if some piece of news just breaks us out of this range. And, although I'm not a strong believer in technical analysis, as a Pro I learned you can't ignore it, completely, since SO many people DO believe in it. One of the oldest "sayings" in their line of work is: "The longer the "base", the HIGHER in SPACE".

ULT means that the part operates on ultra-low voltage and is quite self-explanatory. The main difference between one-chip and two-chip Haswell mobile CPUs is that the one chip part has the Lynx point LP PCH chipset inside of the CPU package. One can view this chip as a SoC (System on chip) and it will come in BGA package. Intel also referred to this chip as part of its Y-processor line of products, with a 11.5W maximum TDP and scenario design power of 7.5W. This is quite exceptional considering that this is the TDP of the complete SoC. In contrast, the Ivy Bridge Y-processor line had a 13W TDP (7W SDP), and that was only the CPU. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The ARM vs x86 Wars Have Begun: In-Depth Power Analysis of Atom, Krait &amp; Cortex A15 by Anand Lal Shimpi Determining the TDP of Exynos 5 Dual Now this is a fairy contrived scenario, but it's necessary to understand the behavior of the Exynos 5250. The SoC is allowed to reach 8W, making that its max TDP by conventional definitions, but seems to strive for around 4W as its typical power under load. Why are these two numbers important? With Haswell, Intel has demonstrated interest (and ability) to deliver a part with an 8W TDP. In practice, Intel would need to deliver about half that to really fit into a device like the Nexus 10 but all of the sudden it seems a lot more feasible. Samsung hits 4W by throttling its CPU cores when both the CPU and GPU subsystems are being taxed, I wonder what an 8W Haswell would look like in a similar situation...</Msg><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1364525985981</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 22:59:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364526800610-43</Id><Topic><Title>People holding out hope that Windows on ARM will exist after Windows Blue</Title><Username>will_amd_yu</Username><Timestamp>1364520617237</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 21:30:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I was speaking with regards to the Surface Pro that is currently in retail, as comparison to the Surface RT that is also in retail.

It will dominate the performance this fall. This Haswell is what will power the Surface Pro and the other Window 8 Pro tablets this fall. The performance should run at least 3 times that of any A15 tablet. With Baytrail, because it is 22nm finfet versues 32nm (clovertrail), out of order execution, and Ivy Bridge graphics, it will have twice the performance as the current clovertrail. At the CES this winter, Intel's reference ultrabook had a detachable screen with an i7 in it. The tablet(screen) was 10mm thick and 1.8 pounds. An ipad is 9.4mm thick and 1.4 pounds.</Msg><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1364528193223</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 23:36:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364528499286-45</Id><Topic><Title>People holding out hope that Windows on ARM will exist after Windows Blue</Title><Username>will_amd_yu</Username><Timestamp>1364520617237</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 21:30:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Not exactly what I meant, do you believe the x86 architecture will be able to grow in the mobile field, long term, as much as ARM.
