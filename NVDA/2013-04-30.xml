Yes, it matters. Nvidia SOLD the family jewels to Intel for peanuts IMHO. Nvidia's GPU IP is what makes Nvidia Nvidia so giving Intel access to Nvidia GPU IP was the DUMBEST thing Nvidia has ever done. (The SHIELD toy doesn't come close). Intel is using Nvidia IP to take GPU share from Nvidia with every Sandy, Ivy or Haswell notebook sold without a discrete GPU. You know Intel, the outfit who kicked Nvidia out of chipsets and he FTC has under a Consent Decree because of under handed dealings, that's the Intel Nvidia kissed and climbed into bed with for peanuts. So, Yes that matters. imho</Msg><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1367336721294</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 11:45:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367336825484-16</Id><Topic><Title>Nvidia starts promoting project shield on facebook (The Heart of Project SHIELD Sweepstakes)</Title><Username>daysofshred30000000000</Username><Timestamp>1367306766405</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 03:26:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Where on Facebook?

First, I never said Nvidia will go up or down. If Nvidia is a POS it is because of what it has done and is doing. Here is what you need to know about Nvidia before putting a dime in that stock. Nvidia makes most of its money selling GPUs so why would Nvidia help Intel take GPU share from Nvidia? Selling Intel GPU IP was a HUGE MISTAKE. Nvidia management decided that Tegra was the future and not GPUs with that DUMB move letting Inte have access to GPU IP. The largest customers for ARM chips, Apple, Samsung and others design their own ARM parts so Tegra is NOT needed. Nvidia bet the wrong horse? All you need to remember is: Tegra 4 id DOA and Nvidia gave GPU IP away for peanuts. That is why Nvidia was $26 and is now $13s. imho</Msg><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1367341151836</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 12:59:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367341336210-28</Id><Topic><Title>Chart targets: 13.73 (500 DMA) and 14.67 (600 DMA)</Title><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1367252145753</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 12:15:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Changing stripes mars?

XC knocks the stock whatever happens. Even serially replies to his/her own posts. Bashers can happen to be right, but it doesn't mean they actually had any analysis that created their conclusions. Same applies to fanboys, for that matter. Over the last year, for example, NVDA has outperformed INTC, AMD, and QCOM (seriously, check it yourself it you don't believe me). Only TXN has beaten them on TTM performance. Now, I don't hear XC telling everyone to get out of the sector, in fact, XC has been pumping AMD from time to time, which has been a great way to lose money. If NVDA has been bash-worthy, I would suggest that being in the sector at all is probably something that you should avoid. Then again, that is another sign of a basher. Those who really understood to stay out of the sector aren't spending their time reading about it daily, are they?</Msg><Username>panacro</Username><Timestamp>1367341416000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 13:03:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367341553056-30</Id><Topic><Title>Where did you Nvidia fans buy your Tegra 4 tablet?

Let your winners run a bit and keep your losses small, and u will see good 5, 10% quick gains in bull market. But if u fall in love with a stock, and this happens to be a weak one which is usually the case, then u r in trouble. Why u love the weak ones? Cos the good ones, u would have sold for maybe a 20% gain. So u ignore the stock. But u end up loving the ones u can't sell.

I don't see anything cutting edge from Intel from said licensing deal. The 1.5 billion has, and will pay for much R&amp;D. Nvidia also received some very needed non-x86 IP from Intel. How long can Apple keep up? Having the top performing chip available along with all the features and IP it has to offer bodes very well for Apple being a customer. If they want to compete and have an edge on Samsung, Apple will have little choice but to do so. High performance gaming is also one area of growth where Apple wants to exploit. The factor that will seal the deal is that it would be cheaper for Apple to co-develop a custom Tegra version with Nvidia.</Msg><Username>fairbanksmorse1</Username><Timestamp>1367344923705</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 14:02:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367345778935-45</Id><Topic><Title>Apple is back on top and is once again the RICHEST Company on Earth.</Title><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1367337780533</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 12:03:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You don't get to dump on the RICHEST stock on earth sitting in a small 2 by 4 room claiming that Nvidia hole you're in is a mansion and get a free pass.

The unannounced tablet appeared on an AnTuTu benchmark clocked at 1810 MHz, or 1.81 GHz. The tablet's SlateBook name implies that the device could be one of the rumored Android-powered notebooks set to be released later this year. However the "x2" label points to a similar Windows 8-based Intel Atom-powered HP Envy x2 tablet, shown on the right, which has a premium metal frame and a detachable keyboard that transforms the device into a clamshell notebook. In fact, the new HP tablet could be quite similar to the Envy x2 outside the OS, SoC and screen size aspects. The Envy x2 weighs only 3.11 pounds without the keyboard, and measures between 0.66 and 0.76-inches. Other features include Beats Audio with dual speakers, a front-facing HP TrueVision 1080p HD webcam, an 8MP rear-facing camera, 2 GB of RAM or more, Bluetooth, NFC and Wireless N connectivity, and up to 64 GB of SSD-based internal storage. ............ In addition to the Slate7 and the Envy x2, HP also offers the ElitePad 900 G1 which features Windows 8 Pro, Intel's Atom Z2760 SoC, 2 GB of RAM and 64 GB of internal storage. The 10.1-inch screen features a 16:10 aspect ratio, multitouch and digitizer capabilities, an anti-smudge coating and Gorilla Glass 2 protection. That said, this unannounced SlateBook 10 x2 will be the company's fourth device in a post webOS-powered TouchPad world. The starting price could be less than the Envy x2 tablet given that HP won't be required to pay licensing fees for Android, and the company will likely make it just as customizable.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1367349223370</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 15:13:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367349482469-58</Id><Topic><Title>Toms Hardware comments on HP's 10" Tegra 4 based tablet</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1367349223370</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 15:13:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If a Tegra 4 tablet exist then why don't you go BUY ONE and report back to the board, OK?. lol Is it sinking in yet? imho</Msg><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1367349482469</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 15:18:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367349741830-59</Id><Topic><Title>Where did you Nvidia fans buy your Tegra 4 tablet?

Individual companies can spike and drop through the days, so it really isn't good to compare individual companies for investments, particularly those outside of the same sector, because there will always be a better company to be in, especially if you are a trader like yourself.</Msg><Username>lrkbik4</Username><Timestamp>1367370930549</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 21:15:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367371384503-97</Id><Topic><Title>Nvda spends $1b, Amd $0 !</Title><Username>chrisssable</Username><Timestamp>1367344522658</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 13:55:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Dude I said one could have sold amd and bought back at the lows for a better gains than Nvidia.

Cos we speak the truth about how bad this POS is as evident from its pathetic share price. A lot of money is lost here by many others. They either bought at $26, 24, 20, or $16 etc. Yet when they lose huge sums, the most baffling thing is they refuse to call this pos??? They still worship it ! I lost in Nvidia. And I feel lousy losing money. Yet I can't understand why others who lose money seem to feel so differently from me. It took me a while but I guess I know why. Cos they dun want any reminder that they made wrong investment. They also want share prices to rally back to their breakeven. Hence they always pump . Lying through their teeth, selling their souls to do that. And they hate people who talk down their shares. They believe paper loss is not loss. Wrong! Paper loss is loss, paper gain is not gain everyone! For me, I lost, I cut I hurt, I call this a POS. I bought back some for trading til it gives me good gains so that I can ride it to invest in it.

He doesn't simply spew out info of past performance of the stock, and actually talks about the companies possible issues. Most of your and Xc's recent posts have been saying about how this stock is a POS, simply because it performed badly in the past. Even Xc occasionally tries to toss in a few tidbits of fact regarding the company itself, however misconstrued and slanted they are. Both of you however, spam the hell out of these boards with fluff, and as of late, coincidentally when Nvidia is actually performing well, you have been comparing it to other companies that quite frankly it is absurd to compare them too, such as AAPL, DDD, and TSLA. While it is great that you have noticed that certain stocks outperform others during the day, do you not think it is a little absurd to compare a semiconductor company like Nvidia to, the largest market cap company in the world, a 3D printing company, and an electric car company? At best you should be comparing it to AMD, or maybe QC. And yes, today AMD did very well, but each companies 5 day performance are relatively the same. Spouting out intraday price comparisons makes both yourself and Xc seem unintelligent as well. It may be useful for traders, but I like to think that these boards has many more investors, who try to examine the company more than the stock action.</Msg><Username>lrkbik4</Username><Timestamp>1367375750649</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 22:35:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367375780458-102</Id><Topic><Title>Looks like tegra is done.

I suggested to everyone that anyone short any calls at 13, 14, or 15, from May onward, should seriously consider covering any covered calls (or completely uncovered calls). I also mentioned that not only do I have position in the stock that is well over 5 figures in shares. On top of that I mentioned that I "couldn't RESIST" to add to that position a couple of times, but most insistently when the stock dropped on consecutive days to exaaaaaactly 12.04...which was eggzzzzaaaaaaaaaaactly 2 times the cash on hand vis-a-vis the market cap. I tried to make the case to Mslans, to Ashraf (who truly failed as a mature human being, or else a "class guy" by refusing to admit he had lost a bet that he made with me..."ARMH will NEVER, EVER see 45 again". Well, since I've been involved in the markets since WAAAAAAY before he as born, and as a professional trader, I simply had to try to help him realize that you NEVER SAY "NEVER" in the market!!! While the "bet" was only for a nickel, CASH, it was QUITE clear that it was NO IOUs, NO checks, but an honorable bet for the cash money. Not only hasn't he admitted that NEVER came PRETTY quickly..(was less than a WEEK), but I gave him 2 days to come forward, and he has refused. So, although he seems to be pretty bright, he missed his chance to learn directly from me, and showed a lack of maturity or class...and he's now on my ignore list. When I added to my position when I realized what Jen had really been saying at the Analyst Day, I put most of my ready cash into a calendar/laddered position of calls at the 13 and 14 strikes in May, June, September and a few January 2014 15 calls. The position has virtually doubled in value in the last week and a half, and I think there's a LOT more fun in store. This slow steady grind higher, even on the light volume for a couple of days, has shown NO signs of abating.

I suggested to John7777 that he buy back his covered calls since the risk/reward was so bad...giving up all his stock JUST as it broke out to the upside for 13.25-30, was not the wisest choice. Well...oh, never mind. I do think we're near another inflection point...a break higher would likely bring the 52 week high at 15.22 into play...that's essentially a 10% move from here. And, I firmly believe we are going to see at LEAST ONE 10%+ move in the near future, and I honestly doubt it will be down. Since NONE of us "know" why the "tenor" of the action here has changed, we can only make guesses. Whatever YOUR guess....the BIG question is whether this is an elaborate "head fake" (QUITE doubtful but ANYTHING'S possible) or there is SOME news coming that is very important. The OTHER consideration is whether this will become a "buy the rumor, sell the news" trade...MORE possible, but, again, other than a possible Knee-JERK reaction to said news...A PS announced release date and price, OR Earnings, a week form Thursday...I still think that the "resolution" of this trade will be a new 52 week high and then some. IF that level is breached, then I think we'll see 17 1/2-20 in short order. Given the minimal price difference between the May and June 13 calls, I'll look for a spike to sell my May 13s (only 50) and hope for a 10-20 cent pullback and replace them with more of the June 13s, where I already have 125, most of which were bought below 40cents. But the PRICE difference between the two is only 9-12 CENTS, and MOST people don't realize that June is an EXTRA LONG OpEx...as long as they get, a full 5 weeks and the latest day possible, June 21st. I will also add some 13 or 13 1/2 puts just for SOME protection, but this position is too large to hedge. As always, we'll know in the fullness of time.

Else dun talk about long-term investment. Oh the foolisest thing of all for investors is, when share prices drop by double percentages, they become long-term investors. WHahaha. Wrong. So wrong. U only hold winners cut losers. Hence, only become a long term investor if share price rally and stay up .

Finally got the set up I'd been waiting for. I was out of space on the last post, or I was GOING to say the SAME things about QCOM...the timing is TOO "coincidental" to be an accident. Just overlay the two charts for the last 5-10 trading days...NVDA has broken out to the UPSIDE, and QCOM has fallen off a cliff into a Bear Market...broke the 200DMA last week, and failed to reclaim it. Truly a "tell" and quite extraordinary. I think their mention on the CC of "competition" was a reference to perhaps both NVDA and BRCM (which has also rebounded well), although I have no real feel for BRCM. More interesting, so far, is that even with the 10% recovery in AAPL( which might be near its top), it's quite intriguing that QCOM had NO bounce, and had another failed rally attempt today. The next week, with earnings, and, of course, the overall market trying to break through 1600, and the Jobs Report, Friday, are all potential catalysts in one direction or the other. Regardless, I think NVDA'S Long Bear Market has clearly ended, and it may be one of the true leaders in the next leg of this Secular Bull Market rally. While a HUGE fight is likely at 1600, too many PMs and HFs are WAY behind the S&amp;P, year to date, and they will force the market to 1700 or higher, once we break through 1600 and don't give it back. As always, we'll know in the fullness of time. Best, Max P.S. I just returned from my mother's, today...ugh...close to the end. I'll be back Mother's Day weekend, and don't know how long I'll stay, but was hoping you might be interested in meeting for a drink or dinner...I'd be happy to drive into The City...she lives in Briarcliff Manor, and it takes me 40 minutes or so. Would love to meet in person.
