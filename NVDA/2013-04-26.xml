It is when index is at new highs, sector as in SMH is at highs, yet POS stock is near lows, and have been doing nothing or dropping for many months. Hence, Nvidia, Amd etc qualifies for it. In fact amd could be better then Nvidia as it has rallied 30+% off lows. Hence someone could have cut and buy back to make $. For Nvidia, its a big pos cos its only 10+% off its lows!If u stay invested in it, it ties in your capital. U could have deployed it into better investments. Luckily, it has declared some dividends recently. But still, u could invest in others that pay dividend and grow share price.</Msg><Username>chrisssable</Username><Timestamp>1366949976594</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 00:19:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366950218255-2</Id><Topic><Title>When is a stock a POS?</Title><Username>chrisssable</Username><Timestamp>1366949976594</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 00:19:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nvidia 20% from lows around 6 months ago.

You really come off as a basher when you call something a POS and misquote numbers. I am sticking with this stock because it has shown strong resistance at levels above what I bought it at. I am already invested, I think it is an interesting long term play, and I'll be sticking with it. This paired with the fact that the stock as not been at these levels for 8 months is why I am excited. There have been numerous posts complaining about the stagnancy of the stock price, this is a fairly good sign that the stagnancy might be over.</Msg><Username>lrkbik4</Username><Timestamp>1366953619980</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 01:20:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366956362021-5</Id><Topic><Title>Where is xc?</Title><Username>new_day_high</Username><Timestamp>1366878175848</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-25 04:22:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Do you think xc BS everyday?</Msg><Username>new_day_high</Username><Timestamp>1366956362021</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 02:06:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366957423402-6</Id><Topic><Title>QCOM's margin pressure</Title><Username>findingnemoyes</Username><Timestamp>1366943190079</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-25 22:26:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>TA of Qualcomm 4/25: --Double bottom breakdown on 5/25/13 --Technical target now $56 (by P&amp;F) SOURCE: Stockcharts stockchartsDOTcom/def/servlet/SC.pnf?chart=qcom,PLTADANRBO[PA][D20130425][F1!3!!!2!20]&amp;pref=G</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1366957423402</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 02:23:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366957500979-7</Id><Topic><Title>QCOM's margin pressure</Title><Username>findingnemoyes</Username><Timestamp>1366943190079</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-25 22:26:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>typo correction: should read double bottom breakdown on 4/25/13</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1366957500979</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 02:25:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366957894675-8</Id><Topic><Title>When is a stock a POS?</Title><Username>chrisssable</Username><Timestamp>1366949976594</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 00:19:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Look at AAPL down 6 months lower and lower Do you think AAPL a POS?</Msg><Username>new_day_high</Username><Timestamp>1366957894675</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 02:31:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366961630359-9</Id><Topic><Title>Shield price is set at $350.</Title><Username>will_sell_nvda_at_100</Username><Timestamp>1366933857377</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-25 19:50:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's not a commercial.

Again, no stock is a great stock forever, and no stock is a POS forever too. This stock despite its recent rally is still one til it proves itself. A rally and a stay above a certain level say $16 should be able to neutralize its status. But at $13 or $14, really still cant rid its pos status. Fyi, I really think it has a good shot at rallying and become an outperformer. Cos its sector is doing well and this stock has consolidated for so long. However, it too has shown great promises previously only to disappoint again. Hopefully it doesn't. But til it does shows good follow thru, still have to objectively say its a POS at the moment.</Msg><Username>chrisssable</Username><Timestamp>1366980772298</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 08:52:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366981474387-17</Id><Topic><Title>Shield price is set at $350.</Title><Username>will_sell_nvda_at_100</Username><Timestamp>1366933857377</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-25 19:50:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Man, you must be blind, so here comes the facts for you: 1.

Meanwhile, Spreadtrum has lowered its quad-core processor prices to similar levels. Both firms are trying to gain market share through aggressive pricing, the sources said.

Nvidia has 3.7B in cash. It could be a total bust and not sell a single unit and it wouldn't matter very much. SHIELD is not meant to be some big time breakthrough product that produces huge revenues and EPS, its simply just a small piece of nvidia strengthening their brand. Nvidias branding is what sets them apart from AMD. They have a following, or what you would call "fanboys." Go ask Apple how much that kind of fan base is worth.

Juniper credits the increasing number of free-to-play releases, more sophisticated devices and the global uptake of smartphones for the surge in consumer interest, adding that advances in cloud-based, multi-platform gaming will position mobile devices as the primary screen for gaming enthusiasts. Social and casual titles will remain the most popular category, driving more than half of all mobile game downloads. Improved device memory also will enable gamers to download more games to their smartphones and tablets, Juniper adds. Tablet owners are already downloading twice as many games as their smartphone counterparts, Juniper states. "Tablet games are growing so much because they are such an accessible way for all consumer segments to access games," report author Siân Rowlands explains. "In particular mid-core gamers, who previously spent a lot of money and time playing games but now have jobs, families or other commitments, are driving this trend. These people are really embracing the tablet form factor." fiercemobilecontentDOTcom/story/juniper-mobile-game-downloads-set-triple-eclipsing-64b-2017/2013-04-25#ixzz2RavuXjmA _____ PS: These downloads will not be done with game consoles, just mobile devices.

So games like Battlefield will see less demand huh. While doesnt all these expensive graphic intensive games require dedicated graphic card that Nvidia makes huge margin on? How is this a good news?!!! More mobile downloads, yes, but the Mobile processor is becoming a commoditized product where mediatek qcom and Samsung thrives! Will_amd_yu just posted about it. Processor costs only $10. Nvidias habit of hyping and marketing for more pricey and better margins strategy in the graphics market aint working in the mobile world. Big companies aint biting it.

EA games are declining because they cost $60 per game. Why pay $60 for a game when you can get free games off android or play one of the hundreds of new totally free to play titles. Nvidia is thriving on the F2P model of games like League of Legends, MMORPG's like Guild Wars etc. People are moving to these free 2 play graphics intensive games without any monthly subscriptions which means more $$$ for your PC. A few years ago only "nerds" played MMORPG's etc. now they are becoming so much more accessible and mainstream. As the overall PC market declines, the "Gaming PC" market is doing better than ever. This is where Nvidia sells $1000 graphics cards to people who want to pimp out their machines.</Msg><Username>manski14</Username><Timestamp>1367031491809</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 22:58:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367031568467-66</Id><Topic><Title>"Google's next Nexus 7 tablet will shun Nvidia in favour of Qualcomm"</Title><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1365008441897</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 13:00:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This is already reflected in the stock price.

I wanted to reconsider my reinvestment in Nvidia. With this information, will reconsider on a pullback. Way I see it, if Google gonna announce new nexus 7 in May, as XC says announcement in May, will wait for that gap down to buy. Assuming it gaps and stays orderly. Cos its highly likely a lost of nexus huge news will gap it down.</Msg><Username>chrisssable</Username><Timestamp>1367032413191</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 23:13:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367033153681-68</Id><Topic><Title>Is ibexx right?
