By any measure, QCOM is clearly in a defensive posture vs. T4 . T4 has captured the imaginations of tech reporters, reviewer, bloggers, and consumers. From a PR perspective QCOM is on their heels and that translates into incredible good will and fabulous PR for NVDA. It also creates mojo with OEMs looking for differentiation and association with a hot chip thatalso happens to be cheaper, smaller and better battery life - not to mention a huge win with always on HDR Its bold prediction, but I predict Tegra reveneus to triple in its run rate business 12 months from now And that will means we can see $20 + If we're still an independent business, I think T4 has raised a lot of eyebrows , shield is going to shock the world in shipments , revn contribution and NVDA will be considering multiple proposals if they are not already Longer than ever</Msg><Username>livinlifeveryday</Username><Timestamp>1362053917539</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 07:18:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362054468024-3</Id><Title>NVDA is looking extremely luscious.

And, you're spot on with "IF we're still an independent business". As I said, yesterday, the appointment of Marty Edelman (who I've known for 40 years) to the AMD BoD strikes me as having 2 possible reasons. One is that Marty is closely tied to BIG money in Abu Dhabi, and perhaps AMD invited him onto the board to secure more investment dollars. However, Marty is VERY smart and extremely well-connected, and is nobody's fool. And while J777 had a cute/funny idea of them turning their Austin campus into condos (and I think he was just joking), I doubt they'd bring Marty onto the Board just to help with that kind of real estate transaction. He does have a lot of M&amp;A experience, too, and if they're shopping the company, he would be great in negotiations, etc. That said, IF that were to come to pass, any bid for AMD would put a major bid into NVDA's stock, and we'd see a 20-50% move possibly overnight. And, with AMD gone (likely to QCOM), NVDA would be "in play" and we might not get the chance to reap the full rewards of what our roadmap would bring. As always, we'll know in the fullness of time. Best, Max P.S.

And the phone vendors aren't eager to tip their hat about new models. It might cause customers to wait for the new model, and could make them vulnerable to "supply issue". I recall Intel was notorious for their treatment of vendors that also built products using non-Intel chips. They would be the last to receiver their chips, and the first to be skipped when there were chip shortages.

But not too surprising - I don't think they can run the clock as high as T4 - they would need to install a fire hydrant right above it before trying :) This more or less confirms T4's lead for the next 2 Years! It would take everybody else to use 20nm technology to run it cooler. T4 is MAGIC! Don't be surprise with a dual A15 at higher clock rates in a phone instead due to the heat issue with Quads. At 20nm the generic A15 guys would finally be able to match T4 at 28nm but by then the T4 as is in 20nm can run at an even higher clock cycle and still draw less power than it is today! :) So T4 really have a 3 to 4 years lead!!

This goes to show the ignorance and audacity of most tech pundits who don't even understand that only 4 A15 cores in Exynos Octa are performing cores, and the rest are for house keeping chores/energy management.

What surprises me was why they need 4 A7s to do house keeping when Nvidia needs only one - I hope it's because Nvidia has a patent protection for the use of one CPU for low power house keeping?

He's a man with a vision and extreme confidence/ego. He's driven by more than wealth... or fiduciary responsibility (or more accurately, I think all of his comments suggest he actually believes it's in shareholders long term interest to let him execute on his vision). Watch videos of him presenting, listen to CCs or at least read the transcripts, and that might help reset your hopes/expectations about how likely it is that management would even enter into negotiations where he wouldn't clearly remain as an autonomous leader of the company he build. Also see the reporting on how AMD wanted to acquire NVDA over ATI and why it didn't work out for a reference, then revisit the CCs/videos and ask yourself he seems to have grown more or less confident over time. 2/ MSFT apparently still has ROFR and ROLR from the deal struck way back with the first XBOX when NVDA was a tiny company. The company still discloses this in their SEC filings, easy to find, but the details aren't public so it's impossible to know what exactly the terms are and if they'd actually apply in a realistic scenario, or if NVDA just continually discloses it as a disincentive for would-be acquirers, but if that's the case, refer to point #1 Could MSFT, GOOG, or AAPL make an offer that NVDA's board would have to consider? Sure. Will they? Maybe... but I wouldn't suggest basing trades on the thesis that it'll happen, and haven't seen anyone doing significant research &amp; analysis on the company suggesting it will. And this is coming from someone that's still sitting on quite a few OTM calls (mostly leaps).</Msg><Username>joshpritchard</Username><Timestamp>1362106580504</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 21:56:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362106798437-71</Id><Topic><Title>GeekBench - Tegra 4 Scores as High as Mobile I5 Ivy Bridge Intel Processor - Must See</Title><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1362097471574</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 19:24:31 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>hello chromebooks &amp; low-end pcs/notebooks</Msg><Username>joshpritchard</Username><Timestamp>1362106798437</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 21:59:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362109989995-72</Id><Topic><Title>Finally A very good reason for Apple to consider Nvidia</Title><Username>ltenow</Username><Timestamp>1362094769243</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 18:39:29 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You are underestimating Jen Hsun - no, he would make sure that the merged company be run by him.
