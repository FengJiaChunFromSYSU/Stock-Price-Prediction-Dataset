He will say that reported rumors like Nvidia losing the Nexus 7 means that Nvidia will fail, while also stating that the reported rumors of Tegra 4 being in an HP tablet can't be considered. He contradicts himself simply to try and bash Nvidia. Whosun is the only "basher" who posts some legitimate points, and the fact that you think Xc does as well makes me highly doubt your legitimacy.</Msg><Username>lrkbik4</Username><Timestamp>1367496793431</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 08:13:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367500207966-3</Id><Title>Intel Pays Their New CEO Less Than a SVP at Nvidia?</Title><Msg>What in the world is that all about?</Msg><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1367500207966</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 09:10:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367501104164-4</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Pays Their New CEO Less Than a SVP at Nvidia?</Title><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1367500207966</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 09:10:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Guess that answers that question.

It would probably be too audacious for the Intel board, the post-merger integration issues (both technical, cultural, and market vision related) would likely be horrendous, but the potential synergies in combining their respective assets are undeniable. For one, the combined company would have the scale to generate internal competition between Tegra and Atom design teams. Plus, Intel's manufacturing process advantages could help finally put AMD to the sword in the GPU business, and as the only ARM SOC team with access to said manufacturing technology Qualcomm (QCOM) et al. would be in for a difficult fight against an Intel fab'd Tegra. Will it happen? Probably not. Should it? Well, it would certainly be something well north of interesting.</Msg><Username>bollingr_band</Username><Timestamp>1367505793824</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 10:43:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367506434541-21</Id><Title>"Nvidia Replaces Tegra Business Leader With Former Head Of TI OMAP, Faces off With Qualcomm"</Title><Msg>"Nvidia Replaces Tegra Business Leader With Former Head Of TI OMAP, Faces off With Qualcomm" "Nvidia announced today that Phil Carmack, the head of Tegra development since the project's inception, has left Team Green to take a position as CEO "of one of our [Nvidia's] partner companies."

PLEASE quit while you're ahead. You are digging the hole deeper. Your math stinks. 2 months of trading days at say 20 days per month is: (1.05)^ (2*20) = 1.05 ^40 =7.03, and given today's close we have 7.03 * 3.39 = 23.83. 2 monhs trading days of 5% gains a day would take AMD to $23.83? That math above is 5% componded over 40 trading days. BUT you did no mean that since you thought 5% of todays price is 5% of next weeks price after adding 5% and so on and that would be wrong. Once a stock goes up you need more pennies to add on another 5%. 5% of $10 is more than 5% of $3.

TechCrunch spotted that gaming industry veteran Noah Falstein had listed beginning the position in April on his LinkedIn profile, and The Verge has confirmed that the designer has taken a role at Google. Though Google released the augmented reality game Ingress last year, the company's need for a leading game designer is a curious one. Notably, TechCrunch reports that Falstein previously listed his position as "Chief Game Designer at Android Play Studio," though the title has since been changed. Android has been rumored to see multiplayer gaming features in a coming update, but we haven't seen any games on the Play Store from the company itself. Falstein has most recently worked as a freelance design consultant, at times assisting major studios. But the designer has also shown an interest in what he calls games being used for "a purpose other than pure entertainment," such as educating children, improving health, or training employees. What Google might do with nontraditional games is unclear, but it would be a bit less surprising if we were to hear that some type of Android gaming initiative is underway at the company. thevergeDOTcom/2013/5/2/4294700/google-android-play-studio-noah-falstein-video-game-design ========================== Jen-hsun foresaw Android game revolution, and Project Shield is positioned for the cataclysmic game changer.
