Allow Best to re-post that softpedia article proving whosun was correct. November 15th, 2012, 07:29 GMT · By Sebastian Pop NVIDIA Developing Wayne and Grey, Two New Tegra Chips Since the Tegra 3 chip, also known as Kal-El, isn't the clear performance and market leader it used to be, NVIDIA is preparing to manufacture the next-generation system-on-chip devices. Unlike the past two years, NVIDIA has decided to go forward with two application processors at the same time. Both Wayne and Grey will be launched in 2013, likely not at the same time but CLOSE ENOUGH TOGETHER THAT THE TIME DIFFERENCE WON'T REALLY MATTER. Wayne is the high-end chip, the product that will pick up where Kal-El left off and which will grace tablets, and some superphones, with ARM Cortex-A15 general-purpose cores, plus new GeForce-class graphics. Since Wayne is bound to be several times mightier than Kal-El, there should be no problems in terms of design wins there. The Grey chip is the one that NVIDIA will have to work at more, even though the final design will be complete before the year is out (2012). It will be optimized for smartphones and, while it will possess integrated 3G and 4G/LTE communication technologies, NVIDIA WILL HAVE ITS WORK CUT OUT FOR IT PERSUADING PHONE MAKERS TO ADD A NEW SoC INTO THEIR DESIGNS. There is also the matter of no support for Windows Phone 8. Settling for Android and Blackberry OS could work in the short term, but Windows Phone 8 may finally give Microsoft the push it wants on the mobile phone market, just like Windows RT (Windows 8 for ARM) and the Surface have done on the tablet market. “We have a next-generation application processor integrated with a next-generation 4G/LTE. This quarter, we HOPE to tape out and race it to market. […] It is obviously a very, very large market opportunity for us, and so we are very bullish about it,” said Jen-Hsun Huang, chief executive of Nvidia, during the most recent conference call with financial analysts. “That [Tegra ‘Grey’] is really the product that IN ABOUT A YEAR'S TIME FRAME will really matter to get us into a larger part of the smartphone market.” "The brown-nosing clueless pumper boyz are cheering because the "chairman said something" about Wayne this or that -- while what Jen told them is that, 1.) Wayne is delayed, and, 2.) nvidia will have its work cut out for it persuading phone makers to add a new Soc into their designs, and, 3.) all of this is mere circus barking anyway, because Grey is about a Year's time frame away from November 2012." -- whosunw. Proving once again that whosunw is much better at this stuff than ibbey. Much much better. Because whosunw THINKS Between the Lines. Thinks thinks thinks. All the time Thinking is whosunw. Unlike ibbey, who simply uses his roundy sissors to CUT On the Line. snip snip snip. And then PASTES it here on our board.</Msg><Username>good_point_whosunw</Username><Timestamp>1353467898377</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 22:18:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353471037403-40</Id><Title>Second Lowest Closing Price of the Year, boys.</Title><Msg>A weak weak showing for nvidia today, boys. VERY weak. Just no buyers willing to, well, buy nvda. Here are the lowlights of today's trading action. NVDA today closed at it's #2 Lowest price of the Year 2012. $11.49 On very weak volume. Oh so weak. Just 8.4 million shares. Versus the average trading volume of 10.7 million shares. It also had it's #2 Lowest Open of the Year 2012 ($11.59) It tied for the #1 Lowest Intraday High of the Year ($11.63) And nvda also turned-in it's #2 Lowest Intraday Low for the Year today ($11.37) And keep in mind boys -- this is Not golf, where lowest score is best. Did I mention? It was a VERY weak showing for nvidia today, boys.</Msg><Username>bestville_daily_gazette</Username><Timestamp>1353471037403</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 23:10:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>16</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353471574940-41</Id><Topic><Title>Second Lowest Closing Price of the Year, boys.</Title><Username>bestville_daily_gazette</Username><Timestamp>1353471037403</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 23:10:37 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So Master? Since today, Tuesday November 20th, was the 223rd trading day of the year, finishing the day with the Second Lowest Closing Price of the Entire Year 2012 shows that nvda really is a dog stock, right Master?
