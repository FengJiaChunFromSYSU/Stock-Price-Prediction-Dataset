Silly ibbey. nvidia can't lay-off the tegra engineers. Oh no no no. They're mostly all employees of ARM Holdings Plc. Of Cambridge, England, don't u know. Who will still have a job -- long after the nvidia Board pulls the plug on the tegra. And regarding real estate -- nvidia really doesn't Own any. Nope. No semiconductor fab plants or anything productive. The whole place is pretty much rented.

Growth and Income funds start trying to anaylse the potential of dividend increases. Clearly Nvidia has very good potential with Non-GAAP earnings of $0.39 last quarter and a dividend of only $0.075. A payout of ratio of 19.2% almost guarantees dividend increases. The only question is how rapid. Even if Nvidia is only nibbling on share buybacks. (i Have no idea how much they are doing) but the threat of "Being in the market from time to time" is a tremendous asset when it comes to preventing volatility. With Nvidia's cash flow (Cash has increased from $1.9B 3Q of 2010 to $3.45N in 3Q of 2012, no one can doubt managements ability to buyback shares.</Msg><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1357316014958</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 11:13:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357316040076-12</Id><Title>End of day run up to 13.25</Title><Msg>Just my prediction for ces runup.</Msg><Username>on2five</Username><Timestamp>1357316040076</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 11:14:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357316528738-13</Id><Topic><Title>custer's last stand - 12.95</Title><Username>o.investor</Username><Timestamp>1357314301524</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 10:45:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Keep shorting, pal.

And, I think we will see more positive movement as a result of CES and the realization by more people that NVDA is much more than they originally thought. I increased my position today. The free money, on a company that has positive growth potential in the long term is a huge plus, and I think more hedge funds will begin taking a look at NVDA when positive numbers begin to be the norm. 2013 will be a good year for NVDA. Best of luck to all longs, myself included. How long before best comes in and tell us how wrong we are?

Also, the prior pattern of an up open followed by a fade the rest of the day has also been broken. Lastly, as I was riding in the car, this morning, I heard Cramer asked about what he was going to be covering, tonight, and he was very coy but said "I have a tech stock that I've hated for a long time that I think is now a buy". I don't know for sure if he meant NVDA, but based on the "coincident" move which started to gather steam this morning, we'll know soon enough if he is mentioning it on the show, tonight. The measured move from here, based on this weekly close over the 200DMA on good volume is at least 15, short term, but if you look back to exactly 2 years ago, today, the stock had moved from this level to the 15 level and then made it to the low 20s in 2 weeks. As always, we'll know in the fullness of time.

I'm not sure how the first A15 based smartphone SoCs will compare to Exynos 5 Dual in terms of power consumption, but at least based on the data here it looks like Cortex A15 is really in a league of its own when it comes to power consumption. Depending on the task that may not be an issue, but you still need a chassis that's capable of dissipating 1 - 4x the power of a present day smartphone SoC made by Qualcomm or Intel. Obviously for tablets the Cortex A15 can work just fine, but I am curious to see what will happen in a smartphone form factor. With lower voltage/clocks and a well architected turbo mode it may be possible to deliver reasonable battery life, but simply tossing the Exynos 5 Dual from the Nexus 10 into a smartphone isn't going to work well. It's very obvious to me why ARM proposed big.LITTLE with Cortex A15 and why Apple designed Swift</Msg><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1357354212213</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 21:50:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357354427536-57</Id><Title>Nvidia's Initiation Of A Dvidend Has Changed My Thinking On Nvidia</Title><Msg>Back in the Day when trading nvidia and I had 15% pop on a trade I would sell and park the proceeds in monthly dividend payer like a closed in Australian Bond fund and wait for a roll over.

The new Ivy Bridge-Y series consist of four Core series models and a Pentium series model. Intel Goes Low Power with Ivy Bridge-Y CPUs Out of the Ivy Bridge-Y series lineup, only the Pentium based 2129Y CPU comes with a rated TDP of 10W. Specifications include a dual core design, 2 MB Cache and a frequency of 1.10 GHz. The faster Core series versions come with 13W TDPs but can be configured by OEMs to run at 10-7W specs though reducing the performance capabilities. Following are the specification of addition Ivy Bridge-Y series processors: The fastest Core i7-3689Y is a multithreaded dual core operating at 1.50 GHz base and 2.60 GHz Boost frequency with 4 MB Cache. The Core i5-3439Y and Core i5 3339Y operate at 1.50 GHz Base clock but different Boost frequencies of 2.30 GHz on 3439Y and 2.00 GHz on 3339Y. The Core i3-3229Y is the slowest of the core series but unlike the Pentium model does come with Hyperthreading and a base clock of 1.40 GHz (No Turbo Boost). All Core i5 and Core i3 models feature 3 MB L3 Cache. In addition to these, All Ivy Bridge-Y models would support DDR3L-RS/DDR3L/DDR3 memory rated at 1600 MHz and Intel HD 4000 series graphics with clock speed set at 850 MHz. All CPUs would be shipped with the BGA package for low power Ultrabooks/tablets.</Msg><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1357354513622</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 21:55:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>11</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357354692264-59</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Ivy Bridge-Y Mobile Series Specifications Detailed – Feature 10W TDP</Title><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1357354513622</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 21:55:13 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The y series chips will go head to head against the a15 in the larger tablets.

The truth of the matter nobody should care. Intel has failed the mobile market thus far not just due to their technological blunders (Atom), lack of executive vision (CEO steps down), but their awful marketing. The truth of the matter is that just like IBM got labeled slow, stark and uni-dimensional back when PC's were taking off so does Intel now in the mobile market. They can't shake the Win-Tel stigma and earning design wins aren't so easy for them as they were in the past..."we're Intel and there is virtually nobody else so pay us what we want" just doesn't cut it anymore.

Just wait for the CES to arrive -- and hit its full, wild-eyed, vapor chambered, over-clocked, fully testulated. smoke emiting, 72-cored, Ninja turtled, "Project Revenue Doubling" frenzy. With the gamers making those oohing and ahhing sounds. Yes boys, oohing and ahhing sounds. Over whatever shiny new thing the carnival barkers are waiving the the rarefied air. And when the Irrational Exuberance has hit it's Absolute Best and Highest fevered pitch -- short nvda like there's no tomorrow. Yes boys -- All In on the short side. And sit back, smiling profitably. While the ducks make their inevitable southward "V" formation. "Oh no no no", exclaim the paid nvidia pumper boys each and every year. "THIS year will be different." Nope.
