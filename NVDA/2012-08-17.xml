Will that help you be less angry and determined to make everyone else seem dumber than you? Here's the thing, why would AMD be struggling so mightily now and Nvidia clearly on the uptick both in gaming/graphics/discrete cards in the mobile market? AMD really is closer to bankruptcy than any of their competitors and Nvidia has more than enough cash to weather any storm and seems to be right on the cusp of being the primary choice in the tablet market outside of the iPad, which looks to be more and more promising with both the wins with Microsoft and Google . . all that's left now is Amazon. Also, you seem to be borderline obsessed with the performance specs on the cards. What the Kepler design has done for Nvidia in the gaming world that 'at least' matches AMD cards in performance and also saves energy and cost in the use of their cards. The efficiency is becoming more and more important to everyone in the industry but you don't seem to care about that. So, go ahead and keep putting people down on the board if you like, and show how superior your company's cards are. It won't change the financial mess your company is anytime soon. You've made your points now and shown how angry you are . . so we'll just have to see how AMD and Nvidia do from here forward, won't we?

There are a couple of flaws with this line of thinking. Best, let's speculate that Big Money purchased 50,000 of those $14 calls. Let's also speculate that Big Money purchased quite a number of shares over the past month to keep the price well above $14. You can see that NVDA hasn't touched $14 since August 6th. Do you think they would give up the fight on the last day, and lose not only profit, but take a loss? Highly doubtful. Do you think that they would buy like crazy tomorrow, to pump those expiring options up as much as possible before selling? I think so.

Let me spell it out for you. Hedge Fund A (Big Money) wants to make some cash on the NVDA run-up. They get together with Hedge Fund B (Bigger Money), and say, "We'll write 50,000 options contracts at $.50 if you buy them. We know NVDA is going to $15, and we can all make money". Hedge Fund B (Bigger Money) says, "Absolutely. We'll buy the calls for $.50, and sell them for $1.00 when the price gets near $15.00. We can both buy shares along the way to reap more profits." See, Best, two winners, and neither of them want the price to stay at $14. You're thinking with Small Money, Best.

"The point at which options expire worthless. The term -- max pain -- stems from the Maximum Pain Theory, which states that most traders who buy and hold options contracts until expiration will lose money. According to the theory, this is due to the tendency for the price of a underlying stock to gravitate towards its "maximum pain strike price" -- the price where the greatest number of options (in dollar value) will expire worthless."

You know fact's like nVidia's narrow bus limit's growth potential on future applications like Crysis 3, which is heavily tesselated and require far better memory badwidth to push data. That's why anandtech's editor (who knows a lot more about GPU's) suggested to choose the HD 7950 over GTX 660 Ti. "Here's the thing, why would AMD be struggling so mightily now and Nvidia clearly on the uptick both in gaming/graphics/discrete cards in the mobile market?" AMD still made a profit at least a low bit one. It's GPU division is still executing well. nVidia still doesn't have anything to compete with AMD on the sub $300 market. Where are the GTX 6XX series that can compete with the HD 7870, HD 7850, HD 7770, HD 7670. Oh right there aren't any. "What the Kepler design has done for Nvidia in the gaming world that 'at least' matches AMD cards in performance and also saves energy and cost in the use of their cards. The efficiency is becoming more and more important to everyone in the industry but you don't seem to care about that." The HD 7950 draws less power that GTX 660 Ti in idle mode. Under load it's only 5W-10W more. If you want to talk about efficiency. The HD 7870 and HD 7850 blows away GTX 660 Ti in power draw. LOL. "You've made your points now and shown how angry you are . . so we'll just have to see how AMD and Nvidia do from here forward, won't we?" No just spreading the truth because as the saying goes the "truth shall set you free".</Msg><Username>impulse9266</Username><Timestamp>1345225576000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 13:46:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345225710000-63</Id><Topic><Title>nVidia’s GTX 660 Ti is out still can’t beat AMD’s HD 7950 for the same price.</Title><Username>impulse9266</Username><Timestamp>1345138173000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 13:29:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"The PC is dying!

That means tens of millions of AMD GPUs and APUs will be sold using AMD chips once Nintendo's Wii U, PS4 and the next Xbox comes out for the next 8 - 10 years.

No, probably from ignoramuses, who like you probably think that iPad's and tablets can run Cysis 2 and Crysis and Metro in FULL HD 1080P with all DX 11 settings set to max. Maybe you should do some "research" on you know things like what "1080P" and how much "power" it requires to run those apps. Or maybe do research on you know what "DX 11 is" and what "tesselation" is and see how those "tablets" run those.

Always good earnings also. While they are doing very well in the 1st tier market here is one of their biggest, fastest growing market segments: http://in.reuters.com/article/2012/08/16... I believe it quite possible these phones will overtake AAPL and Samsung! HIMX is selling at about 1/2 book value! You only see a value play like this once in a lifetime. Use 'efficient market theory' or what ever theory you like this stock is not going to stay here much longer! Even if we are in a recession this is the hottest sector going! People have to have these things-they are addicted. The Chinese even pay to see them unveil new products. Elsewhere someone called tablet computing 'lean back' computing. How much nicer is it to sit back in an easy chair vs hunched over a keyboard? Soon most all existing computers will be replaced with these.

One of the Giant Hedge Funds had a Senior Partner retire today. The luncheon started at Noon sharp. And ended at 3:45 pm -- when they ran out of crab cakes and 50-year-old scotch. In the interim, they put their Black Box Market Management System on autopilot. With a plus-or-minus two cent trading range. Hence the unnaturally flat line you see on today's nvda chart. It's not manipulation really. Any more than flying from Chicago to Shanghai on autopilot is manipulation. Just more convenient for those in charge. While they are partying. Rest assured, the human hedge fund traders will be back in the saddle on Monday. And nvda's decent will continue. Just more violently than today. -</Msg><Username>it_is_best</Username><Timestamp>1345252133000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 21:08:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>42</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345253942000-87</Id><Topic><Title>My my my.
