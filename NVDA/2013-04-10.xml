While we expect the core graphics business to show small growth, we project that the Tegra chip business will struggle to grow, after a 2012 where the company was fairly successful in the merchant market tablet business. Still, we think the stock has a reasonably attractive valuation, and there are opportunities for the company to drive upside or ease investor concerns on several issues: Tegra Growth Drivers. We budget for small growth for Tegra in CY13, but have very low visibility, with the possibility that the company loses some of the high profile design wins of 2012 (notably Microsoft Surface and Google Nexus) and few announced wins so far. Visibility into new design wins could ease those concerns. We also like the roadmap beyond 2013, which will add higher-end graphics features. Icera LTE/Tegra 4i (AP with integrated baseband). Investors are fairly cynical about NVDA achieving traction in LTE, and we agree that it may take time. But the company is quite confident about shipments this year. Carrier qualification will take time, more so on voice than on data modems, but we hope this meeting provides clarity on timing. Royalty Income. Recently clients have shown concern about the sustainability of royalties from Intel, which make up ~45% of (somewhat depressed) current operating income. The current agreement ends Jan 2017. We have modeled for a new agreement at 75% of current rates beyond that period in our sum of the parts analysis, and conversations with both companies make us feel this may be conservative, so these concerns may be overblown.</Msg><Username>schmenkle321</Username><Timestamp>1365604977961</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 10:42:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365605649824-9</Id><Topic><Title>"Microsoft’s Next Xbox Said To Shift To x86 Architecture Courtesy Of AMD System-On-A-Chip"</Title><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1365444977713</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-08 14:16:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>AMD will be THE KING of the consoles with a $67B market in next years.</Msg><Username>spanishpower25</Username><Timestamp>1365605649824</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 10:54:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365605858201-10</Id><Topic><Title>Morgan Stanley-Thoughts heading into analyst day</Title><Username>schmenkle321</Username><Timestamp>1365604977961</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 10:42:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>part 2 Project Shield. The company’s video game platform will probably be a slow starter but is a very low cost launch with material upside if it works. The company has not discussed pricing, which will be key. We would expect pricing in line with a lower end tablet given a similar BOM (less expensive screen at 5”, but the cost of the controller and audio is higher). At that price, and with no marketing push, initial adoption will be limited. But, we suspect that with little investment up front, NVIDIA will get significant third party developer support. Cloud based graphics/GeForce GRID. The company is actively engaged with middleware vendors working with large carriers to deploy GeForce Live technology, for cloud-based gaming and enterprise applications. The company gave price points for servers at the recent developer’s conference, but we still struggle to size the opportunity. Xeon Phi Impact on Tesla. Intel’s announcement of a graphics computing architecture competing with Intel’s Tesla (which established the category) has caused some concern. Our view has been that Intel’s presence will likely increase resources committed to graphics computing and could expand the category.</Msg><Username>schmenkle321</Username><Timestamp>1365605858201</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 10:57:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365606983198-11</Id><Topic><Title>Fuel truck overturns, leaks at Qualcomm stadium</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1365556492368</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-09 21:14:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The picture of UR face is funny!

Two versions expected</Title><Msg>A few words about the background: --Xiaomi is the most popular phone manufacturer in China - equivalent to Apple to US and the western world. Previoua Xiaomi M1 and M2 were sold out within days in the 5-10 million units range. --China Telecom (which the article says will get the Tegra 4 version) is the world's LARGEST wireless carrier, with hundreds (or tens of hundreds) millions of subscribers. The carrier operates TD-SCDMA/LTE, CDMA, etc. NVIDIA's i500 will support TD-SCDMA/LTE as well. The Xiaomi MI3 is expected to be launched in a few months. And you can bet that a lot of speculation will arise about it in the meantime. The first rumor about it says that it will have two versions, one powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 chipset, and the other sporting an Nvidia Tegra 4. Now the Snapdragon 800 is Qualcomm’s flagship mobile chipset for this year, and it’s not out yet – but will be by the end of the year. The Tegra 4 is no slouch either, so it looks like the next MIUI phone will be anything but underpowered. The different versions are apparently going to happen because of some “patent issues” which mean that China Telecom will get a MI3 that has the Nvidia Tegra 4 inside, and not the Qualcomm CPU. It’s unclear what those patent issues really are, it’s worth noting though that China Telecom uses a CDMA network, and most of the patents for that technology are owned by Qualcomm. Perhaps there’s a connection there, just one that isn’t obvious at this point. All the other variations of the MI3 will come with the Snapdragon 800 processor. As for other specs, with the MI3 Xiaomi is said to finally join the 1080p club. That’s right, the next MIUI phone should come with a 5-inch 1080p Full HD touchscreen. Furthermore, it will probably have incredibly narrow bezels, perhaps to make up for the fact that it took so long for this company to adopt the highest-resolution screens available........links info in next post</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1365620999391</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 15:09:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365621361832-31</Id><Topic><Title>"Road BLOCK" at 12.78</Title><Username>kvimax1</Username><Timestamp>1365613996698</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 13:13:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>For you bagholders info.

The number of shares short is then compared to the average daily volume, in order to calculate the total number of trading days it would take to close out all of the open short positions if every share traded represented a short position being closed. In our new rank based on the most recent short interest data from NASDAQ, NVIDIA Corp (NASD: NVDA) has taken over the position of #39 most shorted Nasdaq 100 component, from Comcast Corp (NASD: CMCSA) which is now in the #54 spot. The “days to cover” at 03/28/2013 was 3.42 for NVDA, and 2.40 for CMCSA; this compares to the average across all Nasdaq 100 components of 4.15 (up from the average back on the 03/15/2013 settlement date of 3.66). The chart below shows the movement over time of the “days to cover” values of both NVDA and CMCSA, versus the average Nasdaq 100 component. A stock with a high “days to cover” value compared to its peers would be considered to have a higher level of short interest as compared to those peers. This could mean short sellers are using the stock to hedge a long bet elsewhere, or could also mean that short sellers believe the price of the stock will decline. When short sellers eventually cover their positions, by definition there must be buying activity because a share that is currently sold short must be purchased to be covered. So investors tend to keep an eye on that “days to cover” number is high, it is more difficult to close those positions without sending the stock higher until the higher price produces enough sellers to generate the necessary volume.</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1365626012902</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 16:33:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365626389605-39</Id><Topic><Title>Nvidia already saw $20s and this is the place for Nvidia fans who BLEW IT</Title><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1365611474725</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 12:31:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I don't get it.

He almost was fired again in the early 90s for messing with his stock options and this likely made him even more paranoid. Now even in companies where such deep paranoia doesn’t exist, it is somewhat rare to see a top executive truly mentor a replacement. Thus, it shouldn’t come as a huge surprise that Jobs didn’t really share much of his secret sauce for success with anyone, including Cook. But even if he had I’m not sure Cook would have understood, simply because the two men are about as opposite as you can get. Remember, Jobs was a micromanager, he studied heavily both how to influence people and seemed to intuitively understand the “magic” that surround a premium brand like Porsche. In contrast, Cook is a delegator, he was a logistics guy and understands how to compete on price, he came from Compaq and there is nothing, other than his time as COO at Apple, which connects his background to a premium brand. In fact, logistics (supply chain), generally favors folks who understand how to get vendors to compete on price - but even there word is that Jobs often stepped in and closed the most aggressive deals, or held vendors’ feet to the fire, personally. Now that’s the nature of a micromanager. So Cook never had the skills needed to run Apple but that isn’t the core of the problem because it was the Apple board that appointed Cook and keeps him on the job, as they haven’t replaced or supplemented him with someone more qualified. Someone that understands that selling a premium product in stores like Walmart will destroy that premium value. I mean, when you think of Apple, does your head immediately connect with the stereo typical Walmart buyer and say “now there is a good fit!?” Well, it probably does for Cook, although he is all about volume.

So the key problem that must initially be fixed is this: Apple needs a board made up of people who understand how to manage a premium brand. As you may recall, Jobs wanted a board that would leave him alone and prevent poundings by the US Government (Al Gore). So with Jobs gone, the company clearly needs a board that knows how to replace or emulate him with a team. Until that fix is made, even if Cook were fired tomorrow, chances are they’d pick someone even worse and we’d have a decade-long CEO spiral like HP. Wrapping Up: Fixing the Board If you don’t fix Apple’s board before Cook is replaced, and unless Apple starts to recover soon he is toast, the next CEO will likely be worse. The screwy thing? This will likely force a replacement of the board but the now less qualified CEO will have a huge vote and likely pack the board with folks that support them. This will not fix Apple, but rather, only leave the less qualified CEO in place longer and we’ll have a death spiral with successively worse CEOs and less qualified boards. But who assures the qualifications of the board? I mean other than the board itself? The CEO, but if both of them are increasingly less qualified, unless a miracle happens, each change will be progressively worse. So at the core of Apple’s problem is the fact that we really don’t have a good process to fix a bad board. Of course, this isn’t just Apple’s problem, it is a national issue, and that is why so few companies last more than a couple of decades. This came up when I had a review of IBM, the only century old tech company, and we realized that only a small handful of companies that were around at IBM’s 50th anniversary still exist today.

INTC is down 2% in after hours, and so is MSFT, with HPQ down 2.7%. If you have the time, look at the volume, today, in the APRIL 12 1/2s and 13s, both for this week and next, and next week's13s and 14s. It was quite substantial, and whether people agree with me that "something" IS coming, possibly tomorrow, or by next week, I believe this action is important to note. I've been involved in options since 1977, and I have to say that when I see this kind of HUGE volume, it PAYS to PAY ATTENTION. Also of note, was that yesterday there were 10k Sept. 12 calls bought "to open" (which represent 1mm shares), as the OI went from 2700 to 12,700 from yesterday to today. They paid various prices but most of them were at 1.37. Today, another 1870 were traded, mostly at 1.50, and nearly all of them were traded on various exchanges at THE SAME TIME...2:05. The last 335 of them traded at 3:41 at a price of 1.49. We'll know in the morning whether these, too, were "to open". It's also been quite interesting to watch the action in the last 10 minutes in NVDA, for most of the last 2 weeks. Today, for instance, nearly 2mm shares traded during that time (and, yes, M stands for a thousand, in Roman Numerals, and MM stands for a thousand thousand...or a million...ONLY time I'll respond to an uninformed person). There was a pretty titanic battle in the last THREE minutes, with the stock trying to break above 12.85, only to be pounded back to 12.80, and thereafter moving back up to 12.83. I'd call that a modest "win" for the bulls, with the stock closing at the precise level it closed at 2 Fridays ago, AND a penny above the "sell" call from Susquehanna. I'm just trying to share my "experience". As always, we'll know in the fullness of time.

It is backing horses in a variety of races that will have the potential to widen its market reach, especially in enterprise IT. This is a vendor with enviable shares at the low end (60%) and high end (80%) of the PC GPU market, as well as in the accelerator market for high performance computing (HPC), where it is ahead of its rivals. Having dominated the top of the pyramid (HPC) and the bottom layer (GPU cards), the vendor is poised to break into the remaining tiers – large enterprises and SMEs – with grid and appliance GPU-based cloud solutions. In addition, Nvidia GPU compute devices coupled with ARM processors are set to create mobile supercomputers. Nvidia has also launched its own gaming console, to take a bigger market share in gaming. With nearest rivals Intel and AMD still a generation behind in product development, Nvidia is well positioned to expand its market into the broader enterprise IT world, with design in manufacturing and film/video media key targets. The most significant announcement from Nvidia is its bid to be an enterprise IT player Shazam provides the kind of Nvidia case study that will make enterprise users pay attention. The music recognition service for smart devices performs recognitions on average 10 million times per day, searching a database of 27,000 pieces of music. Both the number of users and the size of the database are rapidly growing. This is a Big Data problem, and Shazam has been able to scale its operation by exploiting Nvidia GPUs that have significantly increased its computing capabilities while reducing costs by a third. Nvidia announced availability of Grid boards through OEM partners and is licensing Grid Technology, including remote desktop capability to virtualization partners. OEM Grid servers are general purpose and will target designers, power users, and and knowledge workers using a range of applications. Such solutions will appeal to the large enterprise market.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1365646318796</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 22:11:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365646864694-66</Id><Topic><Title>NVIDIA's GPU compute aims at breaking open the enterprise IT (an OVUM review)</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1365646318796</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 22:11:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Part 2: Big Data computation demands will spur Nvidia Grid OEM and Grid VCA adoption Examples like Shazam, and others such as the market for digital showrooms or point-of-sale operations reflect the general trend towards the digitization of manufacturing which The Economist is calling the “third industrial revolution”. Audi’s digital showroom, for example, requires massive compute capabilities and the Grid VCA is a perfect use case for where there is no space or time for setting up a sophisticated IT support infrastructure. Instead, installing a Grid VCA can offer massive computation power in a simple and neat setup. Whether use cases are in automotive design or movie industry CGI rendering for directors to update complex animations on live sets, the capability to process Big Data in realtime will open up new market opportunities for Nvidia. Nvidia’s play in four market segments will boost its growth prospects The top end of Nvidia’s market is high-performance computing, a specialized high-margin, low-volume activity confined to a small number of research laboratories. Revenue will always be constrained by the low volume. At the opposite end, Nvidia is already well established in the PC and gaming market with PC graphics cards and GPUs in the Microsoft Xbox and Sony PlayStation 3 consoles. It is raising its profile in this market by introducing its own console, Project Shield. This may cause some rethinking at Microsoft and Sony, but Nvidia sees an opportunity to take an increased share in a market bigger than the film industry. All markets have an associated lifespan and gaming as we know it may be reaching the latter stages of that cycle. If Nvidia GPU compute devices proliferate in the server and mobile spaces over the next five years, the computational capability needed for high-end games will exist in commonly found hardware. But as one door closes, another opens: the middle ground comprising advanced mobility and grid computation for enterprise IT is a massive opportunity that offers good margins and high volumes. The key logic that will drive increasing market share for Nvidia is greater computational power at reduced cost.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1365646864694</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 22:21:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365646941170-67</Id><Topic><Title>Not good news for Nvda and Pc makers, no siree.</Title><Username>jokonczak</Username><Timestamp>1365637635453</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 19:47:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nvidia plays in the very high end PC space, and it sells a lot of add-in boards, so PC sales aren't a great proxy for Nvidia's quarterly results.</Msg><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1365646941170</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 22:22:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365647688241-68</Id><Topic><Title>NVIDIA's GPU compute aims at breaking open the enterprise IT (an OVUM review)</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1365646318796</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 22:11:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Another Excellent Find. It speaks to the heart of what The Street is missing in this story. They simply don't have the "vision" necessary to understand how much BIGGER NVDA's TAM is about to be and how they are SO far ahead of the competition in the extra speed at lower cost that they will likely end up 1 1/2-2 generations ahead. Maybe that won't happen until 2014-15...BUT, I think the "world" is about to catch on to this idea, and will take the shares sharply higher as that concept sinks in. In 3-5 years, I suspect the stock will see 40+/share. Love to see who posted that if you have the link, Ibexx. REALLY on traget.

A presentation from Los Alamos National Laboratory at the conference described a scientific problem where they needed to run simulated annealing and genetic algorithm code written in Java and for which porting to C/C++ was not practical. This and another were two presentations this year covering Java running on GPUs compared to none at the conference in 2012. The ideal solution is for a Java compiler to run on the open standards based LLVM project, similar to the recent announcement of CUDA Python, which was built on top of Nvidia’s open source LLVM GPU compiler. If Nvidia is to open GPU computing to the mass developer market it needs more than CUDA on C/C++ open source compilers. This is why work on Python, Java and projects such as the statistical package R for GPUs are important. ovumDOTcom/2013/04/08/nvidia-gpu-compute-aims-to-break-open-enterprise-it/ ______ The author is a principal analyst for Ovum LTD, Software.
