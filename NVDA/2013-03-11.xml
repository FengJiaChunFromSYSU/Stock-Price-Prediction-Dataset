After the supposed first images of the Samsung Galaxy S IV (or one of its variants) were outed earlier, now we get some alleged details about Motorola’s famous X Phone, along with a pretty blurry shot of a slide depicting its design. Or something along those lines, since it’s pretty hard to see much, except that it’s going to be a very square affair. The X Phone has long been rumored as the first device to come out of Motorola under Google’s supervision. The search giant bought the ailing phone maker a while back, but ever since all the phones launched under the Motorola logo had already been ‘in the pipeline’ when that happened. So the X Phone brings us the promise of a Nexus-like experience, only made by Motorola. Something to really compete with the Galaxy S IV and the HTC One, if you will. So color us disappointed if this rumor pans out. According to it, the X Phone will have an Nvidia Tegra 4i processor. That’s not the Tegra 4, mind you. The Tegra 4i was announced last month and is Nvidia’s first chipset that integrates an LTE modem. However, in terms of CPU and GPU performance, it’s not as great as the Tegra 4 (as that’s based on the newest ARM architecture, Cortex-A15, while the Tegra 4i uses the Cortex-A9 design that was popular in last year’s flagship phones). Of course this doesn’t mean that the Tegra 4i will be underpowered or unable to serve the X Phone’s needs well, but it won’t be ‘the cream of the crop’. Which is an odd decision for what has always been rumored to be the flagship device for Motorola this year. unwiredviewDOTcom/2013/03/11/motorola-x-phone-details-specs-and-blurry-image-leaked/ ________ Nothing to be disappointed about, folks! Tegra 4i retains 80% of Tegra 4's performance, yet lighter and cheaper and giving you much longer battery life.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1363014702580</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 11:11:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363014876831-14</Id><Topic><Title>First design win for Tegra 4i: Motorola X phone specs leaked..</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1363014702580</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 11:11:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's worth noting that the author says the Motorola X phone would be the first Motorola handset developed by Google's M team after the takeover.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1363014876831</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 11:14:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363015342821-15</Id><Topic><Title>How do you downgrade NVDA in the 12s?</Title><Username>mslans</Username><Timestamp>1363008790543</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 09:33:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Was just bout to ask the same question...</Msg><Username>fdigiovanni01</Username><Timestamp>1363015342821</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 11:22:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363017139439-16</Id><Topic><Title>First design win for Tegra 4i: Motorola X phone specs leaked..</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1363014702580</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 11:11:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If true, Motorola X phone should outperform both Samsung Galaxy IV (Snapdragon 600 or Exynos 5 Octa) and HTC ONE (Snapdragon 600) based on Antutu benchmarks which have been reported for both Exynos Octa and S600.

They will begin to get more and more nervous as they realize that their "sell" rating is being met with no volume and very little price movement. Believe me, they did not think this would only get the stock down by 10-20 cents, and was a last ditch effort to keep the stock from staying over the 200DMA. As Ibexx said, they are really a Hedge Fund, and they are probably short a bunch of the stock and the March 13 calls. I'm quite surprised, actually, that they didn't wait to see how the stock did the first few days of the week and come out with this on Thursday or even Friday. Now, they've spent their ammunition, and will have to deal with what comes now. I have no way to know if the market or the stock will rally, today, or this week, other than to say that with volume this low, most participants are ignoring this call, at best, and some might show the firm up by taking the stock up through 13 just to spite them. Keep an eye on the volume and if we should close above the 200DMA, again today, I think their call will look ridiculous. We're right at the highs of the day and above the 200DMA. My "guess" is we continue higher and who knows, maybe even finish up on the day. THAT would show them...;) As always, we'll know in the fullness of time.

That’s because thanks to the nice work over at Droid-Life, the image and specs have been debunked. The image with the label “Motorola NXT” rather than “X” surfaced on foreign Android news site AndroidWorld. It’s the first time the rumored X device from Motorola and Google has been referred to as “NXT.” That’s already worthy of suspicion, but then we get to the specs, which only add to the confusion. According to this rumor, the X — or NXT, or whatever the hell it’s supposed to be — is supposed to have a 4.7-inch HD display, NVIDIA Tegra 4i chipset, 16MP rear camera and a 5MP front camera. Since the 4i doesn’t support CDMA networks, unless Motorola’s X Phone was going to be an LTE-only phone (which is just short of impossible) then it would be ditching support for Verizon or Sprint in the U.S. by going with the 4i. If that’s not enough, AndroidWorld updated its article with a few sentences after finding out the tipster created the entire image you see above itself. It’s not officially from Motorola, not leaked, and therefore not legitimate. The website had already mentioned earlier in the post that it should be taken “with a very large grain of salt.” Sorry X Phone enthusiasts, but you’ll have to keep waiting for now.

So whatever turns out to be true about the Motorola X, the value placed on CDMA for handsets will be diminished by the end of this year. Also, the same Tegra chip, 4i, does support the TD-SCDMA spec. Nvidia is not supporting CDMA to maximize margin, not because their modem is incapable of supporting CDMA. They, like Verizon, are tired of paying Qualcomm all the royalties and surchages.</Msg><Username>roundhouse_c</Username><Timestamp>1363027173782</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 14:39:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363027263632-25</Id><Topic><Title>NVDA Report and Stock Poll</Title><Username>nybernstmildred</Username><Timestamp>1363002725649</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 07:52:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Continue sharing this to us please.

They are a high frequency trading firm with a specialization in options. The top employee benefit they list is an annual massive Texas Holdem tournament for their employees....interesting combination. Notice almost zero block trades except at the open and close. Also the analyst that did the downgrade in late 2010 had $9 price target at the end of 2010 and then upgraded his rating to neutral when the stock hit $24.50. I don't know if I want to make any investment decisions from their ratings. Call me when JP Morgan, Merrill Lynch, or Goldman Sachs weigh in. In the meantime....IMHO... the Nvidia Tech Science fair is important not because of all the tech stuff. Ehat is important is the embedded financial analyst presentation right after Jensen's keynote....Cruel...but some of the bored WS types may actually watch the keynote...but you know everyone will watch the financial presentation. Here's hoping he makes it simple and lays out the yearly plan for revenue and earnings. Note: Analysts have been begging for it for 3 months because Nvidia has entered or about to enter so many new businesses that no one can put together any cohesive financial model. Here's hoping it's simple and specific.....Here's the Tam and here is what our bonus goals are built on.

It seems that their stock recommendations/downgrades are entirely based on their existing position in the stock. I looked for one of their recommendations about six months ago. Five months ago (bad calendar counting on my part) they downgraded Greenhill (NYSE:GHL) when it was about $50. The price dipped a bit, following the market, but is now about $60. Great call. Actually it probably was, for them. Presumably they covered their short position when their downgrade caused the price to temporarily drop.</Msg><Username>watergatefive</Username><Timestamp>1363039218363</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 18:00:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363040032146-36</Id><Topic><Title>Susquehanna will be getting nervous, soon.</Title><Username>kvimax1</Username><Timestamp>1363022853638</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 13:27:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Mslans- Right about the time I wrote that, the stock had recovered to 12.75, and it had the look of a stock that was going to go right back to unched or up on the day. It didn't. However, even with the ensuing sell off and lack of volume, the stock did recover to close ABOVE the 200DMA and ABOVE the down opening price...albeit by 1/2 cent, but that is still important. When a stock gaps up or down, it's quite important to see if it closes above that opening price. So, as had been the case, quite often in NVDA, the stock would gap UP and then close flat or lower on the day, but surely below the opening price. Today it was the opposite, and this is what is going to make the shorts nervous. NO volume on a "sell" call, and NO real downward movement. (They definitely were looking for more than a 12 cent loss.) And, I do believe they WERE nervous when the stock got back to 12.75, and again when it got back to 12.72 in the last 1/2 hour. At 3:30, the stock had traded 5.169mm shares and was at 12.62-.63...at 4:00, the stock had traded ANOTHER 2.3mm shares and was at 12.69-70, closing at 12.695 (I must say I've NEVER seen ANOTHER stock trade at so many fractions of a penny, EVER), which was above the 12.69 open. So, while I may be wrong for this week (but there's PLENTY of time), and maybe we won't get over 13, we are getting closer to seeing the kind of move up in NVDA that BBRY had, today. And when it DOES happen, you'll see some explosive volume and a major league fight, but when the Bulls win, it will be for a pretty long ride. And, don't forget, while NVDA HAS been one of the worst performers over the last 5 years, people were SURE that NVDA would be put out of business by INTC. Jen Hsun has done an incredible job of reinventing the company and the fruits of that labor are coming soon. As always, we'll know in the fullness of time.

"Venerable chip analysts Microprocessor Report today offer up an assessment of Nvidia‘s (NVDA) “Tegra 4” application processor as to how it stacks up against Qualcomm‘s (QCOM) “Snapdragon” family of processors, based on benchmark data released by Nvidia two weeks ago at the Mobile World Congress show in Barcelona. (All articles require a subscription to Microprocessor Report.) The conclusion of the Report’s Kevin Krewell is that Tegra 4 is the fastest mobile processor using ARM Holdings (ARMH) technology, even in comparison to the fastest projected versions of Snapdragon: At MWC, the company continued its product reve- lation by disclosing new details of the architecture and its capabilities (as well as limitations). Judging from this pre- liminary information, Tegra 4 rates as the highest-perform- ing mobile ARM processor—if power constraints don’t throttle the cores. This performance takes aim at Qual- comm’s newest Snapdragon processors; Nvidia offered a wide range of benchmark results that clearly showed Tegra 4 leading both the APQ8064 and (judging from our estimates) the forthcoming Snapdragon 800 […] We also estimated the performance of the Snap- dragon Series 800, assuming that it will achieve its rated 2.3GHz clock speed and applying a 10% gain to represent the improvements from the Krait 200 CPU to the Krait 400 CPU. This approach is probably optimistic, as most bench- mark scores do not improve linearly with CPU speed, although the Series 800 will also get a boost from faster DRAM. Based on these estimates, even Qualcomm’s best processor, which is due to enter production at about the same time as Tegra 4, won’t surpass Nvidia in these tests. Krewell argues Qualcomm still has some advantage for devices that use less than the maximum power possible: Tegra 4 delivers outstanding benchmark results, showing off its considerable capabilit</Msg><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1363040551873</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 18:22:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363040636160-39</Id><Topic><Title>Linley Group - "Nvidia ‘Tegra 4′ Trumps Fastest QCOM ‘Snapdragon,’</Title><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1363040551873</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 18:22:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>end of meassage got cut off - Source Barrons "capabilities.

I hope Jensen shows a financial plan for the analyst March 19th with some detail because no one can put a $ figure on this until Nvidia SPEAKS UP!</Msg><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1363059134222</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 23:32:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363060742395-59</Id><Topic><Title>Cox Communications S.

All the Cable companies will build their next generation STB using Tegra - this provides a ubiquitous solution for the traditional STB function whilst upgrading it to 4K resolution (new Cable TV service upgrade for special programs) as well lag free PC and Android games subscription service all in the same box- plus accessory sales. Selling Grid hardware - selling Shield - Selling Tegras for STBs and selling Tegras for connected TVs Nice &amp; Cool - running circles around QC</Msg><Username>ltenow</Username><Timestamp>1363060742395</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 23:59:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
