In their analyst day last thrusday, they finally spilled the beans on what they are doing in mobile. they gave a full 2 hour presentation on that. For anyone interested in mobile, he owes it to himself to listen to that presentation/Q&amp;A to see the full meaning of what 'making a SoC' means. eg. while nvda will never be able to touch the #1 &amp; #2 in mobile, brcm's already selling tons to samsung, with samsung using their integrated processor in current and future phones. eg. I don't have much doubt sooner or later amzn will go brcm too, with the exception that brcm, unlike other SoC vendors to amzn, will be making good margins off their integrated solutions. the only guy who can touch that would be samsung if samsung need fab fills to replace aapl wafers. With # 1, 2, &amp; 3 out of nvda,s reach, #4 in for spreading the wealth, Jen does not have enough 'cheap radios' to play in this game and attack anything below the leading edge. Time for nvda to run this thing like a real business, fold tegra, and just license their graphics.</Msg><Username>whosunw</Username><Timestamp>1355149003022</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 09:16:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355150674280-12</Id><Topic><Title>NVDA is a prime private equity takeover or Carl Ican type LBO stock for its Cash and multiple</Title><Username>bengraham650</Username><Timestamp>1355148752100</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 09:12:32 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How does an LBO happen with NO debt?</Msg><Username>toonawish</Username><Timestamp>1355150674280</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 09:44:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355155247342-13</Id><Title>Cover shorty...cover!

Secondly, although I fundamentally believe in NVDA as I think the stock will be @ 30 before it's @ 10 I don't expect pullbacks not to occur. Keep in mind December/January are historically the 2 most DOW positive months for stocks in addition to China speculation and maybe CES . I would be shocked if this stock went full steam ahead and broke out of every resistance level without a few pull backs but absolutely agree with you overall the stock will trend higher. 13 by early mid January. I am going to add another 5k on the pullback or possibly if it moves as you suggest just write bull spreads.</Msg><Username>brokeagain73</Username><Timestamp>1355171385763</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 15:29:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355173887210-42</Id><Topic><Title>50 dma taken out</Title><Username>o.investor</Username><Timestamp>1355165926285</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 13:58:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>12.34 50 dma support play should be interesting. next levels to watch, 12.80 earnings release price and 13.22 200 dma NVDA is a momentum stock, it can take-off from here - fundy's be damned!</Msg><Username>o.investor</Username><Timestamp>1355173887210</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 16:11:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355184270224-43</Id><Title>Will The New Launch of A Cheap IPhone Use Nvidia's Grey Processor?</Title><Msg>Looks like Apple is re- inventing itself as a me-too follower.

Yes boys, just plain cash-inefficiently, dumb." It looks like you did it again, Master. You publicly shamed Jen into parting with some cash today. You know, like you shamed him into paying his first-ever-in-19 years cash dividend. With your classic piece, "Jeepers Best, Everybody else pays a dividend." But this time you caused Jen to finally try out that stock repurchase program. By calling him "a just plain cash-inefficiently dumb manager." Right here on this very board. And Jen responded too -- just as he's been trained by Best. One million shares at 1:00. Now granted, that's a bit weak -- well, let's not prevaricate here -- it's Extremely Weak, but Jen's a novice at this stock buy-back stuff, right? Can we see Two million shares a 2:00 tommorrow?
