ZoomA report published by Digitimes states that smaller companies such as Leadcore Technology, Innofidei, Spreadtrum Communications as well as RDA Microelectronics are looking to merge with other companies to be better positioned to compete with larger rivals such as Mediatek and Qualcomm. There is speculation that Intel, Nvidia and Broadcom could be jumping into the game, which could allow the companies to access TD-SCDMA chips and get closer to Chinese handset makers. Whether those three are interested is based on the question whether an acquisition will, in fact, allow them to sell more chips. However, the nature of such a deal would exclusively relate to the Chinese market. Intel especially has been very aggressive in acquiring businesses that open up new opportunities or fill a certain void in its portfolio, but the company declined to comment on the report. Digitimes pointed out that MediaTek's recent merger with MStar semiconductor is putting some pressure on smartphone chip makers in China to step up their game, merge or acquire in order to be able to remain competitive.</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1349293180581</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 15:39:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349293180807-31</Id><Topic><Title>Mr Jen Hsun, your legacy is going up in smoke!</Title><Username>smallstock1</Username><Timestamp>1349289796757</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 14:43:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Report: Intel, Nvidia Could Be Buying Chinese Chip Makers 2:00 PM - October 3, 2012 by Wolfgang Gruener - source: Digitimes Could Intel and Nvidia be looking to acquire be acquire Chinese chip makers?

It seems notable that HTC finds it more cost effective to buy the upgraded T3 and separate baseband from Qualcomm, than using the S4 pro domestically. As I long I hope this is because T3 is so much cheaper to produce on 40nm process, and not because NVDA is giving up margin (though they guided that gross margins would remain at roughly the same levels in Q3 as Q2).</Msg><Username>thetrade50</Username><Timestamp>1349304368475</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 18:46:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349306532404-40</Id><Topic><Title>HTC One X+ is now up for pre-order in UK, shipping October 22</Title><Username>ibexx88</Username><Timestamp>1349299729230</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 17:28:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yes -- agree -- Tegra 3 paired with LTE in the US is very significant.

The ATIV Tab, as Samsung calls it, is a beautiful 10-inch tablet that delivers a full Windows 8 experience and features that intersects the lifestyles of casual user and professional. The Best thing about a tablet running on a Snapdragon processor is that unlike traditional PC processors, a Snapdragon powered-device is designed to provide a full day of use on a single charge, while lasting days on standby. At 10-inches, the Samsung ATIV Tab boasts one of the Best-looking screens on a tablet, complete with a 1,366-by-768 resolution. In addition to an optimal viewing experience, the ATIV Tab is exquisitely thin, measuring a scant 8.9mm and weighing just 570 grams (~1.26 lbs), yet it made room for features such as USB 2.0, micro HDMI, microSD slot (up to 64MB) and front (1.9Mpxl) and rear-facing (5 Mpxl) cameras. One of the main strengths of the ATIV Tab is that it’s so well-connected with the gamut of wireless connections, including Bluetooth 4.0, 802.11n WiFi Direct, NFC, and GPS. The ATIV Tab looks like the start of something special between Samsung and Microsoft, and will be available in the coming months." Did I mention? Not winning the Samsung ATIV brand of Windows RT tablets is truly Crushing news for nvidia.
