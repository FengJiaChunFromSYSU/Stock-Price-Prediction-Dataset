Margins. Margins - low double digits meaning 10% Barrons recorded a handful of analysts comments in this debate. BEARISH --Stacy Rasgon, Bernstein Research: Reiterates a Market Perform rating but raises his price target to $4 from $2. “While consoles appear to be adding materially to revenues, profitability was an unpleasant surprise, with expectations for “low double digit” operating margins. Given relatively little incremental opex, this suggests gross margins (at least for the moment) far below corporate average, materially limiting potential upside from this business [...] we have been very leery to take the bait1, particularly given the company has been hesitant to provide longer term margin guidance. And, last night we discovered that our hesitance to bite was in fact, warranted. Operating margins for the business were indicated in the “low double digits,” likely materially below investor expectations. A bit of mix analysis suggests gross margins for the initial console business somewhere in the ballpark of 20% next quarter. While we would be surprised to see margins stay here forever (presumably cost position should improve later in the ramp) we believe upside from the business is likely to be materially lower than some of the more bullish forecasts likely behind the stock’s recent run.” --Betsy Van Hees, Wedbush Securities: Reiterates a Neutral rating and raises her price target to $4.50 from $4. “We were impressed with the beat and raise, but believe much of the gaming console design wins are already priced in given the weakness in afterhours trading and 90+% gain YTD vs. 25+% of the SOX. We believe for meaningful appreciation in the stock from this level that we will need to see sell thru of game consoles, continued momentum in servers and notebooks, and traction in ultrathins, and tablets.” (To be continued)</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1374284565586</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 21:42:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374284869299-34</Id><Topic><Title>AMD dropped 13% despite rev beat - why were investors spooked?</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1374284565586</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 21:42:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Part 2: --Ross Seymore, Deutsche Bank: Reiterates a Hold rating, and a $4 price target. “The co also delivered strong 3Q rev guidance (+22% q/q) as its APU wins within upcoming game consoles begin to ramp. Unfortunately, this revenue goodness is offset by much lowerthan-expected GMs. Consequently, our recently increased rev ests are rising a bit further, but our EPS ests fall (albeit still above original est). Overall, we applaud AMD’s 2Q execution and believe its gaming wins can stabilize cash flows, but we remain concerned that structural challenges in Computing are likely to re-emerge in 2H13/2014.” --Stephen Chin, UBS: Reiterates a Neutral rating, and a $4.50 price target. “We believe AMD has executed well on its transformation plan as it guided 3Q13 opex down -6% q/q to its stated goal of $450M while guiding 3Q13 up +22% q/q to profitability. We believe further P/E multiple expansion is possible if AMD can execute on its target of operating profitability and positive free cash flow in 2H13 [...] AMD guided 3Q13 gross margin to 36% which suggests its game console (GC) gross margin is around 25% (higher than our initial 20% estimate). AMD expects GC operating margins to be in the “low-teens” which is also higher than our prior estimate of 5%. Since AMD’s GC royalties from Microsoft and Nintendo (estimate $150M/year) will wind down as its GC APU chip sales ramp, we estimate its GC chip sales need to reach $1B in 2014 to improve graphics segment profitability.” BULLISH --Hans Mosesmann, Raymond James: Reiterates an Outperform rating on the shares, and a $5 price target. “There appears to be some debate this morning regarding whether AMD’s new console ramp with Microsoft’s Xbox One and Sony’s PlayStation 4 will be either neutral or accretive to overall earnings.

Under the previous generation, AMD had GPU wins in both the Wii and Microsoft’s Xbox 360, with a royalty model generating a few dollars per unit. With the new generation, the Street seems to be missing that the relationship with Sony is entirely incremental, while the Xbox contribution is higher (CPU and GPU vs. just the GPU in the prior generation) and the Nintendo relationship remains the same. Moreover, average selling prices (ASPs) for the new semicustom APU shipments for the new Xbox and PlayStation are in the $60-100 range with operating margins in the low double digits. Thus, the operating profit dollar contribution under the new model is clearly higher.” Bobby Burleson, Canaccord Genuity: Reiterates a Buy rating, and raises his price target to $6 from $5. “We believe this turnaround story appears to have legs [...] AMD guided Q3 revenue to be up 22%, plus or minus 3% (midpoint of $1.42 billion) compared to our estimate of $1.29 billion and consensus estimate of $1.22 billion. Management guided gross margins to decline to the 36% level in Q3 with increasing mix of semi-custom gaming console chip sales. Operating expenses for the quarter are expected to be $450 million. Management expects inventory to increase to $800 million driven by gaming console semi-custom builds. AMD expects 2013 capital expenditure to be $150 million and expects taxes of $4 million per quarter.”</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1374285011670</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 21:50:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
