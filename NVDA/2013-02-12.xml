It's on Wednesday night this time . . do you want to read into that? You could say they are announcing the same time in the week as Qualcomm did sooooo, ooh, what does THAT mean!! Maybe they chose Wednesday the 13th because I don't know . . the next day is Valentine's Day maybe??? A romantic sendoff, an aphrodisiac for all those REALLY happy investors . . . Seriously, I think the least important detail is how many days before the ER they announced . . because it wasn't any different then anyone else.</Msg><Username>roundhouse_c</Username><Timestamp>1360645724338</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 00:08:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360645931685-2</Id><Topic><Title>Good luck into earnings, longs</Title><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1360637003765</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-11 21:43:23 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>hope you're right...</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1360645931685</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 00:12:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360646924999-3</Id><Topic><Title>Good luck into earnings, longs</Title><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1360637003765</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-11 21:43:23 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Seems to me NV usually announced the earnings cc date about 2 to 3 weeks before the cc date... no?

How big is gaming to AMD? In 2013 over 37 million game consoles are expected to be sold and over 44 million in 2014. (Since those figures were announced, China has decided to lift the ban on game consoles). China sales now have to be added to these estimates. To put it all in perspective, AMD was in only 15% market share for computers or about 30 million computers. I am not the best at math, but even I can see that AMD will be in more gaming consoles than in computer. This is exactly what will lead AMD into being cash flow positive by Q3. Once Sony makes it official on 2/20, AMD will have a nice bounce and you will see 100 million shares that are currently short to scramble to cover sending the rally up even furthest. AMD is up over 40% since hitting the bottom in mid November. Once Sony confirms AMD and makes it official, it will have a very nice ride up. P.S. the PS4 &amp; the Xbox 720 are use not just the GPU or APU, but also the CPU. More slices do the pie for AMD.</Msg><Username>justbecause49021</Username><Timestamp>1360675437271</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 08:23:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>24</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360675877082-12</Id><Topic><Title>Do You Think NVDA is a BUY, SELL, or HOLD?</Title><Username>missionmildred</Username><Timestamp>1360080660065</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 11:11:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I got it.

Exclusive: Nvidia plans 1 million sq ft Santa Clara campus Feb 11, 2013, 8:46pm PST Nathan Donato - Weinstein Real Estate Reporter - Silicon Valley Business Nvidia Corp. filed plans for 1 million square feet of office space on company land adjacent to its current Santa Clara headquarters. The Gensler-designed project will be built in two phases at the 25-acre San Tomas Business Park, according to formal plans filed today with the city of Santa Clara. The plans, which expand the headquarters currently occupied by the computer graphics card maker, name Sares Regis Group of Northern California of San Mateo as the project developer. They do not name Nvidia, but the company has owned the property since 2009. It previously planned up to 2 million square feet of office space there, and its ambitions to build a new campus have for months been buzzing around the commercial real estate community. Under the new plans, each phase will consist of a single, 483,475-square-foot building. The drawings of the project filed today reveal a campus that could rival the Silicon Valley architectural statements being planned by Facebook, Samsung and Apple. At 1 million square feet, the project is likely to be among the biggest projects announced in the Silicon Valley this year. The cost of the project wasn't disclosed in the filing. The Nvidia plans show identical six-sided structures that will include two stories of office. A sloped glass curtain wall on each side rises to a curvaceous, geodesic roof. Each building sits above two levels of parking, one of which is underground, for about 1,700 spaces, the plans show. The plans do not include a timeline for construction. The plans name Kier &amp; Wright as the project engineer and Tom Leader Studio as landscape architect. Nvidia and Sares Regis Group spokesmen declined to comment on Monday. Sources not connected to the project said the company currently is packed into its current spaces. Nvidia leases about 500,000 square at 2701 San Tomas Expressway from The Sobrato Organization. The company also occupies many of the 10 buildings at the San Tomas Business Park. The plans indicate Nvidia will demolish those buildings in phases to create the new campus. With each floor laid out at roughly 250,000-square-feet, the proposal continues the dominant storyline in Silicon Valley tech office space: Absolutely massive floors intended to facilitate the collaborative work environment so popular these days. A future phase could add up to 767,500 square feet of additional office space at the intersection of Condensa Street and the San Tomas Aquino Creek Trail, according to the plans. The plans do not include drawings for that element of the project. Nvidia's decision to pull the trigger on the project may not come as a surprise. The company has long listed the possibility of "increased cash commitments for the possible construction of a campus" on its quarterly reports. Nvidia bought the San Tomas Business Park in 2009 and soon gained entitlements to build up to 2 million square feet of office. Those plans didn't go anywhere after the 2008 recession, and Nvidia has instead concentrated on rehabbing buildings on the site. The company paid a developer $18.9 million in termination charges for putting the development on hold, according to SEC filings. Because of past approvals the company will likely face smoother sailing getting project approvals than it would have starting from scratch."</Msg><Username>i_read_best</Username><Timestamp>1360677084441</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 08:51:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>17</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360677369641-15</Id><Topic><Title>Nvidia plans 1 million sq ft Santa Clara campus</Title><Username>on2five</Username><Timestamp>1360662291256</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 04:44:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Jumping the shark" is an idiom that is used to describe the moment in the evolution of a television show when it begins a decline in quality that is beyond recovery. The phrase is also used to refer to a particular scene, episode, or aspect of a show in which the writers use some type of "gimmick" in a desperate attempt to keep viewers' interest. In its initial usage, it referred to the point in a television program's history when the program had outlived its freshness and viewers had begun to feel that the show's writers were out of new ideas, often after great effort was made to revive interest in the show by the writers, producers, or network The usage of "jump the shark" has subsequently broadened beyond television, indicating the moment when a company, brand, design, or creative effort's evolution loses the essential qualities that initially defined its success and declines, ultimately, into irrelevance.</Msg><Username>perceptive.best</Username><Timestamp>1360677369641</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 08:56:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>14</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360677768385-16</Id><Title>QCOM downgraded nuetrol by JPM today on slowing smartphone adoption rates</Title><Msg>So QCOM chip business slowing, so white label move raises ASP for NVDA in high growth emerging markts of india / china brilliant -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- UPDATE: JP Morgan Downgrades QUALCOMM to Neutral on Slowing Smartphone Adoption David Johnson, Benzinga Staff Writer February 12, 2013 7:41 AM JP Morgan downgraded QUALCOMM (NASDAQ: QCOM[FREE Stock Trend Analysis]) from Overweight to Neutral and maintained a $70.00 price target. JP Morgan said, "We are downgrading our rating on Qualcomm from Overweight to Neutral as every day in 2013 brings us closer to rapidly slowing smartphone adoption that we expect in 2014. As the windfall from high 28nm chip demand recedes into the rearview mirror we believe this eventual market deceleration is likely to become more of a focus for Qualcomm investors. Our proprietary models also suggest that 3G ASPs are likely to finally begin declining this year as cheaper tablets and smartphones weigh into the mix. We are keeping our $70 price target to indicate that we continue to see limited upside to current earnings estimates and the stock price."</Msg><Username>livinlifeveryday</Username><Timestamp>1360677768385</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 09:02:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360677940126-17</Id><Topic><Title>NVDA price per share could skyrocket!

We spoke to some people close to the matter and we got an idea of just how AMD can hugely benefit from that. All of a sudden developers have to make games that will be better suited to AMD’s architecture simply as these GPUs will be in all consoles. Up to this generation of console some balance was in place, as Nvidia was in PlayStation 3 with its G80 GPU derivate and AMD or ATI was in Xbox 360. Now all deals are going to AMD, making it a bit easier to optimise from platform to platform. AMD has Roy Tailor on board, and some might remember that he used to be responsible for The Way it’s Meant to be Played over at Nvidia. At one point he was selling GPUs for Nvidia worldwide and his combined talents might do AMD a lot of good. Nvidia still thinks that it owns the PC gaming market, but it will be interesting to see if AMD can make a bigger comeback in 2013. The vibe from many AMD executives we talked to over the last few weeks is that graphics will become the focus and they want to be a bit more aggressive in this field. Having console deals and console games that will theoretically be better optimised for Radeons in its PC version will definitely do them good."

"Last year marked incredible success for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the tablet market. The graphics specialist scored two of the highest-profile tablet launches throughout 2012: Google Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s Nexus 7 and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s Surface RT. Those were some serious wins that showed that the Tegra 3 was a worthy contender in the market for tablet application processors, while QUALCOMM, Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) was able to hold down most of the smartphone fort with its connectivity advantages. With cellular-enabled tablets gaining popularity to get things done on the go, it seems that Qualcomm may be about to score one of NVIDIA's juiciest spots from last year. Who will win the next Nexus? Earlier this week, Pacific Crest analyst Michael McConnell reiterated his "sector perform" rating on NVIDIA while reducing his estimates, because he believes that that the company has lost the spot in the next version of the Nexus 7 to Qualcomm. The first-generation model of Big G's flagship tablet probably sold close to 3 million units last quarter, assuming it comprises the majority of Asus' tablet shipments. Pacific Crest's analysts believe that Google will ship up to 10 million units over the next year or so. At an average selling price of $20 to $25 per Tegra chip, that would translate into lost revenue of $200 million to $250 million."

Today it’s the turn of Qualcomm to come out slinging, and it has something to say about Nvidia’s Tegra processors. In the video, Qualcomm’s chief marketing officer, Anand Chandrasekher, is pretty blunt. He claims that Nvidia has been helped by its “perception” of superior graphics, but that Qualcomm beats them time and again on empirical evidence. He even goes so far as to say that Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 800 “puts a new benchmark in place” when it comes to graphical performance. We’ll just have to wait and see. Perhaps the most provocative line comes when he talks about Nvidia’s newest line-up of Tegra 4 processors. “So, we clean Tegra 4′s clock. There’s nothing in Tegra 4 that we looked at and that looks interesting. Tegra 4 frankly, looks a lot like what we already have in S4 Pro.” Them’s fighting words, and I’m sure Nvidia won’t be happy about being publicly called out on under performing hardware. Especially as Qualcomm is stating that its old hardware already beats Nvidia’s newest offering."

Analysts said Chinese manufacturers will dominate the domestic market and are well positioned to enter overseas markets. China will register up to 29 percent of the 837 million smartphones projected to be sold this year. The United States, the world’s second-largest smartphone market, is likely to absorb another 125 million units during the same period, it said. Total shipments hit 224 million in 2012 in China, making the country the world’s No 1 smartphone manufacturer, Xinhua News Agency reported, citing industry insiders. Sales of smartphones in developed economies will see robust growth despite the faltering economies, but the major market drivers are developing economies such as China, according to Canalys. “In total, developing markets will contribute 70 to 80 percent of the growth this year,” it added. In addition, national brands will vigorously compete with international players, especially in smaller cities. Domestic vendors are rapidly moving their businesses toward smartphones and winning consumers with their competitively priced devices. Such moves will continue to put “significant pressure” on international vendors this year, according to Nicole Peng, research director at Canalys’ China office in Shanghai. “With smartphones starting to penetrate lower-tier Chinese cities, international brands lack real competitive advantages in those areas,” Peng said. Chinese makers, such as Lenovo Group, ZTE Corp and Huawei Technologies Co, have released a series of low-end handsets priced at around 1,000 yuan ($160), targeting buyers with lower incomes. The US research company Gartner said in November that Lenovo will become China’s top smartphone maker before the end of this year. “Lenovo is positioned at the mid-to-lower end, which will drive much of its future growth, and this is where global brands are less competitive,” said Gartner. Low-cost smartphones have drastically accelerated the decline of feature phones in China, and a similar trend is expected to be seen in other emerging markets in the next three years, Canalys predicted, adding Chinese companies will be given an opportunity to copy their business model to more emerging markets. Lenovo announced its plans for international expansion in September, following in the footsteps of other national companies such as Huawei, ZTE and TCL-Alcatel. “Only very few Chinese smartphone makers have comprehensive or long-term international expansion plans in place,” said Wang Jingwen, an analyst with Canalys. “Their goals are straightforward: to grow economies of scale or fulfill production capacity and to increase profit margins as pricing pressure is lower in overseas markets.”</Msg><Username>livinlifeveryday</Username><Timestamp>1360689990681</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 12:26:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360690090814-56</Id><Topic><Title>Ahead of earnings, Nvidia is trashgraded by mofia media</Title><Username>smallstock1</Username><Timestamp>1360688615719</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 12:03:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>channel checks????going to best buy? looking at inventory on public websites? a gardner report?, like they know anything new!!!!</Msg><Username>smallstock1</Username><Timestamp>1360690090814</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 12:28:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360690335895-57</Id><Topic><Title>Nvidia's Corp presentation by Chris Evenden 12-11-2012 Preso</Title><Username>livinlifeveryday</Username><Timestamp>1360689667650</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 12:21:07 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks for posting this, but I think it's focused on the whole year, not this quarter.

Not in the way that everyone is focused on, with the peak performance of the high-end chip, but starting in the Chinese smartphone market. Today essentially all LTE phones use Qualcomm chips. That is changing later this year. One aspect that almost everyone has missed is that the Icera LTE modem will be first available as a stand-alone chip. As a SDR, it's likely considerably more area-efficient (smaller on the same process) chip than the competitors. That means Nvidia can afford to start a price war on the modem side. Even if they don't win Tegra sockets, they can enable smartphones with cheaper SoCs. That gives Nvidia a toehold in the market, and starts moving Qualcomm from it's controlling position. In the U.S. Qualcomm would respond with a lawsuit that would tie Nvidia up in the court system for years. If Nvidia limits themselves to the Chinese market and the Chinese LTE standard, that's unlikely to happen.</Msg><Username>watergatefive</Username><Timestamp>1360696851796</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 14:20:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360696949625-72</Id><Topic><Title>How Big Is the Market For Project Shield?</Title><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1360695925066</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 14:05:25 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"I tend to see it as a Gamer Add-on toy" junior will play it as a stand alone...</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1360696949625</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 14:22:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360696988885-73</Id><Topic><Title>Nvidia Has Twice The Cash per Share That Apple Has!</Title><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1360282938040</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-07 19:22:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sure he wants to talk about something else NOW Because he got caugfht posting this LIE: "Nvidia Has Twice The Cash per Share That Apple Has!"

I Work with IT and many of my collegues are gamers too. Today the kids also have a nintendo handheld. Looking forward I see parents buying a shield as a stand alone handheld instead - simply because they can have so many free android games for the unit. Nintendo games are quite expensive. Also the kids know the games from the smartphones and like to continue their gaming universe. Since they got my old smartphones they have not used the Nintendo. Microsoft NeXT generation game console is said not to allow used games - not good. Ps4 is likely not compatible with ps3 games cause going away from cell and rsx chip. People will look towards protecting their Investments into gaming libraries and might decide to go for Shield/Ouya/wikipad as their NeXT platfom. I would not be surprised if they can sell millions of units each year and growing.

"Rivals, including Intel Corp, Marvell Technology Group Ltd and Nvidia Corp, are expected to follow shortly with their own LTE products, further heating up the market." Pay attention to the word "FOLLOW" Nvidia fans. If Nvidia is expected to "FOLLOW" then that implies they are not LEADING. But you know who is LEADING, don't you? Is it sinking in yet? imho</Msg><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1360704392851</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 16:26:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360705437950-94</Id><Topic><Title>What is it?

That widely confirmed. The decline was almost entirely on the low end, with tablets substituting for basic home PCs. There was comparatively little change in the sales of engineering and graphics workstations, which are segments with high GPU attach rates AMD reported a reduction in sales of GPUs. Spot prices indicate a trend of decreasing pricing on AMD/ATI GPUs, while Nvidia GPUs haven't dropped in price for two quarters (which is unusual). The open question is if Nvidia gained market share and margin -- it appears that they likely did. That said, I can understand why they lowered the price target. No one sees a rebound in traditional PC sales, and the engineering/gaming workstation market is in a stable replacement-refresh sales mode. But they are missing the significant net profit that the current GPU business is providing.</Msg><Username>watergatefive</Username><Timestamp>1360712343426</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 18:39:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360713874095-104</Id><Topic><Title>How Big Is the Market For Project Shield?</Title><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1360695925066</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 14:05:25 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"I dont see them trying to corner the mkt on Android gaming, but enlarge it quickly to drive game tiltes to it" livinlife Good point. The game developers must love Nvidia. The GTC conference in March has as much on gaming(Cloud-Nvidia Grid, PC, and Android gaming as it does on supercomputing. It's looking like a full scale push to grow another business. Who in the gaming business won't like and support another way for them to increase revenue. I know I have made fun of the middle aged gamers that run Nvidia but they really know how to do gaming right. Think about what they are trying to do. Sell the front end console--Project Shield. Connect it to their PC GPUs to sell more of them Provide the Cloud gaming hardware and software to connect mobile devices, but of course it will work just a tad better on The Shield but they make money on cloud gaming even it it is streamed to an IPad. I'm sure will hear something from another hardware company once Nvidia creates the business which doesn't look like it will take more than a couple of months. Anand get those benchmarks going on smoke and particles quick...LOL</Msg><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1360713874095</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 19:04:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360718010113-105</Id><Topic><Title>Look for Nvidia to miss estimates and give poor guidance</Title><Username>swims48184</Username><Timestamp>1360369110610</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 19:18:30 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>D-day tomorrow.</Msg><Username>qlostagain</Username><Timestamp>1360718010113</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 20:13:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>13</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360720125526-106</Id><Topic><Title>Broadcom unveils its first LTE chip to rival Qualcomm, Where's NVDA Jen?</Title><Username>rounhouse_c</Username><Timestamp>1360713460889</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 18:57:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Another nail in the coffin for Nvidia's tegra hopes.

Here is a lesson for those who always criticized NV being too late, too slow and failed to execute. This modem, when operable, will be classified as Category 4 with down link speed of 150 Mbps. It's still NOT LTE-Advanced which will support carrier aggregation with downlink of 300 Mbps over 20 MHz of spectrum.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1360727898064</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 22:58:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
