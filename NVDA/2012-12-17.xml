"Genuine Apple parts -- accept no substitutes." Okay, so maybe Apple charges the licensed copy-cat people $50 bucks per year per device for their superb Apple expert service. It's still easier than the copy-cat people trying to do it themselves. $17.50 + $200.00 + $225.00 + $50.00 = $492.50 Did I mention? REALLY nice money for Apple, boys.</Msg><Username>best.clone185</Username><Timestamp>1355804556726</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 23:22:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
