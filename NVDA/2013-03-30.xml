BUFFOON !!!! Getanid61, Have you checked the Bestseller rankings on Bestbuy or Amazon lately...i.e. in the last month? Surface Pro is even pulling ahead of some Kindle and Apple models.RT models are not even in the 1st 15 at Bestbuy anymore since the Pro Surface has been released in Feb---4 months after Surface RT. Remember what Nvidia's CEO said at the investor conference on March 19th....."I am disappointed in Surface RT sales, We expected to sell a lot more." And what is with this Google is selling 3 Chromebooks....Two of which are Intel X86 and One is ARM. Weird....very weird...what does Google know that the Tech Press doesn't?</Msg><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1364628086815</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-30 03:21:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364628468452-2</Id><Topic><Title>I TOLD ya that Windows on ARM was a DUD 1 year ago.

Some are selling for a little over $650. Really good ones too. This is bound to really hurt the larger ARM tablets. Some analysts are saying it will kill them. 7-8 inches is the sweet spot in Tablets for ARM right now. But who knows later on this year.we should see X86 in the smaller tablets.....Premium luxury of course.

Surface RT is priced at CNY3,688-4,488 plus CNY800 for a touch cover, the source indicated. According to previous estimation by market observers, Surface RT and Surface Pro shipments to the global market would have reached one million units and 500,000 units respectively so far since their launch, but the actual volume for the two models so far is estimated at about one million units in total, the sources said. Viewing that Microsoft has not placed additional orders for Surface RT, an estimated one million units of Surface RT remain in the inventory, the sources indicated. Microsoft has talked with partners about developing second-generation Surface models, but those partners have generally been conservative, the sources noted, adding that Microsoft is inviting notebook and chip vendors to co-develop tablets based on Windows-ARM platform but those vendors have been reluctant." __________________________________________________________________ Note: Surface RT launched 10/26/12, Surface Pro launched 2/8/13.
