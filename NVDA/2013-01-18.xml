I personally don't think Shield will be marketed under $350 at launch." Ibexx Since the BOM and Mfg cost cannot be more than $150, I believe the sweet spot for the gamer market and semi serious casual gamer market is $299 with occassional coupon sale of X off with very high end Geforce discrete cards at Newegg, Tigerdirect etc. Nick Stam technical marketing director with Nvidia said in a Video that Nvidia would have the device in e-tail and retail at launch. The perfect retail store at launch is GameStop with How many stores does GameStop operate, under what names? GameStop has 6,614 stores in operation, of which 4,434 are located in the United States, 343 in Canada, 413 in Australia/New Zealand and 1,424 are in Europe. Our stores operate primarily under the names of GameStop and EB Games. Our stores sell new and used video game software, hardware and accessories for video game systems from Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft. In addition, the company sells PC entertainment software, related accessories and other merchandise. Talk about instant marketing to your target market. In addition, GameStop's selling of used games and equipment ties extremely well Nvidia's professed desire to do what helps the Gamer! Note: GameStop even sells used IPads and the sales people actually know what they are talking about...not like BestBuy...LOL JMHO</Msg><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1358532449901</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 13:07:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358532818470-48</Id><Topic><Title>Why NVIDIA's Shield will succeed, part I</Title><Username>ibexx88</Username><Timestamp>1358493275478</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 02:14:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>chi - Others have mentioned this as well, in several forms, and one we'll likely see.

Many low-end Android phones are free with a data plan, and the fact that these phones do almost everything that Shield does and more makes Shield a very tough sell. I've written about NVIDIA and think the stock is extremely cheap, but this gives me a little pause. My guess is that NVIDIA will try to sell Shield for at least a few hundred dollars, comparable to the price of the PS Vita and more expensive than any smart phone purchased with a plan. At that price point I don't see a clear market for this thing. What's worse, traditionally makers of game systems sell the system at a loss and then recoup the cost from game licensing fees. This allows the system cost to be fairly low. This is not possible with the Shield. Hopefully, NVIDIA built Project Shield to simply showcase the power of the Tegra 4 processor and doesn't expect it to go mainstream. Otherwise, I think this is a pretty serious misstep." foolDOTcom</Msg><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1358533859392</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 13:30:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358534104994-57</Id><Topic><Title>"Nvidia is Doomed!"</Title><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1358533226523</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 13:20:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"But Nvidia still appears to be focussed on premium gaming.

Dividend may also stop some of the sells by insiders. since they would have income coming in without selling stock. Possibly even encourage them to buy more too. This would make Nvidia stock look better to traders and investors looking at insider trading for cues. I'm in accumulation mode this year.

Quite knowledgeable clerks too. It's kinda of ironic that apparently they take a much smaller slice from the mfg. to sell new gamer merchandize, and make most of their profit on selling used equipment and games. BestBuy and other mainstream retailers take a much larger slice on new stuff and are terrible in product knowledge from my experience. I think it would be a waste of time for Nvidia to hook up with them unless they got a very very good deal or it was a special XMAS promotion because the Shield had become such a huge hit with the mainstream which I doubt. It's a gamer add-on this year and I suspect it will be extremely popular with gamers this year...but mainstream not this year. After all the CEO of Nvidia said the Shield is not a product for 6 year olds or grandmothers and our target market is gamers. Even with that said, it will not surpirse me if the Shield sells 1M to 2M units in it's first year and bring along additional sales of high end Geforce cards. All highly profitable! With all the free advertising that has happened and will continue as Nvidia Grid comes into play later this year, I cannot image it not be accretive to earnings immediately.

So far, there is little to show for it. All claim they already have their modem chips on the tarmac. But that’s it. No takeoff. Nothing about actual design wins. CES last week was no exception. We heard zilch. How come? We can certainly blame the virtually non-existent LTE market for that. Except in the U.S., the roll out of LTE has been slow. If you want volume for your modem chips, you need to play not in LTE but the 3G market dominated by Qualcomm, MediaTek, Spreadtrum, Broadcom, Intel and others. Additional blame goes to Samsung and Apple. The two companies have pretty much sewn up the high-end smartphone market. Samsung designs its own LTE baseband chips while Apple uses Qualcomm’s chips. Not much room is left for anyone else. But the real story lies in the very nature of a baseband chip, which we in the media apparently don’t appreciate very much. Developing a functional baseband chip is a never-ending job, according to CEVA CEO Gideon Wertheizer. When it comes to apps processors, chip suppliers know their job is done. It happens when they see tape out. In contrast, baseband chips, after tape-out, need to be tweaked, tested, modified, certified and/or tweaked again before they can move to mass production. Wertheizer said, “I’ve heard that you’d need to dispatch something like 400 engineers to Samsung in order to have your chip tested in their handsets, certified by different operators and tweaked to work well on different bands, and finally getting designed in.” Come on. Four hundred?

Well the stock got pumped up to $26 on tablet/phone growth fever and when the results didn't come the stock crashed leaving the overhanging medium/long term averages above you as resistance. It does not help that there is habitual bad PC news which has tended to kill any spikes you have had. You really need Tegra to turn a corner and to start breaking even at least before the market views you as anything other than Intel's companion in legacy PCs. Tegra 4 in tablets and Project Shield will probably get you there. As to your comment about using cash well sometimes it is just viewed as unproductive R&amp;D if you spend too much of it for too long without any noticeable results e.g. Tegra 1/2/3 .

From the Intel squeeze killing Nvidia chipsets to Qualcomm bundling LTE. Yet Nvidia has managed to accumulate $2B more in cash than they had 2.5 years ago. But there is hope with Nvidia's "Back To The Future Campaign" in 2013 and what's neat is the simplicity of it. "Hey we are not a PC company, We are a GAMING company." Ala Tegra 4 is released and the first product is a gaming device that ties to Nvidia gaming GPUs which is sold to gamers. Imagine the Launch Party at E3 in Boston in early May...500 select guests raffled of course with Nvidia Grid playing multi-player games on 500 Project Shields all night with the top 3 teams taking home a mucho Nvidia Gaming gear as GameStop starts selling Project Shield bundled with 4 new Exclusive Game Tegra 4 for a period of time. Videos to follow on YouTube comparing these games visual effects on the Shield or a Tegra 4 tablet to an IPad of course. Beautiful way to Ring Fence Nvidia's gamer revenue which is substantial and approaching $2.5B a year. And establish the user base for Tegra optimized games in tablets which will only make theGame Developers double down even more. Of course a few high end phones will pick up Tegra 4 at WWM at the end of February and probably I500 modems too, but what else would you expect with QCOM charging so much. Just a start but not part of Nvidia's 2013 Back To The Future Campaign.</Msg><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1358558142760</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 20:15:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358560111138-89</Id><Topic><Title>Dualing Websites</Title><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1358538913043</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 14:55:13 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ibexx88 Look at the top of the article.

I have come to realize that Nvidia as a company doesn't really care about near term stock price. They have a general vision of building the best compute solutions they can. They keep driving on that general vision, making tweaks to their roadmap etc. as they go. Its clear that Nvidia is an engineering driven company - at this time more so than INTC and AMD. I would rate Qualcomm as a much more disciplined mix of engineering and market messaging. Broadcom as a quiet worker and TXN as pragmatic, very well managed company. If you want to sleep well at night, buy TXN and BRCM on dips and forget about it. Qualcomm is fully valued, it can only go down if it has any significant misstep. INTC is headed the wrong way and is to be avoided (can someone explain #$%$ was Macfee buy for?) AMD is a value trap. and Nvidia is a tease - to be flirted with on dips and dumped for small returns... for now. Nvidia has to show some returns on its R&amp;D investments this year or, they will be punished by the market. Nvidia OpEx has been going up too fast, they are still hiring big time in UK (Icera - Bristol, Cambridge and Sophia/France). Multiple tape-outs each Qtr (this is the reason TXN said goodbye to all things digital). GE jingle was - "we bring good things to life". Nvidia may as well come out with a jingle - "we bring things that nobody is asking for to life". Now this is broadly the mantra that Apple "had" - Gretzky philosophy... Except you better be right and on time else you may pull a "Newton". I can hypothesis that Nvidia is getting better on execution as it goes. Hopefully Tegra 4 is in products at MWC. I find Icera viability still questionable and so "Grey" is still not certain. I wonder if there is more to the story behind Project Shield. Nvidia wants to make a serious foray in entertainment products. I think its pretty well known that Valve/Steam Box is based on Nvidia - I wonder if this will be Project Denver. Lots of earnings (and maybe some pre-announcements) next week - good luck all.</Msg><Username>o.investor</Username><Timestamp>1358563191020</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 21:39:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358563277482-92</Id><Topic><Title>Dualing Websites</Title><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1358538913043</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 14:55:13 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ashraf, You are a good writer, but you need to branch out because your track record on stock recommends is not exactly stellar.

That includes PD cores in Tegra 6 &amp; beyond... But the rewards will be very high if they get it right...</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1358566285314</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 22:31:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358568408424-99</Id><Topic><Title>Dualing Websites</Title><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1358538913043</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 14:55:13 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So Master?

Very similar to MRVL, INTC etc. They are not being afforded any premium because they have not delivered material earnings growth. A bullish case may be made based on future returns on R&amp;D investments over the last few years but the results are far from certain. There are still macro issues to consider and strength of partners. Nvidia made a decision 3-4 years ago to invest aggressively in CPB business and build products. They could have taken an approach of licensing IP instead. We can only speculate but I think NVDA stock would have been much higher as they would have licensed to all major mobile IGP solutions. In any case, looking at my crystal ball I can say that NVDA will trade at 20+ PE if they meet numbers and provide positive guidance. I also recognize the potential for Nvidia to go nuts (I mean all time highs) if they start delivering consistently. btw I think they will introduce Shield in $400 - $500 range. They will probably sell in small numbers initially. Which is fine as there is not much content and the device will be attractive to very select audience. By holiday time 2013 there should be quite a bit of attractive content on TegraZone for Shield. They will then drop price to sub $400 and sell a lot more. So don't be disappointed if Shield has tepid start. Handhelds (especially gaming) can be a nightmare with customer abuse and returns, warranty etc. I hope they hire the right folks to manage retail experience. I was very disappointed to read reviews on TegraZone (Android Play). Sounds like their is a lot of customer unhappiness with application stability. Nvidia introduced 3D glasses to much promise and fan-fare but I don't think they sell very well (I heard of 500K to date).</Msg><Username>o.investor</Username><Timestamp>1358568986711</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 23:16:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358569590531-101</Id><Topic><Title>NVDA prospects</Title><Username>o.investor</Username><Timestamp>1358563191020</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 21:39:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>o.investor Thank you for the post.
