THE hottest new invention for mobile devices. And Texas Instruments has captured this new market with their wireless charging IC's. Texas Instruments currently leads communications IC suppliers in the development of wireless charging chips, serving as the sole supplier of related chips to Nokia and HTC. Meanwhile, Jen dawdles with this and that... and stretches the "Roadmap" by another year. Read all about it, boys. That hot new area of wireless charging -- which nvidia is clueless about. Maybe nvidia will get into it someday, if ARM starts selling the licenses, right boys? Ha ha ha ha ha!. More smartphones to feature wireless charging Cage Chao, Taipei; Steve Shen, DIGITIMES [Friday 16 November 2012] Smartphone vendors... are expected to roll out new models with wireless charging functionality as a basic feature in 2013, according to industry sources. Japan-based vendors and Nokia have led the trend by releasing a number of smartphones with wireless charging, and Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics have also started adding the same functionality to their new models, the sources noted. HTC, which has seen its sales decline recently, also plans to roll out new phones with wireless charging in the fourth quarter of 2012, the sources added. Besides, US-based telecom carrier Verizon Wireless has begun to offer customized high-end smartphone models with wireless charging, highlighting the rapid commercialization of wireless charging application, the sources commented. Texas Instruments (TI) currently leads communications IC suppliers in the development of wireless charging chips, serving as the SOLE SUPPLIER of related chips to Nokia and HTC at present. Integrated Device Technology (IDT) is also moving into the segment, and has signed cooperation agreements with Intel and Qualcomm, respectively, aiming to deepen its development in wireless charging chips and applications, the sources indicated. There is a possibility for Apple to include wireless charging application into its next-generation iPhone due to the increasing popularity of the technology, the sources commented.</Msg><Username>bestonica</Username><Timestamp>1353133234830</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-17 01:20:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>47</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353154032135-2</Id><Title>TI Cuts 1,700 Jobs, Exits Mobile Chip Market</Title><Msg>"Texas Instruments said it will lay off about 1,700 workers, or about 5% of its total workforce, as part of a restructuring that will see it exit the market for mobile chips that power smartphones and tablets, including Amazon's Kindle Fire."</Msg><Username>chitownbarber22</Username><Timestamp>1353154032135</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-17 07:07:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353157252014-3</Id><Title>Times are appropriate to keep an eye on NVDA dealing</Title><Msg>I was persuaded about ( NVIDIA Corporatio ) that it is in unexpected situation to close with bunch need some on the dot augment.

If, huge if, everything works right, chip introduction in late Q2, sales won't come in before Q2 14. in cc, they are still ramping r&amp;d for Tegra, all while sales continue to decline for the next 5+Qs. Breakeven is now well over $300M/Q for tegra now. care to add up how much nvda shareholders will lose in tegra over the next 5Qs? Wayne's r&amp;d began perhaps mid-'2010, it is just stringing ARM's core. it would have taken them 3 years to get the chip to market!!! That's way after all the competition having A15s out. And you want them to design their own core and outperform ARM's too?? nvda does not have the cpu design expertise to compete in this area and it shows. Everybody else is doing a much better job/a whole year's lead on nvda.</Msg><Username>whosunw</Username><Timestamp>1353165364052</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-17 10:16:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353165682164-7</Id><Topic><Title>NVDA presenting at UBS 11/15 9am ET</Title><Username>o.investor</Username><Timestamp>1352905324082</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 10:02:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"When is Jen going to finally release the nvidia 10-Q?" Why, that's fine question, director.best. Jen launched the sensationalized headlines a week ago Thursday. But there is still no fact-filled 10-Q available for the investor community. nvidia needs to get more like Apple, you know. Apple releases their 10-Q report much faster than nvidia. Much Much Faster. Like, THE DAY AFTER THE EARNINGS ANNOUNCEMENT. It's true. And remember, Apple is a much much larger enterprise than nvidia. Much Much Larger. So they have oh so much more accounting to do. For example, Apple has 70 Times the EBITDA that little nvidia has. Yet they get their financial results to their lucky investors, well, Faster. Like, THE DAY AFTER THE EARNINGS ANNOUNCEMENT. Not a week ago last Thursday -- and we're all still waiting on it.

Yes, sucker-in new investors, boys. Maybe some of the readers at home were suckered-in by them? Hummm? It's despicable, I say. Just despicable. And then, when there's no good news to cut-and-paste -- which is frequently -- they post trash about the best, most astute and knowledgeable posters that are just trying to clean this sorry excuse for a company up. Did I mention? It's despicable, A grown company paying for pumper boys to make their stock go up. But the pumper crew is so mis-managed that they do nothing but lounge around all day eating Cheetos® and posting trash about the other fine Yahoo visitors. So. There we have it. Two new additions today. To Best's growing List of Shareholder Demands: #37. The 10-Q's get out One Day After the earnings announcement, and, #38. The worthless paid nvidia pumper boys get fired.

Killed-off by the vastly improved floating point arithmetic functions of Intel CPU processors. And so it will be with Intel CPU's + Integrated Graphics. The need for nvidia's add-on graphics processors will be made obsolete as well. The good news is -- the last add-on GPU maker left in existence -- likely nvidia -- gets to claim 100% market share.

As AMD and Nvidia celebrated their position at the summit of the Top 500 list that ranks publicly known high performance computing clusters based on Linpack performance, Intel scored what many would claim is an equally important Victory. Appro's Xeon powered Beacon cluster that features Xeon Phi 5110P accelerator cards topped the Green 500 list. Intel will be particularly happy with its top billing in the Green 500 list, which divides the Linpack performance number by the cluster's power usage to produce a MFLOPS/W value. Appro's Beacon cluster scored 2,500 MFLOPS/W, almost 150 MFLOPS/W higher than the second place cluster and over 250 MFLOPS/W higher than the AMD and Nvidia powered Titan cluster that sits on top of the Top 500 list. Appro, which was bought by Cray last week, is only one of four vendors including Cray to make it into the Green 500's top 10. Most of those systems are IBM Bluegene clusters that use 16-core Power processors, though Cray and Appro take three of the top five spots, with Adtech coming in at number two on the list. Nvidia could rightfully claim that the interconnect, the wires that connect the nodes in the cluster, is different. Appro's Beacon cluster uses the mature Infiniband interconnect while the two Cray clusters that feature Nvidia's Tesla K20 and Tesla K20X accelerator cards use Cray's leading edge Gemini interconnect that could see future improvements to reduce power utilisation. Intel's Xeon Phi accelerator doesn't boast the same double-precision floating point peak TeraFLOPS rating as Nvidia's Tesla K20X, however given that the Xeon Phi *** already has higher power efficiency than the Nvidia accelerator cards *** its future looks promising. µ Numero Uno, boys. The Intel Xeon Phi 5110P accelerator cards. For the #1 Best, most power-efficient HPC computing.
