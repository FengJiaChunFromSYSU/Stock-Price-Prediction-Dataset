Let's be for real, it's only 30 cents/share and we all know that NVDA can swing that much within 15 minutes. I'm long NVDA, believe it will go higher, but would not let the dividend change my investing as far as the stock goes. Most likely, as is generally the case, we'll see some strength as a result of CES, we'll see some strength the few days prior to the earnings announcement, and then the probabilities say it's time to sell before the earnings are released. Could that thinking be wrong? Absolutely. Has it been true many more times than not? Anyone who has invested in NVDA over any extended length of time is well aware of it and I'm not saying anything which isn't well known. A measely 30 cents will not change any of that so far as I'm concerned. If I really want to hold the stock through the earnings announcement this time, I'll look to sell some covered calls against my position.</Msg><Username>nip7890</Username><Timestamp>1357396036318</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 09:27:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357396882980-7</Id><Topic><Title>Behold, boys.

Yes, even More Volatile, boys. Struggling shrinking dog stocks -- like nvda -- will be shorted. That's a given. It's nature's way. But the shorts don't like paying "rent" on the borrowed shares. No matter how cheap the "rent". So they'll taper-off around the quarterly ex-dividend dates. And hit the stock even Harder in between. Notice the new 22,000,000+ short interest that developed after the dividend? The Highest short interest for the entire year? That was no coincidence. That's a cause-and-effect result of the dividend.

Where do you draw the line between "trader" and "investor"? Holding period? I buy Nvidia when it's "low" and sell it when it's "high". There are a number of factors which play into that definition for me, and the market and seasonality of the stock trading have a role in that in addition to the income statement, the balance sheet and all the other fundamentals. What do you call the "investor" who purchased his Nvidia shares above $30/share? If he sold his shares at $25 or $20 a few months later would you classify him as a "trader"? Better that he still be holding them today even after losing over 50% in value over 5 or 6 years? Last time I "traded" Nvidia (according to you) was a few years ago, purchasing below $7 and then selling about 18 months later in January above $18. Would I have been in your good graces if I had held the stock to $25 (having to watch it go back to $9 first), and then continued holding to watch it get back to where it is today? Call me a "trader" all you like if it makes you feel better. I generally find that folks like yourself call themselves "investors" for exactly the reason Bestfucius says.</Msg><Username>nip7890</Username><Timestamp>1357402903539</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 11:21:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357404244543-14</Id><Topic><Title>Nvidia In the Cloud at CES</Title><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1357346679669</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 19:44:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>finally a long noticed the time of announcement of the cc - designed so nobody can change their travel plans/schedule to attend that cc.

Don't forget that an active stock buyback program is also a deterent to the retail shorts. They have to hate it. Stocks drop a little and then all of sudden it pops back to where it was. LOL Once the share holder base moves from more to less speculative and gets part of the way to growth and income...the companies always increase their dividends. The financial industry has 1000's of anaylysts putting out their picks for what companies can and will increase their dividends and at what rate. All this information is fed to the institutional buyers. Most companies increase dividends on a yearly basis but a few Tech stocks do it every quarter after starting low. (Like Microchip Tech did---check out their first 6 years...dividend increased 8 fold) Hope Nvidia follows that pattern. Heck they could double it overnight and still have plenty of cash flow left over. Just another little factoid about how Nvidia's stock is being reevaluated by Wall Street. Invesco has an actively managed ETF of 30 semiconductors companies evaluated 4 times a year called Dynamic Semiconductor Portfolio. (PSI). Their investment criteria is as follows: "The PowerShares Dynamic Semiconductors Portfolio (Fund) is based on the Dynamic Semiconductors IntellidexSM Index (Intellidex Index). The Fund will normally invest at least 90% of its total assets in common stocks that comprise the Index. The Intelldiex Index is designed to provide capital appreciation by thoroughly evaluating companies based on a variety of investment merit criteria, including: price momentum, earnings momentum, quality, management action, and value. The Underlying Intellidex Index is comprised of common stocks of 30 U.S. semiconductors companies. These are companies that are principally engaged in the manufacture of semiconductors." THEIR TOP HOLDING is NVIDIA at 5.18% Also don't forget that the prevalent trend of Tech compensations is much less regular stock options that are replaced with Restrictive Stock units and the RSUs draw dividends!. Instead of 6 regular stock options management may get 1 RSU and 1 stock option. Less stock dilution which is good for share holders but management gets income from the dividends without any risk. TJ Rodgers of Cypress Semi laughed when he was questioned about his dividend policy by analysts last year and went through the math showing how it was good for share holders and really good for him. "Heck who can't live on $3M in dividends and only 15% in taxes." (2013 is 20%) so I guess he will have to pop the dividend a little.

According to FanlessTech's sources, NVIDIA could unveil their first desktop SoC (system on a chip) at CES. NVIDIA's "Project Denver" could be announced, with multiple reference designs to be shown off tomorrow night, reports FanlessTech. I would not be surprised, and I've said it before that NVIDIA should enter the desktop CPU game in some form - it's one of the biggest markets right now. Does this news surprise you? Excite you? Personally, it excites me - I think years from now the CPU as we know it will be vastly different, as they're already doing so now - APUs and the such. A SoC that could be built into a motherboard would only cost $20-$50 (in that range) more and could give users a huge upgrade in terms of graphics performance out-of-the-box."</Msg><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1357438076177</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 21:07:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>18</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357439469038-31</Id><Topic><Title>Project Denver DeskTop CPU Unveiling Sunday AT CES</Title><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1357438076177</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 21:07:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Now, THIS, would be THE catalyst that I've been looking for, and IF TRUE, it could EASILY cause the price to DOUBLE, as it did 2 years ago at this time.

They no longer have the benefit of the Win-Tel consortium to subsidize their overpriced and dated x86 technology. With the onset of new mobile OS's that run on multiple hardware platforms they are no longer the only [chip] player in town. Not even having the best technology (which they don't) would restore the Win-Tel glory days. So, keep wishing and hoping...Intel will need to focus on their niche and share the market space accordingly as well as accepting smaller margins. Intel (although a good company with decent products) is on it's way to becoming a 10 billion dollar a year company.</Msg><Username>brokeagain73</Username><Timestamp>1357446461484</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 23:27:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357448046086-43</Id><Topic><Title>JUST IN: NVIDIA to reveal their first desktop SoC at CES</Title><Username>ibexx88</Username><Timestamp>1357441532938</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 22:05:32 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Jeepers Best, That "Project Denver" desktop sounds like the perfect device for the do-it-yourself daily BIOS upgrade enthusiast. Hey, you know who might like that Project Denver desktop device? The tablet enthusiasts that bought the Xoom. Remember the tegra #2 powered Xoom, boys? Those Xoom owners got really good at daily software upgrades. Where did they leave off, version 21.17.2.103 And the use of tiny soldering irons too. The Xoom launched at $70 bucks Above the put-together Genuine iPad. And the early models were missing various parts -- like the SD flash reader. Which the do-it-yourself Xoom enthusiasts received later in the mail. And then weeks later, the software patch to make the aforementioned SD flash work. Yes boys, there's a niche for every device. Hey, maybe nvidia's Project Denver folks can borrow the mailing list for Xoom owners? Yes, the U.S. mailing list. 'Cause many Xoomers still don't their email working.</Msg><Username>jeepers.best</Username><Timestamp>1357448046086</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 23:54:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357448317674-44</Id><Topic><Title>JUST IN: NVIDIA to reveal their first desktop SoC at CES</Title><Username>ibexx88</Username><Timestamp>1357441532938</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 22:05:32 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Whoever wrote the article did a terrible job with the editing . . but we'll have to see come Sunday night!</Msg><Username>roundhouse_c</Username><Timestamp>1357448317674</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 23:58:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message></Date>
