I mean, I get it that the cost of putting together the device merits the price tag, but that is still a lot of dough for what is a device that will likely be in addition to an xbox360 or ps3 for most games...on top of their smart phone also.</Msg><Username>clrodrick</Username><Timestamp>1374300981216</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 02:16:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374311865539-2</Id><Topic><Title>Shield - hands on impression from the booth</Title><Username>tegrapower2013</Username><Timestamp>1374199598357</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 22:06:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>unlike the ps or xboz, nvda also wants you to buy a new one every year and a half or whatever when a new processor comes out. how many will buy into that?</Msg><Username>whosunw</Username><Timestamp>1374311865539</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 05:17:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374326680009-3</Id><Topic><Title>AMD dropped 13% despite rev beat - why were investors spooked?</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1374284565586</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 21:42:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Margins.

For a few hundred dollars they can make a major performance upgrade, while leaving most of their installed software unchanged. You don't have to "believe", you only need to observe. And invest, or not, based on sales. Doing otherwise is like believing that there is no market for BMWs because a bus stop is near your house, or because a Kia is cheaper.</Msg><Username>watergatefive</Username><Timestamp>1374348641951</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 15:30:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374357657389-7</Id><Topic><Title>Shield - hands on impression from the booth</Title><Username>tegrapower2013</Username><Timestamp>1374199598357</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 22:06:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wow Watergatefive just ripped you a new one.. showed how stupid you truly are.. and a douche..</Msg><Username>fdigiovanni01</Username><Timestamp>1374357657389</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 18:00:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374363218920-8</Id><Title>Shield will sell like hotcakes because..</Title><Msg>tegra is one hot chip.
