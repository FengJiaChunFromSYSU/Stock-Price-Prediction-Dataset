Roll forward a year and again Intel bulls/ARM bears have been keen to publish “benchmarking” from Intel’s recent unveiling of its Silvermont architecture. Given these benchmarks are based on optimised Intel chips and against estimates of big.LITTLE (actual products were not available for benchmarking tests to be done), we would question the usefulness of such benchmarks until products are actually in the market and comparable. Indeed, we have seen similar benchmarks which clearly score the 1.8GHz Cortex A12 (ie not even the high end A57) ahead of the 2.4GHz Silvermont. The proof of the pudding will ultimately be in design wins but Intel is clearly getting into ball park and it is dangerous to dismiss the threat complacently when there are already successful Intel-based devices in the market (The Lenovo K900 has been a top 5 selling device in the Chinese smart-phone market). While Intel may lay claim to a significant advantage in 14nm production, and we do believe the company has a slight time to market advantage, ARM and TSMC have already taped-out 14nm (marketed as 16nm and actually 20nm FinFET) in 2013 for Cortex-A57. In addition, without the wide support of Samsung [Electronics (005930KS)] and Apple (AAPL) introducing Intel into its mainstream products it is difficult for Intel, globally, to gain substantial market share and is likely to remain just one chip vendor among many in the market.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1372872509274</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 13:28:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372872636005-9</Id><Topic><Title>About ARMH: fears of Intel advances and NVIDIA licensing overblown, says UBS</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1372872509274</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 13:28:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Part 2: about NVIDIA As for competition from Nvidia, and MIPS, a unit of Imagination Imagination Technologies PLC (IMGLON), Jenkins this the “synergies” between ARM’s graphics intellectual property and its CPU design business will continue to be an important advantage: Two recent announcements from competitors have caused concerns around competition in the IP licensing industry. First, Cavium licensed the latest MIPS (recently acquired by Imagination) Release 5 architecture for its Octeon III product line. While we are not surprised by an existing licensee signing with its IP provider, it is noticeable that Cavium signed a v8 (64 bit) ARM architecture license in August 2012 raising the question as to whether processing becomes less sticky like graphics with multiple IP vendors selected. Indeed, we were impressed recently at Imagination’s Technology Summit in Asia with the company’s efforts to make Android apps compatible with MIPs (either ported or using MagicCode). It remains to be seen whether this will make a difference given the importance of the actual eco-system benefits enjoyed by ARM’s partners across multiple fields. Similarly Nvidia, facing lost opportunities to ARM and Imagination, decided that it would license its graphics IP rather than selling its own proprietary graphics chip alongside its Tegra processor. We have highlighted the competitive nature of graphics historically and maintain this view though we would point out that ARM will increasingly attempt to technologically leverage the synergies between graphics and its core processing business and we believe full coherence between the two will be available within two years. ____ PS: I will express my own thoughts later.

They should compare it to the arm 2014 offerings. As I said before - the more Intel wins (if they could) in this space the more they loose and the lower their stock price. LET me spell it out clearly one more time- they have to sell it for a third the asp they used to get using a bleeding node process. So their solution to that as we can also clearly see is - build bleeding edge fabs in lower cost places like Ireland and Israel. That only helps a little since the capex is the overriding cost.

INTC necessarily isn't going to command the high prices/high margin they have been earning in PCs and servers as they go into mobile. Investors should be able to recognize this but many appear not to. The only reason they were able to command high prices historically and mint the money they did over the last several decades is they had no/little competition. ARM/mobile changed this. The meaningful asset INTC have today is manufacturing leadership. If they deployed ARM, watch out. But they'd rather take 4 decade old design and massage and shoehorn and repackage a little more life out of it. Market forces are going to have their way. With shrinking PC growth and vibrant competition in mobile, there is no catalyst for growth for INTC.

While unit sales should improve modestly from Haswell (all else equal), we believe the Street is missing the dynamic that Intel’s Haswell has an initial focus on higher-end products where Intel is already dominant and is subsequently only replacing its legacy products. Consumers (and subsequently OEMs) have become increasingly cost conscious with regards to PC purchases, and we believe the sweet spot for PCs will continue to move lower into the $400-600 range. At these levels, we believe a product lineup from Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) (without supply issues for this iteration) will participate between the high-end focus of Haswell and Intel’s low-end Atom. Thus, we believe the long awaited “rebound” in PCs may be a bigger driver of AMD share gains, while Intel (with ~85% PC market share) will likely be at the whim of the overall market. On that front, we continue to believe that both management’s guidance (calling for low single-digit growth in 2013) and consensus (flat year-over-year) are too aggressive. Putting consensus in context, if we assume that Intel can grow its data center business ~13% in 2013 (in line with its forecast of double-digit growth) while its other non-PC client segments grow 3% y/y (in line with company guidance of low single-digit growth), we arrive at an implied PC Client sales decline of 4% in y/y in 2013. Given our belief that PC units will continue to shift to the lower price points (generating share gains for AMD and ASP pressure across the board), this looks aggressive and we suspect a decline in the mid- to high single digits is more realistic."" Mosesmann models revenue this year of $52.18 billion and EPS of $1.70, down from a prior $53.68 billion and $1.85. That EPS estimate is below the Street consensus of $1.86 this year.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1372902262458</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 21:44:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372903748741-37</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Forecast May Miss on Dimming Outlook for PC Rebound, says Raymond James Email Print</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1372902262458</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 21:44:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He;s still a fruitcake after all these years if he thinks AMD have any products that can take any marketshare off Intel lol ! ;-) More Mosesmann fantasies .... News from August 2011 Hans Mosesmann, Raymond James: Reiterates a Strong Buy recommendation and a $40 price target. Mosesmann thinks sales of Tegra rose “modestly” in the quarter, as strength in tablet computing were offset by “mixed” results in smartphones. “The net is that NVIDIA’s performance goes a long way in dispelling major bear themes such as lower GPU attach-rates, market share losses, weak design-win traction for Tegra, weak PC demand, and massive accumulation of inventories. The issue and thus opportunity for longer term investors is that as we look down the road to high volume computing from handsets to supercomputers, Nvidia is in an extremely strong position. Interestingly none of the traditional handset chip players even have strategies for this game.”</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1372903748741</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 22:09:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372903809584-38</Id><Topic><Title>Nvidia should use Baytrail in its Shield.

Hans was saying that the first wave of Haswell based products tend to be high-end offerings, likely replacing the existing high-end products in a market already dominated by Intel. This corroborated what I stated earlier that the upcoming Intel processors would do more to cannibalize its own than to take market shares from others. The demographic trend for the PC market seems to be migrating toward the lower-end, priced in the $500 range, which works in AMD's favor. To help massage Intel's (and followers) ego, it says nothing about AMD'a offerings being technically superior to Intel'a. The focus of his evaluation is on the "sweet spot" of the market - which happens to be NOT where Intel is heading for, at least in the near and intermediate f</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1372904977179</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 22:29:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372906683799-40</Id><Title>Google Moto-X phone can be customerized and personalized, report says</Title><Msg>SOURCE: mobilesyrup, july 3 The Motorola Moto X will be released this summer and their early marketing efforts declare it’ll be “designed by you.” Rumoured specs are that we’ll see the new Android run OS 4.2.2 and come with a 4.7-inch full HD screen, NVIDIA Tegra 4i processor, 16MP camera, a 5MP front-facing camera, and some sort of “smart” technology. Dennis Woodside, Motorola’s CEO, previously confirmed that the new “hero” device will “know when it’s in your pocket, we know when it’s in your hand, it’s going to know when you want to take a picture and fire up the cameras… The device will know when you’re in the car and it’s moving at 60mph and you’ll interact with it differently, more safely.” New details emerged today that reveal deep personalization. According to sources at ABC, the Moto X – which they say is a ‘mid-range phone’ – will be available for sale via a website – similar to Google’s Nexus 4. In addition, “buyers will be able to select from a palette of different colors. One color can be used for the back case and another can be selected for the trim of the phone. Users will also be able to engrave a name or message on the back cover as well as upload a personal photo through the site to be used as the wallpaper on the phone’s screen.” The engraving portion is similar to heading to the Apple’s online store where they give you options to laser engrave your iPod or iPad, but the wallpaper will certainly add a personal touch to the device. The Moto X is apparently in carrier testing now and will also be made available for sale within retail stores, but will be a un-customized version. Unfortunately, no word yet on specific Canadian partners. ______ To be fair, I've also read that the Moto-X is not one phone, but a portfolio of phones, taking a page from Samsung's book. Other reports (BSN, for example) also indicated that the phones could carry either Tegra 4 or Snapdragon. So we shall see - Tegra 4 is in at least one version of them.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1372906683799</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 22:58:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372907196907-41</Id><Topic><Title>Google Moto-X phone can be customerized and personalized, report says</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1372906683799</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 22:58:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ads for this phone already shows up on TV.....quite interesting.
