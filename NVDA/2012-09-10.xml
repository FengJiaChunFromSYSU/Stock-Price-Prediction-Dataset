The shipments were made one week after Asus began taking pre-orders on Sept. 3. During that time, the company has received more than 10,000 pre-orders, Asus said. The tablet computer, which was designed and developed by Google in conjunction with Asus, runs on the Android 4.1 Jelly Bean operating system. It features a Nvidia Tegra 3 quad-core chip, a 12-core GeForce GPU, and a 178-degree wide-viewing angle IPS display. The 16GB version has a price tag of NT$8,990 (US$302), according to Asus. The Taiwanese computer maker recently adjusted its forecast of Nexus 7 tablet shipments to North America to 5 million units, from 3 million previously, thanks to higher-than-anticipated sales, the company said. The company said its goal now is to make the Nexus 7 the best-selling Android tablet in the global market in the second half of the year.

That's more than double the three million Google expected to sell by the end of 2012, after putting the device on sale in July and seeing the 16GB version sell-out briefly. The estimate, based on projections using expected shipments of four million touch panels for the Nexus 7 in the third quarter 2012, was posted online at Tech-thoughts.net. Google didn't comment on the estimate and a spokesman said that Google hasn't published any sales numbers for the device. Tech-thoughts tabbed sales for the third quarter alone at 2.9 million. By comparison, the $199 Kindle Fire, which went on sale last fall, has sold about 5 million, according to an average of estimates by several analyst firms. The analysis, authored by Sameer Singh, founder of Tech-thoughts, pegged the time it takes Asus to produce and deliver a Nexus 7 at 2.5 weeks. He said that after Google saw strong initial demand, "Google and Asus may have roughly doubled their [sales] estimates and cranked up the production volume." A Gartner Inc. spokeswoman estimated the Nexus 7 so far has sold 1 million to 1.5 million units in about five weeks, based on reports from suppliers. Carolina Milanesi said the Tech-thoughts estimate of 6 million to 8 million Nexus 7 sales by year's end is higher than Gartner is expecting, but she didn't elaborate.</Msg><Username>johndeborah</Username><Timestamp>1347309669396</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-10 16:41:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347311136667-36</Id><Topic><Title>If both the big guns Apple and Amazon worry about Tegra 3...</Title><Username>ibexx88</Username><Timestamp>1347286211086</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-10 10:10:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Your argument is exactly opposite of reality, mr. paid basher and holder of many 'best' aliases.

After three years, in that tegra biz, I was looking at a River of Red. And the story it told, of a river that flowed, Made me sad to think it was red. You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name, It felt good to be out of the graphics.

There were no plants and birds, just rocks and things, And sand and hills and dragons. The business is a desert, with it's life underground, And a perfect disguise above. Under the valley lies, a heart made of sand, But the shareholders there will give you no love. You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name, It felt good to be out of the graphics.

Sad. So very sad. Once mighty Microsoft now tryin' to horn-in on that Christmas mall stalworth -- the Chia Pet kiosk. But the Chia Pet folks will win the battle, of course. 'Cause they've got that catchy jingle. "Cha-Cha-Cha Chia!" Try makin' a jingle out of "Windows 8 RT device". Not happening, boys.
