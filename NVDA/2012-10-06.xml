Inside every Window Phone 7 handset was either a Snapdragon™ S1 or S2 processor. This tight collaboration carries on with the release of Windows Phone 8. Microsoft’s commitment to Qualcomm as the platform’s EXCLUSIVE chipset provider shows the unique benefits of Snapdragon processors for this popular operating system, and we’re excited for the opportunity it represents for the entire mobile ecosystem. These new Windows Phone 8 devices will be powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon S4 processors. The new features of Windows Phone 8 are Vast, and almost every single one is tied to a particular component within the Snapdragon S4 processor. As you know, the Snapdragon S4 processor is made up of a long list of capabilities. The general breakdown below will show you how Snapdragon processors help ensure that Windows Phone 8 will be the BEST Windows Phone version yet. Low Power, High Performance - The S4 Processor is desgined from the ground up for faster performance and energy efficiency to deliver long-lasting battery life. And now that Windows Phone 8 supports multi-core processing, it can take advantage of Snapdragon S4’s multi-core design. In other words, you can watch your favorite video, listen to music, stay connected with your friends and family, and game to your heart’s content. 4G LTE Web Browsing - Previous Windows Phones offered 4G LTE, delivering the fastest internet connection available in the world. The next wave of Windows Phone devices will not only have LTE, but will also be able to take advantage of all the other great features and capabilities integrated into the Snapdragon S4 processor. Having all the components under one roof means better battery life and overall user experience. High-Definition - Within the Snapdragon S4 processor is a powerful graphics component that enables Windows Phone 8 devices to not only play the latest 3D games, but also drive HD videos and movies, high definition audio for amazing sound quality and support high resolution displays (720p) for a visually stunning experience. Faster Location Services - The Snapdragon S4 processor features GPS and GLONASS, so you can access both satellite networks. Using two networks allows your Windows 8 phone to determine your location quickly, more accurately (within a 2 meters radius), and with fewer service interruptions. Now you can get seamless real time mapping and accurate location based services in a synch. Cameras - the Snapdragon S4 can capture up to 20 megapixel images, 1080p video capture and has overall speed and image quality enhancements, including image stabilization." Wow! Now THERE'S what a Real Win looks like, boys. No Chinese knock-offs, no chopping of prices, no re-naming of parts to bamboozle folks into thinking the Tegra 3 TE has LTE when it doesn't -- and no other competition. None of that carnival barking is required. EACH AND EVERY Microsoft Windows 8 Phone, -- ever to be made by any company on the planet anywhere or anytime -- will use that incredible Genuine Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 Processor. EXCLUSIVELY. As in, Qualcomm is the one-and-only, absolutely and completely, unconditionally without exception, The Only Provider of processors for the new award winning, industry sweeping Microsoft Windows 8 phones. It's a Perfect Marriage, right boys? It sure is. All due to that tight collaboration stuff between Qualcomm and Microsoft. Perhaps it's {wait for it now} a Royal Wedding. Google and behold: Snapdragon S4 Processor and Windows Phone 8: A Perfect Marriage</Msg><Username>it_is_best</Username><Timestamp>1349496116451</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 00:01:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>35</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349498722150-2</Id><Topic><Title>Windows 8 Phones: Only Qualcomm Snapdragons deemed worthy.</Title><Username>it_is_best</Username><Timestamp>1349496116451</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 00:01:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Jeepers Best, Since nvidia parts were not deemed worthy for the new award winning, industry sweeping Microsoft Windows 8 phones -- they really lost The Big One. So what's nvidia gonna do? Hummm? When Apple finally vaporizes the Android OS for patent infringement, Windows 8 will be the ONLY viable mobile operating system left, right? It sure will be. Well, except for Apple's iOS -- but Apple doesn't let anybody else use that. So with Qualcomm's Snapdragon having an Iron Lock on the Win 8 Phone business, Qualcomm will also have an Iron Lock on ALL future, post-Android phones too, right? They sure will. And phones are sold in Much higher volume than tablets. Like what, 50 to 1. So Qualcomm will virtually OWN the mobile processor business. It's really too bad that current CEO Jen didn't do more of that tight collaboration stuff. Like Qualcomm did.</Msg><Username>jeepers.best</Username><Timestamp>1349498722150</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 00:45:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349500869576-3</Id><Topic><Title>Windows 8 Phones: Only Qualcomm Snapdragons deemed worthy.</Title><Username>it_is_best</Username><Timestamp>1349496116451</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 00:01:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks Best, You always do such a nice job of connecting-the-dots. It's as if you were a Senior Executive in charge of Strategic Planning or something. Anyway, due to your extraordinary post about how after Apple vaporizes the Android OS, that Qualcomm will become the Master of the Mobile Windows 8 Universe. I think I'll keep my short position in nvidia like, Forever. Might put a few mil into QCOM too.

It sure will be." So Best? How come Qualcomm isn't doing their part to Crush the android? Hummm? Qualcomm is the Big Winner when android is gone, right? They sure will be. Qualcomm will be THE Master of the Universe for Windows 8 Phones. Since only Qualcomm's Snapdragons are deemed worthly for those Windows 8 phones. Yet Qualcomm is just sitting back and letting the others litigate for patent infringement. Apple and Oracle and Microsoft and British Telecom and Fujifilm and eBay have now won Seventeen (17) infringements by Google on their valid patents. So far. And the total is growing rapidly by the week. Yet Qualcomm just sits back and lets the others blast away on the patent stealing android. Surely out of all the thousands of patents that Qualcomm owns they could come up with a couple dozen that are being infringed by Google's patent stealing android. To help the Cause, don't u know. Heck, if nothing else Qualcomm could Rent the patents to Apple for them to litigate. Which I'm sure they would be more than iHappy to do. Like Google did with HTC. Maybe Apple's Capo dei Capi Cook needs to call a gathering of The Families. To get a little more "organization" going towards rubbing-out the android.
