Since Microsoft had pre-paired device builders with chip companies, they had destined some products to failure. Including HP/Compaq, which has been a loyal partner for decades. Microsoft originally planed on mimicking Google and picking a different vendor for each flagship device. There is a good chance that plan has fallen apart. If we see a Tegra in the next Microsoft device, it will be because Microsoft didn't have an alternative. My view: the Microsoft magic is gone. If their first generation tablets don't start making True Believers productive, it doesn't matter who wins the next design. It's a dead end. Should Nvidia continue to invest in what may be a very limited Windows RT mobile market? It might be profitable enough if all of the other chip vendors bail because of the high cost and limited future. But if even one other vendor sticks it out, everyone may lose money. So this could all be a minor sideshow to the real action: a new ARM-based ecosystem of phones, tablets and tiny desktop PC replacements.</Msg><Username>watergatefive</Username><Timestamp>1355071403994</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-09 11:43:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355072675084-5</Id><Topic><Title>Broadcom to make LTE chips in 2013.

It's gotta be a walk in the park for Broadcom to make a discrete LTE modem, right? Yes, a walk in the park. 'Cause Broadcom has already made an Integrated processor with on-board LTE. Which is already selling like hotcakes in many devices. Including the award-winning Samsung Galaxy S cellphone and the HTC One X cellphone, among others. So all Broadcom needs to do is take scissors to the complete mask for the Integrated Broadcom processor with on-board LTE, -- and cut-out the already designed-and-tested LTE modem section -- and send it back to the chip fabber to have 'em make discrete LTE chips too. It's no wonder that Broadcom can be so lightning-fast to market. They design the whole Integrated thing first -- and then just use scissors. That probably also explains why Broadcom is so much bigger than nvidia. Oh so much Bigger.

Broadcom has also contributed its NFC software stack to the Android Open Source Project. Google has chosen to use Broadcom's BCM20793 NFC controller chip in its new Nexus 4 mobile phone and Nexus 10 tablet. The choice of Broadcom for the new Android 4.2 Jelly Bean reference devices' NFC chips marks the first time that Google has not opted for an NXP NFC controller since it first introduced NFC with the Nexus S in December 2010. The Broadcom chip was first announced in September 2011 and enables multiple secure elements to be active on a single phone at the same time — making it possible, should Google implement the option and carriers support it, for consumers to be offered both a mobile wallet supplied by a mobile network operator and a mobile wallet supplied by a bank, handset maker or operating system supplier. The new devices also make use of an NFC software stack developed by Broadcom, rather than the stack developed by NXP which was used in earlier devices. Broadcom's stack is chip vendor-agnostic and is compatible with the NFC Forum's new NFC Controller Interface specification. It has now been contributed by Broadcom to the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), allowing it to be used freely by Android NFC device makers. The new stack, Broadcom's Mohamed Awad told NFC World, "puts all the different silicon vendors on an equal footing", rather than making it more likely that an Android device maker will pick a Broadcom chip simply because it makes the stack. "We believe our advantage is going to be in the quality of our silicon." That said, Awad continued, there are advantages for Broadcom's NFC chip business in terms of its profile within the Android community. "We've established ourselves as a leader in technology within that ecosystem". "NFC represents a huge, industry-wide opportunity and Android is the ideal environment for evolving this technology and its applications," says the chip maker's Michael Hurlston. "Broadcom has developed an open stack that supports all interfaces and replaces existing proprietary solutions. Broadcom is committed to unleashing the massive potential for NFC not only in the mobile payments sector, but much more broadly in gaming, home applications and simplified device-to-device connections that will allow us to recognize the full value of NFC." Clearly, Google likes Broadcom's open stack, boys.</Msg><Username>todays.best</Username><Timestamp>1355076728037</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-09 13:12:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>22</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355078301450-9</Id><Topic><Title>Wayne news: HTC to be the first with NVIDIA Tegra 4 phone?</Title><Username>ibexx88</Username><Timestamp>1354804662828</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 09:37:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why do you think Tablet processors are a stupid venture?

Take a look, boys. Qualcomm launches NFC controller chip By Sarah Clark | December 6th, 2012 Advantages of the QCA1990 include support for smaller and cheaper NFC antennas, ultra-low power consumption, a small footprint and integration with a wide range of mobile phone processors, Qualcomm's Neeraj Bhatia has told NFC World. QUALCOMM: QCA1990 NFC controller will be available in volume from mid-2013 Qualcomm Atheros, the chip giant's wireless connectivity division, has unveiled the QCA1990, an NFC controller chip that works with the company's full range of mobile phone processors. Key features of the new chip include: ■ Small footprint — "The QCA1990 is the industry's smallest, ultra-low power system-on-chip (SoC) with an overall footprint that is 50 percent smaller than current NFC chips available in the market," says Qualcomm. ■ Support for smaller and cheaper NFC antenna form factors, enabling device makers to use both current generation antennas and newer designs that are up to eight times smaller than current antennas and avoid the need to use expensive ferrite shielding. ■ Platform level integration "across the board" with Qualcomm's full range of mobile phone processors, from the Snapdragon S4 and the company's next generation of processors and modems to mid- and low-end chipsets, as well as tight integration with the company's WCN3680 802.11ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.0 and FM radio combo chip. ■ Ultra-low power consumption. Qualcomm has implemented a proprietary polling mechanism that lowers the average current consumed and prolongs battery life. ■ Wide choice of secure elements. Multiple types of secure elements can be supported, including NFC SIMs, dual SIMs, embedded secure elements, microSD and cloud-based SEs. Up to two secure elements can be active at the any time. ■ A QCA1990 software stack that complies with the recently released NFC Forum Controller Interface (NCI) standard. ■ RF performance that exceeds the requirements of both EMVCo and the NFC Forum. ■ The chip comes pre-tested "to meet the requirements from payment schemes, mobile operators and OEMs globally". ■ As well as mobile phones, the QCA1990 can also be used with PCs, tablets and a wide range of consumer electronics devices. The size of current generation NFC controller chips "is one of the key things OEMs have been struggling with," Neeraj Bhatia, Qualcomm Atheros' product manager for NFC and a board member of the NFC Forum, has told NFC World. "Size is always a crucial factor on the mobile platform. Real estate comes at a premium". The size of current antennas and the requirement to include ferrite shielding have also been barriers that the new Qualcomm chip should help to remove, he added. The QCA1990's support for much smaller antennas will mean that a ferrite sheet, which costs "tens of cents" per device, will no longer be required. This will really help OEMs bring NFC into mid- and low-range phones, he explained, adding that "even in the high end it's a factor". Rather than partnering with one or two secure element makers, Qualcomm has taken the decision to support as wide a range of secure elements as possible. "These SE suppliers have some strengths and weaknesses," Bhatia explained, so Qualcomm customers will have "complete flexibility as to which SE they want to use as we pre-integrate with all suppliers." Qualcomm will begin sampling the QCA1990 in the first quarter of 2013 and the chip will enter volume production during the second half of 2013. "We're already talking to OEMs," says Bhatia, and the company is seeing "pretty strong demand and interest in sampling at this point." "I think we're going to have our hands full." Exact pricing is not being revealed at this time but, Bhatia says, "we'll make sure we're very competitive or even the best." So where oh where is nvidia? All the Real mobile semiconductor makers are launching teeny tiny stack controller chips. "We'll make sure we're very competitive or even the best", says Qualcomm. "Qualcomm customers will have "complete flexibility as to which SE they want to use as we pre-integrate with all suppliers." But nvidia is Nowhere to be seen.

Let me make it as simple as I can for this Gollum creaure. Totally hypotheticaly suppose you have company called aidivN that the market currently values at say 7 Billion and anther coppany called moclauQ and the second company was vaued at 15 TIMES MORE or 110 Billion. Now lets suppose the bigger company makes 4+ times the profit and is expected to grow next year at 10%. The smaller company aidivN is expected to grow next year by 11.60% (if yahoo supplied numbers for hypothetical companies readers coud go check thats where these #s are coming from) . If you are not sure which company is more likely to be the next two or three bagger, you can also-once again hypothetically- assume half the value of aidivN is cash so take the math above and assume N has half the sized 'mouths to feed' with its earnings. Arguably, given the cash component of both these hyp. comapnies, Q is cash is 10% N's almost 50%. So that actualy computes to Q at about 29 TIMES valuation of N but again with ony 4+x the earnings and SAME est growth rate HUH? Watch for N to close the gap. sure maybe not all the way but approaching a three bagger sounds pretty okay ;-) So when some creature tries to tell you that straight up comparisons of revenue and earnings dollars or absolute units sold instead of using relative percentages is how to compare massivey differnet sized companies you tell him from me to go to Hades, ya hear? This is last warning nut shorties, the stock is under acumulation by, at a minimum, the company buy back program. It is ony a matter of time- you *will* be assimilated. 4ever!</Msg><Username>nvda_4_ever</Username><Timestamp>1355098767087</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-09 19:19:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>29</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355104064602-21</Id><Topic><Title>Here is why all the pathetic Best losers are WRONG!</Title><Username>nvda_4_ever</Username><Timestamp>1355098767087</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-09 19:19:27 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So many many words about a hypothetical company called aidivN in nvda_4_ever's fasmagorical world. Back in the Real world, CEO Jen Hsun Huang chopped his revenue guidance (-15%). On Thursday November 8th, after the close. Remember? And the Market, she is logically and predictably walking the stock price down (-15%). She sure is. Because she logically and predictably expects Earnings to be (-15%) lower. Just like the CEO said in his revenue guidance. Not higher. Oh no no no. Lower. Because lower Revenue is a pre-cursor of lower Earnings. And as for cash, well, a buck of balance sheet cash is worth exactly that -- $1.00 The Market, she applies no multiple to cash, 'cause a buck is just a buck. Always. The difference is how "cash efficient" the company's management is with cash. Is it being put to productive use, say for working capital or acquisitions, -- which b/t/w did you see Qualcomm made another acquistion last week? -- or is it just lounging-around unproductively, watching Wheel of Fortune and eating Cheetos® all day -- like nvidia's cash is. And for a supposed High Tech / High Growth company like nvidia purports to be, it's just plain dumb for Jen to be holding onto so much excess cash. Yes boys, just plain cash-inefficiently, dumb.</Msg><Username>it_is_best</Username><Timestamp>1355104064602</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-09 20:47:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>21</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355108900635-22</Id><Title>NVDA to $18 with Tegra4 seen as next Qualcom in making</Title><Msg>Cash is $6/share and new Tegra seem making NVDA the next Qualcom</Msg><Username>bengraham650</Username><Timestamp>1355108900635</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-09 22:08:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355111054349-23</Id><Topic><Title>Here is why all the pathetic Best losers are WRONG!</Title><Username>nvda_4_ever</Username><Timestamp>1355098767087</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-09 19:19:27 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>" Gollum creaure." - LOL</Msg><Username>eir951</Username><Timestamp>1355111054349</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-09 22:44:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355112022408-24</Id><Topic><Title>Wayne news: HTC to be the first with NVIDIA Tegra 4 phone?</Title><Username>ibexx88</Username><Timestamp>1354804662828</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 09:37:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wow, an on-topic post and it immediately gets a slew of thumbs-down. Yet off-topic and negative posts with zero content gets just as many thumbs up. It's clear that Nvidia is committing to the mobile products. The same posters slamming them for investing in Tegra would be slamming them if they had stuck with only making video cards. Not that video cards are a bad business. With the imminent demise of the only remaining competitor, ATI/AMD, Nvidia will probably increase sales and margin in a business that has been "dying" for the past decade.</Msg><Username>watergatefive</Username><Timestamp>1355112022408</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-09 23:00:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
