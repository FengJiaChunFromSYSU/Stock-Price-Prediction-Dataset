Only this post is. The rests are facts and observations. Oh. Talking about joke. Nvidia share price is a joke. Lots of promises, average delivery. U? No need to be defensive over Nvidia, or saying Nvidia is a great company. Always let share price do the talking. U invest to make money, or watch it do nothing? Say Nvidia is great when it share price breaks up and stay up. The period it does is the time I change tune to say that Nvidia is a great company. Now, the fact is ain't . Nvidia has not performed for years. Its a POS til it stays above $13 for starters.</Msg><Username>chrisssable</Username><Timestamp>1366546649573</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-21 08:17:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366555416701-4</Id><Topic><Title>Breaking news!

Argue my points. Not ranting like a kid that loses an argument. But I am afraid u cant, cos the facts are clear. U have wasted much time hoping on a rise instead of actually making money. Why I said that? Cos Nvidia din perform for years. I have hurt your feelings and ego, hence u rant instead of arguing based on facts. So whether to grow up or stay as a kid, u decide.</Msg><Username>chrisssable</Username><Timestamp>1366555416701</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-21 10:43:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366555733914-5</Id><Topic><Title>Once again, a lack of follow through</Title><Username>chrisssable</Username><Timestamp>1366452373975</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-20 06:06:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"It's not out. It's been stated by Nvidia that it would be late by a quarter due to a decision to dedicate resources to the T4i so it could be pushed-up by 2 months. Perhaps the delay was due in part to the latest rumor posted by ibexx today in regards to the Xiaomi M3 that will come equipped with Nvidia’s T4i chip?" roflol, pumper boyz spilling lies, eh I meant rumors, so fast and furious, they can't even keep track of keeping stories straight anymore.

According to the latest rumors, he Xiaomi M3 will come equipped with Nvidia’s latest quad-core chip, the 4 CPU will offer a quad-core Cortex-A15 CPU with clock speeds between 1.8 GHz and 2 GHz with...... One day, nvda/Tegra/Jen and txn/OMAP/Txn management will make a pair of classic mba classic classroom case studies: both targeted a market segment, the high end app processor market, that does not exist. The good management admitted their mistake, backed off and retargeted and lived/made money ever after. The bad management who was all hype kept losing shareholders' money to the bitter end.</Msg><Username>whosunw</Username><Timestamp>1366555733914</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-21 10:48:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366559185515-6</Id><Topic><Title>Once again, a lack of follow through</Title><Username>chrisssable</Username><Timestamp>1366452373975</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-20 06:06:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>TI basically admitted that they can no longer compete on the high end.

What don't you understand about that?" for those new to the board: that's another lie that the pumper boyz like to spread here. lol, next thing you know, they will be telling you that nvda is doing $hundreds of M of Tegra 1/2 sales. More than there's money to be made, but the only money to be made is in the low end because in the high end, For the high end app proc market: he top 2 mobile names roll their own, #3 is cheap only, and #4 likes to spread the wealth. Ala, there is no high end app proc market to build a business upon. Hence txn bit the bullet, and shifted their focus to other market segments. Nvda, nvda, with that CEO with the huge ego, gallantly soldiers on with your money. The money to be made will be made by guys with the fully integrated solutions. Fully integrated solutions for lower BOM cost, much much faster time to market, and much much less engineering cost up front. Ala, low end cell phones will be just board + solder: buy the app proc, build with reference design, throw in latter google + proven reference design sw provided by the app proc guy, and you are in the phone business. For that low end market, you need all the IPs to build the integrated solution with. Only two companies have all those 'cheap' radios under one roof. None of the others like nvds, intc, samsung, mediatek, txn, renasas, or the 6 other cell phone chip guys in china has all the ip. There, there you have it, a breakdown of the app proc market. Whether it's T4, T5 or T6 will change that nor be successful in that. Now just watch Mr. ctown go nuts and go back to his foul mouth.</Msg><Username>whosunw</Username><Timestamp>1366561081505</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-21 12:18:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366586972944-9</Id><Topic><Title>Yes Ladies and Gentlemen, It's Up To Project Shield</Title><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1366512499822</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-20 22:48:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>From the 2012 Annual Report - 10K: "During fiscal years 2013, 2012 and 2011, we granted approximately 7.1 million, 6.4 million and 5.8 million stock options, respectively, with estimated total grant-date fair values of $38.3 million, $52.4 million and $34.4 million, respectively, and weighted average grant-date fair values of $5.38, $8.16 and $5.89 per option, respectively.

Stock doesn't even have to go up and yes, your always in the money because your basis is ZERO. Gee is that aligning with shareholder values. I don't know, but I have to ask where is the incentive with all these RSUs. Perhaps it takes these things to keep all those Senior VP's and the CEO happy.</Msg><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1366586972944</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-21 19:29:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366588064230-10</Id><Topic><Title>Breaking news!
