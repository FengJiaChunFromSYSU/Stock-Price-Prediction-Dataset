The HD portion of Kindle Fire is all graphic (GPU) driven. I would understand if Kindle Fire 2 supports H.264 then Tegra would have come very handy because of the high activities in parallel processing with the decoding (CPU bound). I think Omap may have the edge on this one when used strictly with MP3 videos watching and book-reading on a 1.8 GHz CPU as compare to Nvidia 1.5 GHz single core.</Msg><Username>cj_observer</Username><Timestamp>1347423588890</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 00:19:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347424253392-2</Id><Title>IDF: AMD announces availability of new Intel Ivy Bridge Servers</Title><Msg>OUCH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

"With Apple moving their "A-series" ARM chip business out of Samsung, Sammy will have massive capacity to make tons of their own Eyxnos ARM chips, and thereby Crush the little players like nvidia. This can't be good for the Tegra, right boys?" . Good point, Best. Samsung actually OWNS their fab plants -- unlike little nvidia. Eighteen (18) globally located fab plants to be exact. Making Samsung the largest semiconductor manufacturer on the planet. And at least two (2) of their fab plants have been specially built to make Apple's "A" series ARM processors. Like the A4, A5 and A5X chips, don't u know. Yep. Fabs that were built and paid off with Apple's past gigantic iOrders. So with Apple moving their A6 chip production over to TSMC, what's Samsung going to do with their aforementioned specially built ARM plants? Hummm? No. The answer is Not to go into the pigeon breeding business. Samsung is likely to go pedal-to-the-metal and flood the world with their own Eyxnos brand of ARM chips. And cheap too. Oh so cheap. Since Apple has already paid for Samsung's ARM fabs with their past gigantic iOrders. So in an indirect way, Apple moving out of Samsung's fabs is an absolute Death Knell for the nvidia Tegra. Which won't be able to compete with Samsung's flood of inexpensive Eyxnos ARM chips, Ironic, right? It sure is. Just my innocently switching vendors, Apple has likely killed-off the nvidia Tegra.. .</Msg><Username>good_point_best</Username><Timestamp>1347424924162</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 00:42:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347425825578-4</Id><Title>WIRED: Tablet Smackdown: Kindle Fire HD and Nexus 7</Title><Msg>And the Winner Is The best all-around Android tablet is still the Nexus #$%$ polish, speed, software and pocket-friendly size give it an edge over the fantastic Fire HD.

So Best? What you're saying is, nvidia's Tegra business is mere "collateral damage", -- like road kill -- in the raging litigation battle between Apple and Samsung. And if the two weren't suing each other, Apple wouldn't be moving their A6 chips out of Samsung's fabs, causing Samsung to have a Market Crushing Amount of Fab Capacity for their own Eyxnos ARM chips. Thereby flooding the market with their own extraordinarily cheap Eyxnos ARM chips. Turning the Tegra into the aforementioned road kill.

According to the bloggers/pundits, the A6 is likely quad core Cortex A9s around a PowerVR GPU. Unfortunately it's very unlikely that NVDIA is a supplier in the new iphone or ipad mini. Fortunately, however, the market for non-Samsung and non-Apple smartphones and tablets is still very large (~350M units next year), and Nvidia seems positioned well. Once Icera baseband can be integrated into the SoCs (company says sometime in 2013) they should be able to get ~$40 per fully integrated SoC, based on comments NVDA CEO made with regards to competing with Intel. If they get 25% of the mkt and a blended ASP of $30, that'd be over two billion dollars in revenue, translate to 50% rev growth for the overall company. Pretty crazy, and the market seems to be pricing in a probability of near zero. But NVDA was originally guiding that Consumer Products would rise to up to $1B in the current fiscal year... before apparently missing their own internal estimates and dropping that target. If the drop in the first half of this year was actually just a hick-up and the segment has returned to the earlier growth trajectory, then $2B+ would actually be plausible.</Msg><Username>thetrade50</Username><Timestamp>1347468785992</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 12:53:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347473261867-21</Id><Topic><Title>intel/nvda merger on the table again!!!!</Title><Username>smallstock1</Username><Timestamp>1347457105538</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 09:38:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>oldest, deadest issue of all time. quit blowing smoke and sharing your fantasies</Msg><Username>hendar00</Username><Timestamp>1347473261867</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 14:07:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347473540629-22</Id><Topic><Title>what processor will ipad mini use?</Title><Username>smallstock1</Username><Timestamp>1347466229550</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 12:10:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A6 has dual-core A15 and double the gpu power of A5 .... as if it needed it ;-).</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1347473540629</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 14:12:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347475229448-23</Id><Topic><Title>what processor will ipad mini use?</Title><Username>smallstock1</Username><Timestamp>1347466229550</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 12:10:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>we can speculate thru october....</Msg><Username>smallstock1</Username><Timestamp>1347475229448</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 14:40:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347475274956-24</Id><Topic><Title>intel/nvda merger on the table again!!!!</Title><Username>smallstock1</Username><Timestamp>1347457105538</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 09:38:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>the smoke is very thin...</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1347475274956</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 14:41:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347476704217-25</Id><Topic><Title>intel/nvda merger on the table again!!!!</Title><Username>smallstock1</Username><Timestamp>1347457105538</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 09:38:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>maybe not so ....</Msg><Username>smallstock1</Username><Timestamp>1347476704217</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 15:05:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347477093036-26</Id><Title>No IPAD mini! haha! what idiots.</Title><Msg>Big mistake apple....good for google, and the iphone 5 is nothing great...same old look</Msg><Username>tradingguy1111</Username><Timestamp>1347477093036</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 15:11:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347481546728-27</Id><Title>Predictions for tomorrow?

If it looks a dual A9 process shrink/speed bump, walks like a dual A9 process shrink/speed bump, talks like a dual A9 process shrink/speed bump, it IS a dual A9 process shrink/speed bump. I'll stake my 25 yrs of product engineering experience on this one.</Msg><Username>whosunw</Username><Timestamp>1347484482118</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 17:14:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347487026472-32</Id><Topic><Title>Apple A6 processor to be 22% faster than the one in previous iphhone, not 100% nor 50%</Title><Username>ibexx88</Username><Timestamp>1347478261511</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 15:31:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>look at the actual live slides not misinformation from the Inquirer, Apple claim x2 on both cpu and gpu not 22%.

I would bet that it's quad A9, following Exynos footsteps. That would make for a very big die even at 32nm.

Whaaaaaat?! "The Genuine Apple iPhone 5 will include a Qualcomm MDM9600 baseband processor." You mean nvidia/icera lost Another one? icera purports to make those baseband processors too, right? That's what Jen's press releases say. But they didn't win the Fastest Selling Electronic Device in the History of Mankind. The Genuine Apple iPhone 5. Fifty Million (50,000,000) will be sold shortly -- like hotcakes, boys. But lacking any parts fro nvidia/icera. None. The Numero Uno largest baseband chip order of the year.
