For forcing Jen to finally pay us a Dividend!</Title><Msg>THANKS BEST! For forcing Jen to finally pay us a Dividend! NINETEEN (19) long dividend-less years, boys. Since 1993. When Jen and two other co-founders started nvidia. Jen has been hoarding the shareholder's cash. Yes, just hoarding it, boys. And not paying any Dividend to his hapless shareholders. Goose egg, For 19 long years, as follows: . 1993 __ Shareholders paid their money in, hoping for some nice Dividends back. 1994 __ No cash dividend 1995 __ No cash dividend 1996 __ No cash dicivend 1997 __ No cash dividend 1998 __ No cash dividend 1999 __ No cash dividend 2000 __ No cash dividend 2001 __ Quite an Odyssey -- No cash dividend 2002 __ No cash dividend 2003 __ No cash dividend 2004 __ No cash dividend 2005 __ No cash dividend 2006 __ No cash dividend 2007 __ No cash dividend 2008 __ No cash dividend 2009 __ No cash dividend 2010 __ No cash dividend 2011 __ No cash dividend 2012 __ Jen surrenders just nine (9) days after Best calls him out -- and declares a Dividend. Now, I'm not sure what happened to the other two co-founders of nvidia, -- the two guys that didn't work at Denny's -- but malnutrition is highly likely. And then Best entered the ring. Yes, Boom-Boom Best. The fearless Righter-of-Wrongs and Defender of the Alpha-less. And on October 27th 2012, Best went mano-a-mano with Jen right here. On this very global forum. Disclosing the little know fact that Everybody except Jen paid a dividend. Yes, a Cash Dividend, boys. Paid in Cash to the Owners of the Company, don't u know. And Best, along with his usual entourage of Bestville denizens, called Jen out. And called him out Badly. Yes boys, a showdown at the Not Okay Corral. And you know what? Jen quickly surrendered under the insufferable pressure of Best's postings. (Which by the way, can be read and re-read at your leisure -- just look for the highly popular posting entitled, "Jeepers Best, Everybody else pays a dividend.") And just nine (9) business days later, Jen capitulated to Best's intellectually honest demands -- and announced the First Ever Cash Dividend in the History of nvidia. So don't believe it, boys. Oh no no no. When folks say that postings on Our fine board don't matter. They DO matter -- A LOT -- and can change the course of a cheap company's history. If you don't believe it, just ask current CEO Jen. AND THANKS AGAIN BEST! For forcing Jen to finally pay us a Dividend! You're truly, well, The Best.</Msg><Username>thanks.best</Username><Timestamp>1352438311323</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-09 00:18:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>30</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352438708301-3</Id><Topic><Title>THANKS BEST!

This kind of competition is health and drivel overall Windows RT tablet expansion. =================== While I can’t personally vouch for the overall quality of the VivoTab RT, the manufacturer has a strong track record with its Android Transformer line, and this particular slate boasts an incredible 600nit compared to the 400nit luminosity of the Surface. The VivoTab further distinguishes itself with its 8MP rear camera (as opposed to the primary 5MP camera on the Surface) and an additional 7 hours of rated battery life via its docking station. The docking station also includes a keyboard, trackpad and MicroSD card slot. ASUS is offering the optional dock for free through December 31st, 2012. If price is a concern and you’re in the market for a post-PC hybrid tablet running Windows RT, the VivoTab may be a tempting proposition. It also matches the Surface’s 2GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage, and is powered by NVIDIA’s Tegra 3 chip. If patience is your game, stick around for hands-on impressions of the VivoTab RT and a full review of Microsoft’s Surface.

What went wrong? nvda had a high -- just yesterday -- of $13.08 on Thursday 11/8. And then Jen made a presentation yesterday evening about this and that. Followed by the crucial Questiona and "Answers" period, where Jen didn't give a straight answer to Any of the analysts fine questions, And today nvda closed at $12.18 on Friday 11/9. That's what? Like a (- 6.9%) fall in just one day. For the unfortunate chap that bought yesterday at $13.08 Apparently the investor folks didn't like Jen's sucky outlook for the future. Nor his non-answers to analyst questions.</Msg><Username>jeepers.best</Username><Timestamp>1352496666956</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-09 16:31:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>31</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352496726665-69</Id><Topic><Title>NVDA: 12 PE + Cash = 18</Title><Username>balak_joshi</Username><Timestamp>1352492058255</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-09 15:14:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You are on ignore because you don't no how to read any of my messages. Thought I was answering why it would be bought at a premium over 20 but as usual a poster like yourself decides for themselves what someone writes for their own agenda. You throw out #$%$ conspiracy data to confirm your own 'theories' and only post on days like this for any stock. Intel, Qualcomm, and several other companies have had similar days like today when the rest of the market was doing better. If you make a decision about a company based on a market being right or wrong for one day, you shouldn't be investing.

Yes, THREE times, boys. First, nvidia pays taxes on their net income Before distributing the dividend. Then the hapless nvidia shareholder pays tax on their dividend received. And then pays sales tax Again on whatever they buy with it -- in this case almost lunch at Mcdonald's. Assuming that the hapless nvda shareholder spends the dividend. Which is probably a safe assumption.

Right boys? It sure is. For the three months just ended, nvidia had revenue of $1.204 billion. Yet Jen confessed last night that guidance for the Next three months could be as low as $1.025 billion. As much as (-$179,000,000.00) Lower than the quarter just ended. And Much Lower than the average analysts' expectations of $1.206 billion, according to Thompson Reuters I/B/E/S. Did I mention? Like a flag at half-staff, lowered guidance is a sad thing." So Master? First, I must say that's a fine, very well written explaination of why nvda stock came Crashing down today. Following Jen's significantly lowered guidance. Very well written. But secondly, I have a question. We all know that The Market is a forward-looking, cash discounting machine. Like an Italian in a little sports car. Who snaps-off the rear view mirror 'cause, "what's behind him don'ta matter". This we all understand. But how long does it take, Master? The process of The Market reducing expectations and the nvda stock price accordingly -- to reflect the new sucky future and guidance. A couple months? Okay. Thanks Master.
