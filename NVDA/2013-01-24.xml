The iPad and iPad mini saw their combined market share drop to around 50% in the second half of 2012. Since Apple is likely to launch its next-generation tablets in the second half of 2013, several non-Apple tablet brands are aggressively releasing new devices in the first half with attractive prices and specifications to boost demand, according to sources from tablet brand vendors. With Amazon's Kindle Fire and Google's Nexus 7 doing well in the market, while Acer's recently launched Iconia B1, Asustek Computer's MeMO Pad and Samsung's upcoming Galaxy Note 8.0 and new 10.1-inch tablet are all scheduled to launch in the first half, the sources believe Apple may see its tablet market share during the period drop further from the second half of 2012. ______ ASUS Memo pad 10 specs have leaked recently. It is intended as a high-quality, low-cost tablet much in the tradition of Nexus 7, except for a bigger size. Naturally it will be powered by Tegra 3.</Msg><Username>ibexx88</Username><Timestamp>1359005246484</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 00:27:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359005834132-5</Id><Topic><Title>Apple to see tablet market share dip in 1H of 2013</Title><Username>ibexx88</Username><Timestamp>1359005246484</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 00:27:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"ASUS Memo pad 10 specs have leaked recently... it will be powered by Tegra 3."

More than that, analysts were left rather befuddled by the change in Apple’s forecasting approach, discussed extensively on the conference call last night, which now offers a range of revenue values, instead of a single number, for the quarter, and no profit projection. Price targets are going down across the board. There are at least two downgrades, that I can see, one from Scotia Capital’s Gus Papageorgiou, who cut his rating to Sector Perform from Outperform, and one from Jefferies &amp; Co.’s Peter Misek, who cut the stock to Hold from Buy. Nomura Equity Research’s Stuart Jeffrey reiterates a Neutral rating, writing that the company is “Starting the ex-growth era.” However, Brian White of Topeka Capital Markets, while cutting his price target to $888 from $1,111, reiterates a Buy rating, writing that he still expects EPS growth this year, projecting $56.99 per share, versus a prior $58.92, which is still quite a bit above the average estimates now around $42 or so. As if the report wasn’t humbling enough, Gartner late yesterday reported that Samsung Electronics (005930KS) has surpassed Apple as the top buyer of semiconductors in the world, purchasing $23.9 billion in components last year, ahead of Apple’s $21.4 billion, versus prior-year purchases of $18.6 billion for Samsung and $18.8 billion for Apple. ______ PS: I beat the analysts to it. I posted in the past few days prior to earnings cc that Apple would not show growth for at least 3 quarters. Very unfavorable y/y comparisons. Apple sounded shell-shock that it announced no more specific guidance from now on, just a range perhaps... CEO Tim Cook sounded downright defensive about his "performance".</Msg><Username>ibexx88</Username><Timestamp>1359042847744</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 10:54:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359043427121-16</Id><Title>time to take some profits</Title><Msg>sold half - NVDA will either announce earnings date today or, pre-announce earnings.

The big question on many investors’ minds is whether the firm can rebound again. Two things have whetted the bears’ appetites. First, Steve Jobs, Apple’s founder and creative genius, is dead. The iPhones and iPads he sired still generate gargantuan profits. But his successor, Tim Cook, has yet to prove himself capable of bringing new breakthrough products to market. Second, Apple’s fantastic profit margins—38.6% on sales of $55 billion—attract competitors like sweetshops attract six-year-olds. The company’s fans pooh-pooh the idea that Apple has peaked. The firm’s price-earnings ratio—11.6 at close of business on January 23rd—is not much different from Microsoft’s (see chart 2). That makes Apple’s shares look relatively sexy. Unlike Microsoft, which depends heavily on the ailing personal-computer business, Apple concentrates on sectors that are growing fast, such as smartphones and tablets. Only one of 60 analysts tracked by Bloomberg had a “sell” recommendation on Apple before this week’s stockmarket fallout. A drizzle of negative news had already dampened investors’ ardour before this week’s earnings announcement. Apple bungled the introduction of its new mapping app, and there were rumours of cuts in component orders for the iPhone 5. But iBulls still expect sunshine this year: news of new gizmos that Apple has created and new markets it is set to disrupt. One of those gadgets is likely to be a much cheaper iPhone aimed at emerging markets. In China, where some men have reportedly been dumped for failing to buy their girlfriends iPhone 5s, Apple sold 2m of its top-of-the-range devices over its launch weekend last month. However, most Chinese shoppers can’t afford the things. Barclays, an investment bank, reckons Apple could produce an iPhone for less than $150 to broaden its appeal. The firm has played down reports of a cheaper iPhone, but Apple-watchers expect an announcement this year. Slimmer profit margins in China and India may be worth it to woo millions of new buyers. Apple is said to be close to a distribution agreement with China Mobile, a carrier with a hefty 700m subscribers. News of a deal may boost Apple’s shares. Yet the best way for the company to prove it is not past its prime would be for it to disrupt another big market. Since Jobs’s death in 2011 Apple has concentrated on sprucing up its existing products. Now investors want to see it conjure up entirely new ones. All eyes are on television (though Apple is also exploring the potential of other markets, such as wearable computing: see article). Mr Cook says television is an area of “intense interest”. He told interviewers that when he switches on the TV in his living room, he feels like he has “gone backwards in time by 20 or 30 years.” This fuels expectations that Apple will launch an iTV later this year. Sceptics point out that plenty of elegant, wafer-thin screens are already on sale. Moreover, Apple’s existing set-top box, which lets users play content from iTunes, Netflix and other services on their TVs, has not been a stunning success. But this misses the—so to speak—bigger picture. The iTV, which may be controlled via gestures and voice commands as well as via iPads and iPhones, could be a digital hub for the home. It would let people check whether their washing machine has finished its cycle while they gossip on Facebook and watch their favourite soap. Peter Misek of Jefferies, an investment bank, says sales of it should also boost purchases of iPads and other Apple gear, as more people get sucked into the firm’s “ecosystem” of linked devices and software. But the iTV is no surefire blockbuster. For one thing, persuading cable and broadcast outfits to make programming available over the internet on demand will be tricky. They have already seen how such a model crushed music companies. For another, iTVs are likely to be pretty expensive, limiting their mass-market appeal. Apple will also, as usual, face stiff competition from Samsung. The South Korean firm is one of several that already sell smart TVs. Indeed, Samsung seems to be churning out more and more groundbreaking devices while Apple has produced only incremental innovations of late. Apple’s court battles with Samsung over smartphone patents have reinforced the impression that it is on the defensive. However, Horace Dediu of Asymco, a research firm, says it would be a mistake to think Apple is resting on its laurels. He notes that its capital expenditure has soared in recent quarters, reaching levels typically seen at firms with huge manufacturing operations, such as Intel (see chart 3). Some of this money is going into data centres to support cloud services like iTunes. But Mr Dediu reckons much of it is being spent on dedicated production equipment at suppliers. This could give Apple an edge in producing new gadgets. Yet even if it produces a cheaper iPhone, pushes deep into China and wows the world with a smart TV, its shares will not reconquer last year’s peak. Competition is now tougher in its core markets. Rivals will not let it disrupt new ones so easily. Apple may dip into its $137 billion cash lake to boost its share price by paying fatter dividends or buying back more stock. That would delight some investors, but others would see it as a tacit admission that the firm’s great innovation engine has stalled. Apple won’t crumble, but it has peaked.</Msg><Username>ibexx88</Username><Timestamp>1359070891062</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 18:41:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359071010597-43</Id><Topic><Title>The Economist: Has Apple peaked? - the world's most valuable firm may be past its prime</Title><Username>ibexx88</Username><Timestamp>1359070891062</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 18:41:31 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Worth highlighting: Apple may dip into its $137 billion cash lake to boost its share price by paying fatter dividends or buying back more stock.

Samsung and Apple (AAPL) made up half of all smartphone shipments in 2012, with Samsung acquiring 30% share with 213 million units, and Apple having 19% share, at 136 million. Third-place Nokia (NOK) had sales of 35 million units last year, for global smartphone share of 5%, down from 16% in 2011. Samsung and Apple both beat a previous annual record for shipments, the 100.1 million Nokia achieved in 2010. The firm called Apple’s smartphone unit sales growth in 2012 “healthy” at 46%, though it was less than Samsung’s 77% unit growth. Samsung probably sold 63 million smartphones in Q4, Strategy Analytics estimate, (Samsung does not disclose device unit sales), giving it 29% market share, compared to the 22% share Apple captured in Q4 with sales of 47.8 million iPhones, reported yesterday. Nokia sold 6.6 million smartphones in Q4, as it confirmed this morning, including its Lumia smartphone running Microsoft‘s (MSFT) Windows Phone 8 operating system, for 3% share of total Q4 sales. Total shipments of all mobile phones, including smartphones, feature phones, dumb phones, etc., rose just 2%, year over year, to 1.6 billion. Samsung had the top spot, at 24% share in Q4, up from 21.6% in the year-earlier Q4, Strategy Analytics estimates. Nokia was in second place in Q4, with 19% share, down from 26% a year earlier. And Apple held third place in Q4, with 10.6%, up from 8.4% a year earlier.</Msg><Username>ibexx88</Username><Timestamp>1359087070841</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 23:11:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359087228192-51</Id><Topic><Title>Anybody else frustrated?</Title><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1358187259783</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-14 13:14:19 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Toodles to u.

Microsoft reportedly is cooperating with chipset suppliers including QUALCOMM on development of Windows Phone 8 reference design aiming to attract more smartphone makers in China to enter production of WP8 phones for the entry-level and midrange smartphone segments in China and other emerging markets, according to industry sources. Microsoft is expected to release the WP8 reference design in mid-2013, with smartphone models built on the reference design to hit the market in the second half of the year, the sources indicated. The development of the WP8 reference design will help Microsoft expand the ecosystem and market share of its new Windows Mobile platform, the sources commented. QUALCOMM is expected to tie up with Microsoft for development of the reference design, since the chipset vendor has been offering chipset solutions for all WP8- and WP7.5-based models currently available in the market, the sources revealed. MediaTek, an experienced chipset vendor for Window Mobile-based reference designs and a chipset vendor with strong business ties with China-based smartphone makers, is also likely to team with Microsoft for the speculated reference design project, said the sources."
