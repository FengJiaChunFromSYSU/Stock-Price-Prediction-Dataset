TMobile is no surprise since they are not LTE yet. But ATT - LTE required?? Could it be a Pad with discrete NVDA LTE inside where the PAD battery is large and there 's more space for heat dissipation. Discrete LTE runs hotter and is a bigger battery drain. Now if the ATT version is T3+ with integrated LTE - that would be a killer! Anyway what is T3+ process node - seems to me it's a tweaked 40nm - if so - it'll run hotter than the 1.5GHz T3. If it's 32nm it'll run cooler. Thoughts?</Msg><Username>qmtai2</Username><Timestamp>1344055415000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 00:43:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>55</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344060407000-2</Id><Topic><Title>Engadget: HTC One X+, another flagship phone with Tegra 3 and Jelly Bean</Title><Username>ibexx88</Username><Timestamp>1344053596000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 00:13:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>- "The HTC One X for North America has been carried in Canada since April 20, 2012[27] and the United States since May 6, 2012[28] by Rogers and AT&amp;T respectively. It is 0.4mm longer than the international model, and features a 1.5 GHz dual-core Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 (MSM8960) SoC with an integrated on-die LTE (4G) modem -- instead of the Nvidia Tegra 3 which requires an external modem and is LTE-incompatible -- and 16 GB of internal storage instead of 32 GB. [29] Benchmarks have shown the battery life of the [Qualcomm Snapdragon powered] North American One X to be marginally better than the international model for various common tasks, except for web browsing where the [Qualcomm Snapdragon] North American model placed 15-30% better. This is primarily due to a smaller manufacturing process, 28 nm, of the Snapdragon S4 chipset compared to 40 nm for the Nvidia Tegra 3 inside the international HTC One X.[21][30] AT&amp;T cites incompatibility between Nvidia's Tegra 3 processor and LTE radios currently available on the market as the reason for the difference in processors.[31]" See Model variants. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC_One_X "AT&amp;T cites incompatibility between Nvidia's Tegra 3 processor and LTE radios currently available on the market as the reason for the difference in processors.[31]" Quite an engineering screw-up by nvidia, right boys? It sure is. An Elephantine screw-up. LTE -- The fastest cellphone baseband protocol on the planet. North America -- The Best cellphone market on the planet. And the nvidia Tegra 3 processor is INCOMPATABLE with LTE. Says AT&amp;T -- The largest provider of mobile telephony and largest fixed telephony provider in the United States. -</Msg><Username>bestsays39</Username><Timestamp>1344060407000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 02:06:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>64</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344060946000-3</Id><Topic><Title>Engadget: HTC One X+, another flagship phone with Tegra 3 and Jelly Bean</Title><Username>ibexx88</Username><Timestamp>1344053596000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 00:13:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>- So Best?

Is it maybe because Jen bought Icera -- a British company -- to fix nvidia's inability to talk with American cellphone towers? The Brits do everything a little different, right? They sure do. They measure things in the EU mandated metric system. In centimeters and liters and tonnes and hectares and this and that. And they misspell words like colour, flavour, harbour, humour, labour, and neighbour. And they really screw-up the word -- carburettor. And that's where all the INCOMPATIBLE problems begin. The American cellphone towers are looking for something like, "Yo. Cellphone #1234567 here." And Icera's British designed radio chips are sayin', "Pip pip and the top of the morning to you tower, 12-345-67 at your service." It's INCOMPATIBLE, right? And that boys and girls, is why you don't want a bunch of Brits handling the radio cell tower communication part of things. Skip the Icera bangers and mash. Get your genuine American radio parts from Qualcomm. Like AT&amp;T did. The largest provider of mobile telecom services in the United States. -</Msg><Username>jeepers.best</Username><Timestamp>1344097329000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 12:22:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>55</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344097736000-5</Id><Topic><Title>shorts making big bucks, yeah, sure!</Title><Username>smallstock1</Username><Timestamp>1343934986000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 15:16:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you should move to michelle bachmans's district in minn, if that would help...</Msg><Username>smallstock1</Username><Timestamp>1344097736000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 12:28:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344099663000-6</Id><Topic><Title>Engadget: HTC One X+, another flagship phone with Tegra 3 and Jelly Bean</Title><Username>ibexx88</Username><Timestamp>1344053596000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 00:13:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>- Well that, and whenever the British designed Icera chips have nothing to do, they want to talk soccer with the American cellphone tower.

Of course, these numbers could change once Apple dishes out its own 7-inch tablet, the rumored iPad Mini. Consumers holding out for the smaller iPad may likely skip over Google's [nvidia's Tegra 3 powered Nexus 7] Android offering later on this year, and may even ignore Amazon's second-generation Kindle Fire given that Amazon's Instant Video service can be streamed to the iPad platform. That said, both Google and Amazon will need to find ways in keeping the focus on their products prior to Apple's supposed launch by the end of September." Pump harder, boys.
