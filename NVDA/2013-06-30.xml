It is sad that Yahoo doesn't do anything about this, and has allowed the wasting of their precious resources while tarnishing their image in the eyes of Yahoo advertisers. At the same time, Yahoo seems to bend on censoring legitimate information (link information) available in reputable, public media. I've written all this in my "suggestions" to Yahoo, but I doubt the higher ups get to see them.

This article is alluding to exactly that. Seems like brcm is taking that route attack the low cost smart phones in the China*. This totally integrated solution will be the only way to go for low end first and then bubble up market later, ala cheap Hondas and Datsuns. Likes like mediatech/intel/nvda/samsung/aapl need not apply. nvda needs to move very fast to do that with the t3i - go carrier and not phone oems. That market segment is still sort of open for that for the feature phones. In another year, brcm might be bringing out fully integrated solutions for that segment too. Anyway, the fight for the app processor for tablets and phones is pretty much all settled, with nvda the odd man out. Actually nvda is not really odd man out. Jen is the waiter serving out huge loses every quarter while just standing there watching other winners feast. Jen's tombstone, "Was in el goog,s Nexus 7 tablet in 2012!!!!!!!!!" Next up, wearables where discretes need not apply. * brcm's been ramping integrated solutions at Samsung since end of last year and India is supposed to ramp before X'mas.</Msg><Username>whosunw</Username><Timestamp>1372606443570</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-30 11:34:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372610951557-8</Id><Topic><Title>"Broadcom Right Price Right Stock"</Title><Username>whosunw</Username><Timestamp>1372606443570</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-30 11:34:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>" Seems like brcm is taking that route attack the low cost" Exactly what suppliers do when they have no other #$%$ to twist or leavers to pull but price.

One of the announcements focused on Windows RT 8.1 and what users should expect in the not so distant future. The new Windows RT experience has new features such as built-in Outlook, the ability to search across different apps, and improvements for enterprise users such as NFC printing, better VPN support, support for Microsoft's Workplace Join, and greater support for services offered by mobile device management vendors. We already knew of Outlook coming to Windows RT, but the ability to print documents via NFC is more than a welcoming feature. Furthermore, the new update will also bring support for NVIDIA Tegra 4 processors, according to Microsoft's VP of Planning, Mike Angiulo. Tegra 4 should make for more powerful Windows RT 8.1 devices at affordable price points for those who just require a simple Windows tablet without all the bells and whistles. Gaming on these Tegra 4-based Windows RT devices should be top notch so far as playing mobile-based games are concerned and not in the lines of Crysis 3. Web browsing should also be a blast, handling multiple apps opened at the same time shouldn't pose much of a problem, and battery life should be splendid as Tegra 4 is ARM-based. Microsoft has made a good decision by making Outlook available for Windows RT devices. Now only if the company would completely get rid of the desktop interface as Windows RT is designed for tablet devices. In addition, desktop apps are not supported on Windows RT, another reason why Microsoft needs to rethink its strategy and only work with the Modern UI rather than anything else.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1372645987479</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-30 22:33:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372646366060-12</Id><Topic><Title>Just in: Windows RT 8.1 brings support for NVIDIA Tegra 4 Processor</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1372645987479</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-30 22:33:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Please note that information quoted in the prior article came from Microsoft's VP of Planning.

Both invested $B and multi years to chase the exploding mobile opportunity. One got the headlines, but really what they are doing is nothing special, no added value. Did get one roll of the dice going their way and pushed sales to $240M/Q for Q3 2012. Now, can't even get to $100M/Q even when theirr 'cheap' radios are selling like hot cakes. The other did it the grunt way. Built the biz on unique tech, few others can do, with techs that few others have Now they have a steadily ramping business, including multi-socket wins at one of tthe top 2 in mobile, plus in the two biggest developing countries in the world. You want tech? I'll repeat what I posted, "Likes like intc/aapl/nvda/samsung/mediatek need not apply".. Let's see how long nvda can keep coughing up blood every Q.
