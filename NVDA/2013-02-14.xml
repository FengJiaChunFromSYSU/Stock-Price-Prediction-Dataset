I guess your expectations were more accurate. However my typo of referring to the current quarter as "Q2" doesn't change the any of the points I made above. yet, if they don't ship until Q2, Q2 will probably be flat to down from Q1 unless Quadro/Tesla save the day... it won't be until Q3 that we see a full quarter of T4 and Shield out in the market. So I guess I'd apply my disappointment to the implications for their fiscal Q2 as well. Again, I understand now that your expectations were lower and more realistic.</Msg><Username>joshpritchard</Username><Timestamp>1360819688528</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 00:28:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360819876469-4</Id><Title>this quarter they met their high end guidance from last quarter</Title><Msg>Q3 NVDA guided for Q4: Our outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 is as follows: Revenue is expected to be between $1.025 billion and $1.175 billion.

Jan 08, 2013 (Marketwire via COMTEX) --CES -- NVIDIA today announced that Audi's newest auto-infotainment system featuring NVIDIA® Tegra® technology will be rolled out globally in select vehicles this year. The innovative Audi MIB modular infotainment system introduces a new powerful computing module, MMX, which is based on the NVIDIA Tegra Visual Computing Module (VCM). The new MIB high-end system is currently available in Europe in the all-new Audi A3. Beginning with major markets in Asia, the system will reach further regions this year and come to the United States and Canada by 2014. At the heart of the MIB system is the NVIDIA VCM based on the NVIDIA Tegra mobile processor. The modular design of the VCM enables automakers to separate the rapidly advancing processor technologies from the slower to update electronics in vehicles. This can save automakers significant development time and cost by enabling rapid implementation of in-vehicle systems across diverse vehicle models. "NVIDIA's modular VCM approach lets companies like Audi quickly move from a Tegra 2 processor, to a Tegra 3 and beyond," said Taner Ozcelik, general manager of automotive, NVIDIA. "Never before has an automaker been able to deliver a new generation of consumer electronics technology within such a short time."</Msg><Username>moorall</Username><Timestamp>1360823614601</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 01:33:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360824382885-13</Id><Topic><Title>nvdasuck</Title><Username>whatabigmouth</Username><Timestamp>1360820109086</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 00:35:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>..and I TAUGHT I saw you as a parasite of material world</Msg><Username>whatabigmouth</Username><Timestamp>1360824382885</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 01:46:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360825022399-14</Id><Topic><Title>Profit will be minimal in Q1...</Title><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1360808828280</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-13 21:27:08 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Read the transcript before you draw another overly simplistic conclusion.

Going from "near $200M" to "just north of $50M" -- it's a substantial change in at least what the market was predicting. It seems a lot of other longs on this board knew the consensus estimates were way to high so maybe the market reaction will be muted tomorrow... but that seems pretty optimistic.

From SeekingAlpha transcript, page 4 ""Betsy Van Hees - Wedbush Securities Okay. Thanks very much. And so my follow up question has to do with OpEx. So, not this pretty big jump up in the GAAP OpEx, $430 million from your $402 million and then your $384 million in the prior quarter. So as we’re looking at the July and October, are we going to see OpEx sort of flattening out, or are we going to continue to have these incremental increases. And I was wondering if you could help us a little bit with the OpEx? Karen Burns - Interim Chief Financial Officer and Vice President Sure. So as you saw last year, we had a similar jump and we have it every first quarter. And as I explained, it's really the FICA tax reset that hits us pretty hard in the first quarter. And just like in fiscal 2013, OpEx levels are up for the rest of the year. So we expect a similar type of impact this year."" Jen Hsun explained the other part of the OpEx increase re. new product development.

Without 2g/3G, nvda has zero access to the bulk of the phone market. as for tablets, having LTE won't make a single bit of difference - never get into #1 #2, #3 is cheap only, #4 is into spreading the wealth. white box on last android OS will never compete with cut throat #4 with the next gen OS. translated, even with LTE next year, nvda's accessible market is way too small to justify the size of the cash burn of the Tegra group. above is what I've been saying for months now, and the reality longs have been hiding from for months now. Finally Jen is starting to owe up to start, though not admit to his defeat yet. nvda just doesn't have enough 'cheap' radios to stay in the game. google seekingaplha and apple stop making their own processors. That reality is becoming clearer and clearer for everyone to see. by analyst day in spring, analysts will be asking what jen is going to do about this losing strategy.</Msg><Username>whosunw</Username><Timestamp>1360841294069</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 06:28:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360841517314-20</Id><Topic><Title>Tegra numbers</Title><Username>chip_guru</Username><Timestamp>1360815751340</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-13 23:22:31 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>btw, nvda changed their reporting on Tegra - every which way to hid how bad Tegra is doing.

Comments: This is a wise move. Allows the true profitability of GPU's to be stated on the 10Q. Straight up comparison to AMD's graphics except AMD has their game console revenue in their Graphics division. Nvidia Grid Revenue will be reported here so probably a wash. 4Q 2012 results AMD - $326M Nvidia - $833M Tegra Processor Business Units - Same as Consumer Products Division was Comments: Tegra, Basband and RF(Icera), Auto, Legacy game Console, Other (Embedded) It will befuddle the analysts for a while. It use to be so easy looking at GPUs by desktop and notebooks, workstations, and HPC. One could take the Mercury Research report and the Jon Peddie Workstation report and predict revenue almost exactly. Analysts did not like it when Nvidia declined to forecast yearly Tegra and baseband revenue. You know the drill from Intel. Analyst now completely at sea on this so rumors of design wins is all we have to go on. Plus Project Shield is lumped in. Much higher ASP than just an application processor....$299? vs. $25. If Project Shield is successful every one's trends and graphs will just be blown away. Wonder if they will take the Goggle and Amazon Approach and never reveal sales numbers of the Project Shield. I hope they just report the numbers like Apple but even Apple is changing and providing ranges...i.e. more obtuse. Stock buybacks look to continue at a very health rate. Notice they quoted a round figure $100M in buybacks last quarter. Probably just turning over an amount each quarter to a big WS trading desk and saying you handle it. Nothing brings favorable Wall Street ratings as doing business with them. Hope it's GS or JPM.

Now, I don't know if the company needs to wait a day or two to be able to buy the stock, but they will be doing so as soon as legally possible. They have 6 bucks in CASH, and, therefore, this is a company with a PE of 6-7, that is minting money! I just hope that regular investors wake up to this before some kind of LBO or hostile takeover arrives. I won't be surprised if we dip into the 11s but WILL be surprised if we don't closer higher.

Nothing I say on SA or anywhere else is going to move the stock. And, if you actually *read* the article, you would know that I am still hugely positive on the company, albeit somewhat irritated that sell-side analysts had such high estimates for Q1, thinking that traditional seasonality didn't apply to the company. They're making a long term bet with Tegra, and they're backing it with cash. If they win, then there's a lot of glory to be had. A high growth profitable processor division, coupled with a steadily growing graphics division, and a fairly high growth HPC GPU division, makes for a very, very compelling stock. In the near term, I think the stock will again be range-bound, and long term investors should do their best to accumulate at the low end of that range. I don't really see a major catalyst to provide a large upside move until 2H 2013, although MWC could be a pleasant surprise.</Msg><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1360855913173</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 10:31:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360855936095-76</Id><Topic><Title>Can we move substantially higher near term?</Title><Username>mslans</Username><Timestamp>1360855813209</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 10:30:13 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>http://www.forbes.com/sites/ericsavitz/2013/02/14/hp-to-launch-android-based-tegra-powered-tablets/?partner=yahootix I am very hopeful the stock will recover.

If the rumors of an HP Android tablet are true, then this could be a solid start. However, what I would be really excited about is a real penetration into the phones.

Eventually AMD gets chopped up as an asset sale and NVDA is last man standing in a slow growth but highly profitable GPU business.

Stifel Nicolaus commented, "Nvidia delivered a mainly in-line quarter but F1Q14 revenue guidance was well below our and consensus estimates. The main culprit for the miss in our view is a gap in the platforms transitioning from Tegra 3 to the newly introduced Tegra 4. Also, operating expenses were guided to above our previous estimates as management pushes new product initiatives such as LTE modems and GPUs supporting software-as-a-service. We believe that these product initiatives can redefine Nvidia's markets and are worth the increase in spending."

AMD is focusing on AAA games while Nvidia's bundle focuses on F2P games and gives Kepler buyers free virtual currency in the games. I'm wondering, though, with AMD throwing bundles with retail values exceeding $300 for their highest-end Radian cards, and Nvidia currently responding with bundles that can exceed $150 in value, is it only natural to assume that Shield will offered bundled in a whole ecosystem value proposition by Nvidia (not precluding standalone sales as well)? The accounting could look good -- drive more sales of high-end, high-margin cards to the most hardcore gamers by giving them an improved value proposition of also receing a free or heavily discounted Shield device to stream from their couch (possibly connecting to their TV via HDMI) and then playing Android-based games while away from home. If the ecosystem as a bundle works, you could imagine the F2P game developers quickly finding more incentive to extend their PC services with lighter-weight Android based extensions that supplement the overall game experience, bringing even more usage and creating a virtuous cycle for Nvidia and their partners.</Msg><Username>joshpritchard</Username><Timestamp>1360864902260</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 13:01:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360864954400-121</Id><Topic><Title>NVDA short play</Title><Username>o.investor</Username><Timestamp>1360604066251</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-11 12:34:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Not good at this..</Msg><Username>fdigiovanni01</Username><Timestamp>1360864954400</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 13:02:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360864955132-122</Id><Topic><Title>Sorry for those who sold prematurely</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1360864441937</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 12:54:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nvidia is doing what Cisco and Yahoo did and what WS wants Apple to do.

If the ROFR is still in place (much of the agreement is redacted but they still disclose it in their SEC files) why is there some necessary 3-5% premium, depending whatever "current" numbers you're using? I think I could write a somewhat compelling argument that MSFT should acquire NVDA, but I can't imagine management welcoming an acquirer. My disappointment around the third Tegra transition snafu aside, I believe Huang believes his company is well positioned to rival QCOM/INTC over the coming years. I think the genuinely believe he will create a $100B+ enterprise.</Msg><Username>joshpritchard</Username><Timestamp>1360866374063</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 13:26:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360866771641-133</Id><Topic><Title>Sorry for those who sold prematurely</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1360864441937</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 12:54:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>J7777, You quack me up with your fantasies... :P 123rfDOTcom/photo_10746567_a-cartoon-skeptical-duck-posing-a-question.html</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1360866771641</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 13:32:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360866776002-134</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft</Title><Username>malcolmmceasy</Username><Timestamp>1360865844957</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 13:17:24 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think NVDA will take over QCOM in market cap.

The article was on informationweek, written by Paul McDougall and titled 'Exclusive: Microsoft has acquisition deal with Nvidia'. I may be wrong about the price (in fact, I know I am) , but here's how I calculated it... The deal would allow MSFT to match if anyone offered $3.4 billion for 30% of the company. The current value of 30% of market cap is $2.35 billion.

However, what I think is holding us back, (since I'm the former Senior Options Trader in the Arbitrage Dept. of a major Wall St. firm) is tomorrow's OpEx. While those short the 12 1/2s and 13s had ample chance to cover, early on, I still think they'll do all they can to keep us at one of those strikes. Of course, I'd love to see it be the 13 strike, (and open interest there was over 36k), but they might be able to keep us at 12.50ish through tomorrow. However, make NO mistake, the stock is putting on a GREAT technical performance, today, and keep in mind that it is, again, holding over the 50DMA, and the 200DMA is only in the mid-12.70s, so IF we somehow close over that for a few days, then the 2 year Bear Market in NVDA's stock is coming to a close.

I've seen the same figure quoted there and in other articles but I don't understand why a deal set up over 10 years ago would have been tied to an [at least then] arbitrarily set threshold. I think there was some misunderstanding on the part of the first journalist that introduced that figure. Basically I'm saying I think if the ROFR is still in effect, I think it'd be triggered at any offer price (even though I don't think an offer in the neighborhood of $13.01 would even be considered a realistic offer, unless the share price moves significantly lower).

During a conference call after its financial results report for annual and fourth quarter fiscal 2013, Nvidia said that revenue shipments of the Tegra 4 "Wayne" SoC will start in July. Because of this, the first commercial devices to utilize the new chip won't be seen on the market until sometime between August and September. "We ship Tegra 4 starting in Q2 [of fiscal 2014]. We are ramping production now and we will have full production release. […] [The second quarter] is when we ship to customers. Q2 is also when we ship the Tegra 4 based Shield device. […] Although it is in the latter part of Q2, it is going to be in Q2," said company CEO Jen-Hsun Huan. The July date is based on Nvidia's second fiscal quarter which spans from May to July. As stated, Nvidia's own Project Shield handheld Android gaming console will be the first out the door to feature the new SoC, and may be accompanied by tablets offered by Asus and HP. Toshiba is also reportedly signed on to use the Tegra 4 chip whereas Acer is currently undecided. Nvidia's new SoC features four ARM-15 general purpose cores and a second-generation "battery saver" core for low power during standard use. Also packed into the 28-nm chip are 72 custom GeForce stream processors and Prism 2 display technology to reduce backlight power. There's also an optional chipset that enables worldwide 4G LTE voice and data support. "This Variable SMP architecture invented by Nvidia, enables four performance cores to be used for max burst, when needed, with each core independently and automatically enabled and disabled based on workload," the company said. "The single battery-saver core handles low-power tasks like active standby, music, and video playback, and is fully transparent to the OS and applications." On Wednesday Nvidia said its full-year revenue increased 7.1-percent to a record $4.28 billion USD, up from $4 billion USD. Its quarterly revenue decreased 8.1-percent sequentially to $1.11 billion, but the revenue year on year revenue was up 16.1-percent. The company also repurchased $100.0 million of stock and paid a dividend of $0.075 per share, equivalent to $46.9 million, during the fiscal fourth quarter. "This year we did the best work in our company's history," Jen-Hsun Huang said. "We achieved record revenues, margins and cash, despite significant market headwinds. We grew our GPU and Tegra Processor businesses. We are sampling production silicon of the Tegra 4 platform which includes our 4G LTE modem. And we created new pillars for long term growth with Project Shield and Nvidia Grid -- first-of-their-kind devices that will extend our leadership in visual computing into mobile and the cloud." Project Shield will serve as both a Tegra 4-powered handheld Android gaming console, and a receiver for local cloud-based PC gaming. To stream games directly from a PC to the gadget, customers will need at least one Kepler-based GeForce GTX 650 (Desktop) or GTX 660M (Notebook) GPU, an Intel Core i5 or equivalent CPU, 4 GB of RAM, Windows 7 and the GeForce Experience app. A dual-band Wireless-N router is also suggested. Nvidia said that during the fourth quarter it continued to drive the streaming of gaming from the cloud by signing deals with six middleware providers that will supply Grid gaming technology to service operators worldwide. The company also launched the Tesla K20 family of GPU accelerators, making the technology behind the world's fastest supercomputer, Titan, available to all.

Huang said the company will ship Tegra 4 chips to its partners early in its second financial quarter. That means companies like Asus, Vizio and HTC will get the new System on Chip in May 2013 at the earliest. That means those manufacturers won’t have the chance to release devices using the new processor until later this year. Shipping the Tegra 4 to partners in May could mean that smartphones and tablets won’t make it to market until sometime in August or September. That doesn’t apply to NVIDIA’s Project Shield, however.

With no consumer tablet or smartphone to call its own, HP isn't even in the running against companies like Apple, Asus or Samsung. After its spectacular failures in recent years, HP needs to adopt a winning mobile strategy. Google's Android platform just might be the key. The company is working on an Android tablet, reports ReadWrite, and should deliver it later this year. Citing anonymous sources, ReadWrite contends that the device will be announced soon, and will boast high-end specs. It could reach the market during the second or third quarter. The tablet will be based on Nvidia's Tegra 4 platform, which boasts a 4-core architecture. It runs four Cortex A15 processors cores based on a 28nm processes. It also has a fifth, low-power processor to help manage energy efficiency. HP's Android tablet could be one of the first to ship with this new power plant on board. Other details about the device, such as screen size, were not provided. HP currently offers a laptop/tablet hybrid in the Envy X2 (running Windows 8), but has not otherwise sold a tablet since its failed TouchPad back in 2011. The TouchPad, which ran webOS, hit the market in July 2011 and lasted less than two months before HP canned its entire tablet/smartphone business. The move essentially killed webOS, which HP acquired in 2010 when it bought Palm for $1.2 billion. WebOS has since been distributed by HP as an open source operating system. What's perhaps most interesting about HP's new tablet plans is that it is choosing Android over Windows RT/Windows Phone 8. There's no doubt that Android tablets (and smartphones) have all the positive momentum in the industry. Though Apple's iPad still wears the tablet crown, its share of the market has eroded steadily as more Android tablets arrive. It makes sense that HP would want to pick the operating system that gives its hardware the best chance of success. Android is clearly that operating system. The choice could create tension between HP and Microsoft, however. HP's PC business is rooted in Windows. The company has a relationship with Microsoft that stretches back decades. Or is this a reaction to Microsoft's own tablet ambitions? After all, Microsoft brought the Surface and Surface Pro tablets to market on its own, products that compete with Microsoft's partners. Is there already bad blood? Possibly. According to ReadWrite, HP began working on its Android tablet in November 2012, not too long after Microsoft's Surface hit the market. Android may have plenty of strengths, but HP will enter a crowded and competitive tablet market. The first device it is offering may be a high-end machine, but low-cost tablets such as the Asus-made Nexus 7 are gaining in popularity. HP would have to do something extra special with its hardware in order for it to compete successfully against the Apple iPad or Samsung's line of Galaxy Note tablets at the higher end of the tablet spectrum. One thing is for sure, HP needs to get into the tablet market as soon as possible. It also can't afford to make any mistakes. Let's hope its Android tablet isn't another TouchPad in the making.</Msg><Username>livinlifeveryday</Username><Timestamp>1360876786696</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 16:19:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360876827818-191</Id><Title>Quote from Raymond James Analyst . .</Title><Msg>"The street will likely look past the weak April quarter guidance from Nvidia, seeing it as a bottom due to the Tegra3 to Tegra4 transition. Bears will claim that Tegra4 demand is just not apparent, but we would point out shipments start in 2Q, Tegra4 is the apps processor to beat in tablets 2013 (despite amusing kindergarten antics by a blue-teamer now with the red team) and design wins are actually above Tegra 3 levels. The fact that Nvidia won’t give full year guidance for Tegra (as in the past) actually dissipates the bear target game, and takes the “too conservative or too aggressive” debate off the table. We applaud management’s move as it’s a sign of confidence going forward." This take is close to how I view the current state of affairs and also supports my take on the strategy by Jen &amp; Co. for giving guidance (or a lack thereof). I wouldn't be surprised if Jen thinks this is a way to mimic Apple when they were on the rise . . I'm in no way saying Nvidia could be Apple at all, but the parallels in strategy at this time are there, both in outlook and some of the attempts at making their own devices.</Msg><Username>roundhouse_c</Username><Timestamp>1360876827818</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 16:20:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360877028658-192</Id><Topic><Title>Quote from Raymond James Analyst . .</Title><Username>roundhouse_c</Username><Timestamp>1360876827818</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 16:20:27 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"(despite amusing kindergarten antics by a blue-teamer now with the red team) and design wins are actually above Tegra 3 levels."

My take is they think Kepler is strong enough to continue taking share or at least holding the dominant position in the discrete GPU market that they built on in calendar 2012. Their reaction to AMD's aggressive new game bundling, focusing on F2P and MMP games and spending less per card seems to bolster the argument that they're willing to prioritizing gross margin maintenance over ensuring that they can compete on overall value.</Msg><Username>joshpritchard</Username><Timestamp>1360879961505</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 17:12:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360880717938-201</Id><Topic><Title>Revenues in decline every Q for Nvidia.

Trying to say this is better then what was originally interpreted by the analysts and yourself as well, but not trashing your comment at all. I thought you were a constructive commentator on the stock but you are increasingly more defensive then warranted. For a person that isn't paying attention to my comments, you've given a LOT more time then someone that 'thinks' he knows what I think and doesn't need to read anything from me anymore. Anyways, I think your opinion about what Nvidia has botched is clouding your view of what I think is part of a process that no company can really overcome. It's just simply the reality that the further along we go with the development of these mobile chips, the more challenging it will be to make cycles work to avoid down periods between iterations and I think Nvidia has been anticipating that, hence the Shield and what appears to be attempts to have their own devices, even with smartphones and tablets later.</Msg><Username>roundhouse_c</Username><Timestamp>1360881382865</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 17:36:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360884117075-203</Id><Topic><Title>TomsHardware: NVIDIA reports best year ever, shipping Tegra 4 in July</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1360873223090</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 15:20:23 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Tom" was referred to as the website, a collective persona.

You have someone who's ostensibly long calling guidance "rough" and "disappointing" when it comes in below even the lowest existing analyst forecast, then argue that he's the one reacting emotionally for identifying negatives and attempting to explain why they're negative. This when even Jen-Hsun Huang himself would presumably acknowledge that it's a "disappointing" reality that the ramp to Tegra 4 is going to come months after the wind down of Tegra 3 (~40% Q/Q declines from Q4 to Q1 for Tegra), and that Icera was objectively *not* accretive to 2012 earnings, as originally stated, and only barely made it to market in a single device. And I don't think anyone's refuted the point that, as of a few months ago, Nvidia was still saying they'll ship discrete modems based on Icera's technology, that it was a logical step towards Grey, and now they're saying that market is disappearing (BRCM's market research and recent announcements be damned) and they'll only ship them along with Tegra 4s. Okay. Is it more emotional to say "this is what they've been saying all along" and not acknowledge that the guidance wasn't all roses?</Msg><Username>thetrade50</Username><Timestamp>1360896489444</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 21:48:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360897058579-233</Id><Title>Hector Ruiz has written a book, and WSJ ran a mini review</Title><Msg>In the book Hector talks about AMD's fight with Intel - David against Galiath - and the ill-fated attempt to take over NVIDIA.

Mosesmann thinks the lighter outlook for this quarter is nothing to worry about, that the new version of Nvidia‘s “Tegra” line of chips, Tegra 4, will sell, and that the company was smart not to provide an outlook for Tegra for the full year: "The street will likely look past the weak April quarter guidance from Nvidia, seeing it as a bottom due to the Tegra3 to Tegra4 transition. Bears will claim that Tegra4 demand is just not apparent, but we would point out shipments start in 2Q, Tegra4 is the apps processor to beat in tablets 2013 (despite amusing kindergarten antics by a blue-teamer now with the red team) and design wins are actually above Tegra 3 levels. The fact that Nvidia won’t give full year guidance for Tegra (as in the past) actually dissipates the bear target game, and takes the “too conservative or too aggressive” debate off the table. We applaud management’s move as it’s a sign of confidence going forward." blogs.barronsDOTcom/techtraderdaily/2013/02/14/nvda-rising-pondering-tegra-4-operating-expense-trajectories/?mod=yahoobarrons</Msg><Username>best_ivideo</Username><Timestamp>1360897869354</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 22:11:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360898533694-237</Id><Topic><Title>Qualcomm Kindergarten Antics Laughed/Amused by Analyst - Barrons</Title><Username>best_ivideo</Username><Timestamp>1360897869354</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 22:11:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Judging by the cheap giberish, desperate, or kindergarten antics by Qualcomm's CMO Anand Chandrasekher, one has to ask, "Does this guy know how to do marketing?

Published on Feb 14, 2013 Nvidia's Tegra 4 chip is now expected to ship in July, according to the company's CEO, Jen-Hsun Huang. That also means that devices equipped with the next-gen Nvidia silicon will likely be pushed back as a result --with possible late summer shipping dates of August or September. And remember all that buzz about Project Shield during CES 2013? Well, you'll likely have to hold out longer for that one, as well. Here's what Huang told financial analysts during a recent conference call: “We ship Tegra 4 starting in Q2 [of fiscal 2014]. We are ramping production now and we will have full production release. [The second quarter] is when we ship to customers. Q2 is also when we ship the Tegra 4 based Shield device…Although it is in the latter part of Q2, it is going to be in Q2." For those who might have missed it, Nvidia's Project Shield is a gaming controller/portable console that uses the aforementioned Tegra 4 chip. It features a five-inch, high-definition display, solid sound quality and microSD support (for all those extra games). As for the Tegra 4 processor, it implements ARM's Cortex-A15, which consumes 45 percent less power than the company's A-9 design. Here's Nvidia's description of its Tegra 4: "Tegra 4 harnesses ARM's most advanced CPU cores ever, plus a second-generation battery saver core, to deliver record levels of performance and battery life. This Variable SMP architecture invented by NVIDIA, enables four performance cores to be used for max burst, when needed, with each core independently and automatically enabled and disabled based on workload. The single battery-saver core handles low-power tasks like active standby, music, and video playback, and is fully transparent to the OS and applications." We'll keep you posted when we hear more on an official shipping date for the company's Tegra 4 chip and Project Shield. "Devices equipped with the next-gen Nvidia silicon will likely be pushed back as a result -- with possible late summer shipping dates of August or September." February March April May June July August September That's a really looong time to wait for the first dollar of Tegra #4 revenue, boys. A Really looong time.</Msg><Username>i_read_best</Username><Timestamp>1360901100876</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 23:05:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360901138158-239</Id><Title>Short squeeze !</Title><Msg>When Vanguard files the 6% ownership with SEC, it is obvious that the recent low of $12.1 was supported by Vanguard !

Perhaps a smartphone too?</Title><Msg>Hewlett Packard is reportedly working on a new bid for the mobile marketplace, and is barking up the Android tree to do it. ReadWrite reported Wednesday that HP has been developing a new Android-powered tablet since before last Thanksgiving (Nov. 22, 2012), and is preparing to unveil the device before long, citing two unnamed sources familiar with the plans. HP is reportedly going all-out with its Android tablet, aiming for a high-end device of unspecified size that will make use of NVIDIA's impressive Tegra 4 chip. While last year HP released the Envy x2 tablet/notebook hybrid with Windows 8, the company mostly shied away from pure tablets since the fall of webOS and its own TouchPad line. Tablets first, smartphones later The Verge also claims to have confirmation that HP has chosen Android to power some slates from its own anonymous source. HP on board with an Android tablet could be a big win for Google, after last year looked like the PC manufacturer was favoring Windows 8 for its future slates. Then again, HP is fairly late to the party where mobile devices are concerned, so it's questionable how much impact an HP Android tablet will actually have on the market. According to the report, HP's Android adoption also extends to the company's smartphone plans, though that includes the caveat that no HP smartphone will arrive before the end of the year. HP is reportedly holding some behind-the-scenes MWC 2013 meetings in just a few weeks, so you can be sure TechRadar will keep an ear to the ground for any Android tablet and smartphone news from the PC maker.
