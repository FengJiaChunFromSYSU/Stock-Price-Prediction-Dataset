Windows RT was supposed to have multiple SoCs supported at launch. But only Nvidia had working device support, because Nvidia was the only ARM SoC vendor with an experienced software team. The poor sales caused most other vendors to abandon Windows support, concluding that there was only room for a single profitable vendor. Microsoft desperately wants multiple vendor support, thus the intensive courting of Qualcomm. The Balmer appearance at CES in January was the highest profile example of this. I had expected that Qualcomm would come out with working support soon after that appearance. It's now 5 months later, and it's yet to arrive. Apparently Nvidia really *is* the only company that has the competence. Qualcomm's entry isn't positive news for Nvidia, but the real negative news was long ago, with the market failure of Windows RT. Microsoft could have recovered from the misstep by getting their internal teams to actually support ARM. But instead they fell flat on their face with only toy support. and a message that it wouldn't get better.</Msg><Username>watergatefive</Username><Timestamp>1370374807849</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 15:40:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370374888860-33</Id><Topic><Title>Will that SHIELD toy come 3 to a box with perforated packaging + AWARD sticker?</Title><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1370374041823</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 15:27:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Did I tell you how much I like Nvidia's wise name choice of SHIELD?

You can use a CHEAP, passive stylus to achieve the same as Samsung S Pen technology (in Galaxy Note) with line-width control by pressure 2. No limit on stylus size as in the case of Samsung S Pen which needs to be 1.5 mm or smaler 3. No additional dedicated digitizer needed - the latter is costly! 4. DirectStylus technology is manufacturer-agnostic, unlike Samsung's proprietary technology. I'd say this is a major winning technology, altho it doesn't sound terribly sexy on the surface.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1370377150246</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 16:19:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370377682220-38</Id><Topic><Title>"Future Windows 8.1 tablets to tap Qualcomm chip"</Title><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1370317736528</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-03 23:48:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Microsoft did NOT promise to use S800 in Win 8.1 Surface RT.

The two OEMs who cancelled partnership with QC were: HP and Samsung.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1370377682220</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 16:28:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370378166522-39</Id><Topic><Title>The Only Way SHIELD will make Money is if they can sell that name to Trojans</Title><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1370376889378</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 16:14:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm sure your parents regret not using one when you were conceived!

But then you don't see me posting Snapdragon 800 tablet design sightings by the POUND, do you? lol "We are excited [about]...the next iteration of Windows RT 8.1 [and] their new Snapdragon 800 processors," Mike Anguilo, Corporate Vice President at Microsoft, said in a statement." A suit over at Microsoft was blowing kisses to Qualcomm not me sport. All I did was laugh at Nvidia after seeing Qualcomm and Microsoft hugging. And yes, if Tegra 4 takes the Google Nexus 7 jobs from Qualcomm because the Snapdragon 800 is late then Snapdragon just might be DOA. Is that what is happening? Is Tegra 4 taking Qualcomm's Nexus 7 job? lmao IMHO</Msg><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1370379571789</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 16:59:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370380016453-43</Id><Topic><Title>"Future Windows 8.1 tablets to tap Qualcomm chip"</Title><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1370317736528</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-03 23:48:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"IF" true.
