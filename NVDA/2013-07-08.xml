Single memory pools But beyond that, the unique structure of the semicustom APUs at the heart of the new game consoles could tip the scales in AMD’s favor farther down the line, as they’re designed under “heterogeneous system architecture” principles. What’s heterogeneous computing? Chip makers have found it difficult to keep pace with Moore’s infamous Law as transistors have become smaller and smaller. Hardware designed according to heterogeneous computing principles splits up the computing workload among CPUs and GPUs, opening the door for far greater performance than is possible when computing and graphics processors are solitary islands. This computational teamwork may prove key to blowing past Moore’s Law if the technique is adopted en masse. As part of the HSA Foundation, AMD is at the forefront of promoting HSA technology—and the APUs in the next-gen consoles sport a unique HSA feature that could give AMD’s computer APUs a leg up later on. Rather than having components with separate memory, as is the usual case with PC hardware, the CPU and GPU in the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 each tap into a shared 8GB pool of memory. Having a heterogenous Unified Memory Architecture (hUMA), as the pool of memory is called, allows the two processors to communicate and divvy up tasks much more efficiently. However, the software needs to be specifically written to take advantage of the unified architecture. Implementing hUMA in the big gaming consoles could help to drive developers into the HSA Foundation’s eager arms. (Again: Anything to eke out a bit more power!) The Foundation already includes big-name chip makers such as ARM, Qualcomm, Samsung, and Texas Instruments, but Intel—the only manufacturer besides AMD making x86 PC processors—is notably absent from the list of supporters." source: pcworld</Msg><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1373281568734</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-08 07:06:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373281722857-5</Id><Topic><Title>"Why AMD's next-gen console victories are a big win for PC gamers"</Title><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1373281568734</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-08 07:06:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Single memory pools" "AMD’s Kaveri APUs, slated to land later this year, will also rock a unified memory pool.

As we mentioned a couple of weeks ago in our latest Q&amp;A session, Google was preparing to drop the price of the Nexus 7 to make way for the new model which could launch by the end of the month. While we’re waiting for that to happen through Google Play, the discounts at retailers have already begun. Staples dropped the price of the 16GB and 32GB Nexus 7s to $179 and $199, respectively. Their website claims that this offer expires on July 13, but I’d imagine that the deal will run until they can clear out whatever stock they have left. With the new Nexus 7 potentially launching on July 30 (though nothing is ever solid with Google), the sooner they can get rid of these the better. But keep in mind, should you now be considering a purchase of one of these, that the new version will be an upgrade. It’ll likely sport a Snapdragon S4 Pro processor, better display, 4G LTE radios and rear camera.

At the moment 2.3GHz is currently the limit 28nm and Snapdragon 800 and Tegra 4i (Grey) that is set to come in late 2013 or early 2014 both stop at this magical clock. In order to surpass this number there is a big indication that companies will have to go for a smaller manufacturing node such as 20nm. At 20nm TSMC promises 30 percent higher speed and 1.9 times better density at 25 percent less power. The 30 percent faster will get ARM SoCs to around 3GHz with significantly more transistors that will mostly be spent on graphics. This is most likely how Nvidia plans to put the Kepler core on a Logan processor but we don’t have this confirmed, it just makes sense. The 25 percent reduction in power consumption can be translated into a 25 percent better battery life boost with next generation SoCs. Since poor battery life is still one of the top complaints when it comes to smartphones, consumers should look forward to 20nm. This will make the ARM alliance more competitive and ready to face the x86 threat coming from Intel and AMD, especially in the tablet and convertible space, but we are confident that Intel is not sleeping. If all goes well toward the end of 2014 Intel is going to get to 14nm Atoms, and AMD has a chance to get to the same transistor size with GlobalFoundries that has promised 14nm in the 2014.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1373312081596</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-08 15:34:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373315839010-22</Id><Title>Intel's triple whammy today: Evercore says SELL, Citi sees further PC slump, Berstein ponders Capex</Title><Msg>SOURCE: Barrons today This is a very length article, quoting the original analyses extensively.
