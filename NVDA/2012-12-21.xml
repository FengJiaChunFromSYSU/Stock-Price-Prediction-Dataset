"Am I missing something?" What you're missing is the amount of money "someone" is spending on the paid nvidia pumper crew. It's probably unprecedented. 24/7 there is always some paid pumper here expounding upon the purported virtues of their employer. Nonstop "sunbeams" about nvidia this or nvidia that. Those "so many positive articles" don't post themselves, you know. Oh no no no. It's the nvidia paid pumper crew doing what they are paid to do. Posting hype to make the company APPEAR to be doing better than it really is. Have you noticed the total disconnect between the stories posted here, and the actual quarterly results? The paid pumper's stories here give the impression that "Everything's Fine." "Just Fine, boys." And then the quarterly results come out, -- along with Jen's (-15%) reduction in guidance -- and the Reality hits. BA BOOM !!! Thing really weren't going so fine after all. But you'd never know it from the paid propaganda stories posted on This board. I have a theory that one of the reasons that nvda has such a high beta (1.81), and is such a volatile stock -- is because of the paid propaganda campaign. And the total disconnect it creates with the Reality of nvidia's struggling situation. And that what you read here -- continual "sunbeams" about nvidia -- isn't what you're gonna get in terms of anticipated future stock performance.</Msg><Username>in_best_we_trust</Username><Timestamp>1356134246203</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-21 18:57:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>17</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356136312739-27</Id><Topic><Title>Everybody [many at least] speaks so well of this company.. but the stock does nothing</Title><Username>karppharm</Username><Timestamp>1356126674851</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-21 16:51:14 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I've seen it once before.

The paid nvidia pumper crew for which "someone" is paying, is the modern day, digital equivalent of the carnival barking snail oil salesmen of earlier times. "Step right up boys, and see how our fine, specially formulated elixir can cure whatever ails you." When in fact, the product is totally useless. But the future Hopes, Dreams, and Anticipation that their hype created got folks to part with their hard-earned cash. So it is with the paid nvidia pumper boys. Much of the hype that they post here is exactly that -- baseless, unfounded, never-gonna-happen Lies. Like that old hype about their precious Tegra winning the Apple iPad/iPhones. For YEARS they were hyping right here on this very board that the nvidia Tegra would/could/should/might or was rumored to win the mobile Apple processor slot. Years of baseless, unfounded, never-gonna-happen Hype. And many readers here were probably suckered into buying nvda because of their hype. Hoping and Dreaming and Anticipating that the pumper boy's carnival barking would come true. But the Reality was quite different. Oh so different. Apple bought not one, but Two, semiconductor design firms, designed their own superior ARM chips -- and went into the business of making their own chips. Apple will make Two Hundred Million (200,000,000) self-designed and self-manufactured A6 processors -- just this year alone (versus just 30 million tegras sold in 2012). And Apple won't buy even one (1) tegra chip like the pumper boys were hyping. Right here on this very board. Did I mention? The paid nvidia pumper crew for which "someone" is paying, is the modern day, digital equivalent of the carnival barking snail oil salesmen of earlier times. Trying to get folks to part with their hard-earned cash. And to buy nvda -- their employer's stock.</Msg><Username>agreed.best</Username><Timestamp>1356139329001</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-21 20:22:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356144497907-29</Id><Title>10 inch tablets cannibalized by 7 inch tablets and laptop convertibles.</Title><Msg>tegra4 is a power hungry beast that won't run windows well.
