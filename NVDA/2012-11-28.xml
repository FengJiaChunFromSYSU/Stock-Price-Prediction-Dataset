Why aren't company stock buy-backs reported to the SEC on S-4 Forms? And disclosed like the next day? They really should be, you know. Just like any other insider trades in the company's stock. It's the same thing really. But rather than the "insider" trading his own stock -- he's trading on behalf of the company. With the shareholder's own cash. To make the stock price look better than it otherwise would be. Kinda like the Wizard of the Wizard of Oz. Behind the curtain pulling those levers and making impressive flames and this and that. Disclosing company stock buy-back transactions on Form S-4. Best, you should write to the SEC today about that superb idea.

There is a dividend and buyback to show confidence in the future AND to increase shareholder value. If you can't see that, then maybe you need to take a class somewhere on basic arithmetic. The buyback clearly increases shareholder value and the dividend draws in the larger funds to make a long-term investment so the stock price stabilizes with anticipated growth. What you describe is a one time gift to appease investors fears in the short-term.

A few excerpts. "Qualcomm launched its range of Snapdragon S4 processors equipped with AMD’s mobile Radeon graphics earlier this year. Though its adoption is still in progress, benchmarks reveal that high-end Snapdragon S4 processors BEAT Nvidia’s Tegra 3 in terms of graphical performance BY A SIGNIFICANT MARGIN. Below are the benchmarks. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- GL Benchmark 2.5 Eqypt HD (Offseceen 1080p) Frames per Second - Higher is Better 29 __ Qualcomm S4 Pro/Adreno 320 2.5 GHz quad core processor 9 ___ nvidia tegra 3 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- GL Benchmark 2.5 Eqypt Classic (Offseceen 1080p) Frames per Second - Higher is Better 78.2 __ Qualcomm S4 Pro/Adreno 320 2.5 GHz quad core processor 34.0 __ nvidia tegra 3 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- From the benchmarks, it seems that the market for high end gaming processors, at least performance-wise, Undeniably belongs to Qualcomm. Though smartphone manufacturer’s had a weaker quarter, Qualcomm reported stellar financial results. In my opinion, this run will continue as the demand for smartphones is increasing at a rapid rate, especially in India and China. The adoption of Qualcomm’s S4 is still in progress. The company is set to release Snapdragon S4 "Prime" processors in 2013. Though its GPU would be Adreno 320, the clock of the quad core processor would be stepped up from the current 1.7 GHz to 2.5 GHz. Nvidia is due to release its Tegra 4 processors in 2013, which would boast of a maximum clock of 2 Ghz, which is still lower than S4 Prime’s 2.5Ghz. In my opinion, Qualcomm is a great stock to hold, not because my smartphone also has a Snapdragon S4 chip, but because of its growth prospects." Wow! The nvidia Tegra #3 is clearly finished, competitively speaking. And it looks like the nvidia Tegra #4 is already D.O.A. -- Months before its release.</Msg><Username>i_read_best</Username><Timestamp>1354149955794</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 19:45:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354151046386-36</Id><Topic><Title>Sell AMD, NVDA and buy QCOM.

When the nvidia Board of Directors finally pulls-the-plug on Jen's hugely unprofitable, uncompetitive and perpetually late-to-market Tegra folly, will they get rid of Jen at the same time? Or let him suffer a Huge Hit to his Ego for several months before pink-slipping him. Nothing can bring back the Billions wasted on Jen's Tegra folly, of course. But watching Jen's public punishment by the investing community -- Priceless!</Msg><Username>ask.best</Username><Timestamp>1354151046386</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 20:04:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354152996676-37</Id><Topic><Title>Why did NVDA announce a dividend when a "special one time cash dividend would have been better for shareholders?</Title><Username>opseaime</Username><Timestamp>1354130082142</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 14:14:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Please "appease" us. After 19 long dividend-less years, we shareholders deserve more than a stinkin' $00.075 dividend per share. Four Bucks ($4.00) one-time, before year-end, please.

The pumper boy's highly naïve solution to Everything is the "Intel payment". But how many times can they spend the same Intel payment? Hummm? Look boys. The cold, cruel Reality is that Intel's LAST annual payment of $300 million is coming up really quick. January 15, 2013 to be exact. Then there's only three (3) little annual payments of just $200 million left. January 15, 2014 / January 15, 2015 / and January 15, 2016. And then Intel is Done paying nvidia for their IP -- Forever. Now, the other Inconvenient Fact is that the Tegra/Consuming Profits Business is on track to lose MORE than the entire Intel payment of $300 million. Yes, it will likely lose MORE, boys. For the Nine Months Ending October 28, 2012, the Tegra/Consuming Profits Division did in Fact lose ($233,545,000). That's nearly a Quarter of a Million Dollars -- in just 9 months. And annualizing that is what? ($311,393,000) Which is MORE than the aforementioned last $300 million payment from Intel. Is that not correct, decepticon j7777kxx? Speak up now, boy. Of course it is. So nvidia has Already spent the entire last Intel IP payment of $300 million. -- and then some -- on the Jen's horrendous loss-making Tegra folly. And keep in mind that thereafter the Intel payment falls to just $200 million per year. So in conclusion, the immutable Facts are: 1.) The Tegra/Consuming Profits Business is on track to lose MORE than the entire last Intel IP payment of $300 million, and, 2.) You can't spend the same Intel money more than once, boys. "Besides Intel has the Nvidia IP that they are paying for and Nvidia is providing our dividend from", writes j7777kxx, deceivingly.</Msg><Username>epic.best</Username><Timestamp>1354156295442</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 21:31:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354157426961-39</Id><Topic><Title>AMD Plans to Sell 58 Acre Austin Site and Lease Back to raise Cash</Title><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1354065469624</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 20:17:49 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So sorry for the typo.
