First, there is only one homepage – but move left and you’ll find a very handy settings screen, where you can toggle on features such as Wi-Fi and fiddle with your profile. Drag to the right and you’ll see you are able to add more pages where you can install widgets and apps. Far better than having five pages already full of stuff you don’t want, which then has to be deleted. Motorola has also added its Circles widget, which lets you know how the weather’s doing, what the time is – and if you have any notifications. Flip up the circles and more information is available – for instance, the notifications circle reveals a battery life indicator. The digital clock can be flipped to show an old-style analogue clock face. It’s a simple idea but quite addictive. Powerful performance Under the hood sits an Intel’s Atom chip, which may not be as powerful as the quad-core models found in the likes of the HTC One X and the Tegra 3, but is nonetheless good enough to run all the latest intensive games such as Dead Trigger. It suffered no stuttering or any other problems – and Android ran as smooth as smooth can be. If you’re a real games fan, you may prefer to look towards these other handsets, with their quad-core chips and bigger displays. When you want to take a photo, just hit the dedicated shutter key – which sits on the right-hand edge of the handset – and it will fire up the camera, even from sleep mode or another app. Press it again to take your shot – the shutter does suffer from some lag and it takes around a second to fire. Again, the Samsung Galaxy S III and HTC One X are faster. The user interface is really cool and keeps the features out of the way until needed. One of the best is the multi-shot burst mode, which snaps up to 10 images a second – the two rivals we’ve already mentioned, the HTC One X and Galaxy S II, can only manage three or four. We used it to take shots of a water spray and a speeding car – the results were amazing. Flicking through them was akin to watching a film. But you still have that second of shutter lag, which could lead to you missing out on the moment. Images came out well, and looked sharp when we looked at them on a bigger screen. Colours are lifelike, although not that bold, and in low-light situations our images were impressively bright, although there was some blur or graininess. The bright LED flash helps a lot, and manages not to overexpose everything. Battery life is also impressive – Motorola says it offers 40% more life than you get from a single charge on the iPhone 5 – and indeed we used the phone for two days’ worth of texting, emailing, a few calls and some basic app play. With more power-hungry tasks such as streaming films, taking snaps and playing with apps, we managed just over a day. Streaming video will drain the battery in eight hours, which is still pretty decent. Our conclusion This is one of the best Motorola smartphones we’ve seen. It combines a stylish design with a sharp wide display and Intel power. It’s simple to use and should suit web browsers, media fans and gamers – plus it has great battery life. The snapper is feature-packed and offers a great burst mode – only that delayed shutter time lets it down a tad.</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1348857647550</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 14:40:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348858147122-44</Id><Topic><Title>will those 13 puts be in play, ask the algorithm?</Title><Username>smallstock1</Username><Timestamp>1348857283626</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 14:34:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>maybe, but just enough to clear a hurdle</Msg><Username>smallstock1</Username><Timestamp>1348858147122</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 14:49:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348858875046-45</Id><Topic><Title>Intel's Clover View makes Tegra 3 Windows RT Surface tablet DOA</Title><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1348823221662</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 05:07:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>They finally got Atom to be a proper mobile processor, how many years of trying ? lol Shame for Intel in the same time Apple developed a powerful PC class ARM processor so there's hope for Project Denver yet ! ;-)</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1348858875046</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 15:01:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348861456817-46</Id><Topic><Title>GOING RED!

It does perform slightly better than the same GPU on the TI OMAP chipset of the RAZR MAXX thanks to the 32nm process, which allows for higher clock speed, but the gain is minimal and can’t come anywhere near the performance of more modern GPUs. "In the end, we’d probably go for a Motorola RAZR M over the RAZR i – it has the same design and excellent build quality, but the Snapdragon S4 chipset brings high-end performance, while Intel’s Atom still has some way to go."
