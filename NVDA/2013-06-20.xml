Those who pre-ordered the Shield will be charged the new, lower price when the product ships. Microsoft, meanwhile, said Wednesday it would reverse some unpopular policies it recently announced for its coming Xbox One videogame console. The company said it would no longer require its Xbox to connect to the Internet each day, nor would it restrict how its videogame discs are traded, resold or rented. __ Peddie also said that Shield is intended as a proof of concept - not at a loss - as well as a "peripheral for cloud streaming".

"Pure Speculation: I'd like to take a minute just to speculate. Let's say that Apple does make the switch back to AMD graphics for the entire Mac lineup. Where's the evidence? Well there is no evidence per se, but conjecture (and lots of it): Many were suspecting a MacBook Pro refresh at Apple's recently held WWDC; we didn't get one. There's really no reason why Apple shouldn't have announced a refreshed MacBook Pro except for one: production bottlenecks. One component of particular interest is the display; it's very well possible that Apple had production issues with the high-end display that goes into the MacBook Pro with Retina Display. That is the most logical explanation, but it may not be the only. What if Apple is waiting for a certain chipmaker, who's taking on the very difficult task of restructuring, to supply components? AMD, after all, has a great deal on its plate at the moment (as you'll see in the next section), which could be a possible explanation of the delay in the announcement of the next-generation MacBook Pro family. Again, this is all conjecture, though logical in my mind. So, on the off chance that this is the case, what would that mean for AMD? Well, going along with the theme of market share, it would simply mean more market share. This is crucial for AMD right now, and while winning back Cupertino's love wouldn't significantly help the company's bottom line, it serves as an indicator of AMD's competitive viability." source: seeking alpha</Msg><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1371760052267</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-20 16:27:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371766259147-40</Id><Title>AMD and Nvidia should merge, become a graphics giant.</Title><Msg>with a monopoly on gaming.</Msg><Username>will_amd_yu</Username><Timestamp>1371766259147</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-20 18:10:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371769138005-41</Id><Topic><Title>AMD and Nvidia should merge, become a graphics giant.</Title><Username>will_amd_yu</Username><Timestamp>1371766259147</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-20 18:10:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You should merge with XC and become a monopoly on BLATHER!</Msg><Username>chitownbarber25</Username><Timestamp>1371769138005</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-20 18:58:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371769620212-42</Id><Topic><Title>AMD and Nvidia should merge, become a graphics giant.</Title><Username>will_amd_yu</Username><Timestamp>1371766259147</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-20 18:10:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>AMD loser...

He's still not going to even think about raising the fed funds rate until like 2015...if the 10 year goes to even 3 percent, that is still historically low and mortage rates in the mid 4 to 5 range aren't exactly a bad deal either. The traders will benefit from the volatility but for those of us with a longer horizon, the general trend is still up. things are getting slightly better each quarter and corporate profits remain healthy. god forbid our government actual passes legislation to fix the problems we have. if there was any progress in Washington at all, things would already be a lot better. for those that bought today, they are getting a great deal as I see no reason why we will not rally back to the mid 15's on the good rebound days. I also think they were smart to sacrifice a little profit margin on shield to sell more units. its about establishing the platform and then having others follow. if they can get developers to build specifically for tegra, it gives them a market differentiator over qualcom because they have not gamer relationship...hell they can't even get drivers for windows to work right. I think the second half of the year is going to be great for NVidia. lots of irons in the fire.</Msg><Username>neo_trinity1020</Username><Timestamp>1371781195446</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-20 22:19:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371782401971-47</Id><Topic><Title>AMD and Nvidia should merge, become a graphics giant.</Title><Username>will_amd_yu</Username><Timestamp>1371766259147</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-20 18:10:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Jensen could become CEO of the giant graphics company.
