Despite releasing an entirely new operating system on October 22 of this year, WindowsPC sales shrank 21 percent between 10/21 and 11/17 versus the same period last year. Windows 8 tablet sales during that period were "almost nonexistent" – just 1 percent of all Windows 8 sales. “It hasn’t made the market any worse, but it hasn’t stimulated things either,” Stephen Baker, an analyst at NPD, told The New York Times. “It hasn’t provided the impetus to sales everybody hoped for.” No kidding. Yesterday, we reported other bad news: Asus CFO David Chang's comment that "demand for Windows 8 is not that good right now." Microsoft cut its order of Surface tablets for the year to two million units, down from four million. This is a very scary time for Microsoft. Google it, boys : The Windows 8 Sales Data Is In, And It's Bad News For Microsoft Business Insider Remember when current CEO Jen was carnival barking about the new Windows 8 RT being THE best thing ever for nvidia? Looks like current CEO Jen was wrong. Again. "Windows RT was a bad mistake by MSFT."

This is basically PC business. System builders like Apple, Dell, Acer etc. are selling lower end PC's (volume) with integrated Intel or, AMD graphics. This is the volume business. For higher end solutions where faster video solutions are required, System builders are still using Nvidia parts since integrated Intel solutions do not quite get there. This will surely change in future as Intel is increasing R&amp;D in GPU. All in all, NVDA can at best be flat on declining margins. Most likely headed south. - PSB: Revenue will be lumpy at best as Super Computer buildouts occur. Not really a growth business. High-end workstations are tied to global economy. - CPB: Tegra 3 has been moderate success. But QCOM will basically kill this business in 2013. Why? well I am sure informed people know this and I am not going to waste time listing all of them again. Tegra 4 will remain attractive for high-end Android tablets. Nvidia may end up picking some TXN accounts (e.g. Amazon Kindle). Tegra 4+LTE (Grey) will be showcased in some marquee superphone HTC designs but no volume wins. I hope CPB at least has positive margins (not clear) and that is a damning statement. If NVDA is losing money on each part sold then EPS will be terrible in 2013. All in all, I have come to realize that NVDA is fairly priced in at $12. There will be some spikes along the way as rumors etc. come to light. I do think, tax loss selling will drive NVDA stock lower next couple of weeks. And then a bounce come CES/Jan 2013. NVDA is a great trading stock but not one you can hold for a long time and expect meaningful appreciation. INTC and MRVL are my 2 favorites to accumulate on weakness. They represent solid leadership in their segments. I will wait for QCOM to correct before buying any more.</Msg><Username>o.investor</Username><Timestamp>1354373563339</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-01 09:52:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354373828740-6</Id><Topic><Title>Windows RT was a bad mistake by MSFT.
