Samsung already supplies NAND flash to several smartphone and tablet makers and now could find itself supplying next year's high-end smartphone and tablets with 128GB NAND modules. The company announced that it has started mass production of 128GB NAND modules using its 20nm process node. Samsung cited the module's ability to be used as embedded MMC (eMMC) Pro Class 1500 and joins existing 16GB, 32GB and 64GB products in the same performance class. According to the firm, the modules have sequential read and write bandwidths of 140MB/s and 50MB/s, respectively, and use the toggle DDR2 interface. Wanhoon Hong, executive VP of memory sales and marketing at Samsung Electronics said, "By doubling the highest density of its previous eMMC products, Samsung expects to contribute significantly to a timely release of leading-edge mobile devices. The higher data storage and faster data transmission, will bring a range of benefits to users that compare to those of ultra-slim notebook PCs." Samsung didn't say when devices using its 128GB NAND modules will appear, but given that it has gone into mass production now, next year's crop of smartphones and tablets, perhaps including the firm's own Galaxy S4 smartphone, could see onboard storage capacity increase to 128GB.</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1348066849399</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 11:00:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348068660417-8</Id><Topic><Title>now where's the pumper who said yesterday that nvda is not a good short?</Title><Username>whosunw</Username><Timestamp>1347910585029</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 15:36:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A true blue pussi.

Get ready to overlook some flaws. by Casey Johnston - Sept 18 2012, 6:50pm EDT Long story short, here is the conclusion from the detailed review article: "If you can look past that aspect, the Kindle Fire HD improves over the first Fire in many ways, and it's a capable device—sometimes slow on the uptake, sometimes choppy, by no means unusable. Unfortunately, good isn't good enough when the Nexus 7 is out there winning hearts and minds without unusual design elements like the carousel or an ever-present row of Things To Buy on the home screen. The Nexus 7 is also faster, has better battery life and a more robust app store, and has access to most of the same content—save the free streamable videos that come with an Amazon Prime account on the Kindle Fire HD. We were excited to see a worthy 7-inch tablet with the launch of the Nexus 7, and hoped to see some lively competition in the segment. With its vault of services underpinning the financial viability of a cheap tablet, Amazon is perfectly positioned to present such a competitor. Unfortunately, the 7-inch Kindle Fire HD isn't it."</Msg><Username>findingnemoyes</Username><Timestamp>1348102748464</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 20:59:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348110953049-21</Id><Topic><Title>Huge AH trade: a block of $1.7 million shares crossed at $1`3.788</Title><Username>ibexx88</Username><Timestamp>1348091998742</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 17:59:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>. ibbey is clearly small potatoes trader. That was no "after Hours trade of 1.7 million shares." Oh no no no. That has the tellltale signs of a VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price) trade being reported after the close of the normal trading session. By the looks of the straight line chart between 2:00 pm and 4:00 pm, one of the Elephant Institutional Fund Managers got back from lunch in the Walnut Dining Room -- the usual crab cakes with arugula salad paired with a fabulous Chardonnay -- and ordered his assistant Britney to lighten-up on $25M of nvidia. Without disrupting the Market or course -- 'cause he's got a lot more to sell. So Britney called IB and set-up a two hour VWAP sell trade. Which dutifully unloaded the stock throughout the prescribed window, and reported the 1,721,900 share trade after the close. The little clean-up trade of 21,200 nvda shares -- reported at exactly the same time and price -- is likely a residual trade resulting from expanding the trading window slightly, maybe 30 minutes or so. Here. You small potatoes traders can get yourself an education.
