Back in June the company did say that they would be releasing their new line-up, strange to see them actually hitting retail outlets on time. The announcement came during Computex 2013 where Toshiba announced the Toshiba eXcite Pro and the Toshiba eXcite Write Tegra 4 tablets which they had planned for release this month. The hardware for both tablets is pretty much identical but the eXcite Write is geared towards more of a business use with an additional suite of software that comes with the tablet. Toshiba eXcite Pro and Write hardware specs: - 1.8 GHz Tegra 4 chipset - 2 GB of RAM - 10.1" PixelPure display running at 2560x1600 resolution - Bluetooth Keyboard Cover - DTS and harman/kardon stereospeaker - 1.2MP front-facing camera with an 8MP rear-facing camera - Android 4.2 Both tablets also sport 32GB of storage as well with no 16GB option. So you only have these two options to choose from if you're planning on picking one of these up. As for pricing, both of these are a little up on scale in terms of pricing with the eXcite Pro coming in at $499 while the eXcite Write is commanding $599. Both are now available for purchase on Amazon and Best Buy.

The NVIDIA GeoInt Accelerator platform provides defense and homeland security analysts with tools that enable faster processing of high-resolution satellite imagery, facial recognition in surveillance video, combat mission planning using geographic information system (GIS) data, and object recognition in video collected by drones. It offers a complete solution consisting of an NVIDIA Tesla(R) GPU accelerated system, software applications for geospatial intelligence analysis, and advanced application development libraries. "Today's intelligence analyst needs information based on imagery, video, signals intelligence, human intelligence and other sources, in a geospatial context and 'at rate,'" said Nick Buck, CEO Buck Consulting Group and former IT executive with the NRO Ground Directorate. "The NVIDIA GeoInt Accelerator provides developers the opportunity to unleash the power of GPU computing to quickly combine the variety and volume of data sources at the speed needed for mission support, enabling new levels of performance with minimal investment."....... ___ PS: BIG DATA is the buzz word.

Now, it's backtracking, saying sales will be flat. Intel is hoping that sales of chips for servers, tablets and smartphones will compensate for the drop-off in PC sales. The downward revision of the company's outlook is an admission that Intel chips haven't made it into many mobile devices. The Santa Clara, Calif., chipmaker says revenue for the April to June period was $12.8 billion, just below analyst expectations at $12.9 billion and down 5 percent from last year." source: AP Net income was $2 billion, or 39 cents per share.

Revenue in the three months ended in June rose to $12.8 billion, yielding EPS of 39 cents. Analysts had been modeling $12.88 billion and 39 cents. The company saw revenue in its “PC Client Group,” which sells computer microprocessors, decline 7.5% from the year-earlier period, down 1.4% from the prior quarter, to $8.1 billion. The company’s “Data Center” division, which sells chips for server computers, networking equipment, and other gear, saw sales climb 6.1% to $2.7 billion. Gross margin in the quarter came in at 58.3%, up from 56.2% in the prior quarter. CEO Brian Krzanich remarked that “In the second quarter, we delivered on our quarterly outlook and made several key product announcements.” “In my first two months as CEO, I have listened to a wide variety of views about Intel and our industry from customers, employees and my leadership team and I am more confident than ever about our opportunity as a company.” For the current quarter, the company sees revenue in a range of $13 billion to $14 billion, which at the midpoint, $13.5 billion, is below the consensus for $13.73 billion. Gross margin is expected to rise to a range of 59% to 63%. The company sees revenue this year flat with last year, down from the prior view for low-single digit growth. The Street has been modeling revenue of $53.43 billion, up ever so slightly from last year’s $53.34 billion. On CNBC‘s “Closing Bell” this evening, CFO Stacy Smith told Amanda Drury and Bill Griffeth that the PC market will be transitioning and “transforming” later this year to converged devices that combine the best of laptop computers and tablet computers. He said that macro-economic issues are the chief concern to the company. ......... “What we’re seein</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1374095559962</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-17 17:12:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374095861066-49</Id><Title>Qualcomm UP 1.29% or 79 cent today to close at $62.64 while Nvidia closed DOWN.</Title><Msg>I know how much you like to track Qualcomm HERE on the Nvidia message board. lol imho</Msg><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1374095861066</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-17 17:17:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374096133000-50</Id><Title>Still hoping Intel Saves Nvidia's Sorry Rear?

Intel said it now expects to spend about $11 billion on factories and manufacturing equipment, trimming about $1 billion off its prior expectations. Stacy Rasgon, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, said the company's reduced sales forecast for the year and spending cut are signs Intel is being more realistic about its outlook. But he predicted Intel may have to make further revisions, given the weak environment. "I just wonder if it's enough," Mr. Rasgon said. Intel is betting that a new design for its flagship Core microprocessors called Haswell, which was formally introduced in June, will fuel the design of attractive new notebook computers and devices that convert from clamshell to tablet mode. Stacy Smith, Intel's chief financial officer, said Wednesday that more than 50 of such "two-in-one" models are now being designed. At the same time, Intel has high hopes for new version of its Atom design, dubbed Silvermont. Mr. Krzanich said chips based on that technology offer as little as one-fifth the power consumption at the same level of performance—extending battery life on mobile devices—or a threefold improvement in performance at the same power consumption.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1374100096869</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-17 18:28:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374102217299-56</Id><Title>Where are Nvidia's tegras anyway.

What about his attempt to BS this board claiming the author said the exact opposite of what he actually said regarding Ouya vs Xbox One and PS4? "not a real threat" What's the matter you can't stand to see that Nvidia PERMA PUMPER getting caught posting BS? And if it was pure BS wasn't it?

Barons titled: BRCM To Lose More Sockets to QCOM, Says Barclays; Risk Limited, Says FBR pumpers here are just like nvda, won't look long term at how the mobile market is develping, they just want to concentrate on 'one design win', however insignificant it might be, like the Asus Transformer. Not so for the FBR guy. Read his comment, and the mobile trend is clear. Here I will only quote the part regarding mobile trend, not brcm wifi competitive position: "Samsung has increasingly been utilizing fully integrated Broadcom platforms for its low-end smartphone SKUs. Therefore, we identify only a small portion (less than 20%) of Samsung’s SKUs, where a discrete 802.11n connectivity part would logically displace Broadcom." long term trend is clear, starting from the bottom up, this thing's going fully integrated solutions. Low end now, next year, mid-tier models too. And currently there are only 2 guys who can play integrated. Longer term, I have no doubt intel will elbow in, as they've been buying/accumulating cheap radios on the side. Guys like mediatek, nvda, spectrum, freescale, marvel need not apply. They ain't got enuf 'cheap' radios.</Msg><Username>whosunw</Username><Timestamp>1374111950944</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-17 21:45:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374112183923-72</Id><Topic><Title>Toshiba Excite Pro (Tegra 4) is available on Amazon and BestBuy, NOW</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1374104641867</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-17 19:44:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I've been playing around with tablets quite a bit.
