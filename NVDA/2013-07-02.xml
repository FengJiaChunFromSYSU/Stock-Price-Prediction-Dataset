Wrapping Up: Windows 8.1 (Blue) Makes RT Real ""In the end, Windows 8.1, which used to be called Windows Blue, makes Windows RT real and vastly more usable than it was in its .0 iteration. Nice thing about a software fix is my old Surface RT tablet will be automatically upgraded to 8.1 when it comes out and the upgrade, based on what I saw at Build, is pretty seamless. I’ve been playing with 8.1 on a Surface Pro tablet and there really is a lot to love here, but I love it far more on Surface RT.""</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1372739255444</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 00:27:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372771746058-2</Id><Title>Google makes preemptive strike</Title><Msg>Said it before.

The charges against the banks are another black eye for the multitrillion-dollar market for credit-default swaps, the derivatives that act as insurance against a debt default by a company or a government. These derivatives were blamed for accelerating the spread of the financial crisis after the collapse of Lehman Brothers Inc. in 2008 by allowing banks and other financial institutions to take on huge risks with little oversight from regulators. EU regulators say banks fought plans to trade swaps on exchanges because of potential hits to profits. Now, European authorities say the banks, including screwish Goldman Sachs Group Inc., screwish J.P. Morgan Chase JPM , and screwish Deutsche Bank AG, conspired to prevent trading from moving onto potentially less risky, more-transparent platforms, where their profits would be significantly lower.</Msg><Username>screwherbes</Username><Timestamp>1372777254521</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 11:00:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372777523848-11</Id><Topic><Title>Google makes preemptive strike</Title><Username>nvdarocks</Username><Timestamp>1372771746058</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 09:29:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I was thinking the same thing.....perhaps the reason for the delay?</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1372777523848</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 11:05:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372777748073-12</Id><Topic><Title>Google makes preemptive strike</Title><Username>nvdarocks</Username><Timestamp>1372771746058</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 09:29:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"I was thinking the same thing.....perhaps the reason for the delay?"

Nvidia's management knew delaying SHIELD for repairs would be embarrassing and they also knew shipping a BROKEN SHIELD would be even more embarrassing.
