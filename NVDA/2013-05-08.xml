Also, I'd imagine to get to these clock speeds, we'd need to see a move to 20nm, which implies that this is well over a year out. I would much rather see some wins for Tegra 4i, especially as Jensen implied that there was significant interest in it. That's the part that will drive volume, and that's what could push Tegra to breakeven/profitbility during 2014.</Msg><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1367996599170</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 03:03:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367997291865-5</Id><Topic><Title>Xiaomi Mi4 to be shipped with Tegra 5 Logan SoC</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1367983037510</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 23:17:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ashraf, the articles clearly stated that MI4 will be out after Q1 of 2014 whereas Tegra 4 gears are expected in H2 of 2013.

Tomasmann is right on the point (to me) about what is supposed to come this second half with Tegra 4 which is actually a shorter period then either 2 or 3 but is at least half a year before Tegra 5 'could' be coming out. Tegra 4i is aiming at the mid to lower priced smartphones, yes? And this phone model will be the top of the line in this company's products. At the same time, continuing to throw insults back and forth with the posters that are serious about the company and the industry doesn't really help anyone. Anyways, I like the news that there is more coming to push the envelope and cut into the edges of what has 'appeared' to be Qualcomm's domain. We still have a whole 6-8 months for Tegra 4 products to be released. (And continuing to complain that there isn't anything announced 'yet' doesn't really clarify or confirm anything.)</Msg><Username>roundhouse_c</Username><Timestamp>1367998034603</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 03:27:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367998536431-7</Id><Topic><Title>Xiaomi Mi4 to be shipped with Tegra 5 Logan SoC</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1367983037510</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 23:17:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>tomasmann, Personal attacks are always unbecoming and usually reflect a lack of substance in the actual argument. As an Nvidia investor, I want to ascertain the truth - whether it suits my investment or not. Nvidia is scheduled to see first devices with Tegra 4 around Q3 2013, and those will be tablets, perhaps superphones. The problem I have with the alleged "1Q 2014" expectations are numerous: 1. TSMC does not expect 20nm to be significant part of their revenues (they hit the 2% mark) until 2Q 2014, so it is unlikely that we see volume shipments of a 20nm part in 1Q 2014. 2. If this is the case, then Tegra 5 is a 28nm part, in which case I believe that a superior GPU *and* a higher clocked CPU are unlikely in thermally constrained designs. There may be efficiency gains to be had on the GPU side from moving to Kepler, but the higher clock on the already rather power hungry A15's without a process shrink seems implausible. 3. I am not "hired" by SA - I submit articles, they are reviewed, and then they are published.</Msg><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1367998536431</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 03:35:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367999077248-8</Id><Topic><Title>Xiaomi Mi4 to be shipped with Tegra 5 Logan SoC</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1367983037510</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 23:17:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>roundhouse_c, I have no doubt that Nvidia is perfectly capable of designing strong SoCs, and I suspect the modem will be quite good. From an investment perspective, for the Nvidia story, I quite frankly don't care about the high end apps processor market and am infinitely more excited by the Tegra 4i/"Grey" story. Qualcomm's dominance is predicated primarily on modem/integration leadership. If Nvidia's products are as good as claimed, then there will indeed be some share shifts in Nvidia's favor, and this would immediately verify Nvidia's "bet the company on Tegra" move. Once there are signs of profitability here, and signs of ramping to significant scale, I see no reason why Nvidia couldn't be a significantly larger company (by market capitalization) than it is today. But really, I own this stock because Jensen Huang is a superb CEO and will find a way to make money with what he's got. When you have the world's best graphics technology, that alone is probably worth more than the market capitalization of Nvidia. Worst case, Intel buys them and calls it a day. Best case, Nvidia becomes a $30B+ company. Anyway, that's it for my visit to these boards for now. I'm sure ibexx and moorelawyer will come out and spew more nonsense about how I'm a day trader/paper trader/don't own Nvidia, so I'd like to let that storm pass before coming back.</Msg><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1367999077248</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 03:44:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368018932194-9</Id><Topic><Title>Xiaomi Mi4 to be shipped with Tegra 5 Logan SoC</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1367983037510</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 23:17:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>don't think you have the brains the catch the drift - T5 is a clock-throttled T4 to cut down on power. now you get it/GET IT? as I had said, there is no top end merchant proc market.

I wish the T3 could be sold at $10 or less and still do 50% GM - if they can - that would be the new low end CPU. The mid ends would be the T4/T4i and T5 the high end - sounds like that it was the plan all along - recall how they talked about mid end products - and it begs the question - what's the high end one?? Now we know. Architecturally - I am not sure if the T5 CPUs can perform better than the T4 CPUs at the same node and same clock - if they can Logan with 1 Kepler SMX may be feasible in 28nm and the die size will be less than 115mm2 (which is more or less the size of the QCOM quad cores). The Kepler SMXs will not run at the full clock in 28nm, but even at 1/2 the performance it'll reach ~ 200 GFLOPS! and comes with all the good stuff DirectX11, CUDA etc. The other option is to have 2 Logan CPUs + Kepler + LTE in 28nm - pretty much what QC does all the time. 20nM - If you saw the big fanfare on Apple starting 20nm work with TSMC and the not too subtle hints that it would be risk production ready by Q3/Q4 2013 - it's not too outlandish to think Logan in 20nm would be shipping by 1Q2014. Life is Good! That new INTC CEO will have a 6 months honeymoon with Silvermont and the nightmare begins soon after - talk about #$%$ comparing a 22nm product to a 28nm one and not to mention the cost and die size of the 22nm part.</Msg><Username>ltenow</Username><Timestamp>1368034573701</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 13:36:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368034782884-23</Id><Topic><Title>XC: AMD Board Awaits You!</Title><Username>panacro</Username><Timestamp>1368034068175</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 13:27:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Its more fun here wtatching Nvidia fans with their heads stuck in between Jen's rear trouser pockets.

An additional comments about the marketing plans (as viewed by the public) of Tegra 4/5 chips and devices. --Tegra 4 tablets/smartphones and gaming devices - starting to ship end of Q2 of 2013, will continue into Q3 for the holiday seasons, serving the high-end market. --Tegra 4i phones will ship Q1 of 2014, serving the midrange and low-priced markets - the fastest growing and largest on the global basis. Sales into this segment will be a cash cow for NVIDIA for many months/years to come. --Tegra 5 based smartphones (ie. Xiaomi Mi4) will ship Q2 of 2014, serving a high-end, yet moderate-cost market. When Tegra 5 devices become available commercially, the Tegra 4 gears will be marketed in the mid-range mobile space. T4 and end products will co-exist (and overlap somewhat) with T5 and end products, just like Iphone 5,4,3 are on the market simultaneously, serving different customer bases. This is called smart product differentiation. A next-gen product does not replace or terminate the pre-gen product, as assumed by some half baked "analysts".</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1368041407612</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 15:30:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368041458105-34</Id><Topic><Title>Come clean AMD, Are you Pregnant?

We're RIGHT on the cusp of ANOTHER HUGE break out...and I do believe that the CC will be the catalyst for the first of the 10+% days that I think are coming. The stock hasn't been this high since last August, and ANY kind of upside "surprise" in earnings, guidance, release date for PS (and the price) will propel the stock well past 14 and likely to the 15-16 level. IF there is an "attempt" by the Bears to make it a "sell the news" event, I truly don't see ANY way the stock goes back below 13, for more than a few seconds, if at all. I'll have an order in to buy more, a few pennies below 13, and another order to buy just below 13 1/2. Given the way a lot of tech stocks have performed after BAD news (other than QCOM), I think the likely move is significantly higher. There still hasn't been much covering in the 13 and 14 calls for May or June. The OI is virtually the same that it was a week ago, which only adds to my conviction that we might see a 2 strike move higher, i.e. through 14 AND 15 and approaching 16, by the end of NEXT week. The after hours volume "might" be a tell..if it's several million shares either way, but Friday's volume will certainly be significant unless it somehow stays below 10mm. I would expect to see 12-15mm at a minimum, and other than an exogenous "geopolitical or market event", we're going to see this stock grind higher and higher. As always, we'll know in the fullness of time.

(4938), the Taipei-based maker of Apple Inc. (AAPL) devices, forecast its biggest drop in consumer-electronics revenue in six quarters as iPad Mini demand falls. Second-quarter revenue for the business, which also makes Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)’s Surface tablet, will drop 25 percent to 30 percent from the previous three months, Pegatron said today. That’s the most since a 37 percent decline in the fourth quarter of 2011. Pegatron, spun off from Asustek Computer Inc. (2357) in 2010, joins Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. (2317) in facing a decline in orders from its largest customer. Apple last month reported its first profit drop in a decade amid shrinking margins and competition from Samsung Electronics Co., and said it will start rolling out new products later this year. A decline in revenue from the iPad Mini “is more on demand, while price has been stable,” Pegatron Chief Executive Officer Jason Cheng said.... bloombergDOTcom/news/2013-05-08/falling-ipad-mini-demand-to-push-pegatron-electronics-sales-down.html</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1368071214555</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 23:46:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
