Will McDonald's be busy Friday? It's nvda Dividend Day you know.</Title><Msg>Friday is the day, boys. When Jen pays his first ever cash dividend. Yes boys, the One in Only cash dividend ever paid by nvidia in 19 years. The "Best little dividend", as it were. $00.075 per share. (Remember though, the ex-dividend date was November 20th, so the time has passed to try to buy-the-dividend. Like anyone would bother.) So what does it mean to a typical holder of 100 shares of nvda? Let's examine the issue, shall we? 100 nvda shares x $00.075 per share dividend = $7.50 Still with me, boys? Okay then. So what can the nvda shareholder do with that? Perhaps we should contemplate that over lunch, shall we? $2.90 __ One (1) Big Mac $1.50 __ One (1) Large McFries $1.50 __ One (1) Medium Strawberry McShake $1.20 __ One (1) Apple McPie $0.74 __ Applicable taxes (yours may vary) _____ $7.84 __ Total But but but, Best? Jen's dividend on 100 shares doesn't even buy the shareholder lunch at McDonald's! He's thirty four cents (-$.34) short. Can you believe it -- Jen can't even buy one McLunch for the hapless nvda shareholder. Frankly, I think this whole nvidia dividend fandango was just more carnival barking. "Step Right Up Boys -- Behold and Feast Your Eyes on Jen's Great New Dividend." But remember to bring some extra change. Or skip the Apple McPie.</Msg><Username>ask.best</Username><Timestamp>1355292051021</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-12 01:00:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>21</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355293329462-4</Id><Topic><Title>Will The New Launch of A Cheap IPhone Use Nvidia's Grey Processor?</Title><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1355184270224</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 19:04:30 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Apple is very unlikely to use an outside processor. They have established an internal team to design their own chips. More importantly, they have to write all of their own device drivers for iOS. Using an external SoC likely involves more work and risk writing the drivers than just tweaking an existing internal design. I don't see Apple buying Tegra chips. It's remotely possible they would buy an Icera modem, but that's just starting to be a viable part.</Msg><Username>watergatefive</Username><Timestamp>1355293329462</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-12 01:22:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355293432490-5</Id><Topic><Title>So Best?

What nvda and aapl and samsung do are just partial SoCs, as in NOT complete system. You need to think market segments, you are just thinking bleeding edge, think more bulk of the market entry level and feature phones, and think more about what that SoC can really be , a real 'system on a chip', last week at their analyst day, brcm finally spilled their beans on what they are doing. Their design wins at Samsung, who has a processor team just like aapl, are impressive. Their wireless presentation was full 2 hours long, but well worth the time listening to for any serious investor in this space. You will begin to get an appreciation of what a SoC really needs to be for anything less than the bleeding edge. Listen to another similar presentation from qcom and one would start to get the complete picture. nvda is hopelessly behind in doing this system integration game. the worst thing about what nvda is doing: in the bleeding edge that they are doing, they will never get into aapl or samsung, the two hottest name in mobile. Nvda cannot do the integration to get into anything less than the bleeding edge. Their accessible TAM in this space is way too small to justify the investments. As an example of how this integration game is in this space, qcom spent $3B just to get their hands on a 'cheap' wifi radio. $3B, about 8x of what nvda paid for Icera.</Msg><Username>whosunw</Username><Timestamp>1355321283977</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-12 09:08:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355322143544-8</Id><Topic><Title>So Best?

That sounds excellent." So, you thought that maybe they *weren't* working on Tegra4 and so that line added information for you? You could use the same logic you used above and say that Tegra4 is likely better than S4 and probably better than Samsung's current chips, too, so I guess that NVDA will rule the market some time towards the middle next year. Sounds excellent? Except that QCOM and Samsung aren't standing still. The comparison is "excellent" as a cheerleading line but it is not relevant. "LOL. More x86 chips? Sure. Where are their homes? They have proven non-competitive for mobile." x86 chips that weren't well-optimized for mobile weren't competitive, and no one was so impressed by "Intel Inside" to pay a premium for poor chips. Nice try on INTC's part, but not surprised it failed. But now Medfield takes them from a non-player straight into the same league as current ARM products. Note that the best the article can muster is "no edge" on the competition. So, they get into the same league after years of futility but they don't yet have the edge. Okay. Still, if they can go from also-ran to merely having "no edge" in a single design cycle, I would be a little worried about what their next design cycle will do to ARM, if I was an ARM fan. Personally, I hold NVDA and INTC. I don't kid myself, though. The mobile market is too fractured right now and INTC is likely going to take a chunk out of it. Samsung and Apple do their own chips, which leaves a small market to everyone else. Tegra3 was good, but NVDA needs to make an even bigger splash with Tegra4 or they may not get a shot a Tegra5. TXN didn't drop out of the race because they got bored, after all.</Msg><Username>panacro</Username><Timestamp>1355362653942</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-12 20:37:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355366427413-29</Id><Topic><Title>Barrons/Nomura: Intel Medfield does not have edge on Snapdragon or other ARM based SoC</Title><Username>ibexx88</Username><Timestamp>1355338846339</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-12 14:00:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Medfeld is a 6 year old single core ATOM on a 32nm process, whereas SnapDragon S4 is a dual-core "better than A15 design" 28nm process.
