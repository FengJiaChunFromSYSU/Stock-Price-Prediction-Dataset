The Transformer Pad TF300TL combines a 10.1-inch 1280 x 800 display and a quad-core Tegra 3 processor by NVIDIA with 4G LTE connectivity. In the United States, LTE data plans could be acquired through AT&amp;T. Inveterate mobile internet users will likely appreciate the inclusion of high-speed internet capabilities, while productivity-oriented consumers will appreciate the Transformer Pad TF300TL compatibility with the Transformer Pad line’s trademark mobile dock accessory. An 8-megapixel rear camera and a 1.2-megapixel front camera, a microSD card slot and micro-HDMI port round out the device’s major features. The tablet comes out of the box with Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich, but an update to Android 4.1 Jelly Bean has been promised. Asus has been pretty good about its firmware updates, so potential buyers may have no cause to worry.

The mobile dock with keyboard and an extended battery would cost $149. Asus claims that the tablet’s internal battery is good for nine hours of usage; using the extended battery will add over 50 percent endurance, giving the device a 14-hour battery life rating. One of the Transformer Pad TF300TL’s main claims to fame is its combination of a quad-core processor and 4G LTE connectivity. The vast majority of such devices choose to use dual-core chipsets due to battery life and chassis size issues, but we could be nearing the tipping point where a growing number of LTE-compatible devices are now powered by quad-core silicon.</Msg><Username>findingnemoyes</Username><Timestamp>1349154616918</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 01:10:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349154689221-6</Id><Title>Samsung's Galaxy Tab 10.1 gets green light in the US</Title><Msg>Judge dissolves U.S. ban on Samsung's Galaxy Tab 10.1...

Samsung says it filed the motion Monday with the California court, alleging that Apple's new phone infringes on eight of its patents. The two companies are locked in a struggle for supremacy in the global smartphone market, leading to legal cases in courts across the globe. Samsung released a statement Tuesday saying, "We have always preferred to compete in the marketplace with our innovative products, rather than in courtrooms. However, Apple continues to take aggressive legal measures that will limit market competition." It said it had "little choice but to take the steps necessary to protect our innovations and intellectual property rights."</Msg><Username>findingnemoyes</Username><Timestamp>1349154869098</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 01:14:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349157300989-8</Id><Topic><Title>Samsung's Galaxy Tab 10.1 gets green light in the US</Title><Username>daysofshred30000000000</Username><Timestamp>1349154689221</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 01:11:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Not so fast, boys.
