Let's say that the S&amp;P 500 was just one stock. Rather than the average of 500 different Good Stocks. With the S&amp;P 500 hitting a new Five (5) year high, by definition, there are no bagholders. Nope. None. It would be a bagholder-free stock. 'Cause EVERYBODY that bought the stock in the past 5 years would be in-the-money. And EVERYBODY could freely -- and profitably -- sell anytime they wanted. Anytime. Compare that to nvidia, which is now selling for Less than Half of it's Five (5) year high of $26.85 So many many bagholders here who would like to unload their nvidia -- but just can't afford to take the Loss. So many many bagholders. All those folks that bought nvidia at, $26.00 $25.00 $24.00 $23.00 $22.00 $21.00 $20.00 $19.00 $18.00 $17.00 Mister $16.01 with xx,xxx nvidia shares. $15.00 $14.00 $13.00 None of those folks have the Freedom to sell their nvidia at any time they want, without taking a BIG LOSS. And they don't like it. Nope. Not one damn bit. So the only thing they can do is come to the Yahoo! Finance nvda message board, and try their hand at talkin' the stock back to close to where they overpaid for it. Which explains why this board has so many desperate posters. Well, okay. One particularly desperate bagholder here also posts over on the seeking.alpha board. But the message is always the same. "PLEASE PLEASE BUY NVIDIA" -- so they can finally unload their bad stock on you.</Msg><Username>good_point_best</Username><Timestamp>1359179302598</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 00:48:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>14</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359208976502-2</Id><Topic><Title>S&amp;P closes above 1500 for the first time in five years...</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1359151436882</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 17:03:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"So while the S&amp;P 500 Index is setting new Five (5) Year highs, your precious nvidia is trading at Less than Half of it's comparable high.

The family of ARMv8-compatible cores includes Cortex-A53 designed for low-power use cases and Cortex-A57 designed for performance-hungry applications. Qualcomm is at least the eighth company now known to be working on ARM server SoCs. Others with announced or known plans include AMD, Applied Micro, Cavium, Calxeda, Marvell, Nvidia and Samsung. It is expected that the first generation of 64-bit chips with ARMv8 architecture for serverswill emerge in 2014.""</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1359225743999</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 13:42:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>13</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359229747071-5</Id><Title>If ARM cannot design a chip thats lower power than Intel, what good are their</Title><Msg>server chips with less performance than ATOM.

Once it was all about new products, guesses about new products, and articles in the "Tech Press" about the same looking for those ever elusive clicks. Today, NADA absolutely nothing leaking. At CES Nvidia announces a gaming console or portable gaming thing...take your pick and nary a leak appears in the "Tech Press". What has happened? This is serious for those that make their living off Google Adsense. Plus AMD appears to have gone to the mattresses and no new generation GPU cards to write about while we eagerly wait for Nvidia's response...you remember don't you about all the one hand but on the other hand articles. Commentators bitxxxxx about what the gamers have to pay Nvidia and why doesn't Nvidia make Physics open source...etc. etc. Now those same gamers are on the Android gamer websites...still saying the same thing about Nvidia but in a slightly different tone. I'll never pay $400 for the shield and why don't they open it up for those of us that own AMD cards...etc. etc. It's so bad that Charlie on SemiAccurate had to go on a subscription basis to make any money...LOL So what caused this... I can only guess, but Nvidia said what the heck. I'm tired of this Crxx and we'll just talk to people at the appropriate venue's..i.e. CES, MWC, GTC, E3 gamer, etc. But where are we going to get the nect rumor about a smart phone with Tegra 4? How are we going to get the volatility back in this stock, so we can write call and sell put options to make a living. I know, perhaps we can make a product placement with those BOZO's on CNBC. We got to get the volatility back!!!! In the meantime all we got is the old fashioned way.....Earnings and guidance. Good luck all longs. I for one am supremely confident that earnings will beat substantially and guidance will be decent.Of course "decent is in the eye of the beholder of course". Watch those analyst earnings estimates...they are rising...check yahoo finance.

"NVidia is top heavy... especially on the Tegra team !!! Vice-President is an entry level position on the Tegra team..." You have heard of grade inflation I'm sure. Well the same thing happened in the Semiconductor industry. Started in the 90's. There are only so many qualified semiconductor people to go around, so companies came up with the idea when recruiting to ask just what title you would like to have. No more responsibility of course or for that matter money, but it does really look good on the resume you know. Well once at a company that I know, the Chief Technical Officer became so incensed about it what was happening during a massive expansion that he went and screamed to high heaven to HR. True story....HR tried to placate by explaining to him the reasoning and how it didn't cost the company anymore money and how helped morale. Well this guy wouldn't have any of it and threatened to quit if the policy wasn't changed. Quickly the CEO was brought into the discussion because this guy was really extremely valuable...much more so than any new hire. The CEO said "OK what can we do to make this right?" The Chief Technical Officer said "If the company is making people Directors when they don't have any people working for them and the company is making people Vice Presidents when they don't have any profit and loss then GDdXXX it I want my title changed to drumroll please.... "Emperor of the Universe". Long story short the company made the change and he proudly walked around and gave everyone he could his fancy business card saying he was "Emperor of The Universe" ________ Corporation at the next company TGIF as he and the CEO got wasted laughing continuously about it.</Msg><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1359250120218</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 20:28:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359253329238-17</Id><Title>So where's the Tegra #4 orders?</Title><Msg>It's been a month already.
