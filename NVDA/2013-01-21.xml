Be kind to squire ashraf.eassa. I like the guy. Seriously. Now granted, his lame, unschooled attempt at securities analysis is laughable -- but the engineering student has found a way to pay the rent, right? That shows creativity and drive. As you may know Best's first job out of school was that of a Real securities analyst. So here's a few of pointers. 1. Don't go into securities analysis. Unless of course, you Like endless chicken and peas luncheons, and four airports, four planes and four limos per week. 2. So your piece hyping the merits of nvidia Bombed the very next day, right?. When the stock Plunged like (-5%) immediately After your piece came out. Do not -- I repeat Do Not -- write the following day "What the Heck Happened?" It lacks, well, conviction in your own opinion. 3. Give your readers New and Original research. Not a badly slanted re-hashing of what they already know. Like ibbey does. Read the weekly JP Morgan newsletter for High Net Worth Clients to see how the best-of-the-best do it. 4. Finally, skip the securities analysis business completely -- and go into the cutting edge of semiconductor engineering -- research into human brain processing. You know. Like QUALCOMM's Chairman Paul Jacob's kid is doing. Good luck and all the Best to you.

But what has me very interested is why you seem to completely ignore any positives surrounding the company. For example, as someone who is a Best-Of-The-Best securities analyst, surely you know that the company is doing quite well in the high margin segments of the market (discrete GPU, HPC accelerators, workstation graphics). While workstation graphics seems to not be doing so well in the near term, do you not envision an uptick in demand when the cards in the series are refreshed? Further, if you paid attention to past conference calls, like a best-of-the-best securities analyst, you would know that Tegra SoCs are actually higher margin than GPUs on average. This means that once Nvidia can ramp the Tegras to the right revenue level, it will be quite positive for the top AND bottom lines. I realize you think poorly of Jen Hsun Huang as a CEO, but do you honestly mean to tell me that this company really doesn't have the growth potential that the longs do?

Best creature canâ€™t help but take personal potshots and the usual prattle with little behind it, while someone at least willing to use his real persona stays emotionally uninvolved and points out some legitimate issues. You know Bestie, the worst and I mean WORST thing an investor can do is be too emotional. From your MANY MANY posts it is clear you have become well too emotional. A few here have posted that Bestie lost a boat load on RMBS and now spends his days posting his creepy myriad sock puppet posts here and a few other places in order to soothe his wrecked ego. I think ashraf is asking, and I am seconding, Bestie it is time to come clean: Just what is your story for real? If you continue to not answer this question head-on then many will just keep putting you on ignore and that certainly does not help your 'cause' eh? A few like he and I will give you a chance because you amuse us, you know like a clown, but if you donâ€™t give up the real story now, you will lose us tooâ€¦ then it will be just you reading you-- a sordid boon. And clearly not what you want or 'need.'

Qualcomm is definitely a better place to be than Apple, and I think there's more room to run on that stock. However, I like Nvidia better simply because of the much richer upside potential that it has.
