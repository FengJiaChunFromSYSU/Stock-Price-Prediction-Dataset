Yes, Wasted, boys. Yet "somebody" spends a Lot of money on the paid nvidia pumper crew. Which hype the "virtues" of the horrendously loss-making tegra 24/7. To make the CEO's tegra folly sound, well, not so bad. When clearly the numbers on page 28 of the SEC-filed 10-Q for the Nine Months ending October 28, 2012 show that the tegra losses are Really Really Really Bad. Horrendessly Bad, actually. Like, on pace to Lose about ($311,000,000.00) this year. ($311,000,000.00) That's what the Jen's tegra folly is likely to lose -- just this year alone. And 2013 could be even worse. With the Tegra attempt #4 launching WITHOUT any on-board LTE modem radio. In a market filled with ARM chips having integrated LTE modem radios.</Msg><Username>bestogram</Username><Timestamp>1356272686683</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 09:24:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356275983128-5</Id><Topic><Title>(((AMD is a better investment than Intel or Nvidia)))</Title><Username>keeperoftheq</Username><Timestamp>1356041521016</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-20 17:12:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>AMD's mkt cap is lower than INtel's quarterly revenue...</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1356275983128</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 10:19:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356297094270-6</Id><Title>Tegra 4 - what is different this time?</Title><Msg>Hi, I've just went through a couple of articles about Tegra 4. Although I understand longs are happy about the chip (based on leaked information), honestly, where is the major difference from Tegra 3? Yes, I understand it's built using 28nm process, supports dual channel memory and involves a lot more graphic cores, but is it enough? What makes you think it will help Tegra business to swing to black numbers? For me, the only one way to success leads through mobile phones. When it comes to tables, even Tegra 3 was quite successful. All of the devices like Nexus 7, Surface or Asus Transformers are really cool and sell pretty well. On the other hand, HTC One X (and its "plus" successor) was the only one reasonable mobile phone based on Tegra 3 (I don't count local rubbish made in china). So in other words, what makes Tegra 4 more attractive for manufacturers of tablets or mobile phones? It there any game-changer feature? I can't see anything at the moment. (Please best, don't bother answering the questions with you bullocks full of empty lines. All of your aliases are on my ignore.)</Msg><Username>sisula3</Username><Timestamp>1356297094270</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 16:11:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356298720796-7</Id><Topic><Title>Google X Phone...ummmm</Title><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1356224855885</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-22 20:07:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The chip officially doesn't exist and you expect a device to be announced with it?</Msg><Username>sisula3</Username><Timestamp>1356298720796</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 16:38:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356299911518-8</Id><Topic><Title>Google X Phone...ummmm</Title><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1356224855885</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-22 20:07:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I would bet on Intel in the phone, Nvidia in the tablet.</Msg><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1356299911518</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 16:58:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356300125091-9</Id><Topic><Title>Tegra 4 - what is different this time?</Title><Username>sisula3</Username><Timestamp>1356297094270</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 16:11:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>even though I am near term negative on the stock because of various reasons beside Tegra, let me give you my objective opinion on Tegra 4. First, I think Tegra 3 absolutely crushed its SAM (segmented addressable market) in tablets. Tegra 3 further conquered automotive segment. Tegra 3 however missed out on smartphone market big time - this cost them at least 10-15M chip sales opportunity (approx. $200-$300M) in 2012. Tegra 3 was successful in Tablet because it was first to market with a respectable quad-core offering. Strong relationship with Asus, Microsoft, Google, HTC etc. helped drive tablet designs and products to market. Tegra 4 moves the ball forward in following ways: - A15 adoption, helps in performance/watt - 28nm helps in lowering power consumption - larger memory interface, this will help in visual performance - GPU performance, what can I say - if 72 cores is to be believed, you will see Tegra 4 best even A6X in some tests But what will all this do for Nvidia marketshare in 2013? T4 should help Nvidia continue momentum in Tablets, I expect at least 10-20% growth in 2013. T4 should have addressed whatever LTE incompatibility was perceived by smartphone designers ( I never got any intelligent answers on what these were but there was something as proven by late HTC One X+ release with T3+). That will allow some early adoptions but I don't think it challenges Qualcomm in any way. T4+i500 would move the needle in smartphone marketshare as an alternative to Qualcomm but this product is very late now and I don't think in 2013 they will have any new major wins. So I hope Nvidia can stop bleeding money in 2013 in CPB segment because their GPU segment is going to be under pressure.</Msg><Username>o.investor</Username><Timestamp>1356300125091</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 17:02:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356307833911-10</Id><Topic><Title>Tegra 4 - what is different this time?</Title><Username>sisula3</Username><Timestamp>1356297094270</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 16:11:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Tablets: 1) Tablets - Non Apple are expected to grow 60% in 2013 to 80M to 90M. Tegra 4 should allow Nvidia to take even more sockets than they won in 2012. 2) Texas Instruments has left the market throwing the Amazon tablets up for grabs. 3) Freescale has left the market - high end. 4) Nvidia prides itself on being a computer systems company with a 15 year history of working with PC OEMs. As they have to push more into tablets because cheap AMD and Intel processor based PC sales decline they will turn to Nvidia who they know and trust rather than their main competitor Samsung or Qualcomm the phone company. 5) Tegra 4 will start showing up in chrome books etc. if the specs released on Tegra 4 are true Phones: 1) Don't discount those cheaper to mid-range Chinese Smartphone sales. There were 60M smartphone sales in China in Q3. Apple got 2.5M and Samsung got 8.5M. The rest were others a lot China based. 2) Nvidia and Qualcomm is all that's left in the Non-Apple, Non-Samsung smartphone processor market. The Icera LTE chip I500 along with Tegra 4 will get a lot of looks from LG, HTC, Moto, ZTE, etc. rather than pay the Qualcomm going rate. From a base of zero in modem chips. Nvdia can only benefit and should win some sockets. PS. - another huge money maker in the future is the Data Center Nvidia VGX which we should hear much more about in future. Every Data Center Company is backing it and it will be available in 1Q 2013, Nvidia in the Cloud.....Gee it does have a nice ring Also note a breakeven in the Tegra Consumer Products division would have added $0.60 a share to earnings in 2012. Q3 2012 showed they are getting close. I feel confident that this can be accomplished in 2013. Looking forward to CES 2013. Aren't you? In the meantime enjoy the dividend and the on-going stock buyback. This is not the day trader's stock it once was.</Msg><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1356307833911</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 19:10:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356307956549-11</Id><Topic><Title>Google X Phone...ummmm</Title><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1356224855885</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-22 20:07:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ashraf----Intel?

There is a long history of such claims failing to prove true. A bit of a correction though. Right now the K20x is slightly more energy efficient than the Phi when all else is equivalent -- the size of machine, the host processor and network. That's quite surprising considering the process advantage Intel has. The power efficiency is close enough that it's difficult to predict the next generation. There is little improvement to be had when Intel moves to the next process node, but they likely have easier gains from architectural efficiency improvements compared to Nvidia's.years of experience with GPUs.</Msg><Username>watergatefive</Username><Timestamp>1356317183130</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 21:46:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
