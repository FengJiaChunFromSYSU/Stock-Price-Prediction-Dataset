Another cray.</Title><Msg>"Big Red II will accelerate discovery and allow new research by hundreds of IU scientists and scholars right across the university including in medicine, biology, physics, chemistry, astronomy, network science, sustainability science, global climate research, public health, and, of course, informatics and computer science. It will also play a major role in the recruitment of new faculty in these and other areas who will make use of Big Red II and its huge data processing capabilities." The new system will be unique among supercomputers owned by U.S. universities. The new Cray will have more than 21,000 processor cores, high-performance GPUs, and an extremely fast Cray Gemini Interconnect. It will include the newest NVIDIA GPU accelerators and the latest AMD processors with 16 cores each. Big Red II represents a substantial capability leap forward for IU over Big Red's 4,100 cores. "We are excited and honored that Indiana University has selected a Cray supercomputer to become the next Big Red system," said Peter Ungaro, president and CEO of Cray Inc. "The university is widely known as a leader in the academic circles of high performance computing, and we look forward to collaborating with IU and providing their researchers, scientists and students with the unique performance and capability found only in a Cray."</Msg><Username>on2five</Username><Timestamp>1349864707089</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 06:25:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349866262253-4</Id><Topic><Title>Lennovo launched its Win RT tablet, Yoga II, today at a New York event</Title><Username>moorelawyer</Username><Timestamp>1349828429423</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 20:20:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Speaking of lost causes, another stupid post to add to your list.</Msg><Username>chitownbarber22</Username><Timestamp>1349866262253</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 06:51:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349873356104-5</Id><Topic><Title>Wow, most pathetic stock I've seen in years...fail fail fail....after fail fail fail.</Title><Username>stocktradercad</Username><Timestamp>1349794311504</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 10:51:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Don't ask these pumper boys.. they claimed it would be 20 by now. 0 Debt, billions in cash blah blah blah Every week a new product on the market.. it's a fantastic stock..

Given that Obama in 4 years has done very little to improve unemployment from the day he started, along with the unpopular healthcare reform bill that was forced through congress on Christmas Eve, he instills little confidence in the business community. The last debate has shown very clearly that Obama can't defend his record, and that Romney has a grasp on issues that Obama apparently lacks. You can't really expect much more from a political hack and community organizer from Chicago, one term state senator, and half term as U.S. senator.</Msg><Username>chitownbarber22</Username><Timestamp>1349886582918</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 12:29:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349886984436-17</Id><Title>Sold fb for a loss for Nvda</Title><Msg>12.72 1k shares, made money before with this one,great price at these levels imo, and the business cycle should propel us to new highs.</Msg><Username>jtownzu</Username><Timestamp>1349886984436</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 12:36:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349888977448-18</Id><Topic><Title>Voter intimidation by republicans</Title><Username>on2five</Username><Timestamp>1349884601172</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 11:56:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>#$%$... idiot</Msg><Username>mikeywalson</Username><Timestamp>1349888977448</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 13:09:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349889534723-19</Id><Title>insider sales tells the story, sept was a good time to sell</Title><Msg>darn, they're good</Msg><Username>smallstock1</Username><Timestamp>1349889534723</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 13:18:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349889817040-20</Id><Title>okay, who tipped off on the nov15 calls???</Title><Msg>funky behavior, but normal course I guess.</Msg><Username>smallstock1</Username><Timestamp>1349889817040</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 13:23:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349890691440-21</Id><Topic><Title>NVDA Is Looking Good!</Title><Username>callahandenise380</Username><Timestamp>1349878251771</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 10:10:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>true, i feel good about this company also</Msg><Username>janet.calhoun56</Username><Timestamp>1349890691440</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 13:38:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349891119686-22</Id><Title>If i only had more money</Title><Msg>I would be buying with fists,toes and whatever else moves</Msg><Username>jtownzu</Username><Timestamp>1349891119686</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 13:45:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349891232479-23</Id><Topic><Title>WHERE'S THE BOTTOM</Title><Username>hedaklopre</Username><Timestamp>1349890303166</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 13:31:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What a deal here</Msg><Username>jtownzu</Username><Timestamp>1349891232479</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 13:47:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349891873111-24</Id><Topic><Title>If i only had more money</Title><Username>jtownzu</Username><Timestamp>1349891119686</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 13:45:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>i'm in cash but I'll wait until the dust settles, even if I have to pay a bit more...this stock is controlled by big players waiting to eat us alive.

When the economy was in total collapse when he got in to what is timid growth now. I cant agree with you on it being completely forced unless Obama had gone with the public option. What he pushed through was basically the republican plan that was there to counter the public option. Obama put it up and was completely opposed by them. Also the health care bill has become more and more popular as it takes effect. Their was a time Romney was saying get rid of it completely, now he's claiming to keep just the popular parts. Obama can defend his record but he was trying to play it safe by not pushing too hard in the debate and failed to to do so. He wound up doing the complete reverse of pushing too hard. The next debates should be much more interesting. Unfortunately what most Americans cared most about was the economy and that was that first debate. This will probably be a really tight race now. In terms of facts and figures. Obama did better. Romney lied/distorted the truth far more than him. Obama put more policies out on the table that he was willing to pursue. I heard very little from Romney. How many big birds would need to be taken on to add up to just the 2bil+ oil subsidies that Obama was willing to take on. It was all in the presentation and Obama did lousy in that debate.

It's not very presidential to say after you lost miserably that your opponent lied. He had the same opportunity to object to the facts as Romney did. He's the damn President that should have enough onions to open his mouth at the time. Healthcare bill is still disliked by a majority of the people. It's another government run accident waiting to happen. Some stuff Obama has done- Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay act - Let the market forces set pay, not the government. Cash For Clunkers - It was a failure that just moved up the purchases for people already looking and contemplating. The car market was dead a couple months later. Don't Ask Don't Tell policy removed - Should have left what Clinton signed. Bin laden dead - The forces were already in the field looking for him. He just had to give the go ahead. Health care law - Sucks big time.
