THAT has to be the FUNNIEST and LAMEST attempts at SPIN we've seen in a very long time !!! Here's what Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said about the Surfact RT tablet. "Sales of the Surface tablet have gotten off to a modest start." And here's what the Microsoft spin-meisters wrote ex-post-facto. You know, the girls that get push the broom after the Chief has spoken too frankly; "Updated, 1:23 p.m. Nov. 12 : Microsoft clarified that what Ballmer meant by a modest start was in reference to the company's approach in ramping up supply and distribution of the Surface, not how sales have been going."

Why don't you use $1.10 billion since that's the midpoint of guidance. 2. Why don't you add back the eps add-on from gross margin improvement. 3. NVDA stock had sold off when AMD lowered guidance and when INTC lowered guidance. Market is forward looking. If you didn't know that the PC market was weak, then well, you must live under a rock. Now, NVDA may very well continue to sell off but it think at this point that's probably going to be more overall market related. i.e. if spx and nasdaq continue to sell off.</Msg><Username>gtwn13</Username><Timestamp>1352786550719</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-13 01:02:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352787067593-6</Id><Topic><Title>Steve Ballmer talks about the sales of Surface RT tablets</Title><Username>ibexx88</Username><Timestamp>1352783955176</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-13 00:19:15 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Maybe the next time Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer goes to France he should take with him { wait for it now } a tele-promptour.

This is largely due to shift in PC market. The good news is that Jen was not asleep at the wheel and anticipated this shift by investing heavily in Mobile. This was not done at AMD and hence AMD is history. The landscape in mobile space is clearing though - QCOM is the biggest competition for NVDA and to effectively compete with QCOM, NVDA needs to make its integrated LTE strategy work. Then it will be game on! - Samsung will keep flogging Exynos on their products - TXN is essentially exiting app processor segment - MRVL and MediaTek are going no where fast (other than TD China) - ST-Ericsson has some traction - INTC is looking pathetic with Atom NVDA has strong OEM partnership. Microsoft, Google, Motorola, HTC, Asus (also ZTE, Fujitsu etc). NVDA needs to get a true volume product to show serious revenue growth. I think HTC One X+ will do very well but its only available on limited carriers. I expect NVDA to be a solid #2 behind QCOM by end of 2013. However, there are many risks along the way and I expect Q1 2013 to be a disappointment. That may be the right time to load up. Until then, its best to keep NVDA on watch list.</Msg><Username>o.investor</Username><Timestamp>1352790776942</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-13 02:12:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352806058687-10</Id><Topic><Title>Steve Ballmer talks about the sales of Surface RT tablets</Title><Username>ibexx88</Username><Timestamp>1352783955176</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-13 00:19:15 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>IF you recall, Android had a lack luster launch overshadowed by the iPad 2 launch...

The Intel licensing revs are included in the GPU segment's numbers. This has nothing to do with whether the GAAP or Non-GAAP numbers are used for the PE shown in sites like Yahoo Finance. The revenue from INTC's payments are included in both GAAP and non-GAAP numbers. The reason for GAAP vs non-GAAP EPS being used for the PE calculation in Yahoo Finance all comes down to which numbers the analysts report to Cap IQ and Thomson Reuters (Yahoo's data source). If you listen to enough conference calls, you'll here some companies specifically asking analysts to make sure they report the non GAAP numbers. AKAM is one company in specific where I've heard them do that. It is frustrating since a lot of people seem to take the Yahoo Finance numbers at face value and think they're making apple-to-apple comparisons, when they're not. And again, it has nothing to do with the INTC payments being treated differently on a GAAP or non GAAP basis. If you look the companies statements about their Non-GAAP numbers, the difference between the two is almost entirely around stock-based compensation.</Msg><Username>thetrade50</Username><Timestamp>1352817794286</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-13 09:43:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352818008981-14</Id><Title>Who thinks Ballmer would actually admit Surface sales suck?</Title><Msg>Never happen.

NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Advanced Micro Devices has hired JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co to explore options, which could include a sale, as the chipmaker struggles to find a role in an industry increasingly focused on mobile and away from traditional PCs, according to three sources familiar with the situation. One of Silicon Valley's oldest chipmakers, AMD is laying off engineers and some analysts are concerned it may not find new markets for its chips in time to reverse a declining cash reserve. AMD's shares have fallen more than 60 percent this year, giving it a market value of about $1.4 billion. It also has long-term debt and capital lease obligations of about $2 billion. Some investors believe part or all of AMD could be bought by a technology company that might want to emulate Apple Inc's tight control of software and components, a strategy credited in part for the success of the iPad and iPhone. Another source mentioned AMD's game console chip business and growing focus on embedded chips as the company's silver linings. Microsoft Corp, Google Inc, Samsung Electronics, Intel Corp and even Facebook Inc have been suggested by Wall Street analysts as potential suitors that could benefit from some of AMD's chip business, including its graphics division, PC processors and server chips. Goldman Sachs analyst James Covello estimated in a recent note to clients the chances of AMD's PC processor business being sold are between 15 percent and 30 percent." Be sure to read and re-read the whole Exclusive story from Reuters, boys. Google this : Exclusive: AMD hires bank to explore options - sources | Reuters Potential suitors, boys. Oh so many many potential suitors rumored for AMD. Probably so many that they needed JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co to help analyze all the offers. Microsoft Corp, -- check. Google Inc. -- check. Samsung Electronics -- check. Intel Corporation -- check Facebook Inc -- check Goldman Sachs, no doubt being pretty peeved that they didn't get the M&amp;A gig, might be backing their own suprise potential suitors.

Yes, it's true. As expected. The nvda stock price has now declined (-6.18%) from the closing price on Thursday November 8th -- right before Jen gave his confessional about chopping guidance by (-15%) Clearly the Market, she has a looong ways to go yet in walking this one down to it's logical price of $10.72 One Red Day at a time, boys.

They can retire 100+ Million shares if they buy around $12. That itself would save them 30M/Year in dividend payment.

(629,000,000 nvidia shares out x 15% = 94,350,000 shares needed to be repurchased) And Jen doesn't have approval from the Board to spend that much. Oh no no no. Only $90 million. Which is less than 1/10th of the cash Jen would need to neutralize EPS. So she tanks, right boys? With or without the teeny tiny nvidia stock repurchase program.</Msg><Username>perceptive.best</Username><Timestamp>1352869057312</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-13 23:57:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
