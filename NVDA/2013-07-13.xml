Based on the comprehensive performance charts Intel should have laid low and shot down every media efforts. Even if the original Antutu scores held up - the performance charts showed some very serious performance issues - you lost on 90% of the benchmarks by more than 25% and most of them by more than 50%! This is reminiscence of the Intel media blare on how Haswell integrated graphics was going to obsolete the Nvidia GPU. This only means Bay Toast will struggle to reach par performance with the 28nm A15 Quads or at best a 5% advantage. Darn Sad with all the hoopla. Also shows most of the tech writers are at the minimum - idiotic! How much are they selling these ultra performance junk?</Msg><Username>ltenow</Username><Timestamp>1373689984423</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 00:33:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373692942081-2</Id><Topic><Title>Clover Toast</Title><Username>ltenow</Username><Timestamp>1373689984423</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 00:33:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In a somewhat analogous way, Qualcomm SoCs have enjoyed unfair benchmarking advantages as well, as many of the benchmarks now used for mobile devices were originally optimized for Qualcomm's architectures. Unfortunately, this is an inherent bias in favor of the incumbents as they (SW + HW) were and still are part of an "old boys club".</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1373692942081</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 01:22:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373716130591-3</Id><Topic><Title>EETimes: ARM beats Intel in revised Antutu benchmark (newest article published July 12)</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1373677580233</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 21:06:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm sure mars will tell us how the new revaluations are wrong.</Msg><Username>chitownbarber25</Username><Timestamp>1373716130591</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 07:48:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373725387967-4</Id><Topic><Title>EETimes: ARM beats Intel in revised Antutu benchmark (newest article published July 12)</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1373677580233</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 21:06:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yap yap yap all day long pumping and bashing on a nothing message board. Facts about what's going down: before nvda has gotten a subtainable toehold on the mobile market, you have a 800 lb gorilla coming in who WILL siphon off market share and $s. Most importantly, you have one more guy in line in the only high runner in tablets that is available to merchant app proc - Nexus 7. Tegra 1 lost money. Tegra 2 lost money. Tegra 3 lost money. No doubt Tegra 4 will lose money too. When will Tegras break even? Real investors and real shareholders are asking. Brown nosers forever hold their peace.</Msg><Username>whosunw</Username><Timestamp>1373725387967</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 10:23:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373727601686-5</Id><Topic><Title>EETimes: ARM beats Intel in revised Antutu benchmark (newest article published July 12)</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1373677580233</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 21:06:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"yap yap yap all day long pumping and bashing on a nothing message board."

'yap yap yap all day long'. The ones who are spending the majority of their time clogging this board are the bashers with nothing better to do. The majority of the long-term investors, including ibexx and others that post a few times a day, don't post nearly as much as the bashers. So what makes this a 'nothing message board'? It's the losers that are simply talking to each other with the same tired old distortions and lies. Nvidia and the stockholders are on cruise control as the ramp up just begins. There's no desire to waste time responding to those that clog this board (except once in a while as I'm doing here) because we as stockholders of Nvidia are not worried at all.</Msg><Username>roundhouse_c</Username><Timestamp>1373738424855</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 14:00:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message></Date>
