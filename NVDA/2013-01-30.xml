This looks promising Releasing these screenshots, Bohemia Interactive today announced that Arma Tactics, a turn-based close-combat strategy game developed for NVIDIA Tegra devices, will be available in Q2 2013. In Arma Tactics, the player takes control of a four-member Special Forces team. There are no given strategies, rails to move on, or paths to follow; it's up to the player to decide how he will play through both the story-driven missions and generated missions with randomized objectives. Whether using stealth or a more direct approach, players will need to use their strategic thinking and use both basic and advanced weaponry while facing many different opponents - ranging from unorganized local militia to smart and skilled mercenaries. Arma Tactics takes full advantage of Project SHIELD's console-grade controller, and when connected to a television, the game utilizes Project SHIELD's multi-screen gaming, allowing the audience to experience entertaining vantage points that differ from the player's. Optimizations for NVIDIA Tegra 4 include enhanced physics simulation, bloom post-processing effects and increased objects and geometry.</Msg><Username>streamingsodapop</Username><Timestamp>1359558358943</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 10:05:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359558821834-14</Id><Topic><Title>NVDA would certainly come to be the ticker to pay attention to this month.</Title><Username>rayford.roudabush</Username><Timestamp>1359547352760</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 07:02:32 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I am happy i read that before buying</Msg><Username>jose.mcgann</Username><Timestamp>1359558821834</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 10:13:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359561356597-15</Id><Topic><Title>NVIDIA Corporation UPDATED CHARTS!</Title><Username>meulyapril</Username><Timestamp>1359559169108</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 10:19:29 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This is what I am looking for.</Msg><Username>meltezbonnie</Username><Timestamp>1359561356597</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 10:55:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359561927840-16</Id><Title>Did the Bank of Nvidia Buy or Not Buy Shares?</Title><Msg>Too much Cash on the books, too much cash coming in.

The obvious appeal of stocks versus bonds is that investors can benefit from rising dividends over time. Many big companies now have dividends that exceed their bond yields. Blue chips with 3%-plus yields include drug makers Pfizer (ticker: PFE), Merck (MRK), and Novartis (NVS). In the consumer sector, there's PepsiCo (PEP) and Procter &amp; Gamble (PG). And technology, a former income wasteland, now offers many 3% yielders, such as Microsoft (MSFT), Intel (INTC), and Seagate Technology (STX). Energy giants Chevron (CVX), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA), and ConocoPhillips (COP) all yield more than 3%. There are dozens of income-oriented mutual funds and exchange-traded funds. Some of the largest ETFs are Vanguard High Dividend Yield (VYM), iShares Dow Jones Select Dividend (DVY), and SPDR S&amp;P Dividend (SDY). Utilities Electric utilities were the only loser in 2012 among the major sectors of the S&amp;P 500, with a 2.9% drop -- and a 1% return after dividends. This year could be better because utility dividends look appealing at 4%-plus in much of the industry. Major utilities trade at an average of 14 times projected 2013 profits, compared with about 13 times for the faster-growing S&amp;P 500. Yet utility earnings are relatively predictable, in the low- to mid-single digits each year. The three largest electrics (by market value), Duke Energy (DUK), at $65; Southern Co. (SO), at $44; and Dominion Resources (D), at $53, all yield 4% or more. The Utilities Select SPDR (XLU), which holds the electric utilities within the S&amp;P 500 index, yields 4.1%.

NVS is also a growth-and-dividend stock as the company (Norvartis) recently launched a revolutionary drug Ocriplasmin for the treatment of diabetic macular edema - a highly prevalent condition among diabetics.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1359569024181</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 13:03:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359572856449-20</Id><Title>Rise of Vivante: Fastest Tablet GPU on the Market?</Title><Msg>Vivante Corporation is probably one of the best known secrets in Silicon Valley. The company creates graphics processors which end up integrated in numerous SoC's (System-on-a-Chip), yet its public perception lags behind other, well established players. Part of the problem is the engineering heavy background and lack of mature marketing approach but one cannot negate their strengths - the GC2000 GPU IP was the first mobile GPU to successfully pass the OpenGL ES 3.0 and OpenCL 1.1 certifications, while the performance is nothing to be sneezed at. The Freescale i.MX6 chip used Vivante's GC2000/4000 OpenCL capability to land the BMW design win, pushing Nvidia Tegra out within a single product design cycle (Nvidia managed to oust Intel). Furthermore, Chinese silicon vendor HiSilicon (semiconductor arm of well-known Huawei) chose Vivante to be their graphics processor of choice as well. The decision for both Freescale and HiSilicon is yielding good results - more design wins for Freescale, and an impressive score in Rightware's Basemark GUI for Vivante-based tablets. Top 3 fastest tablets in the world are now powered by the 16-core GC4000 and 8-core GC2000, beating the latest GPUs from ARM (Mali-T604) and Nvidia (GeForce ULP).</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1359572856449</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 14:07:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359573942474-21</Id><Topic><Title>NVDA would certainly come to be the ticker to pay attention to this month.</Title><Username>rayford.roudabush</Username><Timestamp>1359547352760</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 07:02:32 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>i want this report send it already</Msg><Username>darrylbuchanan93</Username><Timestamp>1359573942474</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 14:25:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359575947764-22</Id><Topic><Title>NVIDIA Corporation UPDATED CHARTS!</Title><Username>meulyapril</Username><Timestamp>1359559169108</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 10:19:29 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I love this article.

Asus And Google Working On Next Generation Nexus 7 The report comes from Digitimes, who apparently have come across recently released engineering samples of the device. According to these samples, the display will be upgraded to a Full HD one (1920 x 1080 pixels) and the tablet will feature an industrial design with a thinner display border. Despite the bump in specs, the price target will remain the same as the currently available Nexus 7 at $199-$249. Digitimes‘ sources also mention that it will be running “Google’s upgraded Jelly Bean-based Android operating system”, though it will likely be the flagship device for showcasing Key Lime Pie or whatever the next version of Android is to be called, as Google I/O is known for introducing newer versions of the OS. We can also expect it to be powered by NVIDIA’s next-gen Tegra 4 processor, since ASUS seems quite fond of using NVIDIA chipsets in all their devices. Digitimes also states that Nexus 7 shipments are expected to surpass six million units by the end of this month, and that the $249 model is the best-selling of the models currently available. Also, the second-gen Nexus 7 should make up for a total of more than ten million units of all Nexus 7′s by the end of 2013, which I’m sure will no doubt happen if an upgraded Nexus 7 actually comes along this year.

The article: What do you get when you cross an Xbox controller with a five-inch Android tablet with beefy stereo speakers? Nvidia’s new touch-screen portable gaming system, code-named Project Shield. The handheld game system was unveiled at the Consumer Electronics Show this month in Las Vegas, and it could spell more bad news for the Sony Vita, Nintendo 3DS or any other entry in the mobile gaming market. Why? Because it further stretches how consumers can buy and experience video games. Besides being a complete stand-alone Android gaming system, the chunky controller can also stream games that have already been loaded on a Windows PC, providing users are sharing the same Wi-Fi router and the computer is equipped with a recent Nvidia graphics processor (specifically a Kepler-based GeForce GTX 650 or better). Even hard-core gamers take breaks, right? So now you can carry your game of Assassins Creed around the house with you. Other features include a set of standard game controls and 5- to 10-hour rechargeable batteries. The stand-alone mode is based on the Jelly Bean version of the Android operating system. An Nvidia representative promised that it was “pure, unfiltered Android that can run anything you can download from the Google Play app store.” Games that have been modified for gamepads and five-inch landscape displays will work better. One cannot help but notice the potential of this device for playing videos or music, thanks to the clear screen and speakers that are much better than average. Nvidia promises an SD card slot, but will not say how much internal storage the device has. Also up in the air are the final name and the price. All of that will be determined by late spring, which is the earliest consumers will be able to buy one.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1359601320371</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 22:02:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359601987298-43</Id><Topic><Title>New york times gets it right</Title><Username>on2five</Username><Timestamp>1359599841694</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 21:37:21 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A strong endorsement by the author - worth high-lighting: ""One cannot help but notice the potential of this device for playing videos or music, thanks to the clear screen and speakers that are much better than average.""</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1359601987298</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 22:13:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359606225382-44</Id><Topic><Title>New york times gets it right</Title><Username>on2five</Username><Timestamp>1359599841694</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 21:37:21 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Where have you been JK? nVidia has been the subject of New York Times feature articles at last half a dozen times in the past 2-3 years.</Msg><Username>tomasmann</Username><Timestamp>1359606225382</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 23:23:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359607356262-45</Id><Title>$11.11 on 2/22</Title><Msg>Mark it on your calendar.</Msg><Username>arnab_chanda_huang</Username><Timestamp>1359607356262</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 23:42:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
