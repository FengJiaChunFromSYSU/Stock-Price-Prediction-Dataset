The Barcelona Supercomputer Center is building Mont-Blanc, the world's most energy efficient supercomputer by using NVIDIA's (NASDAQ: NVDA ) Tegra 3 mobile processor over the typical Intel Xeon found in supercomputers. For comparison, the typical Xeon processor consumes 50 to 100 watts of energy, where each Tegra will be tuned to consume just 4 watts. Although the project is using off-the-shelf materials, it's not an off-the-shelf initiative. Practically every piece of code written for Intel x86-based architecture needs to be repurposed in order to take advantage of Tegra 3's ARM-based architecture. For data centers, this is great news, because whatever is learned and developed during the process will be openly shared with the community. It's no wonder the sycophants populate this board like a disease. They see their monopoly falling fast!

Those nvidia parts for the Mont-Blanc Barcelona Supercomputer Center were kicked to the curb in November. Yep. nvidia tegra parts are out -- and Samsung's Exynos 5250 superior chips are in. BSC Selects Samsung Exynos Processor Over Nvidia Tegra [11/19/2012 10:10 PM] by Anton Shilov The Mont-Blanc European project has selected the Samsung Exynos platform as the building block for powering its first integrated low power high performance computing (HPC) prototype. Previously, the Mont-Blanc project was co-developed by Barcelona Supercomputing Center and Nvidia Corp., but it looks like the latter is no longer a part of the project. The aim of Mont-Blanc project is to design a new type of computer architecture capable of setting future global HPC standards, built from today’s energy efficient solutions used in embedded and mobile devices. The Samsung Exynos 5250 is built on 32nm low-power HKMG (high-K netal gate) technology, and features two 1.70GHz ARM Cortex-A15 architecture cores plus an integrated ARM Mali-T604 GPU for increased performance density and energy efficiency. It has been featured and market proven in consumer and mobile devices such as Samsung Chromebook and Google’s Nexus 10. This will be the first use of an embedded mobile SoC in HPC, which enables the Mont-Blanc project to explore the challenges and benefits of deeply integrated energy-efficient processors and GPU accelerators, compared to traditional homogeneous multicore systems, and heterogeneous CPU + external GPU architectures. "The Exynos 5 Dual packs the most powerful ARM processors with a programmable GPU in a low-power mobile device that would normally be in someone’s pocket and running on a battery. Its performance density, energy efficiency, and low market price make it an extraordinary building block for prototyping a new generation of HPC systems," said Alex Ramirez, coordinator of the Mont-Blanc project. During the first year of activities, Mont-Blanc has focused on deploying successfully an HPC system software stack and full-scale scientific applications on ARM platforms, proving that ARM-based architectures are feasible alternatives for HPC. Now the efforts gear towards integration of the Exynos platform on a HPC solution, and software exploitation of the embedded GPU.

Stop wasting everybody's time and do you're research - stupid dummy can't even effectively read the 10Q where it sums all of this up! If you could simply read the 10Q you'd know this!!! You have no idea that tegra will be in everything, everywhere... soon - it's all in black and white! Now all you have to do is do you're DD and go find it! Oh and NVIDIA is expected reach a market cap in excess of $1 trillion USD! :p (BTW: posting stupidity was far more difficult than I originally thought, how do make it seem so effortless?)</Msg><Username>brokeagain73</Username><Timestamp>1356971443588</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-31 11:30:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356971569723-28</Id><Title>intel and nvidia fought and both lost!</Title><Msg>but 2013 will be a better year for them as they fall in love with each other again</Msg><Username>smallstock1</Username><Timestamp>1356971569723</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-31 11:32:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356973193065-29</Id><Title>Covered at 12.06 out of NVDA for 2012</Title><Msg>I trust technicals on this one, Fast STO are flashing oversold and it may get a pop going into CES.

" Considering the growth I would say it's viable and there isn't any sign it's slowing for NVIDIA as they pick up more market share. I would argue that Qualcomm's strategy was just as one off and organic. "Icera buy is a complete flop. Remember this doozy from Nvidia press release "The transaction is expected to be slightly dilutive on an operating basis through the first half of calendar 2012, and accretive on an operating basis in the second half of calendar 2012."" The project is late - this is true but so we will have t see until late 2013 to see if this statement holds true. "Mike Rayfield quit this business while a 50% growth was being touted - why? " Nobody knows - did he quite or was he asked to leave? "TXN and Freescale quit mobile SOC market for a reason, they don't like losing money like Nvidia" I don't think you can compare NVIDIA to these two companies. TXN has had very little consumer presence since it's calculators. Both have weak balance sheets (esp FSL) and FSL has an extremely weak cash flow situation going on (OCF - is even really weak). So, exiting made sense financial. NVIDIA financial profile and marketing constitution blow the other two out of the water. NVIDIA has great brand recognition, marketing, and financials to allow it to grow and withstand any setbacks in this venture. You simply can't put NVIDIA in the same category. "Apple, Samsung, Qualcomm, Intel, Mediatek will duke it out for 99% of market share. Nvidia will continue flogging for the remaining 1% market share in mobile SOC." Conjecture with a heavy twist of pessimistic sentiment - this is not what the current trend depicts and Intel has yet to even make a dent. "2012 was a terrible year for Nvidia, stock lost 13% as compared to Nasdaq which gained 15%" Can't argue with that but as far as technicals - however I've been burned more with momentum buys. "Nvidia is headed for 7th straight Red day closing 2012 and heading into CES. If this does not raise flags for longs then nothing else will." I did expect it to be up today, but that being said, and I've said this before, I think the drop in the price is macro and reading into CES is a miserable gamble - none of us know but I'd rather gamble on the side of positive considering what I have heard earlier from the company. It wouldn't surprise me if the company is holding back press releases until the budget gets figured out as any positive news would be muted and forgotten. Waiting until there are more buyers would accelerate the movement - most tech stocks seem to be in this holding pattern right now.

That is fine with me as this helps my long options expire without being assigned. Anything sub 12 I think is a steal and selling calls and puts has put me well below that.

I've followed and traded Nvidia for the last 4 years.So I have some sense of this company and it's stock. The introduction of a dividend and the resumption or the threat of the stock buyback has brought a level of stability to the stock that I like. In addition, Nvidia has approached a level of critical mass in Geforce Graphics with 2012 GPU market share gains along with Tesla and Quadro growth and profit margins. NVX and Gaming Grid initiatives have a lot of potential too. Tegra is also approaching critical mass. I suspect that by this time next year Tegra revenue will be at least 50% above this year's and we Nvidia will be talking in terms of number of design wins rather than individual wins just like they track their PC discrete market wins. In other words Nvidia will become a bet on particular markets like tablets and smartphones or severs, etc. rather than the latest rumor on the internet. Icera modems should also come into play next year. JMHO, and by the Way HAPPY NEW YEAR</Msg><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1357009810826</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-31 22:10:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357013924942-65</Id><Topic><Title>I Like The New Nvidia!</Title><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1357009810826</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-31 22:10:10 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So where will the PPS be in a year, you think?
