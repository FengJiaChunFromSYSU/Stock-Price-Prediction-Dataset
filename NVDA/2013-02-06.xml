"Still, Eurora is noticeably more energy efficient than the Titan, which uses the same generation of NVIDIA GPUs. So why the difference? A lot of it is due to Eurotech's on-board cooling system. That system delivers 50 degree C water to a heat exchanger – flat metal plates with water-flow systems attached. The plates sit directly in contact with the components on a circuit board to uniformly draw away heat. That's why NVIDIA had to provide a special version of its GPUs to Eurotech. They don't have the usual heat sinks attached, but accommodate a plate instead."</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1360139835764</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-06 03:37:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360158412241-2</Id><Title>Why NVDA is going down before markrt open??</Title><Msg>Any news</Msg><Username>handsome868</Username><Timestamp>1360158412241</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-06 08:46:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360158614550-3</Id><Topic><Title>Why NVDA is going down before markrt open??</Title><Username>handsome868</Username><Timestamp>1360158412241</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-06 08:46:52 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Same question here.</Msg><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1360158614550</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-06 08:50:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360159102650-4</Id><Topic><Title>Why NVDA is going down before markrt open??</Title><Username>handsome868</Username><Timestamp>1360158412241</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-06 08:46:52 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Can't understand at all, what should I do with NVDA stock.

The shorts are realizing that this is the end of the road, and what they did was rather simple. They used stock from a long account, and hit the stock pre-market to engender some panic selling, thus allowing them to cover their shorts to the tune of already almost 5mm shares in the first 35 minutes. There is NO news, hence it seems pretty clear that the drop was manufactured by these folks, and the bounce back to just down 1% speaks to that. The stock is likely to close higher, and this will be a major turning point. As always, we'll know in the fullness of time.

NVDA supposedly has a lot of Tegra 4 design wins, but we have only heard about two of them. MWC would be a natural place for their clients to announce new designs. IF they have lost their their two most prestigious spots (Surface and Nexus 7), as the rumors claim, they will need something else to keep Tegra 4 visible (viable?). Of course, the same rumor mill claims they may have a spot in a new Nexus phone, which wouldn't be too shabby.

Not a surprise. Nexus 10 went to Samsung and its exynos 5, but it has NOT taken off like the N7. Timing of product cycles is another factor in this case, but in the end, the most competitive technology/products will prevail. The mobile space is a huge pie, and NV is relatively small in comparison with QC and Samsung. It takes 1/5 of the number of design wins that QC has to achieve a similar growth rate. The differential is so much greater in comparison with Samsung. Today: after a couple of downgrades, the up volume vs down volume ratio is 1.3, meaning there is 30% more buying than selling. The net money flow for NVDA is 3.45 million so far. One should always view the downgrades at trough with suspicion. Some one is buying under disguise.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1360178975187</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-06 14:29:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360180642844-48</Id><Topic><Title>white box tablets won't do good because</Title><Username>whosunw</Username><Timestamp>1360177566190</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-06 14:06:06 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I bought an original N7 when it first came out in July, 2012....still loooooove it.

But all this is coming after LG’s James Fisher went off track at the company’s CES press conference and hinted at more incoming Nexus hardware made by LG. He said the Nexus 4 was “the first of many”. It only takes a spark to ignite a fire and today on Korean tech forum RuliWeb someone has allegedly leaked the specs of the next generation of Google’s Nexus line – the Nexus 5 and Nexus 7.7. The forum suggests that both these devices will be unveiled at Google I/O in May. Now there is no way to ascertain if these specs are a figment of someone’s imagination or the real deal. The mentioned specs state that the Nexus 5 will be a 5-inch smartphone with a display with a 1920×1080 pixels converting to 440 pixels per inch with a bezel measuring just 1mm. It will have the latest Nvidia Tegra 4 quad-core processor, 2GB of RAM and a 13-megapixel rear camera and a 3-megapixel front-facing camera. It will be available for an expected price of $299 for the 8GB model. For the Nexus 7.7, the forum thread suggests that it will have a 7.7-inch display with a resolution of 1920×1200 pixels converting to 294 pixels per inch. It will also be powered by the Nvidia Tegra 4 processor and will have 2GB of RAM and will also have 720p front and rear camera. It will also have an expected starting price of $299 for the 8GB model. It does not take a genius to whip up these specs considering this is more or less what we expect a flagship device to have in the first half of 2013. Additionally, we have already seen The International Business Times report that the Nexus 5 could be incoming with a 2GHz quad-core processor and Android 5.0 which is rumored to be Key Lime Pie. The report also claims that the Nexus 5 could be launched as soon as next month and claims that LG has already stopped production of the Nexus 4. We take the claim of the Nexus 5 launching next month with a bit of caution as Nexus hardware has traditionally been unveiled at either Google I/O or at a dedicated Google event. But we also do believe that LG could have stopped production of the Nexus 4 to make way for the Nexus 5 as the product is not easily available. Consumers have faced difficulty in getting their hands on the product and LG and Google have not released the device in many markets including India. This is of note as we ourselves exclusively reported in November that LG was planning to launch the Nexus 4 in India in late November, but to date the device has not been released. Additionally, LG India’s Amit Gujral had stated back in November that the Nexus 4 was coming to India later in the month. Recent reports now suggest that the Nexus 4 could come to India in late January, so that does not happen then we will have a better idea of what LG is up to regarding both the Nexus 4 and the rumored Nexus 5.

Now remember last year in the 4Q Tegra sales were in freefall with very little if any products selling with Tegra chips in them. The resultant 4th quarter revenue for Tegra proved this. People were saying that Nvidia should never have announced the Tegra 3 so soon because it killed Tegra 2 sales. Well fast forward to this year.Tegra 3 sales are moving along quite nicely. 70% of all Android tablets and the only Win RT tablets are selling. Fujitsu launches a phone in the 4th quarter with tegra 3. HTC One X+ comes along in the US with Tegra 3 rather than QCOM. BLU announces cheaper decent phones shipping in Feb with Tegra 3. In fact Tegra sales for the 4th quarter look quite good. Yet now people are saying Tegra 4 is not being picked up by anybody. Are you sure that's the case? From the announcement of Tegra 4 at Ces to MWC is a little less than 2 months. Do you really want to make the bet that Tegra 4 is a dud? If so short at will, but I for one believe you will be fooled. Of course all the chatter could be just what the Tech Press does best. Talk about anything to get their clicks. In the meantime Project Shield is looking really nice for all those Gamer boys. Something that bloggers will just have to adjust too. One last thought. In 2012 over 90% of all tablets sold world wide were WiFi alone. Explain to me again why one sourcing Application processors and modems from a single source like QCOM is a good thing. But what the heck.....perhaps Nvidia undercut QCOMs modem with I500 and they are really pxxxed about it. My recommendation is to wait for the Feb 13th earnings call. It's a beat for sure and then let's hear the guidance from the only people in the world that really know what it is. In the meantime.....Shorties blast away. I'll collect the dividend. Hope Nvidia picked up some shares in the mid 11's like I did.

As Tiernan Ray updated the Barron's blog post to say, Pacific Crest's Michael McConnell wrote today that: "We have increased our Quadro workstation sales estimate to $897 million (8% y/y growth) versus a prior estimate of $857 million (3% y/y growth). Given the high operating profit of the Quadro product line (46% operating margin), this provides an estimated $0.05 of EPS benefit to our model in fiscal 2014." No commentary about how 8% growth on this [extremely] high-margin business is extremely positive news for Nvidia. 8% growth is substantial. And given the bearishness of the analyst, I personally wouldn't be surprised if that's the lower end of what he's hearing. In 2008, McConnell drove NVDA down to a retest of the low $7s after citing sources saying they were exiting the chipset business imminently, (3 years, billions in revenue before they did, and a $1.5B licensing settlement with INTC before they did). I hope he gets embarrassed with the earnings and guidance next week.</Msg><Username>joshpritchard</Username><Timestamp>1360197529775</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-06 19:38:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360197542966-69</Id><Title>Nexus 7 tablets will have to sell for $99.

I forget the name of the guy that use to blog for Barrons. He never would post anything Pacific Crest said. Guess he got burned once or twice and refused. Pac Crest had to wait for the current guy to cover for vacations. But do you really think a small 200 person brokerage house has the inside scoop. Remember he was pumping Apple like there was no tomorrow at $700 and only cut his price target when it hit $525. By the way Barrons is right about Pro graphics. Not hard to see when even AMD said they had record Pro graphics sales albeit at a much smaller pace. The real wild card is this Indie Gaming trend along with Project Shield. Rumors today about Microsoft XBOX locking at used game sales sent Gamestop shares falling. Certainly Nvidia knows all about Playstation 4 and Microsoft Xbox. Didn't AMD sue their former employees. Along comes Nvidia with an open source gaming platform with support for Indie developers along with Nvidia Grid. Pure coincidence I'm sure. Gamestop will love them. Which way do you think Gamers Fall along with Google Android. Watch what happens here. No one likes a closed system especially when you pay a horrendous amount of money for something that you the buyer doesn't own it. Besides...Nvidia is buying shares on the cheap!</Msg><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1360199482803</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-06 20:11:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360203797033-76</Id><Title>nail in the Tegra coffin - longs, don't read</Title><Msg>Cisco says only 10% of mobile traffic by 2017 will be 4G.

Why does this hurt Nvidia more relative to its competitors? If anything, I'd think this is relatively worse news for QCOM (which I'm also long) since Cisco is predicting that 2G and 3G will remain dominant for the foreseeable future... giving Nvidia and other competitors more time to get their [soft] modems running well on the existing 2G/3G technology. Why would this bit of news hurt Tegra's prospects in phones? What do you mean by "#3 is cheap only, #4 is into sharing his wealth..."? I agree that Nvidia should continue returning cash to shareholders (see the current dividend) and also act on the share buyback program that they extended &amp; expanded last quarter.</Msg><Username>joshpritchard</Username><Timestamp>1360204586098</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-06 21:36:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360205372690-79</Id><Topic><Title>nail in the Tegra coffin - longs, don't read</Title><Username>whosunw</Username><Timestamp>1360203797033</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-06 21:23:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Cisco white paper predicted 10% of connections, but fully 45% of traffic would be mobile. That's hugely different than what you misquote. Those numbers are pure guesses. Data fees and caps will have a huge and unpredictable impact. What's isn't so difficult to predict is the likely need for radios in non-phone devices. Today a bit over 90% of tablet class devices use only WiFi. Few people are willing to pay $40/month per device for a mobile subscription, and even a $10/month add-on fee isn't get much take-up when the base plan is more expensive and the data caps remain unchanged. This is especially true in the volume market of $200-$400 tablets.</Msg><Username>watergatefive</Username><Timestamp>1360205372690</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-06 21:49:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360207264711-80</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft dumped tegra, google dumped tegra, Lenovo is dumping tegra</Title><Username>will_amd_yu</Username><Timestamp>1360197092440</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-06 19:31:32 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>#$%$!!!</Msg><Username>fdigiovanni01</Username><Timestamp>1360207264711</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-06 22:21:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
