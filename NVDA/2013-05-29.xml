The Shield will essentially replace all functionality of the Roku, function as a de-facto steambox for PC Games with up to 4k resolution, allow you to use HBOGO even though some cable providers (Comcast) block the functionality of HBOGO for roku and other hardware, and many other functions (chrome and all of the other android apps). Competitors have some of this functionality (xbox one, ps4, dedicated PC for your tv, etc.); the cost, portability and all-in-one functionality of the Shield is what differentiates the Shield from alternatives. Other than the CEO demoing the shield a couple months ago on a 4k tv, I have seen virtually no mention of this functionality in the media or on the shield promotional pages on new egg or nvidia's own website. They frequently showcase PC streaming to the device's 5 in screen, but rarely to a large HDTV. Is there something tying nvidia's hands that I am missing? Or are the simply dropping the ball on this?</Msg><Username>morrowltd</Username><Timestamp>1369849370003</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 13:42:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369851388982-5</Id><Topic><Title>Nvidia Should Market the Utility of the Shield When Paired with HDTV</Title><Username>morrowltd</Username><Timestamp>1369849370003</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 13:42:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why don't you elaborate the point and send a message to JH and NV's marketing chief?

But our government leaders will never agree to the elimination of stock options. Many have advocated profit sharing or other forms of incentives instead. But they too are corrupt, by giving way to lobbiests against the idea. And this is one of the good reasons why the retail investor does not trust Wall Street.</Msg><Username>jtjgmtbt</Username><Timestamp>1369854531057</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 15:08:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369855175645-8</Id><Topic><Title>Markets SOAR, NVDA up 3 stinking cents!</Title><Username>roundhouse_cc</Username><Timestamp>1369752616405</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 10:50:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>hopeless</Msg><Username>kharies99</Username><Timestamp>1369855175645</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 15:19:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369855690898-9</Id><Topic><Title>Nvidia Should Market the Utility of the Shield When Paired with HDTV</Title><Username>morrowltd</Username><Timestamp>1369849370003</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 13:42:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think there there will be many many many uses of SHIELD beyond gaming (ex. remote vehicle controller) that are yet to come to light. This list will get long, I am certain, because of the utility of the hardware and the open standard the platform provides. My guess is NVIDIA will spotlight these on their website when there is a critical mass. NVIDIA has done a very interesting thing by giving developers a new tool or canvas if you will. I can even imagine a DOD (quadro) version for the military operating all their remote devices . . . My advice is be patient, the thing isn't even shipping yet! And I don't think "consumers" are the target yet. There are going to be bugs to work out, new firmware to upload, new generations and features that got missed, and new, lower price points to reach. So for today enthusiasts are the best audience. But it's certainly going to be interesting in the next year or two, imho. I hope that many other ODMs repackage SHIELD with different features and price points and that this platform becomes a defacto "i-Interactor" or "i-Controller" standard.</Msg><Username>schmenkle321</Username><Timestamp>1369855690898</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 15:28:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369855822831-10</Id><Topic><Title>Re: look for an increase in screwish activity over the next 30-40 days</Title><Username>screwherbes</Username><Timestamp>1369398384547</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-24 08:26:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm guessing now about 15-17 days left of screwish manipulation down and then we head back up</Msg><Username>screwherbes</Username><Timestamp>1369855822831</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 15:30:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369859995532-11</Id><Title>HP SlateBook X2 to be launched in Europe in late July</Title><Msg>SOURCE: Unwired View By Florin on 29 May 13 While HP’s first Android tablet – the 7 inch Slate – is far from being impressive (it’s an entry-level device after all), the company’s second effort, the SlateBook x2, carries a whole different story. It’s a 10 inch Full HD hybrid tablet powered by Nvdia’s latest Tegra 4 quad-core processor. The SlateBook x2 will be released in the US sometime in August, and it looks like it’s going to hit shelves a bit earlier in Europe. According to MiniMachines, HP France has indicated that the SlateBook x2 would be in stores staring late July. Prices will start from €449 – detachable keyboard dock (with a second battery) included. HP has yet to clarify if we’re going to see a SlateBook x2 with cellular connectivity or not. In any case, the tablet will come with Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean, Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n, stereo speakers, DTS sound technology, HDMI, front and rear cameras, ”up to 64 GB of storage” and MicroSD card support. unwiredviewDOTcom/2013/05/29/hp-slatebook-x2-to-be-launched-in-europe-in-late-july/ ____ Revenues from this win should be recognized in Q2.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1369859995532</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 16:39:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369860247343-12</Id><Topic><Title>Re: look for an increase in screwish activity over the next 30-40 days</Title><Username>screwherbes</Username><Timestamp>1369398384547</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-24 08:26:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>screw boy is working the fibonnacci correction ratios...</Msg><Username>screwherbes</Username><Timestamp>1369860247343</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 16:44:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369860470836-13</Id><Title>Researchers bring in graphics supercomputer for a breakthrough against HIV/AIDS (NVIDIA's graphics, of course)</Title><Msg>venturebeatDOTcom/2013/05/29/researchers-marshall-graphics-supercomputer-in-the-fight-against-hiv/</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1369860470836</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 16:47:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369868515178-14</Id><Topic><Title>HP SlateBook X2 to be launched in Europe in late July</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1369859995532</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 16:39:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Does it use fans to cool it down.
