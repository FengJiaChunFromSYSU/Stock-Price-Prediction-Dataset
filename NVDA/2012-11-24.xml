Which might happen soon, as Washington is peering over the Fiscal Cliff. “Fiscal cliff” is the popular shorthand term used to describe the conundrum that the U.S. government will face at the end of 2012, when the terms of the Budget Control Act of 2011 are scheduled to go into effect. Among the laws set to change at midnight on December 31, 2012, are the end of last year’s temporary payroll tax cuts (resulting in a 2% tax increase for workers), the end of certain tax breaks for businesses, shifts in the alternative minimum tax that would take a larger bite, the end of the tax cuts from 2001-2003, and the beginning of taxes related to President Obama’s health care law. At the same time, the spending cuts agreed upon as part of the debt ceiling deal of 2011 will begin to go into effect. According to Barron's, over 1,000 government programs - including the defense budget and Medicare are in line for "deep, automatic cuts. If the current laws slated for 2013 go into effect, the impact on the economy could be dramatic. While the combination of higher taxes and spending cuts would reduce the deficit by an estimated $560 billion, the CBO estimates that the policies set to go into effect would cut gross domestic product (GDP) by four percentage points in 2013, sending the economy into a recession (i.e., negative growth). At the same time, it predicts unemployment would rise by almost a full percentage point, with a loss of about two million jobs." Here. You boys can get a free education about the Fiscal Cliff.

About the Genuine Intel Bay Trailer-T mobile chip. It's an x64-bit processor too. With the 64-bit data bus width speeding 17GB/sec of throughput to the lucky user. So it can run all of the Millions upon Millions of x86 Windows software titles. Fast. Which those ARM chips, well, can't. At any speed. Oh, and the "-T" after Trailer? It apparently stands for "Tablet."

[We] estimate that NVIDIA’s smartphone applications processor revenue share has been stagnant at 2 per cent from Q1 2011. We believe NVIDIA continues to miss the large addressable market as it currently lacks baseband-integrated applications processors.” ----------------------- Although it still leads the smartphone applications processor sector, Qualcomm is coming under increasing pressure from the likes of Broadcom and MediaTek in the low-end Android smartphone market. Guy Daniels reports. The global smartphone applications processor market showed an impressive 55 per cent year-on-year growth in the first quarter of 2012 to reach $2.47 billion, according to a new report from Strategy Analytics. It adds that the supply chain continues to show significant dynamism, reflecting on-going changes in the smartphone manufacturer sector. According to the report, Qualcomm led the smartphone applications processor market in both unit and revenue terms with a dominant 44 per cent revenue share in Q1. Qualcomm was followed by Samsung in second place, Texas Instruments third, then Broadcom and MediaTek. But despite holding on to its lead, Qualcomm is feeling the pressure from competitors, as senior analyst Sravan Kundojjala explains: “Qualcomm maintained its lead position in the smartphone applications processor market in Q1. Qualcomm’s revenue share dropped to 44 percent in Q1 2012 from 51 percent in Q1 2011 as a result of expanding market size and intense competition from Broadcom and MediaTek in the low-end Android smartphone market Strategy Analytics believes Broadcom and MediaTek are emerging as credible threats to Qualcomm with their baseband-integrated applications processor strategy.” The report explains that MediaTek made it into the top five for the first time thanks to strong sales in the sub-$200 smartphone segment in China and other growth markets. Marvell dropped out of top-five rankings as a result of weakening position of its primary customer, the BlackBerry manufacturer RIM, despite strong TD-SCDMA shipments to China Mobile. Another company that failed to get in to the top five was ST-Ericsson. However, the company is showing signs of improvement thanks to 600 per cent sequential revenue growth in Q1 mainly due to its Nova and NovaThor-branded applications processors proving popular with tier-one OEMs. Strategy Analytics believes NovaThor baseband-integrated applications processors have the potential to be a strong alternative to Qualcomm’s Snapdragon processors. One of the perhaps surprising omissions from the rankings is NVIDIA, as Stuart Robinson, director of the Strategy Analytics handset component technologies service, explains: “Despite its strong momentum in the tablet applications processor market, NVIDIA’s market share continues to be a concern. [We] estimate that NVIDIA’s smartphone applications processor revenue share has been stagnant at 2 per cent from Q1 2011. We believe NVIDIA continues to miss the large addressable market as it currently lacks baseband-integrated applications processors.” Stand-alone applications processors continue to gain share and accounted for 44 percent of total smartphone applications processors shipped in the first quarter of 2012, up from 39 per cent in the previous year. The new report estimates multi-core processors accounted for about 30 per cent of total smartphone applications processors shipped in this last quarter.</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1353801465161</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-24 18:57:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353803064986-17</Id><Topic><Title>Tablets to outsell notebooks this quarter and next year in the US</Title><Username>ibexx88</Username><Timestamp>1353724522233</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 21:35:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>had a chance to play with the winRT yesterday.

"online retailer NCIX had sent out emails to their pre-order customers that the Asus Transformer Prime had been delayed worldwide and will most likely not be available before Christmas due to Asus believing the WiFi range doesn’t meet their standards and has thus delayed all shipments of the device." Asus denied and denied and denied, of course. And then confessed days before Christmas that the tablet had WiFi problems. And that it wouldn't be available before Christmas.
