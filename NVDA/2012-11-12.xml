MarketWatch, citing South Korean daily newspaper Chosun Ilbo, reported on Sunday that Samsung has increased the price of mobile processors supplied to Apple for use in its iDevices by 20 percent. Chosun Ilbo apparently heard about the price hike from an unnamed person familiar with negotiations between Apple and Samsung. "Samsung Electronics recently asked Apple for a significant price raise in (the mobile processor known as) application processor," the source said, according to MarketWatch. As could be expected, the new price didn't initially sit well with Apple. "Apple first disapproved it, but finding no replacement supplier, it accepted the (increase)," the source added. The new price has already taken effect. Apple buys all application processors used in the iPhone and iPad from Samsung, totaling about 130 million units last year and more than 200 million units this year, the report notes. Samsung has a long-term contract to supply the component to Apple until 2014.

Revenue climbed to a record $1.2 billion for the quarter, while GAAP EPS was 33 cents per share, analysts estimates were $1.19 billion in revenue and earnings of 30 cents. For the current quarter, Nvidia expects revenue of $1.025 -1.175 billion, analysts were expecting $1.2 billion. Nvidia also achieved record gross margin in the third quarter, driven by strong demand for their energy-efficient Kepler GPUs and Tegra 3. I will make this simple, the analyst community and investors have been worried about Nvidia’s future prospects considering that demand for PC’s is declining, which is causing everybody to make the assumption that PC’s will eventually go away. That’s not going to happen, but even if it does Nvidia still benefits. Here is why. Nvidia caters to gamers first and foremost, the company focuses on the high end. Nvidia gets no revenue from low end PC’s, that’s all integrated graphics produced by Intel. This segment of the PC business is low margin, so Nvidia isn’t missing out on much. There will always be gamers, and so there will always be a need for Nvidia’s high end GPU’s. Whether these are running servers in the cloud or running PC’s outside of the cloud, it doesn’t matter. The future is cloud computing, but it will be a decade before that fully takes over most PC’s. When that happens, you still need a GPU somewhere. It’s not like the cloud is some magical place that has its own graphics processing power. This is more of a transfer of product location, than a demise of the GPU itself. The GPU side of Nvidia’s business is going to remain important for years and years to come. It’s still growing, but the growth potential over the next 5-10 years isn’t tremendous, it’s just stable. Nvidia recognized several years ago that it must look to expand into mobile because that is where the real growth potential lies. They designed the Tegra processor and now the third generation of Tegra is powering major tablets like Microsoft’s new and very popular Surface tablet, as well as Google’s Nexus 7. Tegra 3 is also in many new smartphones on the market. To show you how Nvidia is moving into areas outside of the PC, 3 years ago, non-PC revenues were 7% of total revenues. This quarter, they grew to a record 30%, mostly because of their Tegra business. Tegra 3 is the best mobile processor on the market, beating out Qualcomm which makes the Snapdragon processor, Apple’s A5 chip, and Intel’s Atom chip. I have seen this story before, once Nvidia gets the edge it maintains it. continued........</Msg><Username>soma022</Username><Timestamp>1352780314406</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 23:18:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>14</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352780358749-61</Id><Topic><Title>Article on Nvidia</Title><Username>soma022</Username><Timestamp>1352780314406</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 23:18:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>As I mentioned, Tegra 3 is in many new tablets and smartphones on the market. But these are two different segments. Nvidia’s tablet sales are up 100% year-over-year, their Tegra processors overall is up about 50% year-over-year. This means that more growth is coming from tablets rather than smartphones. This is because Nvidia is missing one key element in its smartphone offering, an integrated 4G LTE modem. The vast majority of smartphone manufacturers are looking for an integrated product offering, and so Nvidia can’t really compete until they have a next-generation application processor integrated with a next-generation LTE. They have that now, and the company is releasing it this quarter. Nvidia will now be able to expand their smartphone opportunity quite dramatically, it could be very significant for them. Tegra is a business that could grow well over 50% each year. When you combine that with the fact that Nvidia’s GPU side of the business is still growing, this is a company that is being very overlooked right now. One thing I want to point out, Nvidia’s CEO Jen-Hsun Huang says consumers are now starting to realize that a great tablet is better than a cheap PC. Since these low end PC’s dominate the market, it’s understandable why people say that PC’s are going away. They are, but it’s on the low end as tablets are just better. But as I said, Nvidia doesn’t compete in the low-end PC segment of the market, that’s all integrated graphics. So if this segment of the PC business is in decline it doesn’t hurt Nvidia. But what people are overlooking, is the death of low end PC’s is a huge win for Nvidia. If a product you sell is taking over market share of a product you don’t sell, that’s a huge win in my book. They will now be able to pick up business from these high end tablets that are replacing these low end PC’s, in other words, the cannibalization of PC’s by tablets works in Nvidia’s favor. It just opened up a huge new door for the company. Nvidia expects tablet sales to be down this quarter because most of the tablets go into production well before November. Meaning Nvidia shipped most of the tablet processors to manufacturers last quarter as these OEMs prepared for their holiday build. This is also a timing issue as Nvidia’s 4th quarter doesn’t begin October 1 like most companies, rather it begins in late October. Most OEM’s usually want suppliers to ship in October to meet the year-end demand. continued....</Msg><Username>soma022</Username><Timestamp>1352780358749</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 23:19:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>14</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352780395065-62</Id><Topic><Title>Article on Nvidia</Title><Username>soma022</Username><Timestamp>1352780314406</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 23:18:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Here is a quote from Nvidia’s CEO during the conference call that gives a good summary of Nvidia’s future prospects: Well, I could tell you what our focus is. Our focus is to build the world’s best mobile computers. And to do that, you need to have a great SoC, you need to have a great GPU, and you need to have extraordinary software capability. And there are multiple platforms: there’s Android, there’s Android phones, there’s Win RT, there’s Linux, there’s Chrome, there’s Windows 8 phone, there’s quite a few platforms. And we have the capacity as a company, both technologically as well as resources, to be able to partner with many of these companies, these ecosystem owners, to build these great computers. And you’re right, we’re not going to win them all. But as you can see, we win our fair share. And we’re winning more and more every day. We won about 100% more this year than we did last year. And my hope is that we’ll win even more next year. And every time we expand the reach of our company into new platforms, and this year was Win RT, it really expanded the reach of our company and expanded our growth. And so we’re just going to keep — stay focused on that. And one of the attributes of our company is technology leadership. You can trust us, to partner deeply with us, to build these complicated devices. And I think that’s a real virtue. With respect to the size of the PC TAM you’re alluding to, and what I also believe and now what the world has seen, that a great tablet is every bit better than a cheap PC. And that is the reason why tablets are gaining the favoritism of consumers all over the world. It’s easier to use, it’s more delightful to use, and it’s more useful. And the cheap PC market represents probably a couple of hundred to 200 million units a year. The vast majority of the world’s PCs are affordable PCs, as you know. They’re cheap PCs. And that segment is now wide open, as these mobile processors have become more and more capable. And you know that disruption comes from the bottom. The disruption comes from the bottom because the volumes are so high. In just 2 years’ time, this year, we’ll probably ship around 30 million Tegra processors. And that just happened in the blink of an eye. And that’s — and yet there’s enormous markets ahead of it. And so once an instruction-set architecture like the ARM CPU reaches critical mass and the developers all focus on it, it becomes more and more valuable. And it becomes more useful. And as more companies drive and compete in this ecosystem, in this marketplace, we make the SoCs better and better. And before you know it, it disrupts the market above. And the market above is — directly above the tablet is the cheap PC market. And so that’s a big opportunity for us, especially now with Win RT. And so I’m super excited about it. In summary, forget what you read about the demise of the PC, it’s only happening at the low end. Nvidia doesn’t compete in that space, but now that tablets are taking over, this actually works in favor for Nvidia. Most analyst and investors can’t see that. But in a few years time, when Nvidia is the dominate mobile processor manufacturer, it will become perfectly clear.
