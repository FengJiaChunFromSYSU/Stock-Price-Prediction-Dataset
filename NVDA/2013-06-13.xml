Today it was "AMD in red" before AMD closed UP for the the Day and Week, while Nvidia is still DOWN for the Week. Keep making a fool of yourself while pretending to be a know it all. The only thing you know about trading is that YOU CAN LOSE MONEY BEING CLUELESS.

Jen Hsun had said on numerous occasions that NV would NOT sell products or product or product categories that already exist in the market." See how he pretends to know what Jen would do as if he speaks for Jen? He likes to pretend he knows something which is the funny part since the junk he post PROVES he knows nothing. Remember "Little guy selling" when you pretended that buying Nvidia at $16.01 weeks before Nvidia dropped to $8s was brilliant? I remember and its still good for a laugh.

Nvidia thinks the handheld Shield will compete with Xbox and PS4 consoles. Good article with quotes from peterson. The only thing they're not saying is this is the Google Shield! Pushing the Android platform as a straw man. But Shield in the future could become an alternative to consoles as gaming on Android gains popularity and graphics hardware improves, Petersen said. Android is being widely adopted, there is a growing gaming developer base, and titles will be less expensive in Android stores, Petersen said. “If Android gaming continues to get better—that’s our goal and that’s what we’re spending a ton of money to do—the differentiation of a console becomes less and less. Sooner or later you’re going to hit this inflection point,” Petersen said.</Msg><Username>nvdarocks</Username><Timestamp>1371159400331</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 17:36:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371164342732-45</Id><Title>According to engadget, Microsoft is giving away 10K surface RT tablets.</Title><Msg>Even then nobody will want these useless things.
