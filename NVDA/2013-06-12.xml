The semiconductor design firm's products are everywhere at E3, even if they aren't always front-and-center on display. AMD's Jaguar CPU core is baked into both the PS4 and Xbox One and its FirePro graphics cards are powering the Apple Mac Pro. Apple isn't giving specs on the cards yet but refers to them as offering up to seven teraflops of procCesing power and 6GB of VRAM. That puts the cards somewhere between W8000 and W9000 GPUs -- the listed configuration is a bit more powerful than the W8000, but the W9000 in pairs would offer 8TFLOP of processing power, not seven. Powering the Xbox One and PS4 isn't likely to earn AMD a huge uptick in profits immediately (Rory Read has forecast the entire embedded business as accounting for perhaps 20% of AMD's revenue in 2013), but it's a critical path to returning the company to profitability in the midterm. Long term, AMD's business could benefit from a halo effect. Game programmers working on next-generation titles are going t0 be working on AMD graphics cards and CPUs. Anchoring the first Mac Pro refresh in years gives the company a leg up into that business. AMD's stock value has nearly doubled since late April, from a low near $2 up to about $4. That increase reflects the company's recent launches in desktop, server, and mobile products. With Kabini looking like a strong mobile part in tablets and laptops and AMD's first low-power servers ready to go up against ARM and Atom, the company is enjoying something of a resurgence. Then 5GHz CPU demo today is icing on the cake -- provided you like 220W icing, at any rate."

The tech in xbox one and ps4 will be available to build into your own PC so there is nothing special about the hardware that would make me choose it over the PC at this point. I think this is where NVidia understands what gamers want. There may be a few exclusive titles on the consoles but most of them will be multiplatform because the install base is going to be small especially with the 4 and 5 hundred entry price with you then need accessories for. It will be interesting to see how many people really upgrade to the new gen. Already the hardware is no match for the PC so they will fall behind even more every year and they are not even out yet. not sure how many hard core gamers are going to want to make that investment but we will see. In any case, these consoles in no way to me signal the end of PC gaming at all. I think NVidia made the right decision by not spending R&amp;D on the consoles this time around. The mobile space will be a much higher volume business for them. I think they have a big second half of the year.</Msg><Username>neo_trinity1020</Username><Timestamp>1371055265918</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-12 12:41:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371055545265-14</Id><Topic><Title>why do i need a ps4 or xbox one?

Nvidia doesn't seem happy with news that Advanced Micro Devices has all but won this generation's console cycle. The company pointed out Wednesday in an interview with The Verge that, while the next-generation consoles are notably more powerful on the graphics side, they still can't compete with the chips Nvidia is producing on the PC side. "I'm glad the new consoles are here," Nvidia Senior Vice President Tony Tamasi told The Verge. "If for no other reason than to raise the bar." He also pointed out to The Verge that his company's graphics cards can deliver more than two times the graphical performance of the PlayStation 4, which runs AMD's technology. AMD's chips are running in both the Xbox One and PlayStation 4. Nintendo even chose to go with an AMD chip in its Wii U. That leaves Nvidia out in the cold. But Tamasi and his team believe on the PC side, with its higher-end processors like the GeForce GTX Titan, Nvidia is pushing the gaming space forward. It's no secret that PCs have delivered better graphics than consoles since the very beginning, as long as power users bundle the right equipment into their machines. It's also no secret that Nvidia could have profited greatly off this generation's console market. But it won't."

Nvidia had YEARS in between the Xbox and Xbox One to sneak SHIELD into the market. Nvidia had YEARS in between the PS3 and PS4 to dump SHIELD on us. But what does Nvidia do? Nvidia chose to ttake on Microsoft and Sony ON THEIR TURF AND AT A TIME OF THEIR CHOSING. 2013 is the year Sony and Microsoft RELOADED with NEW Game Consoles. Nvidia was probably angry that Sony and Mucrosoft rejected Nvidia for their competitor, so they went off like some kid on the play ground to errect a SHIELD Toy. To late, the window for JUNKIE Pocket Toys has closed, PS4 and Xbox One Pre-Orders are "through the roof". Nvidia is CLUELESS.
