Perhaps "overbought" was a poor choice of words. I merely meant that as, "hey, it just gapped up and there will probably be a dip or two that could be a better entry point". I am long (and not planning to sell), but if I were looking to add, I'd hold off until things cool off a bit. I don't like chasing.</Msg><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1368423916789</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 01:45:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368447979178-3</Id><Topic><Title>Nvidiots really think nexus loss is a none event</Title><Username>chrisssable</Username><Timestamp>1368400238478</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-12 19:10:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>U guys r big fool.

Last I checked, it may be heading down . Bulls can be super cocky when it makes super rally. That day will come when Nvidia really turn around. Now?

But it will definitely hold $13. there was years of resistance there, it took several attempts to go through that level, and now it has the 50 and 200 day converging to that level if it were to pull back. (but it won't...... the fundamentals are undoubtedly improving). and one more side note, anyone that points to the revenues this quarter or guidance for next quarter, clearly doesnt understand the transition from Tegra 3 or the magnitude of management's tremendous decision to pull forward the 4i to become a player in a new, gigantic market (smartphones). dont buy if u dont want, but shorting this particular company makes no sense...........</Msg><Username>sdhoff144</Username><Timestamp>1368453003433</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 09:50:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368454721956-6</Id><Title>Selling stocks is more important than buying</Title><Msg>Sold JCP for a quick 7% gain.

What exactly are you going on about? Some facts for you: In the last year, AMD GPU sales were down, but they say that's because the PC business is declining. Yet NVIDIA just announced GPU sales up 8% Y to Y. NVIDIA is building a campus with spare cash AMD just sold their Austin campus to make sure they have enough money to finish the year. I admire AMD, they have brought a lot of tech to the x86 market (such as 64 bit), and competition for Intel and NVIDIA is good. But as an investment, based on facts, they look pretty shaky to me. I know AMD has created another rough spot for themselves in GPU with their well documented issues with studder and runt frames (look at PC Perspectives if you are so clueless as to not know what this is about). Is your frustration with AMD driving you to post endless fact less derogatory statements? Or are you paid to do this? Honestly I am curious, as I can't figure out any reason other than employment and mental illness that wold cause someone to spend so much time posting the same old tired stuff as you do.</Msg><Username>really_chris</Username><Timestamp>1368472734376</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 15:18:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368472981812-54</Id><Title>If Today was an AMD vs Nvidia Fight they would have Stopped It</Title><Msg>Todays action is not even close.

It is a fact; Just about 12 months ago AMD was at $8 per share. Since you seem a bit slow, so let me explain slowly. The point there is that you can pick convent time periods to show a NVIDIA price drop, I can pick the same for AMD. What matters is going forward, and the facts I listed are relevant to theses companies future. I say "if" to illustrate a hypothetical situation. It's a common thing among adults. Now if I wanted to be more emotional, and fact less (like you) I'd assume all AMD fans bought their stock above 8$ a share (just like you like to assume that all NVIDIA supporters bought theirs 16 or 26 or whatever servers you at the time. You know the saying about assumptions, or maybe you would not.. Maybe you have been posting bs for so long you can't tell the difference. I just stop by here from time to time to see what is here (have for 10 years), and am saddened to see how low some (such as yourself) degrade the quality of discussion here. As I asked before, I can't understand why you spend so much time here posting such nonsense, unless: 1) you are paid to do so. Which I find it hard to believe that posts such as yours really influence anything, so who would pay for that. 2) You are a deranged AMD fan. Yea, I know runt frames and all, it's a tough year for the AMD GPU guys.

NVDA is a certified heart breaker - I wish the stock performance could match the hype. It did for a while when they came out with Tegra-2 few years ago. I think it doubled in a few weeks. But the market is tired with PC chip companies. I am actually surprised that NVDA has relatively underperformed both AMD and INTC and so was glad to take 14.5 for now. BTW, I was spot-on calling carrier certification challenges. And I can now confidently state that NVDA has been overplaying their hand with soft-modem story. Its hard for a programmable solution to beat a purpose built ASIC - thems just the facts.</Msg><Username>o.investor</Username><Timestamp>1368483871497</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 18:24:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368484276789-81</Id><Topic><Title>Get real</Title><Username>o.investor</Username><Timestamp>1368203462628</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 12:31:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>what was that Romney line - in s free market there are winners and losers, you sir just happen to really good at picking the losers. you are akin to an unlicensed quack - peddling your dribble for a few clicks. you would have been relegated to ignore list but for the entertainment value you provide.</Msg><Username>o.investor</Username><Timestamp>1368484276789</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 18:31:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368487601793-82</Id><Title>#$%$, Down 2%!!

The price is rising now only because the bullish environment allows some investors to take a huge gamble on what amounts to a penny stock. You aren't losing that much if you buy below $5. Let me put it another way, I would have considered AMD a good buy at the sub-$3 level, and at the current price I'd either hold just a little bit longer or sell it off now. I'd NEVER buy AMD at the current stock price . . NEVER. You do realize you are on a message board for NVDA don't you? So why the strong buy? Obviously, you are into AMD big time, not sure if you get the concept of the sentiment disclosure when you are the wrong message board. In case people are wondering, I'm a BUY for NVDA, not AMD :).</Msg><Username>roundhouse_c</Username><Timestamp>1368502760237</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 23:39:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message></Date>
