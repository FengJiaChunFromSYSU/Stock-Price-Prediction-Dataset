For those that follow my work, you know that I am very bearish on Nvidia as I believe they have no real future product that differentiates themselves over their competition in any of their niches. I reiterate that stance, no matter what the stock has done in the last couple of months, fundamentally the company is on a treacherous path to the future. Aside from the embarrassing miss on the Tegra 4 announced at the earnings report. If anyone believes that the Tegra 4 was pushed back because of the Tegra 4i, then I fear for your money. Moreover, they are now completely on the outside of the game development loop as the driving force behind gaming will be x86-64 and it will be driven by what AMD, Microsoft and Sony want. Nvidia says it didn't want the console wins, but that's pure marketing. If it had a competitive solution, it would have put in a bid for the business, especially considering that selling the SoC directly was on the table this time, not just designing and licensing the graphics technology."

Nvidia, which I have been bullish on due to its dominance of the graphics cards field, is about to shoot itself in the foot with a bizarre portable game console that is designed as a hybrid Android and portable PC gaming platform. Why am I so convinced that the Nvidia Shield will be dead on arrival, and fail to dent the handheld market dominated by Sony (NYSE: SNE) and Nintendo (NASDAQOTH: NTDOY.PK)?. Nvidia Shield is destined to fail due to its high price, bizarre form factor and limited software selection. While the Shield might be used by some consumers as a media center, thanks to its HDMI connectivity, or become an all-in-one homebrew and emulation device for hobbyists, it is unlikely to achieve mainstream popularity, simply because gamers are already accustomed to Nintendo and Sony’s more established consoles. Meanwhile, mobile gamers are more likely to stick with their smartphones and tablets for Android gaming. If the Nvidia Shield fails, it wouldn’t be a devastating loss for the company, since it only reportedly spent $10 million on R&amp;D for the product. Yet I’m baffled as to whom the product was intended for and why Nvidia felt the need to challenge Sony and Nintendo, when it should simply concentrate on churning out graphics cards and mobile CPUs.</Msg><Username>moochelebut</Username><Timestamp>1369236154588</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 11:22:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369237940525-9</Id><Topic><Title>As the Tegra 4 UNIT HEAD departs HQ the Smart Money is Fitting Tegra 4 for a PINE BOX</Title><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1367439867707</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 16:24:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hey, if anyone sees a loose Tegra UNIT HEAD wandering around in the wild DON'T send it back to Nvidia.

I’m impressed. Here are the eight reasons to buy Xbox One. Faster Hardware: Xbox One is powered by an eight-core processor. The processor is based on Jaguar design by AMD. The processor is customized for DirectX 11.1 graphics and contains 32 MB ESRAM memory. The system supports 8 GB of RAM, but RAM does not appear to be GDDR5 as in PlayStation 4 from Sony . There is a Blue-ray drive, 500 GB of hard drive, a USB 3.0 port and fast Wi-Fi using IEEE 802.11n standard. Watch The Video: Microsoft Xbox One Event David M. Ewalt David M. Ewalt Forbes Staff Improved Kinect: Kinect allows the user to control the Xbox with gestures. The new Kinect appears to be much improved. It supports 1080p wide angle camera. The motion sensor also has been improved to detect even the slightest motion. The camera can see in the dark using infrared. Voice Control: There is a new multi-microphone array, advanced noise isolation, and ability to control Xbox with your voice. Second Screen: Xbox One allows your tablet or phone to act as a second screen. The second screen can intelligently interact with the Xbox and allows for smooth navigation. Exclusive NFL Agreement: Microsoft has announced an agreement with the National Football League for exclusive content. Together, Microsoft and the NFL plan to deliver a unique interactive experience through Xbox to the users. Built-in Skype: Skype is built-in the Xbox allowing for easy video calling. EA Sports Ignite: Electronic Arts has announced that there will be new titles from Madden, MMA, NBA, and FIFA using a new engine called Sports Ignite.

The two firms announced at the Citrix Synergy event that Citrix's XenServer will support virtual machines running directly on the GPU in the next release, due in the third quarter of this year. XenServer is Citrix's virtualisation technology that underpins the XenDesktop VDI platform. XenDesktop also runs on VMware and Microsoft's Hyper-V, but this GPU support will initially only be availble for deployments based on XenServer. Nvidia's general purpose GPU compute (GPGPU) development has thus far been largely aimed at high performance computing (HPC). However, the firm is now aiming at the enterprise market with its Grid GPU virtualisation technology. The firm unveiled its Grid VCA appliance at the GPU Technology Conference in March in order to support its Grid VGX virtual desktop software. At that event, the firm said it was working with hypervisor vendors to allow virtual machines to run directly on the GPU rather than on the CPU. A technology preview of XenDesktop with support for Grid virtual GPU will be released this quarter, according to the two firms. Nvidia said it is working with other hypervisor vendors including Microsoft but that integration with Citrix's Xenserver was proceeding the fastest. Nvidia is pitching its Grid VGX as a high performance virtual desktop that supports 3D rendering and offers the graphical capabilities of a standard local desktop. The Grid VGX software only works with its latest generation Kepler GPU cards. .............
