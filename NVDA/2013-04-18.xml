They said they would purchase the shares before end of year. In other words they can purchase everything before Q4 or earlier if desired. Hoewever they are probably careful not to create an artificial bubble where they push up the stock price with their purchases. If they bought all almost at once (one extreme) then they could probably push the pps to 15 with the strong buying pressure and momentum traders on the stock. Hence the stock would not be all cheap to purchase anyway. After their buying subdues the traders and shorters will have a strong oppertunity to knock the pps down again and the charts will look ugly again. So stretching out the purchases through a longer period gives a more stable and believable rise to the stock pps. Perhabs they even only purchase in down days on Nasdaq to provide the stable floor and to avoid putting oil on the fire in the up days. I look forward to other poeples' insight on this matter. /Frank.</Msg><Username>frankduxbusborg</Username><Timestamp>1366269512533</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 03:18:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366289541963-2</Id><Topic><Title>Stock buybacks</Title><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1366245635935</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-17 20:40:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Another thought that occured to me is that perhabs they finance much of the buybacks from the cash flow??

If they do it the same way each quarter, the investment banker is essentially short the stock during the settlement period. Essentially using ASRs Nvidia's investment banker is short the stock during the settlement period. Kind of upside down don't you think? Of course I could be missing something or completely off base. Most companies that do doing stock buybacks are active in the market when the prices are right as you describe.

Those that are unwilling to buy back short calls for 3 or 4 cents, may be quite surprised when we're at that level, again. There are still 3.5mm shares short via those calls, and very few have been bought back between yesterday and so far today. I used to deal with these kinds of positions, and I can tell you that there's no way I'd stay short to save that small a premium. As always, we'll see in the fullness of time.

Is the 5.7" monster with Tegra 4 inside?</Title><Msg>SOURCE: GSMINSIDER ZTE must be satisfied with its ZTE Grand S design as another device with the similar design spotted in China. The device is known as the ZTE N988 and no official name yet. This ZTE N988 has been approved by Telecommunication Equipment Certification Center MIIT in China. ZTE N988 is another flagship level device from the Shenzhen based company. The display size of ZTE N988 is 5.7-inch which is similar to the ZTE Grand Memo and the resolution is 1280 x 720 pixels. The 5.7-inch phablet has a quad-core processor that clocked up to 1.5GHz and 2GB of RAM. The processor could be the NVIDIA’s Tegra 4 or Qualcomm’s Snapdragon. ZTE N988 has a front camera of at least 8-megapixels and above while the front camera is a 2-megapixels shooter. Therefore, the camera could be a 13-megapixels shooter as well. Other specs include Bluetooth, USB, a MicroSD slot, GPS, FM Radio and etc. The ZTE N988 runs on Android 4.1.2 Jelly Bean and comes in three colors include black, white and red. ZTE N988 is an ultra slim and a super light device as it only has 6.9mm thickness and the weight of 110g. This device isn’t tailor-made for any carrier in China as you can’t find any carrier logo on the device. The ZTE N988 has the similar display size like the ZTE Grand Memo but the design isn’t the same. From the rear view, it is indeed similar like the ZTE Grand S. But the camera lens and the LED flash are parallel with the back cover. This must be something new from the Chinese company and could be the first Tegra 4 handset. gsminsiderDOTcom/2013/04/18/zte-n988-spotted-in-china-with-tegra-4-insid/</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1366308015625</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 14:00:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366308309189-7</Id><Topic><Title>#$%$ Intel</Title><Username>nvdarocks</Username><Timestamp>1366307867337</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 13:57:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>To be fair, Intel has entered (or about to enter) the network switching market place.

They will also be a major player in mobile, along with Nvidia and Qualcomm. It's not baloney. There's a reason I own both Intel and Nvidia. Intel for dividend + modest growth, Nvidia for deep value/potential outsized growth/dividend growth.

Possibly the first Tegra 4 tablet</Title><Msg>Although the Nvidia Tegra 4 was announced quite some time ago, there’s not one single product with this CPU on the market. One of the first seems to be the Toshiba AT10, a tablet that has just reached the FCC, so it’s approaching launch time. Aside from this model, other units have leaked, like the Toshiba AT15 REGZA and Toshiba AT502, which could be the same Tegra 4 device, but for various international markets. They rely on a quad core 1.8 GHz Tegra 4 processor and run Android 4.2.1 Jelly Bean. There’s no exact specs list for these models, while the launch may happen at IFA 2013 at the end of the summer. The Toshiba AT10 could debut first, in Japan for example, where early launches are a common thing. The official documents published so far seem to say that the device comes with WiFi 802.11 a/b/g/n support, Bluetooth 4.0 and NFC. It appears that the product will be made by Pegatron and the design involves rounded corners.

(we could've told you)</Title><Msg>We reviewed the Google Nexus 10 tablet here and while we did like the display and the camera, it appears that the general public didn’t think the same thing. The Nexus 7 was seen by us as the tablet of the year 2012 and now there are some sales estimates out there to detail the success of the Nexus slate series. Industry watchers such as Benedict Evans are the right people to judge the sales of the tablets from the Nexus series. Made by Samsung, the Nexus 10 went on sale in November last year and it was the first Android 4.2 tablet on the market, premiering the multi user feature and also premiering the way Jelly Bean looks on a 10 inch diagonal, which is something we criticized in our review. Evans claims that there are around 6.8 million Nexus tablets sold and only 10% of that are Nexus 10s, meaning the device shipped around 680k units. Apple is said to have sold in the range of 10 million iPad Minis and keep in mind that we’re talking about a device that’s not typical for Apple, a cheaper and smaller one. Google is said to already be working on a Nexus 10 with an improved CPU and GPU, while next month we may see a Nexus 7 2. Will those be able to get better sales?
