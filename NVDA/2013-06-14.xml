Club3D to Become Exclusive Partner of AMD, Set to Cease Selling Nvidia-Based Products [06/12/2013 11:53 PM] by Anton Shilov Club3D, one of the leading graphics cards suppliers in the European Union, said Wednesday that it would exclusively sell graphics cards based on Radeon HD graphics processing units from Advanced Micro Devices. While the company did not say it directly, the announcement means that Club3D will no longer sell products based on Nvidia Corp.’s GeForce chips. “We are showing our commitment to AMD because we believe that AMD is ideally positioned to deliver a complete solution to our customers, and after 16 years in the business offering solutions from a variety of processor partners, we truly believe that we can offer a better solution going forward with AMD alone,” said Judith Ma Tseng, chief executive officer of Club3D. Back in the early and mid-2000s graphics cards suppliers sold exclusively either ATI- or Nvidia-based graphics cards. Large manufacturers, such as Asustek Computer or Gigabyte Technology, dropped exclusivity in 2003 – 2004 timeframe and since then offered their customers products based on chips from both developers. Mid-tier vendors ceased to be exclusive during the economic downturn of 2007 – 2010. One of such companies was Club3D. While the market of graphics cards is essentially stagnating and offering all kinds of products is an indisputable trump, the company now decided to go AMD-exclusive without any explanation. Perhaps, AMD managed to make Club3D and its main affiliate, Tul Corp., an offer they could not refuse. As a result, AMD Radeon HD will gain market share in Europe." source: xbitlabs</Msg><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1371185768446</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 00:56:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371206994067-4</Id><Topic><Title>NVIDIA CEO sees sales of chips to cars increasing to $1 billion</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1371175676730</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 22:07:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"How do you model Tegras?"</Msg><Username>whosunw</Username><Timestamp>1371206994067</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 06:49:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371216619117-5</Id><Topic><Title>PS4 and Xbox One are ONE and TWO on Amazon's Best Seller List. lol</Title><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1371055117743</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-12 12:38:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Guess what?
