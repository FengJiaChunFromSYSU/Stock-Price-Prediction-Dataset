Intel's Xeon Phi landed at the Supercomputing 2012 (SC12) conference and scored some impressive wins, including a cluster being placed in seventh place on the prestigious Top 500 list. Despite Intel's impressive entrance, Nvidia told The INQUIRER that it validates what Nvidia has been saying about accelerator based HPC performance and brings in new potential customers. Sumit Gupta, GM of Nvidia's HPC business unit sees Intel's entrance as an opportunity to capitalise on a big brand validating accelerator based HPC computing. Gupta said, "We are delighted to have Intel in the market. If you think about it, until a year ago Nvidia was the only company trying to convince everybody to move to this accelerated way of computing and it's a hurdle. If you have the leading company there, Intel, telling everyone 'no no no, CPUs are going to get better', it is much harder to keep growing the market. Now Intel is telling everyone the same thing, [...] they are basically saying you have to use an accelerator and obviously they will promote their accelerator." With Intel backing accelerators as the way to increase computing performance in clusters, Gupta said more of the market is seeing accelerators as a viable option for clusters. Gupta said, "So what we've seen actually happen is the pace at which this market is growing has dramatically increased. In the past I would always run into customers that would say, 'I am not going use GPUs or accelerators', now every one of those customers is saying, 'of course I'm going to use accelerators', and they are going to do a bake-off between us and Intel." Gupta admitted that Nvidia won't win every customer, adding, "Obviously Intel is going to win a few." However Gupta said Intel's presence has in many ways made it easier for the firm to do business in this market. "We were a very small portion of the HPC market, now the entire HPC market is addressable, because every customer at [SC12] was telling us they are going to use an accelerator and they going to benchmark both and try both, and they all realise that programming both the accelerators is exactly the same because they have tried it," said Gupta. Intel's brand brings in a lot of business and credibility even in the hard-nosed world of HPC, and its decision to get into the accelerator business is likely to help Nvidia as Gupta mentions. While Intel might have increased Nvidia's potential market, the challenge for Nvidia is not simply winning business but iterating its product cycle fast enough to keep on track with Intel. Even though Nvidia's Tesla K20X powers Titan, the highest performing cluster on the Top 500 right now, Intel's track record of ramping up performance is formidable, and given that it already has a cluster in the top 10, Nvidia will need to ensure that it has the performance to overcome Intel's hardware and branding</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1353652290130</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 01:31:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353652545721-2</Id><Title>NVIDIA: The Opportunities Ahead</Title><Msg>NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA ) has struggled in recent months largely thanks to a continuous drumbeat of bad news in the PC space. Yet, the company has worked hard to diversify its business away from PCs and toward mobile devices and high-end workstations. To help investors sort out the risks and opportunities facing NVDIA, we've created a new premium report on the company. Below is an excerpt from the report which breaks out some of the opportunities facing the company. We hope you enjoy this sample of the report. The opportunity While the company remains a leader in the GPU market, there's less growth in the broader PC market than in NVIDIA's formative years during the rise of the PC. NVIDIA has three primary operating segments: graphics processing units (GPU), professional solutions business (PSB), and consumer products business (CPB). The GPU segment remains the bulk of sales, but the other two have significant potential upside in the years ahead. Perhaps the most exciting growth prospects that NVIDIA has are in mobile chips, where the company aspires to challenge dominant incumbents like Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) . This business is included in the CPB segment. NVIDIA launched its Tegra family of ARM-based mobile processors in 2008. Since then, these chips have become a force to be reckoned in the mobile chip market. NVIDIA was the first company to unveil a quad-core mobile applications processor, the Tegra 3, which incorporates four ARM Cortex A9 cores alongside a fifth "ninja" core for low-power tasks. Tegra 4, code-named "Wayne," will utilize ARM Cortex A15 cores for dramatic performance improvements. When NVIDIA proceeded to acquire small baseband specialist Icera for $367 million in cash last year, it was an unambiguous indication that NVIDIA was hoping to exactly replicate Qualcomm's value proposition. Qualcomm has done remarkably well for itself by selling mobile applications processors bundled with discrete baseband modems as well as processors with integrated basebands. In February, smartphone maker ZTE announced the Mimosa X, which was the first device to utilize a Tegra processor alongside an Icera baseband. This isn't quite a blockbuster device in terms of unit volumes, but it was a milestone in itself for NVIDIA's mobile strategy. A few months later, NVIDIA announced that a new Icera LTE modem was validated for AT&amp;T's LTE network, paving the way for future design wins destined for Ma Bell's network. The next important move for NVIDIA will be to integrate cellular connectivity directly into its Tegra chips. The company announced these chips, code-named "Grey," a year ago, and was hoping to have them hit the market in 2012. Unfortunately, the time frame of these processors has now been delayed and they won't be launched until 2013. Qualcomm currently remains the only player with an integrated LTE solution, an advantage that the company is capitalizing on. NVIDIA has had tremendous success in tablets, scoring numerous high-profile design wins within the non-Apple segment of the market. Google selected the Tegra 3 for its Nexus 7 tablet, and Microsoft's Surface RT tablet similarly uses one. Windows RT, which supports ARM-based chips, is a major opportunity for NVIDIA for even more tablet growth with other OEMs. Microsoft is imposing restrictions on ARM chip makers and only "allowing" each to select two hardware partners for Windows RT. NVIDIA has selected Lenovo and Asus, two respectable OEMs. Incidentally, Asus also builds the Nexus 7. For now, NVIDIA is gaining more traction in tablets than smartphones, a trend the company sees continuing in the near future. Despite several flagship smartphone wins, like the HTC One X, it still doesn't rank in the top five smartphone processor companies when ranked by revenue. The launch of the Tegra "Grey" chips could help change that.</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1353652545721</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 01:35:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353654016497-3</Id><Title>HTC One X+ (Factory Unlocked) Black Friday Deal</Title><Msg>See expansys-usaDOTcom/htc-one-x+android-smartphone-unlocked-237901/ Happy Holidays!</Msg><Username>findingnemoyes</Username><Timestamp>1353654016497</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 02:00:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353654074301-4</Id><Title>nvdia is worth more than hp</Title><Msg>nvdia is worth more than hp I sold all my hp and bought nvda</Msg><Username>nvdia26er</Username><Timestamp>1353654074301</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 02:01:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353669696138-5</Id><Topic><Title>Nvidia says Intel's Xeon Phi helps it win new business</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1353652290130</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 01:31:30 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>'and they all realise that programming both the accelerators is exactly the same because they have tried it," said Gupta.'

Why is Intel doing this if x86 is dominating as you mentioned? 1. Please list all the ultra-mobile products that Atom is in? How many years has Intel been trying? 2. ARM is dominating the ultra-mobile sector. 3. x86 is bloated with legacy issues and will never reach the performance per watt, and cost advantages of ARM. 4. As remote as it is, I merely listed a possible scenario that Intel would purchase Nvidia based on the lack of market penetration in the ultra mobile sector.

The company which is known for its high-end PC graphics chips is in the midst of a transformation. It is a mobile strategy that the company hopes can help it not only compete more effectively with the likes of Qualcomm and Texas Instruments, but also set the company on a sustained path towards growth – except, Wall Street isn’t buying the story. Will Growth Today Be Gone Tomorrow Image representing NVidia as depicted in Crunc... Makeovers occur all the time on Wall Street. However, in the case for Nvidiabears believe that the company is too far behind the competition to make a meaningful dent in the market. This is whether or not its transition into mobile is considered a success. The thought is, if it yields little market share, what would have been the point? This is the same concern that is plaguing Intel. Nonetheless, that it was able to beat on both the top and bottom line in its most recent quarter, Nvidia appears determined to prove doubters wrong. The company generated net income of $209.1 million, or 33 cents per share on revenues of $1.2 billion – exceeding analysts’ estimates of 30 cents per share as well as revenue projections of $1.1 billion. Interestingly, the better than expected performance was the effect of growing demand for the company’s line of Tegra chips. In other words, Nvidia is already doing what doubters proclaim it can’t. The company is figuring out ways to grow market share and outperforming (among others) rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices. On the other hand, that the low end of the company’s revenue guidance was 17% below analysts’ estimates left investors wondering if the momentum can be sustained, even though it would still represent double-digit growth. In other words, as well as the company might be performing today to the extent that both margins and income are showing annual and sequential improvement, this guarantees nothing in terms of the company’s market position in the future. A Good Bet, But Failure Is Not An Option I like Nvidia’s chances. But evidence suggests that what the company is attempting to do, which involves moving away from its legacy graphics business into mobile processors is not going to be easy. As noted in my opening, the space is already crowded with rivals with designs wins from prominent customers such as, Google and Microsoft. But equally important for investors to consider is that Nvidia risks alienating its core business during the transition. While I do believe it is a worthwhile gamble, it is one that will come at a cost if Nvidia fails. This is the “bird in the hand theory.” For instance, one of the most impressive aspects of the company’s Q3 results was that Nvidia’s graphics business did pretty well. This is despite the chronic spread of PC “doom-and-gloom.” While the PC business is still seeing meaningful erosion from mobile, it says a lot that Nvidia can still outperform in that category. So I questions the company’s full rush to mobile without having fully capitalized on what is left of its (yet popular) graphics business. Although Nvidia has made some good progress so far, failing is not an option as it could signal the end of the company – particularly since two-thirds of its revenue still comes from its PC graphics business. For now, the company to betting everything on is Tegra line of mobile processors – a system on chip (SoC) that integrates many of the features of the ARM architecture into one package. It comes with features including low power consumption and high performance – making it one of the best chips on the market today. Bottom Line With the stock making new lows after dropping 11% following its earnings report, investors want to know if now is a good time to jump in. Or are the bears correct in their belief that Nvidia lacks the ability to convert from what it has been known for? The jury is still out on this one as it is going to take some time for either side to proclaim victory. Although the company is finding it difficult to convince Wall Street that it can successfully transform and remain profitable, investors who are willing to believe in Nvidia’s story may be able to capitalize on a good turnaround candidate – one that now pays a respectable yield.</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1353681294961</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 09:34:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353682461810-10</Id><Title>Intel buys U.K. graphics chip team</Title><Msg>LONDON – Intel is paying $50 million to multimedia hardware company Creative Technology to license certain patents belonging to Creative subsidiary ZiiLabs Inc. Ltd. and to acquire its U.K. subsidiary ZiiLabs Ltd., formerly known as 3DLabs Ltd. The move by Intel Corp. (Santa Clara, Calif.) is said to be part of efforts to de-emphasize the use of PowerVR graphics cores licensed from Imagination Technologies Group plc (Kings Langley, England) in future Atom processors. The deal includes $20 million to Creative Technology Ltd. (Singapore) for the licensing of technologies including ZiiLabs graphics processing unit (GPU) technology and $30 million for the acquisition of the U.K. based design team. This design team is engaged in, primarily on behalf of ZiiLabs Inc. Ltd., the development of ZMS chips for Creative. Creative acquired 3DLabs Inc. in 2002 for about $170 million, at the time the company was a Nasdaq-listed developer of graphics chips for workstations but with much of its engineering base still in the U.K.. In February 2012 Creative began sampling the 100-core ZMS-40 media processor aimed at Android platforms with high graphical and multimedia processing requirements (see ZiiLabs samples 100-core HEVC chip). "Moving forward, it will be more cost effective for Creative to outsource to third-party contract chip-layout houses on future advanced chips for its products, while at the same time allowing Creative to focus on its core strength - the designing and marketing of more innovative and exciting products for our customers," said Sim Wong Hoo, CEO of Creative Technology, in a statement. "We will be engaging in discussions to further monetize this valuable collection of 100-plus patents," Sim Wong Hoo added. Under the terms of the deal ZiiLabs Inc. Ltd. will remain a wholly-owned subsidiary of Creative and will retain ownership of the StemCell media processor patents and will continue to supply ZMS chips. Intel and Creative have been collaborating on an advanced motion-sensing camera and are in discussions on technology for media-rich tablet products, Creative said. The Creative transaction is expected to close before the end of 2012. Interestingly 3DLabs licensed its entire patent portfolio to Intel in 1999 for about $7.5 million.</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1353682461810</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 09:54:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353685392188-11</Id><Topic><Title>Is Intel acquisition of Nvidia possible?</Title><Username>o.investor</Username><Timestamp>1353430809659</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 12:00:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>“Intel will always be behind with the bloated legacy x86 issues that will not be able to break the long-time advantage ARM has in pricing, and power savings.” I’m not so sure that you are correct.

Bay Trail-T is the follow-on for Intel's Clover Trail platform, but with a number of improvements. First, it is based on 22-nanometer architecture as opposed to Clover Trail's 32-nanometer architecture, which, according to the roadmap, means half the power consumption. The leaked Intel documents suggest that video battery life is up, from about 9 hours for Clover Trail to more than 11 hours for Bay Trail-T hardware. The number of cores have also been bumped from two to four, though since Intel has ditched Hyper-Threading the number of threads stays at four. Despite this, the core increases, combined with a clock speed boost from 1.5GHz to a far more respectable 2.1GHz, offer a 50 to 60 percent performance improvement. Bay Trail-T also offers support for 3D cameras and USB 3.0. The processor is also fully compatible with Windows 8. Powering the graphics side of the SoC is the HD 4000 chip found inside the Ivy Bridge processors, which offers DirectX 11 support, display resolutions up to 2,560 by 1,600 pixels, and boosts performance by at least three-fold. This puts Bay Trail-T well ahead of both Clover Trail and ARM's Cortex-A15 platform.

Intel generally goes it alone and will build their own alternative instead of buying a competitor. In the end, they produce an acceptable alternative that is good enough, but not one that excels. For most users and manufacturers, "good enough" will suffice when you offset the cost differential. However, with NVDA, Intel has to be concerned that if they don't buy the company, someone else could and instantly becomes a competitor - or greater threat. While NVDA languishes at the current ridiculous valuation, that threat continues to exist and grow in my mind.</Msg><Username>o08o.ugh64w</Username><Timestamp>1353687128906</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 11:12:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353688175327-17</Id><Topic><Title>Nvidia says Intel's Xeon Phi helps it win new business</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1353652290130</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 01:31:30 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"We are delighted to have Intel in the market", purports Sumit Gupta, GM of Nvidia's HPC business unit.

Intel Xeon Phi 5110P cluster tops Green 500 list Nvidia needs to take note By Lawrence Latif Thu Nov 15 2012, 14:52 CHIPMAKER Intel has seen the Xeon Phi accelerated Beacon cluster claim top spot in the Green 500 list. As AMD and Nvidia celebrated their position at the summit of the Top 500 list that ranks publicly known high performance computing clusters based on Linpack performance, Intel scored what many would claim is an equally important Victory. Appro's Xeon powered Beacon cluster that features Xeon Phi 5110P accelerator cards topped the Green 500 list. Intel will be particularly happy with its top billing in the Green 500 list, which divides the Linpack performance number by the cluster's power usage to produce a MFLOPS/W value. Appro's Beacon cluster scored 2,500 MFLOPS/W, almost 150 MFLOPS/W higher than the second place cluster and over 250 MFLOPS/W higher than the AMD and Nvidia powered Titan cluster that sits on top of the Top 500 list. Appro, which was bought by Cray last week, is only one of four vendors including Cray to make it into the Green 500's top 10. Most of those systems are IBM Bluegene clusters that use 16-core Power processors, though Cray and Appro take three of the top five spots, with Adtech coming in at number two on the list. Nvidia could rightfully claim that the interconnect, the wires that connect the nodes in the cluster, is different. Appro's Beacon cluster uses the mature Infiniband interconnect while the two Cray clusters that feature Nvidia's Tesla K20 and Tesla K20X accelerator cards use Cray's leading edge Gemini interconnect that could see future improvements to reduce power utilisation. Intel's Xeon Phi accelerator doesn't boast the same double-precision floating point peak TeraFLOPS rating as Nvidia's Tesla K20X, however given that the Xeon Phi *** already has higher power efficiency than the Nvidia accelerator cards *** its future looks promising. µ Numero Uno, boys. THE Genuine Intel Xeon Phi 5110P accelerator cards. For the #1 Best, most power-efficient HPC computing. 250 Million more Flops per Watt versus the gas-guzzling nvidia Tesla K20X.

Sounds like another slam-dunk winner just as they have touted for the past years. I remember Intel made a number of very optimistic assertions regarding Larrabee that went no where. Of course it has now evolved into into something much bigger that will threaten Nvidia's HPC business and rule the world?

The Bay Trailer-T with its (1080P30, H.264, 64-bit, 17 GB/s LPDDR3, 2.1GHz, quad-core processors) will decimate any hopes of Project Denver’s viability in the future from tablets,PC, to server markets. In the mobile arena today, between Apple and Samsung they practically own 50% of the world smartphone/tablet markets and there is 0% chance of Nvidia getting any slice from these two since both are using their own processors (Samsung Exynos, Apple A6X). I think, in general, Nvidia’s demise will come from its inability to have any meaningful advancement in LTE modem technology and to incorporate such LTE advancement into its SoC which is a requirement today. In other words, in my view the Icera modem is far behind in technology as compared to the Qualcomm’s MDM(s) and the Nvidia SoC is also far behind to Qualcomm Snapdragon with its embedded modem technology. In my opinion, the Intel XM7160 LTE baseband is far more advanced than Icera. It will give Qualcomm MDM9615 a run for its money where Icera still lacks behind. This is one of the reasons why TI has exited from the mobile market because they simply cannot compete on baseband technology in SoC. Therefore, I am now inclined to believe that Intel Bay Trailer-T will capture the remaining 50% of the mobile market eventually and as well as major portions of the PC and server markets from Project Denver.</Msg><Username>cj_observer</Username><Timestamp>1353691617097</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 12:26:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>17</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353694947011-21</Id><Title>weak Close...+8 cents.</Title><Msg>All indices soaring, Naz up 40, Dow +173,,,,NVDA a disappointing closing up 8 pennies.

Go ahead and keep posting here since you have 'some' solid information even though it's really slanted to one side and isn't really as objective as you make it out to be. In the posts I've seen by you, there's an omission or maybe lack of understanding of how important the software side of the equation is. Nvidia has always maintained and will continue to maintain one of the best teams for the critical software/firmware that maximizes the performance of all their chips. Intel has always been lacking in that area, at least in graphics.</Msg><Username>roundhouse_c</Username><Timestamp>1353696175388</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 13:42:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353696324075-23</Id><Topic><Title>weak Close...+8 cents.</Title><Username>uppauaz</Username><Timestamp>1353694947011</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 13:22:27 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Okay, that's the best you got on a half day?

The acquisition of icera was announced when? May 9, 2011 At the time of the announcement the nvidia press release gushed that, "NVIDIA announced today that it has agreed to acquire Icera, a [purported] leading innovator of [purportedly] top-performing baseband processors for 3G and 4G cellular phones and tablets.". And the currently anticipated date for the long long delayed nvidia Grey chip, -- with hopefully that icera modem finally on board -- is when? "Within a one year time frame", said Jen, in November 2012. So let's assume November 2013 for the long long delayed launch of nvidia's integrated processor + icera on-board modem. That's How long, from acquisition of icera to goods delivered? Hummm? 2 years, 6 months. At best. That's a loooong time, right boys? It sure is. 2 years, 6 months. Why, that's a Very Very Long Time, actually. To simply attach icera's purportedly top-performing baseband processors for 3G and 4G cellular phones and tablets -- to the same piece of silicon as the tegra chip. Separately, does anybody know? Just how long it takes Jen to put up his Christmas tree every year? And attach those top-performing lights and top-performing ornaments, of course.
