Comparing the two microarchitectures in Figure 7, that is a highly plausible claim as out-of-order scheduling alone should be worth 30% and perhaps 5-10% for better branch prediction. Additionally, the 22nm process technology has reduced Vmin by around 100mV, and increased clock frequencies by roughly 20-30%. In total, this paints a very attractive picture for Silvermont. To cement this view, Intel compared Silvermont to Saltwell for tablets, showing performance data suggesting a 2× increase in CPU performance at constant power or a 5× reduction in power. Intel also claims a 60% performance and 3× power over projections for competing 28nm tablet SoCs expected later this year. In the more abstract realm of CPU to CPU comparisons, Intel indicated that Silvermont is a much faster design than the Cortex A7 or the A15 at any given power level; the goal is to avoid any complicated and high latency software-driven power management and rely on firmware-based management and power gating. As a design point, this is a good choice and follows in the steps of Apple’s Swift or Qualcomm’s Krait, which are undeniably successful CPU cores. " p.s. remember that to accommodate the traditional x86 CISC power handicap Silvermont is still a 2-way issue processor like A9 but not like A15, S600/S800, Swift. However the performance of those CISC commands boosted by macro-fusion of these commands allows the performance not to suffer against a 3-way ARM device. Intel has made the right performance/power tradeoffs at the right process size something that cannot be said about ARM A15 at 28-32nm which is too power intensive to be used flat out in a phone.</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1367929375357</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 08:22:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367931848694-8</Id><Topic><Title>Syria exepcted to bomb US weapon suppplier to terr or group in I s rael</Title><Username>screwherbes</Username><Timestamp>1367931087794</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 08:51:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Your anti-semitic political postings are always emailed to yahoo!.</Msg><Username>transatlantic2013</Username><Timestamp>1367931848694</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 09:04:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367932062747-9</Id><Topic><Title>Intc.

PS3 came out how long ago? So many things have changed since PS3 came out. Mobile was not what it is today. PC's were still good and Tablets were not that popular yet. Pretty much all the things that are going to DESTROY the consoles from here on out were not part of the picture yet. Jen is simply changing with the times. At that time PS3 was a great opportunity, but if you fall in love with old technology you die along with it (the PC is a perfect example of how being tied to old dieing technology is bad). Jen realizes that consoles are ultimately not the future and maybe learned his lesson not to count on old tech to power future growth. Is the PS4 a good opportunity? ABSOLUTELY, but its not a game changer and its not revolutionary in any way.</Msg><Username>manski14</Username><Timestamp>1367970895882</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 19:54:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367971002943-36</Id><Topic><Title>nvda got nothing going for it</Title><Username>trikormeat</Username><Timestamp>1367960820020</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 17:07:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>AMD has better GPU's than Titan?

Google isn't run by small children who would miss what was being done there." Uh, The CEO of Nvidia DOES NOT REPORT TO Google. Let Google listen in to the call if they want and SO WHAT? lol Its public information. The CEO of Nvidia can TALK UNTIL BLUE IN THE FACE ABOUT Tegra because Tegra is an Nvidia product and Google don't get a say about that. IMHO Did Tegra sales gain traction in the quarter? Did Tegra add any new design wins? Is Tegra 4 making progress and is it on track for launch? Nvidia can answer or not answer those questions WITHOUT using the word Google if they want. And BTW just like suppliers shouldn't announce OEMs products, OEMs shouldn't announce they've dropped suppiers, that is for the supplier to say or not. imho</Msg><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1367971325676</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 20:02:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367971843720-38</Id><Topic><Title>Jen was so happy that he was "THRILLED" to work on the PS3 and now what? lol</Title><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1367941896163</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 11:51:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"No XC. the answer is no."
