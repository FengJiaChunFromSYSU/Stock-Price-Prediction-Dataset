The whole Office suite, including Outlook, should have been ready for Windows RT at launch. And multiple SoC vendor support as well. The early PR "leaks" prepared the market for the lack of application support, but the lack of hardware ecosystem continues to be a surprise. A year ago rumors that only Nvidia could get Windows-on-ARM working were being dismissed as speculation. Since then Microsoft has put high-profile efforts behind getting at least Qualcomm SoC support, including the big budget CES event (which was very nearly an announcement of Windows RT support). I don't think that many would have predicted a year ago, or even at CES, that Tegra would still be the sole processor working with Windows RT (sales: approximately zero) or still in the most popular Google tablet (the Nexus 7, still selling quite well). We have multiple vendors that can make working chips, which is an easy metric that the market quickly responds to. But the software side is increasingly difficult, and the market doesn't seem to price that rationally.</Msg><Username>watergatefive</Username><Timestamp>1372682616548</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-01 08:43:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372682835440-6</Id><Topic><Title>The recently released Ouya selling on eBay for a less than the $99 msrp</Title><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1372682098012</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-01 08:34:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>On eBay listing says: "Ouya Video Game Console (Kickstarter Edition) USED ONCE!"

It used two A15 CPUs and a Mali 604 GPU. However the software support (an OpenCL implementation) wasn't released until after its successor was announced, and that part dropped the Mali 604 GPU. I'm speculating, but it appears that the thermal envelope, power input envelope, memory bandwidth, 32 bit address space and lack of communication combined to limit the effectiveness of this as a power efficient compute platform. Of course none of the hardware specs matter if you don't have a software environment, and that was where it really feel short. Nvidia's CARMA and Kayla development kits were more useful. They are Tegra 3 chips paired with a GPGPU. So not at the same as an SoC, rather positioned as demo systems for upcoming SoCs. The Tegra 3 is unique in its class in having PCIe. This allowed hooking it up to an external GPU, mitigating many of the problems faced by the Exynos. Both the CPU and GPU can use power simultaneously, there is twice as much chip cooling, the GPU has 2GB of dedicated high bandwidth memory (only part of which is mapped into the limited CPU address space at a time) and they have PCIe connected 1Gb Ethernet (rather than the marginally usable USB connected 100Mb on the Exynos 5 'Arndale' board). And, of course, the big part was that CUDA support was there when it was announced. Since then there has been a steady stream of CUDA-on-ARM.announcements, providing confidence that this won't be a one-off chip that's abandoned a few months later.</Msg><Username>watergatefive</Username><Timestamp>1372698140596</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-01 13:02:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372700654498-23</Id><Topic><Title>SoC's with parallel processing technology?</Title><Username>morrowltd</Username><Timestamp>1372689801487</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-01 10:43:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>so after so many years of whacking at it, which phone or tablet has adopted this tech? this company reminds of McNut/Sun Micro while it was still alive and before Ellison put a stop to all that nonsense.

Because Altair Semiconductor isn't obsessed with securing a deal for Apple's iPhone or another mobile giant's flagship smartphone, it just might have a shot. The company, based outside Tel Aviv, sells chips that only work on the latest mobile-data networks using technology called 4G long-term evolution (LTE). By just targeting the high-end networks, Altair avoids the expenses of designing complex chips that must operate on all of the other existing cellular standards and paying patent royalties to competitors such as Qualcomm. And that allows Altair to sell its chips at a lower price. Why ain't Jen doing something like this? He can't compete with Qualcom.....that's for sure.

But every serious vendor will need an in-house design to put onto their SoC, so eventually the company or IP will be bought for a big profit.</Msg><Username>watergatefive</Username><Timestamp>1372711648690</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-01 16:47:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372712128805-31</Id><Topic><Title>Another Nvda boot'n #$%$ by the Juice</Title><Username>poundhouse_c</Username><Timestamp>1372703776106</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-01 14:36:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>along the same line of thinking, I think mrvl has something in their pocket - outside brcm and even higher extent than qcom, mrvl has an totally integrated connectivity chip with all the radios, including GPS and NFC. If mrvl willing to part with that, meaning shut down their app proc biz altogether, I am sure that that integrated connectivity chip fetch a healthy $ - for intel, nvda, or samsung. Just that mrvl is too big a biz to benefit from the sale of just that biz.</Msg><Username>whosunw</Username><Timestamp>1372712128805</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-01 16:55:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372714008364-32</Id><Title>BROADCOM #$%$-slapped whosunw by dropping 60 cents while</Title><Msg>NVDA was up.

Rob Enderle experiences the joys beyond traditional gaming. There has been a lot of talk this month about the gaming system Google is planning to roll out. In the meantime, I’ve been living with the Android gaming system built by Nvidia which is called “Shield." Shield was recently delayed to fix a hardware component problem (better to get it right before it ships rather than have to do a recall) so I figured I’d talk about some of my experiences and why this thing is worth waiting for. ""The Unlocked Game System" One of the first things I noticed was how inexpensive the games are. Indeed, many are $2 which is a hell of a lot cheaper than games on a console or proprietary game system. Plus, you can plug this into your TV if you want a big screen experience. However, I was just fine with playing this as a handheld. The reason the titles are so inexpensive? Game makers don’t have to pay a hefty fee to Nvidia to support the system. While this makes the system more expensive, it also results in games that are a fraction of the cost. The closes analogy is an unlocked Smartphone connected to a low cost carrier, you get similar service to one of the big guys for a fraction of the cost. I didn’t find that one iconic title like Halo is for the Xbox but I found a ton of games that were fun to play. I expect higher end titles will show up after this game system ships because developers will then have something to build these games for. It is really a great deal of fun and the controller felt good in my hand, something I’ve never gotten out of a PlayStation (I think Sony designs for really small children).

While not a Boombox by any stretch of the imagination, it does actually fill the room with sound far better than any cell phone, tablet or even laptop (except maybe one of the old big gaming laptops from Alienware). This is impressive sound and it is a wonder they can get it to come out of suck a small device. "HD Movies" This actually puts out a really nice image, I’ve watched the new Oz movie and Identity Thief on it. You can download the movies onto the device and either watch them on the small screen or use a HDMI cable, or wireless, to connect to a big screen and watch the HD movie from across the room. You could use this much as we used to use portable DVD players while traveling. "Drone Pilot" But the most fun I’ve been having is flying an AR Drone. This is a relatively affordable personal drone which is designed to work off of Android or IOS. The drone is amazing because it has ground sensors which allow it to hover in place and auto land. This can be handy because if you’ve ever flown an electric helicopter, particularly a big one, you’ll find the first few landing experiences expensive (you’ll likely wreck the copter). No such issues with the AR Drone. It even tryst to compensate for wind and it is really easy to fly. With the built in camera feeding the screen and the actual physical controllers on the Shield Pad it is as if this thing was made to be a drone controller. It is just a ton of fun. Later on this week I’m going to try and reenact a scene from the Green Hornet (the old TV Show) and see if I can launch the drone from my trunk. Granted the Green Hornet Drone looked more like a flying saucer. It is also a handy way to check what is going on with my roof solar panels or scare the #$%$ out of squirrels. The combination is just a ton of fun.

It has been a ton more fun than I expected it would be and I’m now thinking of ways I could customize it and make it uniquely mine (it will come with skin options). If I figure something cool out I’ll share pictures in a future post, until then you’ll find me patrolling my neighborhood with my AR Drone and Shield. It’s going to be a great summer!</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1372727080331</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-01 21:04:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372727529462-38</Id><Topic><Title>NVIDIA Got nothing to show, sheild what?</Title><Username>nofearyet</Username><Timestamp>1372539905190</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-29 17:05:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This sounds as a stupid empty message.

The descriptions read: used 5 minutes, used 30 minutes, used once, booted once, ..., you get the idea. And these "new other" Ouya consoles are selling for less than the $99 msrp because that is what the market is willing to pay when over 100 users dump their Ouya on eBay at the same time. And Ouya will have some eBay competiton soon if Nvidia ever gets it act together and ships SHIELD. SHIELD will be on eBay soon after it ships and if Ouya is any indication, with the bidding starting at 99 cents just like Ouya and also just like Ouya it will sell for a lot less than $299.

Not even Nvidia is out talking up Project Shield Out Until Repaired (SOUR) Lemon today, Nvidia's crack QA team already has enough EGG ON THEIR FACE to last the rest of the year for letting defective parts make it all the way to launch day -1. Are you trying remind QA how embarrassing launch day -1 was for them? QA over at Nvidia must stand for Quit Acting, because we know you clowns ain't testing those parts. And don' t laugh because the same QA Team is responsible for testing the REPAIRED SHIELD. Even Nvidia's management know its time to shut up and FIX SHIELD first and don't even think about pumping a BROKEN SHIELD now. Do Nvidia a favor, follow management's lead this time and put a sock in pumping a BROKEN SHIELD.
