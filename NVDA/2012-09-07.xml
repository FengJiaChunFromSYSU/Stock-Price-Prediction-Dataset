Buy the news of a loss.</Title><Msg>. . Tegra: Sell the rumor of a “win”. Buy the news of a loss. . On most of Wall Street, it’s “Buy the rumor, Sell the news”, right boys? Let’s say it’s rumored that an oil company has discovered a new oil field . Buy the rumor. And sell the skyrocketing stock when the news is actually announced. A pretty straightforward approach to accumulating multi-generational wealth. But nvidia is different. Oh so different. You see, the nvidia Tegra chip Loses money. Like clockwork. Yep. They’ll lose about (-$700 million) on $500 million of Tegra sales. Just this year alone. Keep in mind this predictable pattern has been going on for several years now. (They cost about $60 bucks to make, and they sell ‘em for about $25. At best.) Hence the unusual situation of Losses being bigger than total Tegra Revenues. Well, you can’t keep a secret on Wall Street for long, don’t u know. And many of the more astute investors have discovered this phenomenon. And now SELL nvda on the rumor of a Tegra platform “win”. And BUY nvidia on the news that they have in fact, lost. Which, in the most recent contest for the Amazon Kindle #2, was to Texas Instruments. . Just take a look at the nvidia chart for proof. Earlier this week it was widely rumored – heck, outright Hyped by the paid pumper boys on this board – that the Tegra would “win” the Kindle #2 for sure. And Wall Street responded with palms vigorously waiving outwardly above head, -- As in Sell nvidia. And nvda stock Plunged (-6%) on the rumor of a Tegra “win”. Today, the Truth came out that the nvidia Tegra had indeed lost. And lost Badly. To the aforementioned Texas Instruments OMAP processor. Folks bought nvda – mostly in relief -- on the news that the Tegra had lost. And the already Elephantine Tegra losses wouldn’t become even Bigger. At least not this week. Did I mention? The best approach to accumulating multi-generational wealth. Tegra: Sell the rumor of a “win”. Buy the news of a loss. . .</Msg><Username>oh_so_best</Username><Timestamp>1346995528886</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 01:25:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>21</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346996824809-6</Id><Topic><Title>Reuters reports that NVIDIA's miss in Amazon KF2 surprises many investors</Title><Username>ibexx88</Username><Timestamp>1346990010874</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 23:53:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>patrick wong is a total _______ , you guys fill in the blank :) . . he is supposedly totally surprised at the 'miss' by Nvidia here and probably thinks the company should declare bankruptcy now . .</Msg><Username>roundhouse_c</Username><Timestamp>1346996824809</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 01:47:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346997573630-7</Id><Title>Playcast media brings cloud gaming with Geforce Grid</Title><Msg>Do a google search.

Intel cuts sales outlook on weak PC demand; shares fall Reuters – 7 minutes ago. In excerpts . (Reuters) - "Intel Corp cut its third-quarter revenue estimate on Friday and withdrew its full-year forecast amid a decline in demand for its chips as customers reduce inventory and businesses buy fewer personal computers. A revision of targets had been anticipated by many analysts after competitors such as Hewlett Packard and Dell Inc warned of slow demand for PCs last month, a development that has been compounded by a shaky global economy and consumers shifting toward tablets and smartphones. But the cut by Intel, the world's largest chipmaker, was much more severe than analysts had expected. The company said it now expects third-quarter revenue of $13.2 billion, plus or minus $300 million, down from its previous forecast of $13.8 billion to $14.8 billion. Analysts on average expected $14.2 billion. Intel is due to report its third-quarter results in October. Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said the magnitude of the warning was surprising, adding that it was a worrying new sign that Intel is seeing weakness in PC sales to businesses and governments, known as enterprise sales. "They also have weakness in enterprise PCs in emerging markets. In the last six to eight quarters, consumers have been weak but the enterprise was strong. Now the enterprise is weak," he said. Intel's warning comes at a time when PC makers should be gearing up to build more computers than usual ahead of the launch of Microsoft Corp's Windows Phone 8 operating system. Intel has been banking on the Windows 8 release in October to help slow the trend of consumers buying smartphones and tablets instead of personal computers. While a major Windows release normally boosts computer sales, MKM Partners analyst Daniel Berenbaum said it might not help as much this time. Along with concerns about consumer demand being hurt by the weak economy, Berenbaum said PC makers are reluctant to build up a lot of inventory because they are not sure whether notebooks or tablet computers will sell best. "You're trying to decide are people going to buy convertible form factors, a tablet that slots into a keyboard, or are they going buy traditional notebooks or ultrabooks," he said. "In the absence of knowing what to sell, there's a clear reluctance to build any sort of further inventory." Intel's processors are used in 80 percent of the world's PCs." . Don't nvidia's GeForce graphics processors -- and Quadro and Tesla too -- hitch-hike along with those Intel PC processors? They sure do. Those nvidia graphics parts are pretty worthless without the Intel PC processor. And it looks like global demand for Intel PC processors is falling off a cliff here. My my my. Perhaps you boys have invested your hard-earned cash in the wrong company. . .</Msg><Username>todays.best</Username><Timestamp>1347031165938</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 11:19:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347032400148-46</Id><Title>NVDA future not too bright</Title><Msg>NVDA should start a dividend for stock stability they are burning up too much money on r&amp;d and acquisition with little shareholder return I am still short and feel much better about low 12s or even 11s when market corrects</Msg><Username>o.investor</Username><Timestamp>1347032400148</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 11:40:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347032944121-47</Id><Title>Yawn....what a sleeper</Title><Msg>Just get it over with and tank into the mid 12's today, shorties makin a killin this week!</Msg><Username>stocktrader4444</Username><Timestamp>1347032944121</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 11:49:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347032999174-48</Id><Title>Jen's guidance.

We asked Nvidia for an official comment and this is what we got. “It’s good to see companies continuing to use Tegra 3 as the standard they compare their products to. The immensely popular Nexus 7 has shown the capabilities of the Tegra 3 processor. You can’t measure the consumer’s overall experience with synthetic benchmarks. A better way to measure is with real world apps and use cases. Tegra 3 has shown time and time again that it delivers a great experience for consumers, whether they’re gaming, streaming video or using other apps. Igor Stanek – NVIDIA Senior Product PR Manager EMEAI “ It is interesting that Nvidia didn’t go to benchmark wars, as according to our experience Tegra 3 is quite fast, especially on Jelly Bean Android 4.1. Surprisingly Nvidia took the higher ground knowing that being in Google Nexus 7 or Microsoft Surface, it gets inside two out of three important platforms, the third being Apple’s iPad of course. So, Nvidia is choosing user experience and eternal love and happiness over the traditional bigger-number-is-better approach. We will take the OMAP 4470 for a spin as soon as we get our hands on an 8.9-inch Kindle Fire, but the OMAP 4460 inside the 7-inch Kindle Fire HD is likely to end up slower since it’s pretty much the same chip that we tested in Galaxy Nexus last year. It ends up significantly slower in most benchmarks than the latest flagship phones.</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1347041202879</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 14:06:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347041322048-69</Id><Topic><Title>Is NVDA too good to be true?</Title><Username>allenjoe3624</Username><Timestamp>1347038719194</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 13:25:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>amazing stuff</Msg><Username>georgelockhart32</Username><Timestamp>1347041322048</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 14:08:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347042337774-70</Id><Topic><Title>what the heck is a pc?</Title><Username>barc37000</Username><Timestamp>1347037923055</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 13:12:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Interesting to get another Apple win today!

An XDA-Developers forum member posted some details about the One X+ on his Twitter account Friday and said that the new smartphone will be equipped with a Tegra 3+ quad-core processor clocked at 1.6GHz, a 1,800 mAh battery, 1GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. The device is also expected to be skinned with Sense 4.5 atop Android 4.1 Jelly Bean. The rumored battery in the One X+ is something of a disappointment, since earlier rumors hinted that the handset would feature an improved battery and not the same 1,800 mAh battery that appeared in the original One X, but hopefully other optimizations will stretch out its performance. source yahoo news tech</Msg><Username>inthemoney69</Username><Timestamp>1347046698046</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 15:38:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347047813039-81</Id><Topic><Title>htc one x+ specs: tegra3?</Title><Username>inthemoney69</Username><Timestamp>1347046698046</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 15:38:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Lets hope there's not going to be another last minute switchero.

Nvidia slides after downgrade and Intel guidance Nvidia slips after analyst cuts rating on stock and Intel cuts 3rd-qtr revenue forecast Associated Press – 52 minutes ago. In excerpts. NEW YORK (AP) -- Shares of Nvidia Corp. fell Friday after a Cantor Fitzgerald analyst downgraded Nvidia shares and tech bellwether Intel lowered its third-quarter sales forecast. THE SPARK: Analyst Dale Pfau downgraded shares of Nvidia to "Hold" from "Buy" and cut his price target to $13.50 from $20. Meanwhile, Intel cut its third-quarter revenue forecast by more than $1 billion because the tough economy is hurting demand for its chips. About 80 percent of personal computers include Intel chips, making the company an important indicator of spending on computers THE ANALYSIS: Pfau said Nvidia gets about 80 percent of its revenue from older parts of the PC market where there is going to be little or no growth. He said the rest of its revenue comes from consumer products like graphics chips, and the stock price already reflects Nvidia's success in those markets." . Nvidia gets about 80 percent of its revenue from older parts of the PC market where there is going to be little or no growth. And with a price target of only $13.50, why hold the stock?

The release of a new breakthrough Mobile product THIS YEAR is critical to reassure - 1) Analysts to shut the critics up for a while and to reassure those are in your camp 2) The buying public to reassure them that they are buying from a BLEEDING Edge company that still has what it takes to stay up there - YOU LOOSE THIS END USER "FEELING" - It will take a long time to rebuild it - right now you are barely hanging on to that user goodwill 3) Your OEM customers - the public is sensing that you are loosing their respect - you took early hits from the Snapdragon Dual Core when it came out - ok it's not a blow out as QCOM suggested, then the new EXYNOS for which your OEM customers have no ammunition from you to fight it for how long now? and now the QCOM S4 Pro where it's a performance blow out. 4) Or Ignore everybody and be a godfather - why take the hard road? Unlike the Graphics BIZ you are increasingly selling to NERDS in that space, 0.01 sigma of the population. In the Mobile space - YOU are selling to Mr Joe Six Pack, The Nerds and 3 sigma of the population - it requires a different approach and mentality. The picture is looking grim - price performance advantage is very important for the $$$$ to roll in but for the buying public - they want to be associated with a product, a company that is unquestionably at the top of the High Tech Totem Pole while buying a mid end product at a great deal from a company that they can proudly associate with. Isn't that what Apple is doing.

Whereby Microsoft received the right of first refusal -- and the right of last refusal -- to buy nvidia by simply matching -- not exceeding but merely matching -- any offer made to buy 30% of more of the stock of nvidia. So let's say some private equity fund makes an offer to buy all of nvidia for $12.00 a share. Microsoft would merely need to match the $12.00 offer, and if there is no better offer, then Microsoft exercises its option, and rips the shares out of your poftfolio for $12 bucks a share. It's true. Look in the nvidia 10-K if you don't believe that any CEO could be so stupid to give a call option on this entire company.
