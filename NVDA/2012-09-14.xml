Once they have 4G LTE capability from Icera then they will again be included in the US smartphone market in a big way. 2013 will be sweet for NVDA, plenty of reasons for the stock to move toward $20-25.</Msg><Username>tmsherrm</Username><Timestamp>1347596725970</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 00:25:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347599290347-2</Id><Title>Feds crack down on insider trading -- nvidia mentioned</Title><Msg>. Google this from Bloomberg: Bharara Sees Schemes Grow as White-Collar Unit Turns 50 In excerpts. "Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, whose office has charged 72 people in a nationwide crackdown on insider trading, said he anticipates more work for his securities-fraud unit, the oldest in the country. At the Bloomberg Markets 50 Summit in New York today, Bharara said the securities-fraud cases his prosecutors and federal agents are now seeing are more complex than in the past. The unit, which recently marked 50 years fighting white- collar crime, brought cases against financier Ivan Boesky and junk-bond king Michael Milken in the 1980s. Insider-trading schemes have grown in scope, said Bharara, 43. The new breed of securities-fraud defendants “engage in insider trading on the kind of scale that I don’t think we’ve seen in public prosecutions that have been brought,” said Bharara, speaking with Bloomberg News Editor-in-Chief Matt Winkler before a gathering of fund managers and members of the financial community in New York. “There were people who were not just committing one-offs and found out about a tip from an uncle or someone, but people who actually had as a business model a plan to have multiple sources at multiple places, and sometimes redundant sources,” Bharara said. More than two dozen people have been convicted of securities fraud tied to convicted Galleon Group LLC fund manager Raj Rajaratnam, who was found guilty last year of being at the center of what the U.S. said was the largest hedge-fund insider trading case in the nation’s history. Rajaratnam is serving an 11-year prison term. The 68 people who have either pleaded guilty or been convicted at trial by Bharara’s office run the gamut from company insiders to fund managers who got the illegal tips, he said. Many of the portfolio managers have multiple, sometimes overlapping sources of inside information and work in different states or even in another country, he said. Those who his office has prosecuted “aren’t just traders at hedge funds, but also people who are insiders at companies, people who are in every different kind of sector and every different geographical area,” he said. Bharara said this leads him to conclude that insider trading is on the rise. The recent round of prosecutions, which began in late 2009, is the result of an initiative called “Perfect Hedge,” which was started five years ago by agents with the Federal Bureau of Investigation in New York and Bharara’s office. This month, Hyung Lim, a former Altera Corp. (ALTR) executive from California, pleaded guilty to passing illegal tips about his company and **** Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) **** some which were relayed to a group of fund managers accused of running an insider-trading “criminal club.” Lim’s defense lawyer said his client will testify at the trial of Anthony Chiasson, a former Level Global Investors LP co-founder; Jon Horvath, a former technology analyst at SAC Capital Advisors LP’s Sigma Capital Management LLC; and ex- Diamondback Capital Management LLC portfolio manager Todd Newman. That trial is scheduled to begin on Oct. 29. The use of wiretaps and consensual recordings as evidence in insider-trading cases may give some people pause, just as it did when the government deployed such tactics against organized crime, Bharara said. “When people have to wonder whether or not law enforcement is listening, and they have to wonder whether or not the person they’re talking to is wearing a wire, I think that causes people to think again, not once, but twice, and perhaps three or four times about engaging in that activity,” Bharara said. As in the case of Whitman, hearing the words out of a defendant’s own mouth during a recorded call or wiretap can also make a jury’s job easier, he said. “Insider trading, the offense, is basically a crime of communication,” he said. “It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to appreciate that if you actually have the communication, you’re more able to prove the conduct.” .

Here's more on Hyung Lim, the guy the SEC charged on September 4, 2012 with illegally tipping a hedge fund manager with inside information about Nvidia Corporation’s quarterly earnings that he learned from his friend who worked at the company. . Google this: U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION Litigation Release No. 22471 / September 5, 2012 SEC v. Hyung Lim, Civil Action 12-CV-6707 (SDNY) . SEC Charges California Man for Illegal Tips to Hedge Fund Manager "On September 4, 2012, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York charging Hyung Lim with illegally tipping a hedge fund manager with inside information about Nvidia Corporation’s quarterly earnings that he learned from his friend who worked at the company. The SEC alleges that Lim of Los Altos, Calif., received $15,000 and stock tips about a pending corporate acquisition for regularly providing a fellow poker player, Danny Kuo, with nonpublic details ahead of Nvidia’s quarterly earnings announcements. Kuo, a hedge fund manager, illegally traded on the information and passed it on to multi-billion dollar hedge fund advisory firms Diamondback Capital Management LLC and Level Global Investors LP. The SEC charged Kuo and the firms among others earlier this year as part of its widespread investigation into the trading activities of hedge funds. In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Lim. According to the SEC’s complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan, Kuo and the hedge funds made nearly $16 million trading in Nvidia securities based on Lim’s inside information. Lim lives in Los Altos, Calif., and was employed by a semiconductor firm. Lim and Kuo met at poker parties organized by a mutual friend. The SEC alleges that during at least 2009 and 2010, Lim regularly obtained detailed information about the contents of Nvidia’s upcoming quarterly earnings announcements from his friend who worked at Nvidia. Lim’s source provided him with not just one but a series of tips, which grew more accurate and reliable as Nvidia finalized its financial results for a given quarter and prepared to report them publicly. Lim typically learned the nonpublic information in phone conversations with his Nvidia friend, and within one minute of ending a conversation Lim would immediately call Kuo to relay the latest inside information. Lim provided Kuo such nonpublic details as Nvidia’s calculation of its revenues, gross profit margins, and other important financial metrics before the company made those figures public in its quarterly earnings announcements. The SEC alleges that Lim was compensated by Kuo for the confidential Nvidia information that he provided. Kuo wired $5,000 to a Las Vegas casino to pay a debt for Lim, and later Kuo made two $5,000 cash payments to Lim. Kuo also provided Lim with nonpublic information about a pending corporate acquisition, which Lim used to make more than $11,000 in trading profits. The SEC’s complaint charges Lim with violating the anti-fraud provisions of U.S. securities laws and seeks a final judgment ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains and those of his tippees plus interest, ordering him to pay a financial penalty, permanently enjoining him from future violations, and barring him from serving as an officer or director of a public company." .</Msg><Username>i_read_best</Username><Timestamp>1347600327137</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 01:25:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>28</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347601116291-4</Id><Topic><Title>Feds crack down on insider trading -- nvidia mentioned</Title><Username>i_read_best</Username><Timestamp>1347599290347</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 01:08:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>.

Looks like that Hyung Lim guy -- the trafficker in nvidia insider information -- just plead GUILTY. And is now singin' like a bird to the Feds. “On a number of occasions, and at my request, this friend provided to me material, nonpublic information concerning Nvidia,” Lim said. “When I did this, I knew that Kuo wanted the Nvidia information so that others could trade Nvidia stock.” “In return for providing this information to Kuo, I received cash and other items of value from Kuo, including material nonpublic information concerning other publicly traded technology companies, which I used to trade on my own account,” Lim said. .

Who the "unidentified friend" was that worked in nvidia's Accounting Department? Passing along "such nonpublic details as Nvidia’s calculation of its revenues, gross profit margins, and other important financial metrics before the company made those figures public in its quarterly earnings announcements." And isn't nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jen supposed to have proper controls in place to insure that leaks of this and that don't happen? Again and again. .

A possibility is the mini replacing the iPad2 but with the new iPhone processor - wouldn't cost them that much more and GPU performance would be ok since the mini is a smaller screen resolution than the regular iPads.

Not a lot.</Title><Msg>Apple's annual flagship product will get a lot of attention, no doubt. But in the end, it won't stop Android's growing momentum. Overall impact In the near few months, Apple will see sales of its iPhone soar, and in record numbers. In the longer term, Android will not be affected all that much and we'll likely see the platform pulling closer to 60 percent market share or greater. Less expensive phones, more hardware options, and a wider variety of carrier options will see that Android continues its growth. In other words, it's the same today as it was in 2009. Android users and new smartphone buyers are going to largely adopt the platform, just as they have in increasing numbers over the last few years. On the other hand, Apple will still pull in new folks all the time, growing its own base. Loyalists and fanboys are going to continue to take shots at each other and claim that it's their grass that is greener. Given that the smartphone industry is growing at such a rapid rate, both players will be content with their piece of the pie.

I don't think TI was the better choice and if it was about price, maybe Rayfield left on his own because he just thought the price battles are going to make it impossible to take more share in the market. I hope that isn't the case . . my thinking is next year is when Tegra really does become profitable with the integrated baseband, etc.</Msg><Username>roundhouse_c</Username><Timestamp>1347668857298</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 20:27:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347669851945-38</Id><Title>I expected Others instead of Mike leaving</Title><Msg>Put Nvidia on auction block and let new people to get it moving into mass market.

So Best? IF the nvidia Board of Directors finally decided it was high time to pull-the-plug on Jen's folly to make those Tegra commodity ARM Cortex-A9 chips, -- rather than continue to lose over ($100,000,000.00) per quarter like clockwork -- don't you think that Mike Rayfield, the General Manager of the Mobile Business Unit, would be one of the first folks to know? Of course he would. And maybe -- just maybe -- the guy really didn't have the heart to be involved in handing out pink slips and severance packages and this and that to his former hard working team. Nobody can blame the guy for that, right? .</Msg><Username>ask.best</Username><Timestamp>1347681301970</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 23:55:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>30</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
