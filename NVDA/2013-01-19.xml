His past shenanigans -- the prior SEC sanction, Bumpgate, the insider trading scandal, unbridled carnival barking about vaporware Years before there's any product, vastly overpaying for Icera, starving his investors by not paying any cash dividend for 18 years, as well as the unfolding caper involving One Hundred Thousand confidential documents belonging to AMD -- have put Jen on a zero credibility, cash-n-carry only basis. All that matters any more to Wall Street is the next quarterly report card. Period. Now, Jen chopped his revenue guidance to (-15%) growth at the last quarterly cc. That's what he told an already skeptical Wall Street. And that's what Jen absolutely MUST deliver. Giving any re-reduced revenue guidance, or missing his current reduced guidance by even 0.0001% -- and this one plummets off the flat side of the earth. Did I mention? It is Jen that makes Nvidia the #1 Most Despised high tech company on Wall Street.</Msg><Username>genuine.best</Username><Timestamp>1358571942969</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 00:05:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358572609816-2</Id><Topic><Title>NVDA prospects</Title><Username>o.investor</Username><Timestamp>1358563191020</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 21:39:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>so genuine.best - you are obviously disappointed with Nvidia's execution and its leadership but how do you do what you do? so much hate - day in and day out.

Bob Feldstein, the man who holds great influence when trying to put AMD tech into next-gen Xbox and PlayStation consoles, is amongst the accused. He is joined by Manoo Desai, Richard Hagen and Nicolas Kociuk. As reported by Ars Technica, the lawsuit suggests “AMD has uncovered evidence that three of the four defendants – Feldstein, Desai and Kociuk – transferred to external storage devices trade secrets and information in the days prior to their leaving AMD to work for Nvidia.” It is thought the group gathered over 100,000 documents between them. “The names of identified and transferred files match identically or very closely to the names of files on their AMD systems that include obviously confidential, proprietary and/or trade secret materials relating to developing and/or highly confidential business strategy.” Feldstein apparently connected two external storage devices to his machine during his final day with AMD. “Onto those storage devices, three highly confidential files – two licensing agreements with significant customers and a document outlining proposed strategies to AMD’s strategic licensing – were transferred,” the lawsuit declares. Manoo Desai was said to be engaging in similar activity, connecting an external drive to her machine before leaving the company. “A folder called Perforce – which is the name of an AMD internal database containing the confidential technological work and development of AMD process and product – was created on the external device,” it is suggested. The defendants are also accused of luring staff from AMD to Nvidia. All face charges of Misappropriation of Trade Secrets, Unfair Competition, Violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, Breach of the Employee’s Duty of Loyalty, Breach of Contract and Conspiracy. Oh my! My my my. So many many charges against the alleged purloiners. 1. Misappropriation of Trade Secrets 2. Unfair Competition 3. Violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act 4. Breach of the Employee’s Duty of Loyalty 5. Breach of Contract and Conspiracy. Of course, after plea bargaining, and singing to the Judge the full details of what Really went down, they might be shielded from the charges. Shielded -- get it?

Best example was the AT&amp;T qual of the I410 for data in May of last year with Asus Win 8 RT tablet going on sale in Oct, 5 months after the qual. Plus consider the I410 had been sampling since December of 2011 to AT&amp;T carrier qual in May of 2012. Carriers and smartphone companies can do it much faster if Qualcomm is overplaying what they charge their customers and some carrier wants to introduce competition so they can cut back on subsidies. But it will take some nerve for a smartphone company to incur Qualcomm's sudden "Oh so sorry but for you I have no 4G modems". Absolute Best Case scenerio is Nvidia pushing cash to AT&amp;T so they will move the I500 to the front of the qual list and announce passing qual at Barcelona at the end of Feb. and either LG or HTC using it for Summer/early Fall release IMHO. This is as Jensen said "The year of Gaming and Tablets.To me it is a wise choice because they are playing in their sandbox...not Qualcomm's. P.S.

And the Tegra #4 side of things might turn out, well, krappy. It's "no va". But rather than throw the scrap integrated part into the Scrap Dumpster, they probably will keep it -- and fuse-off the aforemention krappy Tegra #4.

REALLY REALLY UGLY. But it's still a servicable ugly part. Smart folks, right? Those pioneering Broadcom modem folks. Another question for Charlie? Sure. Good question -- so what happens if the Tegra side is good, but the modem isn't? Well, those scrap parts they probably DO throw into the Scrap Dumpster.

After leaving TI, Michael joined a start up called Growth Networks as VP of Sales and Business Development, and after a rapid period of growth, negotiated the acquisition of the company by Cisco Systems. After the acquisition, Michael remained on board as Director of Market and Business development for the Multiservice Switching Business Unit (Telecom ATM switches), where his responsibilities included managing the system engineering team that handled all MPLS network installations for wireless infrastructures.

Which I found very very upside down to put it mildly. Read the backgrounds and biographies of people both within and without the company and have some knowledge of what markets a company is in before you spout the party line. P.S. Initial stock option grant is based on the stock price when starting to work. Typically the initial stock grant is 4 years worth of options. Timing is everything when accepting new employment in the Semiconductor industry. RSU are relatively new thing and do not require the stock price to rise for the employee to make money.</Msg><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1358648916550</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 21:28:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358651565638-28</Id><Topic><Title>Integrated Baseband v.s.

Ibexx Ok Ibexx let's run through what you said... "Ok, I meant to say TI was/is in PC-centric semiconductor business. I thought you knew." Ibexx PC - centric semic business. I have news for you TI is the world's largest analog semi company by a factor of 3. Last time I looked at PC's they used Digitial semis. Not analog. As for me making things up. Mike Rayfield left for Micron in July/ Aug. The price MU stock is up 40% since then...i.e. his 4 year grant of stock options is up 40%. No guarantee that it will stay that way, but a good start. Surely better than his outstanding options with Nvidia. RSU's - go to the insider trades on Yahoo message board and look for managers that are on the Executive list on the Nvidia Website ----i.e. the top 15 people. Look for RSU unit sales. It is safe to assume that SVP get roughly the same amount and the next level down gets much less but roughly the same for each at that level give or take a little. And yes... On the executive bio page of Nvidia it shows two SVP of the Mobile Business Unit and they have both been there since 2010. What's interesting when you look at their Bios is they both are PC centric...chipset or graphics etc. Frankly I believe they are leading the charge into Gaming and Nvidia grid and Project Shield which to me should be greener pastures for Nvidia in 2013 rather than trying to take on Qualcomm in phones. That's a 2014 story IMHO. Funny but I always thought of Mike Rayfield as the phone guy.</Msg><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1358651565638</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 22:12:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358652421470-29</Id><Title>One thing is for sure, Nvidia has no experience in modems.</Title><Msg>Stock is headed to single digits.</Msg><Username>will_amd_yu</Username><Timestamp>1358652421470</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 22:27:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358654492672-30</Id><Topic><Title>EETimes comments on Tegra 4</Title><Username>ibexx88</Username><Timestamp>1358651433979</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 22:10:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>“Their [Nvidia's] software-defined radio is a very high-risk, high-return proposition." -- Patrick Moorhead, principal of Moor Insights and Strategy (Austin).

Since you are blind as well - I have to point out to you - the i400 is the first LTE soft modem in the world - fully qualified by ATT. The i500 will be 40% cheaper tp manufacture than any other LTE modem in the same node. It's already in the very low single digit - you mean it's headed to the penny counter!</Msg><Username>mark1289b</Username><Timestamp>1358655754963</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 23:22:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358656085947-32</Id><Topic><Title>EETimes comments on Tegra 4</Title><Username>ibexx88</Username><Timestamp>1358651433979</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 22:10:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I don't get it. Why would any OEM take the risk of NOT going with Qualcomm for their radio modems? Hummm? Qualcomm makes the Best radio modems. Period. They have made more modems than anyone on the planet. And Qualcomm has made them longer than anyone. And Qualcomm radio modems are really really cheap. Just a few bucks each. So why would any OEM take the risk of going with an unproven, no-name, never-sold-one-before iffy icera modem? There's only one reason, right? Price. To compete with Qualcomm, Jen needs to make and sell his icera modems for what, HALF of Qualcomm's price? Just to get a guinea pig OEM to try one. This is a Flawed Business Model, boys. Oh so Badly Flawed. Chopping your price just to get somebody to try it.

Scaring the buyers Away. Let's say that an OEM thinks that the Tegra ARM attempt #4 is maybe okay. But really doesn't want to gamble on the unproven, no-name, never-heard-of-it-before icera integrated on-board radio modem. So the guy takes a pass on the integrated nvidia Grey chip. Rather than "double our revenues" by selling two chips in one, Jen actually gets ZERO revenue from his dunder-headed icera scheme to compete with QUALCOMM's fine, world-renowned, cheap radio modems. Did I mention?
