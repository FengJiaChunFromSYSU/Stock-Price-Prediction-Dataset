Why? Well, the volume is good for this time of day, but since for professionals, the first hour holds NO meaning as to price, the better volume (not titanic volume) is a good sign of increased interest in the stock. And, the now "higher low" than we had the last three days is also a big plus. Also, we're on the "buying on weakness" list at the WSJ, which means, as Ibexx regularly points out, that the "money flow" is actually positive, so far today. Unless the market really craters, later, I'd say this is shaping up to be a very nice day. And, please keep in mind that NOTHING really matters until The Final Hour. I won't be at all surprised if we do finish only marginally lower or even higher. Thursday's Annual Investor's Day will be here soon enough. As always, we'll know in the fullness of time.

(MSFT) will use an Advanced Micro Devices Inc.

The Xbox will use an AMD system-on-a-chip that combines powerful “Jaguar” central processing units with graphics chips, said one of the people, who sought anonymity because the plans aren’t public. The shift to the so-called x86 format ubiquitous in modern personal computers means Microsoft will drop the Power PC technology designed by International Business Machines Corp., and game discs made for the current Xbox 360 won’t be compatible.

Photographer: Jonathan Alcorn/Bloomberg The switch is a boon for AMD, which is also providing chips for Sony Corp. (6758)’s coming PlayStation 4, as it seeks a larger slice of the $67 billion global video game market to help lessen its reliance on the shrinking PC industry.

The new AMD SoC will mean that Microsoft is moving to an x86-based system architecture, which Sony’s upcoming PlayStation 4 is also adopting. The change is great news for AMD, and for gamers, and bad news for AMD’s chief rival Intel. The new Microsoft console will be running a “Jaguar” CPU, which is also what’s going into Sony’s PS4, alongside a Radeon graphics processor from ATI, an AMD subsidiary. The similarity between the two SoCs employed in each next-gen console should go a long way toward silencing complaints from developers that it’s too difficult and resource-intensive to develop for each type of console. A shared x86 architecture means that it’ll be much easier to port titles, both between consoles and from the PC. For AMD, it means gaining access to a much bigger chunk of the console gaming industry, at a crucial juncture: the desktop and notebook PC market is shrinking, facing increasing encroachment from devices like the iPad, meaning there’s less room to vie with Intel for market share in a space where Intel already clearly dominates. The console industry hasn’t exactly been a shining beacon of growth itself, but with a hardware refresh imminent, AMD is in the best position to capitalize should consumer interest once again be caught by fancy new console devices."

Look closely it said "great new for AMD" and " bad news for AMD’s chief rival Intel." Because AMD won the deal and Intel did NOT. You see, Intel has NO GPU GAME. Intel can't touch an AMD 8 Core 64 bit CPU+GPU part because what? Intel has NO GPU GAME just like Nvidia has NO CPU GAME. lol imho</Msg><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1365458931409</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-08 18:08:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365459023488-34</Id><Title>When will Nvidia announce a tegra4 design win.

I am guessing that supply is somewhat limited by nvidia not over producing on a niche product however it seems as if they underestimated demand and are not catching up a bit as the cards seem to come back in stock more quickly. Its hard to say how many of these they have sold but we still have a few weeks left before the quarter closes and i'm thinking that this product alone may have put them over their guidance. It might be interesting on analyst day to hear what they say about sales of this product. 50k boards is 50 million dollars...thats a nice chunk for them in one quarter from one product. In regard to all the negative posts about them not being in any of the new consoles, i think in time people will realize this was a brilliant decision on their part. The new consoles are not going to be backwards compatible which means many people are going to stay with their current hardware for a long time. I don't see the real hook of the new consoles offering anything more than a hardware upgrade and they are going to be expensive. Also, with casual gaming offering the same playability from like the ouya and project shield, a lot of folks on a budget will opt to wait on the consoles before making the investment. games are like 50 to 60 bucks a piece on a console, practically free on the other platforms. I think playstation and XBOX running on the same hardware is a stupid model and the overall sales are going to be much slower than in the past. the funny thing is that nobody has any idea what apple or google are working on next. could throw cold water on the traditional consoles. we'll see who is right in the next year.</Msg><Username>neo_trinity1020</Username><Timestamp>1365469217949</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-08 21:00:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365474716197-39</Id><Topic><Title>Shield should be priced at $800</Title><Username>nvdarocks</Username><Timestamp>1365449015177</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-08 15:23:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Then $200-$249 it is...assuming a $150-$175 BOM and assembly costs . However, that adds even more mystery as to how they will bill back the T4 component - although if Shield and Tegra all fall within the same vertical it may not matter as much.</Msg><Username>brokeagain73</Username><Timestamp>1365474716197</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-08 22:31:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365474988515-40</Id><Topic><Title>AMD UP 13%, QCOM UP 1% AND TXN UP 2.5%...NVDA DOWN!</Title><Username>achdumoff</Username><Timestamp>1365450597848</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-08 15:49:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>xc, enjoy your AMD purchases -- you've pumping it in the past year. great job! you should go to AMD board!</Msg><Username>best_ivideo</Username><Timestamp>1365474988515</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-08 22:36:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
