Intel, AMD, Nvidia : Evercore Slices Ests On Soft PC Sales CIO Network | 12/20/2012 @ 9:14AM | 592 views "Evercore Partners analyst Patrick Wang this morning trimmed estimates on Intel, Advanced Micro Devices and Nvidia, citing continuing lackluster demand for personal computers. But Wang’s colleague Rob Cihra, who covers hardware companies, contends that there are “glimmers of hope” that PC demand will start stabilizing in the 2013 first half. Cihra expects global PC shipments to be flat in 2013 after a 3% year-over-year drop in 2012. For the fourth quarter, he’s expecting a 2% rise sequentially, but a 5% drop from a year ago. “Much of the supply-chain looks to have needed to under-ship end PCs for a second consecutive quarter of inventory drawdown,” he writes. “Pressures continue to include weak macro and more so tablet cannibalization. Early ultrabooks have been stymied by high prices and Win8 so far looks like a remarkable non-factor.” He does see some reasons for hope for 2013 among other things, he thinks the product cycles that were supposed to help this but didn’t – ultraboks and Windows 8 – could ultimately boost sales. He adds that China is an “upside swing factor,” noting that he’s now seeing “a constructive tone and expectations for soem rebound in China’s PC growth.” OK, back to the chip stocks. Here’s a quick look at Evercore’s estimate cuts today on the chip makers: • Intel: Wang cuts his Q4 view to $13.39 billion in revenue and profits of 44 cents a share, down from $13.6 billion and 46 cents. For 2013, he goes to $53.4 billion and $1.85 a share form $54 billion and $1.90. • AMD: For Q4, he goes to $1.13 billion and a loss of 14 cents a share, from $1.15 billion and a loss of 13 cents. For 2013, he now sees $4.8 billion and a loss of 18 cents a share, down from $4.87 billion and a loss of 15 cents. • Nvidia: For FY Q4, Wang now sees revenue of $1.07 billion and a loss of 21 cents a share, down from $1.09 billion and 22 cents. For FY 2014, he sees $4.3 billion and a profit of 85 cents a share, down from $4.4 billion and 88 cents."

It provides them key differentiation against competition. How will Google, Microsoft, Nokia, RIMM, Amazon combat this? Just do generic designs and compete with HTC, LG, Sony etc. or, start their own chip design or, acquire a chip design powerhouse in search of a home? I think the 3rd strategy is most viable for Google or, Microsoft - I didn't think Google would acquire Motorola but they did for patents. They already give Android for free. I think Microsoft has the most vested in Nvidia at this time. Microsoft is coming out with XBOX 720 which is hardcore Nvidia based on developer platform leaks. Anyway, its no reason to buy Nvidia on hopes of an acquisition. Its a Hold at best.</Msg><Username>o.investor</Username><Timestamp>1356017522828</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-20 10:32:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356017771848-15</Id><Topic><Title>NVDA can be the next ten bagger!</Title><Username>george.johnson67</Username><Timestamp>1356004423582</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-20 06:53:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>they are the best</Msg><Username>katherineearl73</Username><Timestamp>1356017771848</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-20 10:36:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356017826528-16</Id><Topic><Title>Tegra Sales</Title><Username>mslans</Username><Timestamp>1356014391921</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-20 09:39:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>nvda will never outbid samsung at amzn - aapl is empting out of the samsung fab and samsung is looking for fab fills. That's just the economy of running fabs - you'd rather sell at a loss than not run the fab because of high depreciations. Sales for 2013: Q4 now, with a last Nov X'mas sales will already drop to $160 per nvda. No doubt after X'mas, sales will drop further to, if nvda is lucky, $120M range until Wayne ramps. Wayne: total awol. With nothing integrated, it's 9 to 12 months to actual device sales (vs 1 - 2 months for fully integrated solutins). And this is assuming no engineering problems like T3 which greatly delayed the mass market sales. ala no sales increase until Q4 '13 at least. nvda will be very lucky to do $600M in Tegra sales for '13.</Msg><Username>whosunw</Username><Timestamp>1356017826528</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-20 10:37:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356018272950-17</Id><Title>I'm guessing the boyz don't like Forbes today.</Title><Msg>I'm guessing the boyz don't like Forbes today.

Nexus/goog is in for spreading the wealth, hence the Nexus 10 will be Exynos. amzn and samsung are definitely NOTcompetitors in the tablet space. amzn is into selling an eco system on the cheap, samsung sells tablets. you bet you for 50 cents, bezo will buy the Exynos.

Great fundamentals with low P/E, [little debt], solid profit margin and a decent dividend, plenty of cash on hand ($5.50 per share) and a great quick ratio. Overall, this company sounds like a slam dunk for any portfolio.. MotleyFools carry no weight. Neither does Seeking Alpha.
