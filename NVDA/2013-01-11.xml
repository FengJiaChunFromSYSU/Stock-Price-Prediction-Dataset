"The industry is littered with the remains of companies that have tried and failed." -- Sony Corporation Chief Executive Kazuo Hirai The most underestimated challenge in this business is distribution. Yes, Distribution, boys. These things don't sell themselves, you know. And as Jen has publicly groused in the past -- Best Buy's cut is 30%. Just to put it on the self. Yes, (-30%) boys. Now, the toy Shield's competitor is the Sony PlayStation® Vita mobile game player. It sells for $249. Briskly it sells. That sets the Ceiling for what nvidia could charge for their unproven knock-off. $249 retail price Which, net of the aforementioned (-30%) distribution cost, becomes $174 net to nvidia. Yes boys, just $174, BEFORE advertising, returns, customer service and warranty claims. You WOULD like to Advertise the toy Shield, yes? Figure at least a $60 million campaign to sell what, maybe 3 million devices. At best. Waive goodbye to another $20 bucks per device for advertising. So that $259 selling price has now become just $154 net to nvidia. Before a whole lot of other miscellaneous retail related expenses. Can nvidia Build the low volume Shield for less than $154? And in the remote event that they could -- is it worth it? Hummm? Good luck with that. Are you starting to understand now?

Citing industry sources, hit-or-miss DigiTimes reported on Thursday that mass production issues can be pinned on iMac panel supplier LG Display. The problem apparently stems from full lamination issues in producing the panels. Apple and LG are only able to produce about 100,000 units a month, according to the report. The issues do not apparently apply to the 21.5-inch iMac, which has reached monthly shipments of between 300,000 and 400,000. AppleInsider previously noted on Monday that Apple's iMacs remain in short supply more than a month after the new all-in-one desktop launched. In fact, Apple's reseller channel remains completely out of stock of the 21.5-inch model." Be sure to Google the story headline boys, and look at the cute little pictures of the Genuine Apple iMacs, and their cute little spec sheets. So who supplies the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 6xxM series graphics cards? For those "only able to produce about 100,000 units a month" 27-inch iMac's. Hummm? Looks like it's time for the analysts to use their folding pocket hatchets again, boys. Chop chop chop chop chop On those now unattainable nvidia Revenue projections.</Msg><Username>i_read_best</Username><Timestamp>1357887693057</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 02:01:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>27</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357893966601-5</Id><Title>Project Denver Announcement ???</Title><Msg>Just guessing here.. but if NVidia launches PD at an event....

Alot of people, especially on this board, are counting their chickens before they hatch, crediting Shield with millions in added revenue for NVDA before the product has even been finalized, or hit the market. Sure it has the capability of increasing profits for NVDA, but it also has the possibiltity of being a colossal failure. Personally, I don't think it will be, simply because Shield can do things other hand helds cant, namely Steam, and streaming from PC to TV, but we'll have to wait and see. I'm not a "hardcore" gamer by any means, but I'm even interested in purchasing a Shield for myself, assuming reviews continue to be good, and the pricing is right. Those long flights, or when I'm stuck at the in-laws wishing I were anywhere else could really be broken up by being able to kill some time with some gaming. Granted, I could also do that with any of the other handhelds, but with Shield, I get something else: I don't have to buy new games if I dont want to. Shield, supposedly, will allow you to play games that you've already purchased off of Steam and Android. That's a BIG plus. Tegra 4 was just "officially" announced, so true, there won't be any product launches with it for at least a little while. But, Tegra 4 undoubtedly will be king of non-Apple tablets, at least in 2013. All reviews have been stellar, and with the capabilities of Tegra 4 with photos, video, and graphics, I think we'll see more smartphones making the move as well. Will it overtake QCOM, no, but more market share means better earnings, and every little bit helps. What intrigues me is NVDA's relationship with Apple. Apple has notoriously used their chips for their products in the past. We're now seeing NVDA GPUs in new IMacs. With the capability in photo and video with Tegra 4, I could see Apple considering utilizing Tegra 4 in new Iphones, if it can increase performance, and improve battery life, all of which Tegra 4 can reportedly do. Should that happen, NVDA will rise, quickly. Again, right now we're in a holding pattern until something breaks, good or bad.</Msg><Username>jrdelaney1</Username><Timestamp>1357909765491</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 08:09:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357911966427-7</Id><Topic><Title>Best of CES 2013: NIVIDIA Project Shield</Title><Username>ibexx88</Username><Timestamp>1357859379907</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 18:09:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>0 0 0 Share Project SHIELD, the breakout hit of CES, continues to rack up awards.

I believe its because it proofs what the market suspects all the while. That nvidia must be an owner of devices. It is tough being a supplier. It used to be a supplier. But now owners such as samsung, apple etc are using their own parts. Even google who uses nvidia for nexus 7 may not continue to use nvidia going forward. Also this fabless model means more competition coming in. Eg. mediatek is doing well. So essentially, more people are competing for a smaller pie. To ensure success, nvidia have to be an owner. This is new grounds for nvidia. It could either fail big, and wither. Or it could be so successful being another Apple??? Who knows, meanwhile, market hates uncertainty. Hence the sell off. Faithful longs betting its the next Apple? Yes maybe, but this a huge bet. Its unknown, and so its like betting on lottery.

It's probably going to be sold at about 249 which, at that price won't deliver the volume of a 129 device, but should be inline with their targeted market. As for the WiFi - well that isn't exactly the big picture as this will work with GRID partners content. However, although being able to stream over the internet would be great, that may come, but the logistics and latency issues have not been solve or at least cheaply. I akin this to someone getting a Ferrari but then complaining that it doesn't fly or drive itself. It's still a good device with lots of technical promise, although at 250 it will be out of my price range as I am not a gamer (particularly PC) - now if it could stream from my playstation then I'd buy it or if it was in the 150 price range then I could see paying that for the casual game and media functionality. I do travel for work a lot and so maybe I would consider 250 as my tablet sucks for playing games.</Msg><Username>brokeagain73</Username><Timestamp>1357921732106</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 11:28:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357921733208-28</Id><Topic><Title>NVDA just hit $12.21 please and I am out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</Title><Username>iroc88joe1234</Username><Timestamp>1357920859906</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 11:14:19 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think NVDA will be higher at the close - so I will get the $12.21, but it will be higher Mon.

One of them was trying to smooth over the debacle of the single-chip-vendor Windows RT launch. The rumors that only Nvidia was able to get their drivers qualified appears to have been true. Microsoft desperately needs multiple chip vendors and a wide range of devices in the market, and it needs to happen in the next few months. Otherwise they could end up in a situation where all of the ARM SoC vendors decide that it's not worth investing in WinRT drivers just to split a tiny market with Nvidia. That's both good and bad for Nvidia. They investment they made in WinRT won't provide a big return, but they are the main suppliers for WinRT. Although they likely have little pricing power since the same Tegra is used in Android devices, where the pricing pressure is pretty intense.</Msg><Username>watergatefive</Username><Timestamp>1357953116164</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 20:11:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357956442415-86</Id><Topic><Title>Attention maravian/getanid - dell xps not yet shipping</Title><Username>apollinaire123</Username><Timestamp>1357939063642</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 16:17:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Give us 1 good reason to buy a Win RT tablet over Win 8 tablet.</Msg><Username>will_amd_yu</Username><Timestamp>1357956442415</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 21:07:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357956734917-87</Id><Title>Lenovo dumped tegra and Win RT in their yoga tablet.

Won't be surprised if they already have Tegra 4 drivers nearly finished along with Tegra 3 updates. It's what they do best. Ask AMD. I doubt Microsoft will fold Windows RT because of having only one application processor vendor. Look how many years they lived with Intel and AMD a very weak sister in X86. Samsung pulled out because of Qualcomm issues sure...but Sammie just doesn't like the volume...same will happen with Dell. 3 or 4 maybe 5 million Tegras in 2013 for Windows RT is a big run for Nvidia since they only sold maybe 20M Tegras in tablets for 2013. People forget that Nvidia is just getting started in this business. Plus Tegra is already in 3 windows 8 RT tablets on retail shelves. They can supply to more vendors if they wish to enter the business.. Qualcomm will eventually get their drivers qualed but it might be too late.

Go to Vegas and bet the ranch on #4. That's just what Jen did -- with Your money. And unfortunately lost. Big Time. The CES week opened optimistically enough. Too optimistically as it turned out. The birds were singing, the pumper boyz were pumping, and the union electricians were estimating. And nvda opened CES week on Monday, January 7th at $13.14 Looks like Good Money today, right boys? $13.14 It sure does. Needless to say, things didn't go well for nvda at CES 2013. Of no no no. The Denver Project wasn't launched. Maybe year eight (8) for that one? The Tegra attempt #4 Was launched -- but partnerless and orderless. Jen attempted to gracefully present the gimcrack Shield device to the public. You know -- Steve Jobs style. But then Jen couldn't get the Shield to actually work. Which quickly became a decidedly Ungraceful presentation by Jen. So after a half hour of short-notice emergency on-stage union electrician time, the boys from International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Unions In NEVADA, Local 357, finally got the Shield to to light up a screen. (Just wait until Jen sees the bill for That service call.) Finally, Jen's previously purchased CES "Best of This and That" awards were delivered. Receiving a smattering of politely tepid applause. Needless to say, the whole trip to Vegas was a disaster. Yes, a Total Disaster boys. NVDA closed CES week on Friday, January 11th at just $12.21 DOWN (-$.93) for the week, or Minus (-7.07%) And a lot of money lost. A Whole Lot of Money. (-$.93) per nvda share x 624.8 Million nvda shares outstanding equals a Loss in nvda's Market Cap of ( -$581,110,000.00) for the week at the 2013 CES. Six Tenths of a Billion Dollars of nvidia's market cap, boys. Stays in Vegas. Can't wait for the next one, right boys? Next up : Mobile World Congress, Barcelona, February 25-28, 2013. Be sure to tell Jen to take more money this time. MUCH more money. What with the exchange rates and more expensive Spanish union electricians and all.</Msg><Username>best.here</Username><Timestamp>1357962660131</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 22:51:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>27</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
