In addition to making Facebook Home available as a software download, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company has crafted a set of tools for phone makers to include Home from the outset. The company has a list of hardware makers and carriers already interested in doing such devices, including Samsung, Sony, Huawei and Alcatel One Touch. As we reported more than a year ago, the first partner will be HTC, which is creating a phone to be sold with AT&amp;T. HTC chief Peter Chou appeared onstage on Thursday to show off the aptly named HTC First, which will be the first device to carry Facebook Home as its default interface. The phone, which will sell for $99.99 and go on sale April 12, will come in red, white, light blue and black. Preorders start today. AT&amp;T Mobility chief Ralph de la Vega said the HTC First is a canvas on which to show off what Facebook has done. “It’s simple and it;s elegant,” de la Vega said.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1365105855147</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 16:04:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365106069709-33</Id><Topic><Title>"Google's next Nexus 7 tablet will shun Nvidia in favour of Qualcomm"</Title><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1365008441897</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 13:00:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Google apparently favoured a Qualcomm chip for "power reasons", according to Reuters' unnamed source."

Google Nexus like of products is well known not for being "the best" but "good enough". Other vendors might find Tegra 4 more suitable for their strategy. Although you're right it's a loss for Nvidia, it's not a proof that Tegra 4 is a failure as you try to suggest.</Msg><Username>sisula3</Username><Timestamp>1365106352205</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 16:12:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365106907752-35</Id><Topic><Title>"Google apparently favoured a Qualcomm chip for "power reasons" "</Title><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1365027001816</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 18:10:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Tegra 4 with better performance but bigger battery" So are you saying that Tegra 4 requires a bigger battery, isn't that Google reportedly said, "power reasons"? lol "Google Nexus like of products is well known not for being "the best" but "good enough" " So does that mean they went with Tegra 3 because its not the best but was good enough until it wasn't good enough when compared to the competition so Google UPGRADED to QCOM for the NEW Nexus?

I repeat: nexus line of products are "good enough" (and yes, Tegra 3 is just of this kind) and focus not on pure performance but mainly on price. So the chances are that they considered Tegra 4 for its performance, but it needed bigger battery to reach the same level of "battery life" as not so performance strong Snapdragon. So they might have decided to go with Snapdragon even if they know they wouldn't hit the highest scores in benchmarks but holding to their price targets due to lower battery capacity and price.</Msg><Username>sisula3</Username><Timestamp>1365107670959</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 16:34:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365110182866-38</Id><Topic><Title>"Google apparently favoured a Qualcomm chip for "power reasons" "</Title><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1365027001816</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 18:10:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hey what happened to all your 'best' shortie puppet logons?

Don't even think Tegra 2 can get down there. Must be a very highly integrated solution. Era of el cheapo huge volume smart phone has started.

Over the past few months, the story flipped back and forth a number of times - first it was Tegra 4, then it was changed to QC S800, now we are back to the original version. I am glad Tegra 4 is still in the race as a leading candidate, as Xiaomi is the Apple in China with unbelievable cult following. The previous Xiaomi Mi-1 and Mi-2 were sold out within days.. At least that was what I read on the Internet and exactly what my friends from China told me. So...product launch in summer and release in the fall. If this is true, we will be talking about 5-10 million units at launch on a conservative estimate.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1365131186174</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 23:06:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365133847388-47</Id><Title>Nvidia's competition is Rockchip, Mediatek, Allwinner...</Title><Msg>Huge profits to be made here.</Msg><Username>will_amd_yu</Username><Timestamp>1365133847388</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 23:50:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
