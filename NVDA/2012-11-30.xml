There is no tangible benefit to many applications from having quad-core. This is marketing hype. You can see benchmarks after benchmarks where Tegra 3 has its behind handed to it in both CPU and GPU results. The reason is that all benchmarks utilize single core. Things that matter are cpu speed, memory speed, architectural design. Tegra 3 was based on older ARM architecture, utilizes slower internal memory and architecture. I have said in past, Tegra 4 will be an improvement but its just a matter of time before its again bested by the next release from QCOM etc. There is no real innovation in packing 3rd party ARM core. To that point, Mediatek will be putting out Octa Core (yes 8 core) and Mediatek has many other assets that they have developed in wireless that they can integrate. So good luck in trying to differentiate with core-count.</Msg><Username>o.investor</Username><Timestamp>1354299734925</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 13:22:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354300867402-23</Id><Topic><Title>When are we gonna see the 1st Snapdragon S4 powered Win 8 tablet?</Title><Username>ibexx88</Username><Timestamp>1354238342982</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 20:19:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"There is no real innovation in packing 3rd party ARM core."

I do believe Tegra numbers will be roughly the same as last quarter because the units that they are in are roughly the same and seling well. As to PC graphics - Nvidia is doing very well and getting absolutely no credit for it. But things change rapidly. Think about all those Apple IMacs and 15 inch Macbooks. By the way....I am very pleased with Nvidia's change in investor strategy....i.e. no more hype. That and the dividend makes me believe that internally they believe they have cleared some magic critical mass in mobile. But of course will see.

To make it perfectly clear, despite having nearly 100% of the smartphone and tablet market, as well as nearly the entirety of the microcontroller and embedded space, ARM fails to generate net income that comes out to even a fraction of that of its licensees and peers in the semiconductor industry. The company's initial success in the mobile computing markets has been primarily due to the firm's long-standing focus on the low power/embedded space, which allowed its products to evolve, due primarily to process technology advancements, to become fast enough to enable smartphones and tablets. The low power, low ASP application processor segment was largely overlooked by larger competitors early on, which gave ARM and its licensees the spotlight in the mobile processor world. However, going forward, it is clear that the actual ARM core designs will become less important, and that ARM's primary role in the mobile world will be as an instruction set licensee, given that there is now a substantial software base for the firm's instruction set in place. No other company could reasonably hope to compete in designing its own instruction set (other than Intel and its already established X86 ISA) since the software support and toolset -- usually the product of many years of development -- would be an almost intractable barrier to overcome. In short, ARM's business model will generate consistent, but low amounts of revenue and net income compared to its peers, which means that it is very unlikely that it will ever grow the top and bottom lines enough to warrant its valuation. However, the stock has seen an extraordinary run post-earnings and even more recently over the last couple of days. The earnings report was nothing to write home about -- it beat analyst revenue forecasts by $2M (for a total quarterly sales figure of $227M) , and as a result, the company has gained over $4B in market capitalization.</Msg><Username>roor15</Username><Timestamp>1354303563749</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 14:26:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354303907821-30</Id><Title>NVDA sellers @12.12</Title><Msg>i see sellers are pounding NVDA every time to touches 12.12, very bizarre.

Nvidia is doing fine. It's holding around 12 off of lows in the low-mid 11s. Nvidia can afford a dividend AND buyback because the management know the future is bright for them. AMD, not so much. You are getting a bump because of a garage sale for assets and talent you would need to stay competitive.</Msg><Username>roundhouse_c</Username><Timestamp>1354310617745</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 16:23:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354315279770-34</Id><Topic><Title>Boehner Comming On TV Soon</Title><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1354297584120</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 12:46:24 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Speaking of pukes, you should do something more productive like checking your propane tank, and the tire pressure on your home.</Msg><Username>chitownbarber20</Username><Timestamp>1354315279770</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 17:41:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354315683205-35</Id><Topic><Title>AMD up almost 8%</Title><Username>jigsanbifs</Username><Timestamp>1354309107817</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 15:58:27 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Just posting for the sake of others because after checking your limited posts elsewhere, you shouldn't be allowed to post on this (or any other) board.
