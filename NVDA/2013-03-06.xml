No, late 2014 at the very earliest but probably 2015-6 for real volume. 'Might even have legacy app support.' No, keep dreaming. The reason MSFT has increased its world wide Surface distribution is purely to get rid of its large inventory. WinRT was not a successful experiment. 'But seriously if ARM doubles performance every year and Intel increases performance 15% to 20% a year, what do you think the competitive landscape will look like next year.' That was not a serious comment but one of your typical wet dream fantasies. A57 will only improve performance over A15 by about 33% according to ARM and Broadwell will be about the same over Ivy Bridge so competitive conditions will be similar except Intel processors will have made greater strides in improving power efficiency. 'Just another thought if little ole Nvidia can build a processor that is comparable to Ivy bridge what do youthin Apple will do on Mac Airs next iteration. Fancy ultrabook at 1/2 the price...No Wintel tax at all. ARM and IOS.' Apple would not have gone to the trouble of developing Swift if it had seen A15 and liked what it saw which it clearly did not. Forget Tegras for Apple, if it wants more ARM performance it will just up the clockspeed (and TDP) on Swift (currently 1.3 GHz).</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1362570095697</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-06 06:41:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362570330140-3</Id><Topic><Title>Nvidia Is Now Claiming Tegra 4 Is Faster Than 80% of Ultrabook Processors Sold Today</Title><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1362488187423</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 07:56:27 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A15 has 40-bit Large Physical Address Extensions (LPAE) addressing up to 1 TB of RAM but still only 32-bit address space (4 GB) per thread.</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1362570330140</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-06 06:45:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362575507756-4</Id><Topic><Title>NVIDIA Corporation SURVEY!</Title><Username>pupatekeisha</Username><Timestamp>1361802072479</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 09:21:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ok cool.

Pure supposition. 64-bitness by itself will not guarantee sales e.g. VIA has had x86-64 chips for some time now and which are not bad either and they still have only 0.5% of the x86 market. I know you are looking for a silver bullet here but you will need a pretty damn good Project Denver design that stands on its own merits against all the cross architecture opposition to hope to dwarf the gpu business here. There is not going to be some great ARM64 popularity wave which you seem to think, just like there was not a great Windows on Arm wave which you previously was touting as a game changer. If Project Denver is a great design it will succeed on that alone and not because it uses the ARM64 ISA which is coincidental.</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1362596665221</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-06 14:04:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362596797704-30</Id><Topic><Title>NVIDIA Corporation SURVEY!</Title><Username>pupatekeisha</Username><Timestamp>1361802072479</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 09:21:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wow free of charge.

The fundamental problem with WinRT is that nobody is bothering to port old Windows apps to ARM which means the ARM hardware has to be so much better than the x86 to get users to put up with that legacy drawback. I don't see that being the case considering Clover Trail is a viable single day usage chip like the ARM ones and Bay Trail will be in Tegra 4's performance class. Where's the differentiation apart from a negative one ? 'BUt going forward, NO more waiting on ARMH to release a core, such as A15 which took NVIdia way too long to integrate...' OTOH at least you know what you are getting with ARM. Project Denver could range from anything to a withdrawn flop to a major success as the range is that wide when you do something as intellectually hard and difficult as designing a general purpose processor and no, a parallel executing rinse and repeat hardware units gpu is not in the same difficulty of endeavor IMO. On the plus side it will give you differentiation to everybody else and as A57 is based on the power hungry A15 maybe an opportunity to shine if your architects are bright enough.</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1362600448570</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-06 15:07:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362601221788-39</Id><Topic><Title>Was yesterday's close and this morning's pop a "shot across the bow"?</Title><Username>kvimax1</Username><Timestamp>1362598880080</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-06 14:41:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The huge open interest in on month calls could be mixed blessings (cf.

Probably would have significant advantages by taking advantage of the fact that they can now tightly couple the CPUs to the GPUs since they supply both. Titan has 299K CPU cores (18,688 x 16 cores) and 18.6K GPUs. Nvidia would be able to supply both at a much better cost - Give Intel a run for their money! If Intel has to give it away today to compete with the K20X - they will have to pay $$$ to get anybody to use their Phi platform. 2) General purpose 64 Bit Arm Servers - not interesting - everybody will be able to just license and do it. Not much to differentiate there - doesn't need GPUs, Doesn't need LTE, or anything else. It will be pure commodity space - the cheapest at the latest fab node wins for a period and then it repeats - low power will be driven primarily by fab node. Intel will be the biggest looser unfortunately. 3) Android, RT, IOS are all 32 Bit OS/Software/APPS/Hardware platforms today - and ALL are rather poor at multi threading/multi processing/multi CPU utilization today - going to 64 Bit architecture only increases cost with little to show - like when AMD first went to 64Bit CPUs and Win OS and Applications did not take advanatge of it for a awhile. It took a long time before Win OS/Apps took full advantage of the multi core 64Bit CPUs.</Msg><Username>ltenow</Username><Timestamp>1362605155586</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-06 16:25:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362605469731-47</Id><Topic><Title>Analysts now pile on Apple: Citi cut AAPL target to $480, citing slowing demand for ipad, iphone</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1362595613707</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-06 13:46:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The following paragraph pertaining to iPad/ipad mini - how the latter cannibalized the big brother.

I say this because, in a parallel manner, Qualcomm's Snapdragon 600 performs 40% better than its predecessor Snapdragon S4 Pro partially because of the memory technology factor, even though both SoCs have quad core- CPUs in addition to identifical Adreno 320 graphics. The difference in performance, according to a number of websites, is mainly due to 2 factors: 1. Deployment of LPDDR3 in S600 could result in a 15% performance increase. 2. The rest of performance enhencement could be attributed to a subtle difference in the Krait chip - Krait 300 in S600 whereas Krait 200 in S4 Pro. The point is that cpu DOES make a difference; certainly not all A15 based SoC are vanilla rubber stamps. Snapdragon S800 will have Krait 400, and it's not clear how much improvement can be expected there.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1362619529470</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-06 20:25:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362620351199-64</Id><Title>The official Nexus 7 Dock is here...available at Google Play for $29.99</Title><Msg>In all major global markets: US, Canada, Japan, Germany, Australia, UK etc From Google Play: Charge and dock your Nexus 7.

Not how it got there. I went to Geekbench2 with my desktop purchase...cheap I3 Sandy Bridge Gateway PC on sale for $350 with decent Ram 6GB and 1T hard drive. Works great....Geekbench2 benchmark of 5800. I'm happy. All the Tech Press articles would say I shouldn't be, but all I do is use Microsoft Office, surf the web, and watch some videos. The point being that a geekbench2 benchmark for Tegra 4 of 4592 should make anyone more than happy with a mobile device. Of course you do have the luxury purchasers.....but it's a small percentage of the market. Just like Nvidia has been showng for about a year...Nvidia is coming from the bottom and going up! P.S. Tegra 4 is 2.3 times faster than S600. Qualcomm marketing says S800 is 25% faster than S800 so you still have Tegra 4 considerably faster. And note: KRAIT IS NOT AN ARM15 core. Qualcomm spent gadzillions to develop their own and yet Nvidia buys A15 cores for a few pennies from ARM. It's looking like a very wise decision on Jensen's part. CPUs have become a commodity. The secret sauce is in the GPU! Let's get those Bristol English Boffins a Nobel Prize!

At the upcoming Game Developers' Conference (March 25-29), Nvidia will show the GeForce GRID to the army of game developers, banging the cloud gaming drum with no compromise in quality. Last years' GPU Technology Conference had several cloud gaming companies stirring the pot, while Nvidia and the associated investors were trying to measure the pulse of what companies can deliver, and who can't. The first company to cash out on the whole deal was Gaikai, whose charismatic leader Dave Perry spent seven month on a hype-raising tour, ultimately selling the company for $380 million to Sony (it was rumored that Samsung came $50 million short). However, GAIKAI will not be utilizing the GPU technology in its entirety, as Sony wants to use those several million unsold PlayStation 3 consoles to offer a cloud gaming service for PlayStation 4, removing the need for backward compatibility. For Nvidia, that meant only one thing - go alone with their own service, and have products that align nicely to that. According to an Nvidia representative, GRID is "the upcoming on-demand gaming service from NVIDIA. It's like Netflix's video-streaming service for games, so you can enjoy them wherever you are on your connected device." The company has six partners right now, Agawi, Cloudunion, CyberCloud Networks, G-Cluster Global, Playcast and Ubitus. However, time will tell is Nvidia's "controlled ecosystem" approach the right one to go with - the company had no design wins on Mobile World Congress with the Tegra 4, Tegra 4i (Project Grey, Tegra 3 with LTE Baseband) had a single design win (ZTE), while the strategy around Project SHIELD is unknown. The upcoming GPU Technology Conference (San Jose, CA) on March 18-21, and the subsequent Game Developer Conference (San Francisco) on March 25-29 will shed a lot of light on what's going on with Nvidia.</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1362621484069</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-06 20:58:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362622451188-69</Id><Topic><Title>Nvidia Is Now Claiming I500 is Only 40% The Size of QCOM's MDM9215 Modem</Title><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1362579087081</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-06 09:11:27 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Getanid61, I will quote Jensen in an video about Tegra 4. "Sure we could have spent gadzillions developing our own CPU. Surely Qualcomm has done that but I think you will be impressed with the A15 benchmarks. In November of 2012 he said Project Denver was a project to put ARM cores in High Performance Computing Cards. Said that the general purpose server market was too crowded. So there you have it...Project Denver is going to put ARM 64bit cores in Tesla cards. Sounds great because it would kick Intel Xeon processors to the curb if successful and makes a whole bunch of business sense. And yes the dividend is wonderful thing. That and the on going stock buy back has lowered the stock Beta from 1.9 to 1.63, brought on a whole new class of investors like me, and reduced the options volatility which has reduced the number of day traders and option players. Just look out over the last 3 months at all the semi's. Those that pay dividends and have stock buybacks in place have done the best over this time.</Msg><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1362622451188</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-06 21:14:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362623879344-70</Id><Topic><Title>Nvidia: GeForce GRID is "Netflix for Gamers"</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1362621484069</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-06 20:58:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Theo, Playstation 3's mean royalty;s to Nvidia.

I had to go out to a meeting for a musical I'm going to do next year right after the close, and just got back. Yes, normally, that big OI would likely augur poorly for the stock price, next week. However, as you mentioned, there are times when that is superseded by a major move. I've seen it happen 5-10 times in NVDA, over the years, including the huge spike higher in early 2011, and also last year in August, when the stock went from this level to 15 in 8 days. Given the huge "scare" that was put into those short those March 13 calls, this morning, and given the volume of over 21k calls (OI was 37.78k), it will be interesting to see what the OI is tomorrow morning. I have a "feeling" that most of those were to "close", and cover those short calls, and I still think we've got a chance to break out in a big way before the end of next week. Today's high was the highest intraday price since January, and IF we can close OVER 13 1/8, or so, from a "technical" standpoint, there is NO resistance from there to 15. As always, we'll know in the fullness of time.

Yes, I forgot to mention that we've had higher highs and higher lows for the last week or so, which is VERY encouraging from a technical standpoint. I've done 10-12 leads in musicals and other shows, here in Woodstock, VT, over the last 27 years. In 2008, I got my friend who had directed many of the shows but had moved to Virginia, in 2000, (right after we did "Guys and Dolls" and I was Nathan Detroit), to take a 13 week "leave of absence" from his job at a major theater, there, to come and direct me as "The Music Man", a role I'd wanted to play since I saw it on Broadway with Robert Preston, in 1958...;) He did that, and we had a GREAT time, and I got to play the role of a lifetime even though I was 20-25 years older than the character was supposed to actually be...;) (Although without my beard and my hair slightly darkened, I didn't look too old.) So, he has now moved back to town (about a year ago), and we've been talking about what "good roles" are left for me at my "advanced age". I had thought for awhile that it would be a "kick" to play Tevye, in "Fiddler on the Roof", even though I might have to wear a pillow under my costume to look the part...:) But, I DO have a white beard, and can certainly sing the part, so that's what we're proposing to the local Arts Council for late May, 2014.
