At this point, the Santa Clara, California-based company does not need to prove its point anymore, that GPUs can be a great asset in supercomputers. All it has to do is to keep its accelerators in shape, which should be easy in the near term, as all it needs is to unlock those remaining CUDA cores and SMX units.

Yes, there is general macro concerns. Yes, there is the tablet craze. But I would place part of the blame of the current PC slowdown on AMD's woes. Without AMD pushing them, intel has not been releasing new better product. Instead, Intc s's been releasing die shrinks with same price points, ala bigger margins, but same performance as last gen. Who the heck will upgrade??? The PC industry is not helping either. they are not introducing new products fast enough. same ole 24" 1080 screens, same ole 17.3" 1600:900 laptop sreens etc. Count me as one who held back: I want to upgrade my 2 yr old laptop, but the new stuff out there are the same thing, not enough a diff for me to fork over my $1k.</Msg><Username>whosunw</Username><Timestamp>1350738038067</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-20 09:00:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350738295300-4</Id><Topic><Title>The gales of October came early</Title><Username>edmund_fitzgerald_best</Username><Timestamp>1350711931091</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-20 01:45:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>As the big chipsters go, it was slower than most And the crew and bad captain were radio-less</Msg><Username>edmund_fitzgerald_best</Username><Timestamp>1350738295300</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-20 09:04:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350739672978-5</Id><Topic><Title>The gales of October came early</Title><Username>edmund_fitzgerald_best</Username><Timestamp>1350711931091</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-20 01:45:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Does anyone know where the Apple love goes When their attorneys put in their hours?

The first complaint was posted on Sept. 24 by Hyperyellow, who wrote that following the activation of the iPhone 5 on Verizon, the device incorrectly reported that the date was Sept. 26, 2012, while the time was 30 minutes ahead. "I woke up and looked at my phone and had a melt down because my alarm never went off," Hyperyellow wrote. "I hurriedly got ready and looked at the microwave as I ran out, and it was 30 minutes earlier than my iPhone said." The issue seemed to crop up overnight, as the device was in sleep mode and charging (though the commenter didn't specify whether it was plugged into a computer or a wall outlet). According to the complaint, the glitch, which struck twice, also messed with iMessage, "and I'm sure the rest of the date/time dependent apps." Hyperyellow deployed a quick fix — turning off the automatic time settings, which seemed to do the trick. A slew of responses have been posted in the month since —365, to be exact. They seem to follow suit, alleging the same iPhone 5 time/date problem on Verizon Wireless service. Incorrect times varied from person to person — one complained that their phone was off by 15 days, six hours, and 12 minutes.
