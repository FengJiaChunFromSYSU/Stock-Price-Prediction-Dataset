First, how is Samsung moving to the self-design and self-manufacture of their own mobile processors with integrated modems remotely good for nvidia? Hummm? Answer : It is not. Because nvidia now has one less gigantic company to sell their parts to. nvidia's so-called "Total Addressable Market" -- buyers, don't u know -- has shrunk. Icera also loses a gigantic potential customer too. Secondly -- and quite ironically -- Qualcomm will make an Even Higher Profit Margin by Samsung making their own integrated LTE modam chips. "But but but, how can that be, Bestie?" Well, the reason is simple. Because Qualcomm generates licensing revenue, directly or indirectly, on virtually every wireless device manufaturerd on the planet. Yes, each and every one, boys. Witness the summary of Qualcomm's Licensing Unit ("QTL") for the Twelve Months ending September 30, 2012. $6,327,000,000 __ Qualcomm Licensing Revenue $__742,000,000 __ Cost of licensing $5,585,000,000 __ Earnings Before Taxes -- Qualcomm's Licensing Unit 88% __ Earnings Before Taxes as a % of Licensing Revenues A nice gig, right boys? A REALLY REALLY nice gig Qualcomm has going. Collecting licensing fees from virtually every wireless thing that is made on the planet. So Samsung will be payin' patent vig to Qualcomm too. Just like everybody else. And Qualcomm has virtually no-cost of those no-goods-sold. So Qualcomm will have even Higher profit margins on Samsung's self-manufactured mobile processors. Than if Qualcomm actually went through the time and trouble to make 'em. Like nvidia currently tries to do. Did I mention? It's a nice gig for Qualcomm, right boys?</Msg><Username>good_point_best</Username><Timestamp>1353478207461</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 01:10:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353480599617-2</Id><Topic><Title>Samsung KICKS OUT Qualcoomm for own modem/chipset in a variant of Galaxy S3 LTE smartphone</Title><Username>ibexx88</Username><Timestamp>1353462412539</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 20:46:52 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So Master? If nvidia ever gets their Grey chips working, -- with that on-board LTE integrated modem -- nvidia will have to pay licensing fees to Qualcomm too, right? Just like everybody else.

So the CEO announces that the future won't be as good as the past. Sometimes giving a generalized reason like, "Global sales of PC's stink." Which, for a company like nvidia that gets 2/3rds of their revenue from the sale of parts which attach to PC's, is Not a good thing. "Chopping guidance" it's called in the lingo of investing.

Few key events have happened in last few days - TXN/OMAP exit. INTC/CEO retirement. NVDA is a spec stock anyway. Its running on 3 themes: 1. Defend high end GPU, GPGPU market share. AMD and INTC are the main competition. One is in disarray and the other has not been able to deliver (proof Apple going with NVDA for high-end) 2. Further in-roads in Mobile. All the bets are on Wayne and Grey. Amazon will need to move to a new chipset next year. Adreno 320 will be trumped and lampooned by Wayne/GPU at CES. TegraZone games are gaining steam and that will make tablet/video gaming a key differentiator. 3. Project Denver.

So today it's just walking "bird". So it is with nvidia's Tegra #3. The Tegra #3 is a descendant of the prehistoric Tegradactyl, don't you know. Yes, the Tegradactyl, boys.. Once a mighty, fearsome, ferociously fighting, flying dinosaur bird. Take a look, boys.

More than 43,000 NVDA options trade, compared to the daily average of 7,500 in the last month. Puts outpace calls by 10 to 1 in today's session, with almost all of the action in the January 11 puts. More than 37,000 of those contracts have traded against open interest of 3,513. Blocks of 18,000 and 17,500 were sold in a matter of seconds for the bid price of $0.36, according to optionMONSTER's tracking systems. NVDA is up 2.35 percent to $11.76 in afternoon trading. Shares of he graphics-chip maker have been trending lower from above $15 in early August and were down at a low of $11.15 a week ago. The put selling is a wager that NVDA will remain above $11 through the expiration. The trader is also willing to buy shares if they are below the strike, at an effective buying price of $10.64 including the credit from the put sale.</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1353527889621</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 14:58:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353528884278-31</Id><Topic><Title>Is Intel acquisition of Nvidia possible?</Title><Username>o.investor</Username><Timestamp>1353430809659</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 12:00:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Time is tight and Intel doesn't have much more time as they lose more market share to ARM. They're backs are against the wall, and many scenarios are probably being considered to stop the hemorrhaging? Perhaps they might just bite the bullet and consider buying Nvidia if their band of lawyers say they would have a good chance of passing SEC anti-trust issues? How many years have they been trying with Atom without any success? Intel will always be behind with the bloated legacy x86 issues that will not be able to break the long-time advantage ARM has in pricing, and power savings. Offering Jen the top spot that's now available, along with a generous buy-out price might be something Jen would consider? Jen did make a point of wanting to be in charge of AMD when they wanted to buy Nvidia. Most likely won't happen, but strange things have happened in the past with mergers and acquisitions.</Msg><Username>chitownbarber20</Username><Timestamp>1353528884278</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 15:14:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353529687804-32</Id><Topic><Title>Is Intel acquisition of Nvidia possible?</Title><Username>o.investor</Username><Timestamp>1353430809659</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 12:00:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"But how long until LTE is a commodity...??

The ex-dividend was on the 20th, period. Nvidia may have intended to say the week of the 23rd, not sure. But it's done.
