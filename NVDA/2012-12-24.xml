A Huge Huge WIN for those energy efficient Intel Xeon Phi chips! Intel has won the #1 Fastest Supercomputer on the Planet. THE #1, boys. Let's read excerpts about how 200,000 Intel parts will exclusively power THE Fastest, Most Powerful Supercomputer in the History of Mankind, shall we? "Sometimes in the next 18 months, Intel will power the world's most powerful supercomputer. Consisted of approximately 100,000 Ivy Bridge-EP based Xeon E5's and 100,000 Xeon Phi boards (Knights Landing), the Chinese supercomputer should be the world's most powerful, reaching no less than 100 PFLOPS of compute power. ... the supercomputer should reach 100 PFLOPS, approximately 10 times faster than the fastest supercomputer in 2011 and five times faster than the current fastest supercomputer. This project is heavily backed by the Chinese government and Ministry of Sciences, viewed as the system needed to aid the China space exploration, as well as rising the health research to a new degree. The government sees that within the next couple of decades, it will have to start battling the older population, predict where to build cities, calculate the highway system (by 2020, China plans to build more new highways than the current total in the United States, for example - and have twice as much highways than U.S. by 2030), public transportation system as well as wild projects such as intelligent license plates, real time traffic calculation to suggest preferred speed to reduce stoppages on the roads etc. ... this will be the fastest supercomputer for some time. ... the Chinese supercomputer will be a majestic rig indeed, with over 200,000 pieces of silicon processing weather simulations, calculating Chinese space projects (manned missons to the Moon by 2020, Mars by 2025), and many more. ... Intel will earn some nice dollars off the special warranty arrangements." Intel will power the #1 Fastest Super computer on the Planet. "THIS will be the fastest supercomputer for some time." 10 times faster than the fastest supercomputer in 2011. Using over 200,000 pieces of Intel designed and manufactured silicon. Looks like Intel has done it again, boys. Killed-off yet another one of nvidia's litte businesses.

Apple is reportedly using a ARMv7 core of their own design. It falls somewhere in performance between the A9 and A15. It's difficult to judge the relative power efficiency because of their closed OS. Qualcomm is also using a core of their own design, "Krait". Qualcomm's designs started out being measurably below the same-era ARM Holdings designs, and they initially appeared to have wasted their investment. But by sticking with their internal design team they were able to bring out a A15 class processor earlier than vendors waiting on ARM. Samsung was the first with the actual A15 with the dual core Exynos 5 in the Nexus 10. Actually the Arndale board was the first announced, but you couldn't get those until the Nexus 10 was on the shelves. It appears that Nvidia will be the first with a quad core A15. We can expect that Samsung will have an equivalent quad core Exynos 5 sometime in early spring.</Msg><Username>watergatefive</Username><Timestamp>1356374855150</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-24 13:47:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356379982508-24</Id><Title>5% correction coming up</Title><Msg>NVDA is sitting at MA-50, I think "fiscal cliff" drama takes it down to 11.50 by end of week.

Tegra needs $1B per year to break even... At least currently, Tegra will greatly increase its reach with Project Denver cores... "I do see pressure on GPU segment with Intel Haswell." Ya know, every year the exact same thing is said... The new GPUs just keep raising the bar... and last report, INtel drivers can now run 100 games... Pressure will be in 2yrs on the x86 segment from ARM64...</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1356405375456</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-24 22:16:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356407072892-33</Id><Topic><Title>case study to prove 4+1 advantage</Title><Username>o.investor</Username><Timestamp>1356380607444</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-24 15:23:27 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Microsoft isn't using the 5th core because their software isn't mature. They wanted to keep a vendor-neutral software interface, yet expected the vendors to go all out to support and improve their unproven platform. That works in the desktop world, but not when they are struggling to hit 1%. The companion core approach is a great solution, but it doesn't address the power consumed by the rest of the system off of the SoC. I would say the bigger advantage is that is avoids the big.LITTLE approach, which is difficult to schedule for. By the time the Android Linux kernel gets good at simultaneously using asymmetrical cores, the next hardware generation will be here.</Msg><Username>watergatefive</Username><Timestamp>1356407072892</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-24 22:44:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356410178423-34</Id><Topic><Title>Ouya - oh yeah</Title><Username>o.investor</Username><Timestamp>1356365544782</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-24 11:12:24 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>well the HDD controller makers were all saying the same thing about SSD and see how quickly that changed - of course, floods in Thailand helped... its a no-brainer that one of these days, Intel GPU will be accepted as good enough. Just look at MBP 13" - it provides Pixel whatever with Intel solution. You are in denial if you think GPU business as standalone has any future. If Nvidia was thinking about shareholder interests - they would sell or, scale back and start licensing etc. The stock would be at $20+. However, I have on good authority that Nvida top management is mediocre and delusional. I am counting on that.</Msg><Username>o.investor</Username><Timestamp>1356410178423</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-24 23:36:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message></Date>
