He sure did. Take a look. Right here on this fine board. Search for this : "Jeepers Best, Everybody else pays a dividend." "So let's say that the Institutional Investors have gathered, smoked some nice Cuban cigars, told a few yachting stories, and voted. Jen is out at CEO, and the new guy is in. And let's say the new guy decides that $3 Billion of cash is Waaaay too much to be holding for no particular reason. And he decides to distribute say, $2 Billion of it as a one-time Dividend. Here's how some of the checks would look. Pay to the Order of: $280.8 million __ FMR LLC $122.0 million __ PRICE (T.ROWE) ASSOCIATES INC $112.6 million __ VANGUARD GROUP, INC. (THE) $62.4 million __ PRIMECAP MANAGEMENT COMPANY $53.2 million __ BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. $30.2 million __ AllianceBernstein, L.P. $25.4 million __ Invesco Ltd. $22.6 million __ BlackRock Fund Advisors $323.88 __ for a holder of 1,000 shares "And when is a good time to meet?" See that part? Hummm? "...distribute say, $2 Billion of it as a one-time Dividend." Great advice from Best, right? It sure was. The best advice -- as always. And what did we get instead from Jen? A teeny-tiny Recurring dividend of $00.075 -- which will be taxed at the Higher future tax rate. So the rest of the more financially astute companies will be printing-up their Tax Efficient One Time Dividends this year, while Jen dawdles around with his Higher Taxed teeny-tiny little dividends. And they wonder why this sinker is hitting new 52-week lows every day following Jen's Tax Inefficient teeny-tiny recurring dividend. Enjoy paying your higher taxes, boys.</Msg><Username>it_is_best</Username><Timestamp>1353248571585</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-18 09:22:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353249051802-7</Id><Topic><Title>Fiscal Cliff?

Just Ridiculous. Jen and his interim launched the sensationalized headlines a week ago Thursday, right?. But there is still no fact-filled 10-Q available for the investor community. None. nvidia needs to get more like Apple, you know. Apple releases their 10-Q report much faster than nvidia. Much Much Faster. Like, THE DAY AFTER THE EARNINGS ANNOUNCEMENT. It's true. And remember, Apple is a much much larger enterprise than nvidia. Much Much Larger. So they have oh so much more accounting to do. For example, Apple has 70 Times the EBITDA that little nvidia has. Yet they get their financial results to their lucky investors, well, Faster. Like, THE DAY AFTER THE EARNINGS ANNOUNCEMENT. Not a week ago last Thursday -- and we're all still waiting on it. Maybe another management issue here, right boys? OR, maybe Jen and his interim are tryin' to finagle the 10-Q numbers a bit? You know, like maybe make the Tegra/CPB look, well, not so bad? Maybe moving a bunch of tegra engineers from CPB unit to maybe the GPU unit? Thereby moving a bunch of expenses that belong in the Tegra/CPB, well, out.

In 2012, Nvidia dominated non-apple, non-samsung, non-amazon tablet sales. Unfortunately, the SAM for that was quite small. Nvidia thinks it can reverse smartphone absence by integrating LTE. There are 2 BIG problems with that theory: 1. NVDA does not have a popular discrete LTE modem. 2. QCOM has set the bar so high with integration that NVDA has no opportunity of winning the integration war and smartphone SOC. - S4 Pro has 3G/LTE (World Mode), 802.11ac, BT 4.0, GPS etc. all integrated on a single die. The only hope for NVDA is a misstep from QCOM, e.g. integrated LTE or, 802.11ac performance is worse than a discrete design. NVDA can under-cut QCOM pricing but the market will not reward a stock with declining margins.</Msg><Username>o.investor</Username><Timestamp>1353260386224</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-18 12:39:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353261936474-17</Id><Title>I'm out</Title><Msg>This one is doomed.

I actually like Nvidia the company, I have bought their products - Nexus 7 being the latest. I am just not in love with NVDA the stock - that's all. Ask yourself this: 1. Why did NVDA start a dividend now? IR was asked this question at UBS conf. and gave a non-answer answer. I will tell you why, they want to help stock price from falling too much. Their earlier efforts of returning value to stockholders by investing in R&amp;D has not paid adequate dividends with stock price languishing at 52 week low. 2. NVDA has an outstanding stock repurchase program BUT has not actually exercised any buybacks this year despite 52-week low. Why? NVDA sees a tough year in 2013 and expects to buy back stock at much lower price. 3. Why a tough 2013? - Project Wayne delays (Q1 2013) - Project Grey delays (Q3 2013) NVDA will probably have moderate success in Android Tablet market but no where close to 100% growth they experienced in 2012. NVDA will not make any progress in Android Smartphone segment - see my earlier comments on failure to gain traction with discrete LTE modems to fully appreciate QCOM Snapdragon S4 competition. And obviously its not just me, look at the market reaction when on the face of it - NVDA beat numbers and declared dividend and extended stock repurchase yet NVDA the stock has sold off on increasing volume. If that is not a sure sign then I don't know what it.</Msg><Username>o.investor</Username><Timestamp>1353268705996</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-18 14:58:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353268804054-26</Id><Topic><Title>I'm out</Title><Username>flumoxed11</Username><Timestamp>1353261936474</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-18 13:05:36 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Intel claims yet another victim."

Another question, if I may. That would be known as a "cause and effect" relationship, right? The cause would be that nvidia's line-up of chips is getting stale and old.

The effect is that, well, the stock is hitting new 52-week lows every day. 'Cause the Market, she doesn't like old things. Oh no no no.
