Tegra 4 offers exceptional graphics processing, with lightning-fast web browsing, stunning visuals and new camera capabilities through computational photography. Previously codenamed "Wayne," Tegra 4 features 72 custom NVIDIAGeForce™ GPU cores -- or six times the GPU horsepower of Tegra 3 -- which deliver more realistic gaming experiences and higher resolution displays. It includes the first quad-core application of ARM's most advanced CPU core, the Cortex-A15, which delivers 2.6x faster web browsing and breakthrough performance for apps. Tegra 4 also enables worldwide 4G LTE voice and data support through an optional chipset, the fifth-generation NVIDIAIcera® i500 processor. More efficient and 40 percent the size of conventional modems, i500 delivers four times the processing capability of its predecessor.</Msg><Username>goovnia</Username><Timestamp>1357537319124</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 00:41:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>13</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357538014666-13</Id><Topic><Title>4K video coming out of a mobile device - first time ever!</Title><Username>ibexx88</Username><Timestamp>1357537678337</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 00:47:58 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I am impressed with great surprise...just wow lion now puts a buy rating on nvidia</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1357538014666</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 00:53:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>15</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357538730545-14</Id><Topic><Title>72 GPU CORES/4-A15/4G LTE</Title><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1357534666568</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-06 23:57:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>SHIELD DISRUPTS GAME CONSOLES WOW BUY RATING ENFORCED ON NVDA</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1357538730545</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 01:05:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357538770309-15</Id><Title>Nvidia Shield Is A Huge Winner</Title><Msg>Games from Googleplay, Tegra Zone, and Steam.

Put simply, SHIELD is an NVIDIA-branded, Android-based portable game device with a 5” 720P display that can play Android and PC games. It will be available in “Q2/2013” at a “to be determined price.” Using NVIDIA’s latest and greatest mobile processor, Tegra 4, game players can display locally on their own device or display wirelessly to an HDTV. The form factor isn’t rectangular like the PS Vita, Nintendo DS, or Apple iPod, but rather shaped more like an XBOX or Playstation controller with a fold-out display. The ability to play PC games is accomplished leveraging the same kind of technology that is used in NVIDIA’s commercial VDI (remote desktop) and cloud gaming technology, called NVIDIA VGX Technology. Essentially the Kepler-based technology renders a video of the gameplay as it is happening on the PC and wirelessly send it to the “Shield” or an HDTV. With NVIDIA’s Kepler architecture, they significantly improved their rendering technology so that the gaming latency would be minimized. Shield sends gameplay commands wirelessly to the gaming PC. The Most Significant Consumer Technology Products of 2012 Patrick Moorhead Patrick Moorhead Contributor Apple Borrows NVIDIA's Tegra Vision for the new iPad Patrick Moorhead Patrick Moorhead Contributor Key Console Player Leaves AMD For Nvidia Brian Caulfield Brian Caulfield Forbes Staff The important piece of information we don’t know yet is the price, but they have a lot to work with. You have to consider what it could replace and compete with: Apple iPod Touch- starts at $299 Sony PS Vita- starts at $249 Sony PlayStation 3: starts at $249 Nintendo 3DS XL- starts at $199 Microsoft XBOX 360: starts at $199 There are some big differences in the economics. Each of the devices, except the iPod Touch, is significantly subsidized by games that cost between $25-$70. I expect NVIDIA to price SHIELD more like the iPod Touch, with an initial higher price point. I would expect games to be priced between $1-$20, like Android games are priced today. Buyers can also play any games they may have previously purchased too, let’s say from their Android phones or tablets like the Google Nexus 7. Very important to stress, none of the competitive game devices can play PC games, and that will be very important to some gamers. PC gamers don’t always enjoy sitting at the table or desk and like to be mobile, too. NVIDIA sent a shock wave through the gaming industry tonight with its Project SHIELD nnouncement. Yes, there are many unanswered questions, but regardless of those answers, this is a major disruption to portable game devices, game consoles and devices like the Apple iPod. I give NVIDIA a lot of credit for this disruption as it could payoff big for them but also for gamers.</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1357540302852</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 01:31:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>17</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357540376146-28</Id><Topic><Title>No Project Denver announcement as rumored...</Title><Username>ibexx88</Username><Timestamp>1357539200978</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 01:13:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Honestly, who cares about Denver?

Then you would see the price match the offering price per share instantly . . and you would see a whole different set of investors jump in an many selling the bulk of the shares because of their relatively low entry point. I do think we can see a steep rise without the 'spike' if there are clear signals that AMD is caving (even worse than is apparent now) or some other related event for a competitor makes it apparent Nvidia is the main beneficiary.</Msg><Username>roundhouse_c</Username><Timestamp>1357540619632</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 01:36:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357540861100-31</Id><Topic><Title>No Project Denver announcement as rumored...</Title><Username>ibexx88</Username><Timestamp>1357539200978</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 01:13:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well, I agree that seeing the Tegra line becoming profitably as a result of what you envision is what any investor (and analyst) would like to see that is bullish, but any concrete news on Denver will help diffuse the feeling that Intel is a threat to Nvidia's future growth . . even if that perception isn't necessarily valid at least in the near-term.</Msg><Username>roundhouse_c</Username><Timestamp>1357540861100</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 01:41:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357540880554-32</Id><Topic><Title>No Project Denver announcement as rumored...</Title><Username>ibexx88</Username><Timestamp>1357539200978</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 01:13:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"CES is mostly about what you will see in the American living rooms" ...Grid...</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1357540880554</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 01:41:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357541286985-33</Id><Topic><Title>Ashraf Eassa on SeekingAlpha -- Qualcomm: Aggressively Buy Dips</Title><Username>i_read_best</Username><Timestamp>1357515379750</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-06 18:36:19 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Qualcomm: Aggressively Buy Dips" Looks like a good call.</Msg><Username>elf.best</Username><Timestamp>1357541286985</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 01:48:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357541663640-34</Id><Topic><Title>Ashraf Eassa on SeekingAlpha -- Qualcomm: Aggressively Buy Dips</Title><Username>i_read_best</Username><Timestamp>1357515379750</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-06 18:36:19 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>'Looks like a bad call'.... best's mother</Msg><Username>fdigiovanni01</Username><Timestamp>1357541663640</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 01:54:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357542408841-35</Id><Topic><Title>No Project Denver announcement as rumored...</Title><Username>ibexx88</Username><Timestamp>1357539200978</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 01:13:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"No Project Denver announcement as rumored." Face it, boys. Jen's performance Sunday night at the big CES event was a Failure. Yes boys, a Total Failure. The gimcrack "Shield" didn't work on stage. The gimcrack "Thor" has a teeny-tiny screen. Nobody in the audience cared about about the rack of game servers. The "optimize game settings" scrap of code was a real yawner. And the applause throughout the night was politely tepid. At best. This sinker closes this year's CES Below where it opens the week.</Msg><Username>bestogram</Username><Timestamp>1357542408841</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 02:06:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>17</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357543355545-36</Id><Topic><Title>JUST IN from WSJ: NVIDIA plans to sell its own device (the Shield)</Title><Username>ibexx88</Username><Timestamp>1357542955318</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 02:15:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Too bad Jen couldn't get that gimcrack Shield device to work on stage!

Meet Project Shield, graphics guru Nvidia’s Android-powered gamepad that’s as much PS4 killer as PS Vita slayer. Read on to find out why this might be your next console, handheld or home… Just days after the Android-powered GameStick stormed Kickstarter, Nvidia has unleashed its own Google-powered gamepad with a console inside. It’s called Project Shield, and looks a lot like an Xbox 360 controller with a five-inch, high-definition screen on the top. See the insane TV tech of CES 2013 here That’s where the similarities end though. It’s a hardcore portable gaming machine that runs Android with full access to Google’s services and Play app store: you can play your favourite mobile shooter using two thumbsticks, like you would at home. But it also plays your home PC’s games too. When connected over Wi-Fi, Project Shield can stream high end games directly from your own PC, so long as it’s powered by one of Nvidia’s GeForce GTX 650 graphics cards or higher – it’ll even work with your Steam downloads. Better yet, you can use Project Shield to play all your PC games on the telly too: it supports output via HDMI with resolutions up to a staggering 4K (sharper than HD). Talk about future proofed. Sadly, no price has been put on Project Shield just yet, but if you’re as excited as we are, you won’t have too long to wait: it goes on sale in Q2 of this year, or sometime between April and June in plain English."</Msg><Username>daysofshred30000000000</Username><Timestamp>1357551867189</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 04:44:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357555648750-40</Id><Title>New gaming device</Title><Msg>Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo just soiled themselves! It won't take very long for the ramifications of this announcement to sink in. The processor is more powerful than anything in a current gaming console. The graphics is magnitudes better. No more paying $50 a pop for gaming software. Thousands of games immediately available. The device is portable. Those are just the immediate benefits of the device for the consumer. Looking at what the device will do for Nvidia: 1. First to market with such a device 2. Total control of the platform 3. First revolutionary gaming device in a decade 4. Will spur a whole new wave of game developers who will be able to market their stuff for a low cost/pricing. No more having to pay huge sums of money to become a developer with any of the majors and do development in a custom/proprietary sandbox. And guess who will collect commissions for making the sales through Tegra Zone? EA and the majors will have little choice but to also develop for this platform at a lower price point than their current console games as the number of users is going to be enormous. 5. Since it is a Nvidia device, will have control over pricing and be able to price competitively as needed and still be able to get higher margins than bulk wholesale shipments to the phone/tablet manufacturers. 6. Since the other gaming consoles are moving away from Nvidia this is a natural move. 7. The volume of sales of this device will be enormous. If Nvidia prices this thing at $199 it will tear a new one for the majors. If they get it down to $99, there will be one (or more) in every household. 8. Having all the wireless capabilities in the device, it opens the doors for wireless accessories to work in tandem with it and a new breed of Android-based games that could take advantage of enhanced capabilities. These are just the obvious ones to me. Feel free to add your own. I've got a hard on! I want one of these things today!</Msg><Username>nip7890</Username><Timestamp>1357555648750</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 05:47:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357557185599-41</Id><Topic><Title>Opening at 15.00+ tomorrow</Title><Username>cansomeonetellmenowpls</Username><Timestamp>1357539631632</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 01:20:31 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Amazon Best Buy Target Walmart Tegra Zone What more is needed?</Msg><Username>nip7890</Username><Timestamp>1357557185599</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 06:13:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357560815958-42</Id><Title>Tegra 4 and SHIELD game console will both be #1 in their markets - Nvidia WILL hit $20 this week!</Title><Msg>Absolutely unbelievable technology!!!!

It it nice to find yourself smile several times during the show. I also like the strong tie between all the products and announcement during the show. They made a complete story and tie-in of the products' place in the big picture. The also made a convicing argument about the ever lasting thirst for more compute power - even in mobile devices. I really like that HDR camera demo and believe it could be a killer "app" for many users when choosing a phone, since we dont want to carry seperate cameraes beyond the phone anymore. Also twice as fast web browsing etc. Nvidias' insight into compute discoveries from GTC and supercomputing is paying dividends in the consumer class products too. Talk about Computationel photography. Very cool. That Shield announcement was indeed a complete surprise to all of us. All the other news we sort of new from combing through all previously held conferences (GTC, CC's and live webcasts and msg board news). But Shield is brand new and just the product to sell their vision. They made a strong argument today and most likely many users will look into their product as the mobile console of 2013 and forward for now. It will certainly garner a lot of press. Well done Nvidia. I always liked your innovative culture and today you made me an even prouder owner of the company.

Net impact of all the announcements for '13: $0. Yes, that's right, $0: 1. T4 just spec launch as rumored , even 'less' than the paper launch of T3 - no partners, no announcements of when devices will come out. Look for Q4 for the first $, if nvda is lucky. = $100M Tegra loss in Q and going forward. Since no announcement of when T4 will be available = chip has bugs and not ready for production. 2. 'T4 with Icera' - so what is different today than yesterday? Even o.investor knew about 'I500'. Does I500 work? who is qualed? Still no Grey (personally, I don't think it needs to be integrated silicon, integrated solution is good enuf) 3. Exact same dynamic in tablets: cannot get at aapl's 60% market share, nor sammie's 15% market share, nor amzn's 8% market share. 4. 'Shield' - zero word on what this will go to market; back to school? X'mas? nobody knows. Side comment: why need one for the home, any real PC gamer with an ounce of self respect would already have gotten their own remote controller, no need to buy anything to play their game 'at a more comfortable position'. Ground breaking Kinect it is not. Outside the home, you are asking people to carry more than one device to play the same Android game? For me, hard to judge the potential success. But it is about time nvda think outside just tablet and phones.

It's really, really light. The kind of light where we picked the tablet up and wondered immediately whether or not there was a battery inside, or anything for that matter. The rounded slate with the soft-touch back is fairly thin, too, and it adds up to a 10-inch tablet that feels considerably smaller than the iPad or a Nexus 10. The Vizio 10-inch Tablet has quite a bit in common with Google's larger slate, actually. Its 10.1-inch, 2560 x 1600 display matches the Nexus 10, and we've quite liked the screen before — pushing that many pixels did cause the Nexus 10 some problems, but we're hoping Tegra 4 is more up to the task. The 10-inch Tablet also has 32GB of storage, Bluetooth 4.0 and Wi-Fi, front and rear cameras, and the standard set of ports and connectivity. Vizio wouldn't tell us when the 10-inch Tablet is coming, or how much it will cost. No matter what, though, Vizio appears to have built an impressive 10-inch Android slate — as long as that Tegra 4 is everything it's billed to be.</Msg><Username>livinlifeveryday</Username><Timestamp>1357564944784</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 08:22:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357565810654-48</Id><Topic><Title>Do You Think NVDA is a BUY?</Title><Username>kwbeggnd6225</Username><Timestamp>1357565461005</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 08:31:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>i think you r a fraud</Msg><Username>seito15</Username><Timestamp>1357565810654</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 08:36:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357566923139-49</Id><Topic><Title>Crow for whosunw</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1357539095391</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 01:11:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Just more of your usual blather that shows you are still stuck on stupid!</Msg><Username>chitownbarber20</Username><Timestamp>1357566923139</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 08:55:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357567498088-50</Id><Topic><Title>Crow for whosunw</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1357539095391</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 01:11:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Too much crow has gone to your head... btw, do you like your crow raw... or just cold...

You don't have to capture a major portion of that to see a big impact to the bottom line. Can NVDA take 5% of that? That's $3.4 billion thank you very much. This is a good move and at the right time.

Just smoke &amp; mirrors or for real? Perhaps T4 is further ahead of T3 at launch? Jen promised T3 tablet in August last time, but nothing till X'mas. if jen is not lying again, maybe nvda might see some revenue from T4 in 13 after all, from Shield. To take advantage of Shield, there needs to be Android games written that use all the physical controls, instead of the usual Android touch screen/accelerator controls. without those, that platform won't go far. So far, no software partners have been announced. Not a good sign if they are prepared for a Q2 launch.</Msg><Username>whosunw</Username><Timestamp>1357572648552</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 10:30:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357572713969-69</Id><Topic><Title>Crow for whosunw</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1357539095391</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 01:11:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>balancing everything, my guess is first T4 revenue at X'mas.

It had a 35.8 percent share in the same quarter last year. “Apple has reached a major milestone in the U.S. by passing the 50-percent share mark for the first time, with further gains expected to be made during December, Kantar’s Dominic Sunnebo said in a statement." The Genuine Apple iOS increased from 35.8% to 53.3% market share. In just one (1) year, mind you. And the Christmas 2012 new Apple iPhone activations aren't counted yet.

LOL Steve Mann developed and patented the global-HDR method for producing digital images. Canon already owns patents, what NVIDIA implemented in Tegra4 Canon’s In-Camera HDR Patent Will Let You Take Pictures Like This Canon's looking to change the way you take HDR pictures. Previously, in order to capture images like these, you'd have to combine photos in post. With a new patent, the process will be done in-camera, at the pixel level. High Dynamic Range pictures are taken by capturing the same subject at varying exposure levels and then combining those images in photo editing software. The idea is to create something that's more detailed and potentially more representative of what your eye can see. You can see what HDR photos look like in one of our Shooting Challenges. Canon's new patent wants to turn that sort of complicated process all in-camera. The way it works: According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, preliminary image capturing is performed using the image capturing unit, and the exposure time is assigned to each pixel based on the result of the preliminary image capturing. Image capturing can thus be performed with a wide dynamic range without a loss of highlight detail and a loss of shadow detail. Other cameras, like the Sony A550 and A500, are capable of doing in-camera HDR but they're more of a quick chop method. Mapping out the exposure level by the pixel is far more detailed and if done correctly, has huge implications. HDR has its fair share of fans and haters but Canon's patent would give Canon cameras the ability to capture a much wider dynamic range in a single image and a stand out feature in the ever evolving</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1357598874843</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 17:47:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357598903005-150</Id><Topic><Title>Problem with Presentation</Title><Username>roundhouse_c</Username><Timestamp>1357594581270</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 16:36:21 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Clone 185, "Balderdash" means nonsense.

Where each core in the GPU T604 is a combination of two arithmetic pipeline and a pipeline texture, with the new solution we have twice the number of arithmetic pipelines per core . There will also be a doubling in the number of shaders and support for DirectX 11, OpenCL 1.1, OpenGL ES 1.1/2.0 and OpenVG 1.1. ARM has predicted that it will be possible to create up to eight T658 GPU core , something that together with all the other will have graphics performance 10 times faster than a version of "mainstream" of the Mali 400 and four times the computing power of the T604 . Among the companies that adopt definitely Mali T658 products of 2013 (probably based on the architecture Cortex A15), we have Samsung (the company that most of all is depopulated in the smartphone industry thanks to the Galaxy line), Fujitsu Semiconductor, LG Electronics and Nufront. The game, however, is open: in addition to the ARM solution we have already mentioned Imagination Technologies, Nvidia and Qualcomm do not forget with the Adreno solutions. It must be rubbing their hands over the next two years will see some good (and thanks to these GPUs in high definition).

That is why we gathered the existing quad-core mobile chipsets at the office table, and ran a few standard benchmark tests to decide who is who in the world of multicore. Of notable absence are the overclocked 1.6 GHz Exynos 4412 in the Note II and 1.7 GHz Tegra 3+ in the HTC One X+. These would certainly perform better than their basic versions, but are not actually a different processor family, just one with a 0.2 GHz step overclock, so we wanted to stick with stock. We used the LG Optimus G with its Snapdragon S4 Pro, the Samsung Galaxy S III with the Exynos 4412, the LG Optimus 4X HD with Tegra 3, and the new entrant - Huawei Ascend D quad XL - with its homemade K3V2 quad-core processor. As you can see from the results in the video below, all except one deliver a similar performance, with Huawei's processor delivering a pleasant surprise in the graphics department, and the Exynos proving to be a great all-arounder. The big outlier is the S4 Pro, however, and we have to admit that Qualcomm has done a great job with this processor, whose cores are using instructions from the Cortex-A15 architecture of ARM, just like Apple's newly-minted A6 processor. The weakest performer most of the time was the Tegra 3 chip, which can be expected, as it was the first quad-core processor announced, and is done with the older 40nm process. Next week is rumored to see the unveiling of a Samsung Nexus tablet with the real-deal Cortex-A15 processor of the Exynos 5-series, so we can't wait to see the benchmarks from that one.</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1357601190662</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 18:26:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357601284939-158</Id><Topic><Title>Problem with Presentation</Title><Username>roundhouse_c</Username><Timestamp>1357594581270</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 16:36:21 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well, I can't reply to your post on the distortion but Canon does not own Nvidia's chip design.

As far as the previous post about whether NVDA shoulda/coulda sold it as the next XBox or Wii chip rather than going their own way with Shield, that just doesn't fit, IMO, the direction or timing of what the console folks wanted to do. Chaining the XBox or worse, a Wii, to a PC would be a non-starter as far as what those consoles are designed to do short term or long term. XBox is a total living room system, or soon will be.</Msg><Username>panacro</Username><Timestamp>1357602031443</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 18:40:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357602057036-161</Id><Topic><Title>Lava XOLO of India announced a new smartphone based on Tegra 4, to be released by March 2013</Title><Username>ibexx88</Username><Timestamp>1357589560879</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 15:12:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>see this sis my worry for NVIDIA Most 900lbs Gorillas now make their own SoC's and they dominate marketing channels at Mobile carriers around the globe How can NVIDIA get that massive volume scale against these 900lb Gorillas?

Nothing much has changed now she's covering all things photography related for CNET. A patent originally filed by Apple in June 2012 details a method of generating high dynamic range (HDR) photos by using a single exposure. (Credit: Apple) HDR imaging has become increasingly popular amongst manufacturers and photographers who want to boost the dynamic range of their images to better display variances in shadow and highlight detail. Usually to make an HDR image, the photographer needs to take several exposures and stitch them together in post-processing. A patent filed by Apple and discovered by the Image Sensors World blog details a process whereby an HDR image can be created from a single photo. Problems that can arise from the traditional multiple-exposure method include ghosting and shifting subjects — unless you are able to hold the camera or phone particularly still or use a tripod. Apple has already had an HDR mode available in the camera module for a while, though it combines three separate exposures using the traditional method. A diagram from Apple's patent filing that shows an image sensor with the HDR capability. (Screenshot by CBSi) This new patent outlines how the device can scan the same row of pixels multiple times. The data is then combined to create the HDR image. This method would mitigate any possibility of ghosting and motion blur from combining multiple exposures. A similar patent has previously been filed by Canon, which also shows how a single photo could be used to make an HDR image. The Canon method appears to work slightly differently, by adjusting exposure on a pixel-by-pixel basis.</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1357602366874</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 18:46:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357602859822-164</Id><Title>cramer said nvda stuck in the mud</Title><Msg>barebone facts very heavy above avg volume today to the downside. was 12.05 less than a week ago lots of profit still in stock that traders will take unless some braniac analyst comes out with a buy but they already spoke today by the volume action first they get their buddies out and them come out with negative comments. notice how no firm said anything today</Msg><Username>tomasco3777</Username><Timestamp>1357602859822</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 18:54:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357603307490-165</Id><Topic><Title>cramer said nvda stuck in the mud</Title><Username>tomasco3777</Username><Timestamp>1357602859822</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 18:54:19 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>no analyst worth the salt would say anything today..they need to get moreinfo from the company and adjust their models....the stocks wheels will stop spinning soon..</Msg><Username>smallstock1</Username><Timestamp>1357603307490</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 19:01:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357603430962-166</Id><Topic><Title>cramer said nvda stuck in the mud</Title><Username>tomasco3777</Username><Timestamp>1357602859822</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 18:54:19 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>barebone facts: $5.50/share cash, profitable company, dividend, share repurchase. we'll hear from the brainiac analysts and their buddies after they buy all the shares they want and the stock is a few bucks higher. they're Cramer's buddies too - why do you think he's spewing all the negativity? then, one day he'll just do a 180 as he did with Pfizer after pooping on it for a decade. you'll see.</Msg><Username>nip7890</Username><Timestamp>1357603430962</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 19:03:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357603949787-167</Id><Title>Project shield estimated cost $79-99</Title><Msg>SOURCE: wwwDOTfacebookDOTcom/ProjectShieldNvidia Not a gamer but I'll buy one.</Msg><Username>brokeagain73</Username><Timestamp>1357603949787</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 19:12:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>17</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357604076188-168</Id><Topic><Title>cramer said nvda stuck in the mud</Title><Username>tomasco3777</Username><Timestamp>1357602859822</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 18:54:19 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Cramer sucks...the few recommendations I've take from him either influencing a buy or staying away...I've been burned.</Msg><Username>brokeagain73</Username><Timestamp>1357604076188</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 19:14:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357604261289-169</Id><Topic><Title>Lava XOLO of India announced a new smartphone based on Tegra 4, to be released by March 2013</Title><Username>ibexx88</Username><Timestamp>1357589560879</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 15:12:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Note that unlike ibbey's sensationalized headline at the top of this thread, what Mr. S N Rai, Co-founder and Director of Lava International, told the The Mobile Indian publication was, "We are in the Process of Evaluating the Option to launch a Nvidia Tegra 4 smartphone."

I don't know how many it will seel, but remember those funky Nvidia 3D glasses. They have sold over a million at a retail cost of $199 in 4 years. Still cracks me up, but I'm not a gamer so if you need proof about Nvidia's pull on the gamers look no further.

Check out the facebook page - I am not sure why they would give a price range sub 100 if that wasn't the case. Again, unless I misread something that seems to be the price target. It's plausible that they can get the cost down to say about $80 and sell it at $100 with a total profit of about $15 (assuming retail market up of $5) this would be about the same nominal profit would be for a T4 chip. My guess at this point is they are targeting a much higher adoption than a few million.

Now we're back for part deux, starring Tegra and a healthy dose of Jelly Bean. While touring the company's suite, we found two prototypes: a 10-inch tablet with NVIDIA's new Tegra 4 chip and a mid-range 7-inch model designed to take on the lower end of the market. Starting with the 10-inch model, key specs (aside from Tegra 4) include a 2,560 x 1,600 display, 32GB of on-board memory, NFC and dual 5MP / 1.3MP cameras. The 7-incher, meanwhile, has 16 gigs of storage, and steps down to Tegra 3 and a 1,280 x 800 resolution. No NFC on that one. Both run Jelly Bean, though -- stock Jelly Bean, at that. Design-wise, both have a rubbery, soft-touch finish, similar to what you'll find on the Windows 8 tablet we saw earlier. As ever, it makes for a sturdier grip, though unlike on the Tablet PC there's no beveling on the sides where you can rest your thumbs. Both models have narrow speaker grilles on the back, except the 10-inch model has two, while the 7-incher has one. As with the Tablet PC, the display isn't IPS, per se, but it does have some unspecified wide-angle viewing technology. Indeed, we were able to follow along with a movie from off to the side and with the tablets lying face-up, but we did notice the colors seemed a little pale. Washed out. As for Tegra 4, we wish we could tell you more but alas, NVIDIA is still being awfully protective over its technology demos. So, while the folks staffing Vizio's booth let us watch a movie clip, we weren't permitted to select other media files or play any games. All in due time, we suppose. Suffice to say, the 1080p movie we watched ran smoothly, but that wasn't ever really a problem on Tegra 3, was it? In any case, we'll surely be showing you lots more of Tegra 4. As for this particular tablet? We're not sure. Vizio hasn't confirmed whether either of these tablets will come to market, though it says there's a good chance, particularly for the higher-end 10-inch model. Whatever happens, we've got hands-on photos below, along with a video walkthrough of both devices.</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1357609875013</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 20:51:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>16</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357609987349-188</Id><Topic><Title>here at CES TEGRA4 : Vizio Shows of Tegrs4 Tablet</Title><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1357609875013</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 20:51:15 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Two of the bigger stories from CES so far have been Vizio's Windows 8 tablet and Nvidia's Tegra 4 mobile processor. So it's only fitting that the two companies have combined on another piece of news in Vegas. Vizio is apparently showing off a new tablet that runs on the Tegra 4 chip at the trade show, one of two new Android-based prototypes the company is working on. The model powered by the forthcoming Nvidia processor is a 10-inch model that packs 2,560x1,600 resolution, 32GB of storage, and NFC capabilities while running the Jelly Bean flavor of Android. The other tablet is a 7-inch version that also runs Jelly Bean, but lacks the NFC functionality and uses an unspecified processor. Engadget got its hands on the new tablets, but was given an extremely limited demo that showed off almost none of the Tegra 4's technical tricks. And while not knowing any pricing or release date details might perturb some of us, Vizio is not saying anything more about the eventual availability of these slates. In its defense, the company is referring to these as prototypes, which means there's a chance they may not even hit the market. It will be worth watching as CES week unfolds to see if any other manufacturers will reveal plans for Tegra 4-based tablets or even show off their own prototypes. We'll keep you posted if they do.</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1357609987349</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 20:53:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>14</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357610242325-189</Id><Title>"Clunky" vs "Slick"...</Title><Msg>Nvidia proved to the planet that it is W-A-Y innovative beyond compare.

Nexus 10 (32GB) sells for $500 and that price is subsidized by Google (or at least no profit). Vizio tablet has much better specs and they will need to provide customer support (unlike N10) and some profit too. It's just best to leave it be for right now until we have more information. There is no use arguing price because, while we can speculate, there is no actual device in our hands that we can definitively look at to see what the component costs are. There is also no use arguing real world performance until we actually have the device on hand (however, I think it is very likely that the Tegra 4 beats out the Exynos 5250. I also would think it is likely that the Exynos 5450 will beat out the Tegra 4 when that chipset arrives). I think in the end we have to just leave it to personal tastes as to what product you buy. If you want a device that promises the newest Android OS as soon as it comes out as well as strong development support (for rooting and what not) then the Nexus 10 is your choice, but if you want the latest in graphics and processing power then the Vizio tablet is your choice.</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1357610309579</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 20:58:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357610367690-191</Id><Title>The Trend Setting Websites Say Epic Fail for The Shield</Title><Msg>You know the ones...The Verge, Engadget.

I couldn't be more pleased by what these guys say as they protect the standard stuff through conventional wisdom as they decend on CES with 30 reporters in tow. Look at that Ouya console $99 with over $9M in kickstarter funding. But it doesn't have all the goodies as the shield does. Any cost under $200 and this thing is a winner. At $100 forget about it...I'm in. Surely Comcast will have a gaming channel soon! Plus I've been dying to try cloud gaming with Nvidia Grid.

Copy and paste articles as much as will be allowed in a post to seem credible then shift focus of the information that is actually out there about the product they 'say' they are studying. It's been published AND confirmed by Nvidia that Shield will be out sometime in the 2Q THIS year, not in the second half of this year or later. And I expect several more products announced over the week that will be launched within the first half of this year. CES typically hosts companies that show their game plan for a full year in any case, but Nvidia has made it clear their OWN launch of a Tegra 4 design, ie Shield, will be coming sooner, not later, by the second quarter.</Msg><Username>roundhouse_c</Username><Timestamp>1357612809299</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 21:40:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357613208108-203</Id><Title>The market voted on that SHIELD junk, didn't it?</Title><Msg>Did the market say give me back 38 cents and shove the SHIELD junk sport? lol What do you think? imho</Msg><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1357613208108</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 21:46:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357613974246-204</Id><Topic><Title>(((AMD lands the new Wii, SP4 &amp; Xbox)))</Title><Username>keeperoftheq</Username><Timestamp>1357148663090</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-02 12:44:23 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I was short AMD.
