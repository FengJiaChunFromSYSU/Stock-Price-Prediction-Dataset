Since I've been trying to point out the good things so far. --Currently sounds like the Xbox one wont support Xbox 360 controllers. Most of the time you want a few controllers laying around for when friends are over and are not using them most of the time. If you want controllers for 4 people you usually need between $100- $150 for a set of controllers. It would help a lot if the old controllers worked for the new system as those extra controller. I can see most people picking up 2 already one for primary use and one for backup/friends use. Definitely a negative mark though for people already invested in the 360. Long term not a big issue. --Currently sound like Backwards compatibility is a no go. Not a complete guarantee but system doesn't support it natively. Long term not a big issue as well. Most people only care for the first year or two then there is a library that the system can fall back on.</Msg><Username>x1x4x1x13</Username><Timestamp>1369541236597</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-26 00:07:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369542729119-2</Id><Topic><Title>Wall Street didn't disguise its disappointment in Xbox One, either</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1369508694692</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-25 15:04:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good points. I think the lack of backward compatibility is a virtual certainty - including both xbox360 and the Slim. At best, the xboxOne will have a few months of glory during the holidays, but then Logan based devices will come around, and most of us have a good guess as to where the game developers will migrate to. True, many people don't care about the Android games, but this could change quickly.....yet consoles like xbox one and pS4 will become obsolete for most of their product lives (5,6,7 years?). The basic problem is the console -based business model is no longer valid. Time is NOT on their side.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1369542729119</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-26 00:32:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369547552539-3</Id><Topic><Title>Wall Street didn't disguise its disappointment in Xbox One, either</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1369508694692</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-25 15:04:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>More processing power doesn't necessarily mean better AI. It's all about how well it is coded. Just compare the behavior of monsters in TES4: Oblivion (endless mindless pursuit, natural enemies ignoring each other in favor of attacking player) vs Skyrim, where they will flee when badly wounded and fight each other. Both released on the 360. I'd say AI improvement is mostly separate from processing power, and there are lots of ways to get it wrong. So I wouldn't count that as a possible plus.</Msg><Username>torchie4269</Username><Timestamp>1369547552539</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-26 01:52:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369550432371-4</Id><Topic><Title>Wall Street didn't disguise its disappointment in Xbox One, either</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1369508694692</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-25 15:04:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Serious android gaming will happen. Its a matter of time. But I think we are a few more years away from critical mass. They have to prove that they can be a decent game system. And even after that It will take time for people to move away from their old game systems. I see them both doing well with this generation, with consoles loosing out over time. I'd say android will start taking over during this console cycle. Probably in about 2-5 years. and by then the consoles will have lower prices and a library of games on hand. With grid even a single good internet connection will make it possible for almost any device act as a receiver for gaming. Just hook up to a TV and controller and you have a very portable game console. This will make having a game console nearly obsolete unless you have an internet issue of some kind. And eventually phones will be powerful enough to act as a true full fledged game console on its own. without external processing. Current console based business will likely change. Microsoft seems to be parring up with cable providers. Maybe we will have ad supported consoles that are drastically cheaper. though I don't see Microsoft or gamers going along with ad support happily considering the amount of ads already for even gold subscribers. Maybe the whole system will be changed up in a way i cant think of. E3 should will answer many console questions and whether or not the console deserves a cheer or a yawn. PRICE will matter, WHAT IT CAN DO will matter and NOT ENRAGING THE GAMER BASE will matter.</Msg><Username>x1x4x1x13</Username><Timestamp>1369550432371</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-26 02:40:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369556817831-5</Id><Topic><Title>Wall Street didn't disguise its disappointment in Xbox One, either</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1369508694692</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-25 15:04:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Oblivion was an early game before they knew how to take full advantage of the hardware. Skyrim came out much later after they learned to optimized better for consoles. Coding is where the AI is. But a next gen system can process a more complicated AI and on more enemies. Even if they are a bit inefficient on the next generation. For example: Lets say early on you can do 50 tasks at a time for enemies. lets say you have 10 tasks per enemy and 5 enemies. So 5 enemies are doing their thing with their AI. Lets say end of consoles life span you still can only do 50 tasks at a time. but now resources are handled better elsewhere so you may have 5 tasks that now each take away a task from all the enemies workloads. Now for all the enemies you have 45 tasks for the remaining enemies. But now each enemy only takes 5 tasks each to run their AI. now what used to be 5 enemies can now be 9 doing the same thing. Or you can keep the same 5 enemies and have them do more by adding more tasks improving the AI. (you could also more efficiently use tasks by combining what used to be 10 tasks into 5 for each enemy from streamlining the code in which in this alternative case would allow for 10 enemies with the same AI) Now lets say next gen comes along and you suddenly have 200 tasks to spread around for enemies AI, suddenly you've got a whole lot more to work with. Sure you're probably back to not knowing how to take advantage of the system. so every enemy eats up 10 tasks again. But now you have 200 tasks to work with and can have 20 enemies with the same AI. or 10 that do far more than whatever they could do last gen. This is the general idea. This is one of those thing where theirs thousands of different ways to work with the code but It all relies on processing. Efficient code helps but you can only streamline for so long. A better processor is necessary at some point.</Msg><Username>x1x4x1x13</Username><Timestamp>1369556817831</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-26 04:26:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369568645055-6</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft Xbox One 'a let down,' says Steven Butts of IGN</Title><Username>torchie4269</Username><Timestamp>1369407529033</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-24 10:58:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Question.

WHINE all you want about the NEW Xbox One and the NEW PS4 Nvidia fans Tell us how disappointing they are BEFORE one NEW Game Console goes on sale. Tell us how Sony's amd Microsoft's Consoles won't sell BUT a condom sounding SHIELD Toy will. lmao Tell us Sony and Microsoft are clueless about what an 8 Core 64 CPU+ GCN GPU SoC can do but YOU know even though the world has never seen an 8 Core 64 Bit SoC. Tell us Nvidia was TOO BUSY to work for Game Console BILLIONS as they ready that SHIELD Toy because that's what Nvidia's Management told you right? lol Tell us Nvidia didn't want to sell Sony and Microsoft a 64 Bit CPU+GPU not because they don''t have one but its too much of a bother since they're so busy delaying Tegra 4 and playing with a SHIELD Toy. Tell us Nvidia did not want a steady stream fo REVENUE for the next several year, and Nvidia WANTED an estimated $9 BILLION to go into the compitions pocket. WHINE just like Nvidia's Management is doing and see if Sony or Microsoft or AMD cares as that Game Console Money rolls in.

This includes better AI, better graphics and other improvements. -Next gen: the code is messy again. but more processing power allows the code to be processed so much faster that inefficient code doesn't matter so much for the moment. It just cranks through the stuff and its better than last gen. The code affecting the behavior of AI includes every action they can perform and the process to determine that action. variables that need to be taken into consideration include their own location/movement in space, the location of other objects and characters in space, collision detection and more. The more characters and objects you have the more you multiply the amount of factors being processed by the system. So to sum up what I'm saying is AI can get really really complicated. AI is code and that code has to be processed. Processing power doesn't directly determine the AI since costs and time are factors just like any other part of the game but but better AI is more likely with more processing power at hand.</Msg><Username>x1x4x1x13</Username><Timestamp>1369585043219</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-26 12:17:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369588277098-9</Id><Topic><Title>Wall Street didn't disguise its disappointment in Xbox One, either</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1369508694692</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-25 15:04:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>x1x4x1x13, Thanks for the insights.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1369588277098</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-26 13:11:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
