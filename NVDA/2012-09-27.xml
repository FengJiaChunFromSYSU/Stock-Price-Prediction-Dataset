Sounds like a scratch, boys. "Qualcomm superb radios are usually not compatible with NVIDIA SoC chips." "Qualcomm made sure that such incompatibility exists to screw NVIDIA." .

Heck, Qualcomm derives income -- directly or indirectly -- from each and every wireless device on the planet. So if engineers demand Qualcomm radio parts -- they'll just have to buy their commodity ARM processor chips Elsewhere. Did I mention?

How can it possibly be worth the time and energy to do this? I wish this message board had actual substance. I'm long but would love to read well-reasoned bear theses, and try to debate them in a constructive way. Those debates might actually be beneficial to everyone involved and help make more informed/well-reasoned decisions.</Msg><Username>thetrade50</Username><Timestamp>1348796879884</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 21:47:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348803219222-43</Id><Topic><Title>GOING RED!

(sorry I don't see another way to post at a reply) Technicals make sense. I can see those looking lousy. I can see this selling off at the moment with fear of europe and large funds making bets around them. After all they don't want to be stuck in something volatile without a dividend when the stock market tanks. -But its this time of year when tech gets seasonal and sells better than normal for the holiday season. -Project Denver could be announced more officially any quarter now. Maybe even a working prototype as well. Even a little market share take away from Intel and amd would be big early on. -Nvidia is in all of the major tech growth businesses. Such as cloud and mobile. Texas Instruments even basically conceded mobile to Nvidia and Qualcom. -Nvidia is supply constrained but as yields improve, their profits do as well. -Nvidia has tons of cash/cash equivalents. They will weather just about any storm. So ya I can see the big guys bailing (making technicals look bad) but I have too many reasons to be positive on this company. Unfortunately they do have the selling power to drag the stock price down.</Msg><Username>x1x4x1x13</Username><Timestamp>1348803219222</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 23:33:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
