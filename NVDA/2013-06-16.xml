Intel is DISPLACING Nvidia in more and more GPU sockets thatnks to help from Nvidia. Intel is using licensed Nvidia IP to kick Nvidia out of more thin and light notebook designs where a single combined CPU+GPU saves power. 2. Nvidia aware that the APU would eventually erode GPU share looked to Tegra for revenue growth. Qualcomm is shutting Tegra down and DISPLACING Tegra at Google and, as has been reported, will soon replace Tegra in the NEW Microsoft Surface RT. That Nexus business accounted 60% of Tegra revenue according to Digitimes. Tegra 4 is DOA and Nvidia licensed IP to Intel is kicking Nvidia's out of notebooks. Nvidia bet on Tegra for future growth and then along came Qualcomm. In the far corner we have the heavy weight Qualcomm weighing in at $106 BILLION In the near corner we have the heavy weight Intel weighing in at $123 BILLION and squeezed in the middle we have Nvidia weighing in at $8 BIILLION and trying to take them both on. lol You know how this fight will end don't you Nvidia fans?

The tech press has been speculating since the consoles’ specs were first announced as to how the PC could benefit from Sony and Microsoft opting for the x86, and specifically AMD, architecture. After all the Xbox 360 was running AMD graphics hardware and, from my perspective, the benefits to the PC from that relationship are pretty intangible at best. There are signs that things may be different this time around. “The consoles are really the target for a lot of the game developers, if it’s a Radeon heart powering that console, like the PS4 or Xbox 360, that means these games devs are going to be designing their games, designing their features and really optimising for that Radeon heart” said AMD’s Devon Nekechuk around the launch of the Radeon HD 7990. But why, specifically, will that be the case? I asked AMD’s worldwide manager of ISV gaming engineering, Nicolas Thibieroz for the nitty gritty. “We paid a lot of attention to the DirectCompute processing capabilities in the GCN architecture because we know that this can enable all kinds of features, from physics simulations to advanced lighting schemes. Now those capabilities are going to be the baseline development platform for a lot more developers and we know that this is an area developers will explore more and more.” That’s potentially good news for the minority of gamers running GCN-based graphics cards in their PC, but what about the larger percentage of folk running Nvidia-based GPUs? The Kepler generation spent much of its silicon focusing on traditional rendering power, eschewing the compute-focus they had with the Fermi architecture. In terms of DirectCompute power then the GCN cards are a good bit quicker. Given that devs are likely to be looking at the GPU in the next-gen consoles for more general purpose computing, " source: pcgamer</Msg><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1371391493787</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-16 10:04:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371399015369-13</Id><Topic><Title>ZTE U988S With 1.8GHz Tegra 4i Processor and Android 4.2.2 Gets Benchmarked</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1371366827881</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-16 03:13:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>1. 5.7", that's not a phone, that's a phablet.

Nvidia has no class, unlike IBM whose CPUs also didn't make it into the NEW Xbox One or the PS4 hasn't said a word to denigrate the Xbox One, the PS4, Microsoft or Sony. Nvidia lies, they claimed Game Console vendors weren't offering enough to make it worth their while right? Worth their while for what? Nvidia does not have a 64 bit CPU, even the old consoles are 64 bit. And how would they know what was offered if they didn't try to sell them something first. Nvidia can not claim they don't want that business after being rejected and Nvidia was rejected regardless how they try to spin that rejection. Nvidia is not in the Xbox One, PS4, NEW MacBook Air, NEW Mac Pro Desktop and the Next Nexus 7 because Microsoft, Sony, Apple and Google didn't want Nvidia in those products NOT because of some BS Nvidiia claims.
