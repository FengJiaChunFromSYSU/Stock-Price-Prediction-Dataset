Even Pre-Orders for ACCESSORIES for the yet released PS4 and Xbox One are OUT SELLING Ouya. Ouya is headed for an early eBay grave, on its tomb stone you'll find the words "USED ONCE". Ouya is DONE.

We don't know how Pre-Orders went before that Embarrassing Almost Launch but Nvidia did. We don't know what parts are broken on SHIELD but the real mechanical problem with SHIELD is that it was ever assembled in the first place. lol SHIELD is going to DIE if Nvidia ever gets around to shipping one.

Spoiler alert: yes for $460 less. I don't see this as a bad thing. The bottom line is more enthusiasts will enjoy NVDA graphics now that you can get world-dominating performance at a much lower price point. NVDA leapfrogging itself cemets performance leadership as ATI/AMD just doesn't have the juice this generation (or maybe ever going forward the way things are going).

How is LESS money dropping down to the REAL BOTTOM LINE for Nvidia NOT a bad thing? lmao Carry on you're doing just fine bashing Nvidia without any help. imho</Msg><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1373218751036</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-07 13:39:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373218904003-7</Id><Topic><Title>Brit server maker Avantek puts its back into ARM servers</Title><Username>whosunw</Username><Timestamp>1373168021443</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-06 23:33:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"no wonder nvda/PD gave up on ARM server" you know NVidia will target servers...
