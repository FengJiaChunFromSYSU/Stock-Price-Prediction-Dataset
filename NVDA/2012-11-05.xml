Creating an unfounded rumor about a dividend announcement might do the trick, since it could theoretically create an expectation that is highly unlikely to be met. But the idea that a dividend announcement might be imminent shouldn't shouldn't make much sense to anyone that's been following the company. The last word on the company's plans for the cash position was just that they plan to make it a lot bigger. See the Q2 transcripts, available on seeking alpha. In the current phase of heavy investment, a dividend wouldn't make much sense, and I don't think any serious longs are expecting one. Making use of some of the cash to buyback some shares seems *slightly* more likely, since it would add leverage to the future earnings growth without creating an ongoing cash commitment (dividends are hard to take away) -- but such a move still seems highly unlikely based on the company's recent commentary... and the fact that the board has already has authorized and extended a buyback program through May 2013 (originating back in 2004!). See nvidiaDOTcom/object/io_1268820951326.html Committing a big chunk of cash now to a dividend (or even a buyback) would be like David pawning his slingshot in preparation for his battle with Goliath.</Msg><Username>thetrade50</Username><Timestamp>1352140998073</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-05 13:43:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352141310611-27</Id><Topic><Title>Jeepers Best, A Rally?</Title><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1352129124583</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-05 10:25:24 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Too bad you aren't in a quiet period!</Msg><Username>chitownbarber22</Username><Timestamp>1352141310611</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-05 13:48:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>14</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352141355184-28</Id><Topic><Title>sold 30%</Title><Username>daysofshred300000000000000000000</Username><Timestamp>1304106681000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2011-04-29 15:51:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm out/ no, not out oof my flemish shed. in here I remain until they let me out; But,, i'm out of nvda.
