Better is up for debate. I'm not defending anyone here, but I don't think you understand this company as well as many others here. Many of the brightest simply lurk and do not regularly post. Kivmax is an example, schmenkle too. I would not group you into the set of the sharpest pencils in the drawer, you are simply a pencil looking for an opportunity. Then you will be gone. Trader. That would be a more apt description. You may see an opportunity, but truthfully your timing hasn't been great. Opportunist would also work. Investing. That is where the play with NVDA is. Ibexx fits better into that description than you do. Investor.

Jen and Nvidia, do u get paid for winning designs or big actual productions?!!! Like I said, F Jensen &amp; Co. This company forever looks promising. Never actually promising. What happen to those rants about great Kai phones. Idea is great, but then dead again. Just like project Denver etc. Nvidia company profile should read: We are a company that loves and thrives on projects. We design projects. Introduce projects. But we dun deliver projects. Eh.... Deliver? What's the meaning of that huh?</Msg><Username>chrisssable</Username><Timestamp>1366766983646</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-23 21:29:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366769159173-38</Id><Topic><Title>Many people I know simply do not trust the market</Title><Username>dyk742000</Username><Timestamp>1366749228236</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-23 16:33:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>USA has a system of bribes for representatives, it is called "campaign contributions".

This would've been the entire tax-free cash flow for FY2012. Apple will issue debt to partially finance this. S&amp;P already assigns AA+ rating. --Tim Cook said, "Our growth has slowed." --Iphone channel inventory has increased from 1 million to 11 millions; ipad inventory increased from 1.4 millions to 4.8 millions. Relatively stagnant by historical Apple standard. --In FYQ2, more ipad mini were sold than new ipad, thus margins were negatively impacted, In the case of iPhone, as many old models were sold as iphone 5. --China market not taking off --Last, but not the least important: TC indicated that new Apple products will be introduced in the fall and into the holiday season. Major investors/analysts had hope that there would be summer refreshes of iphone and/or ipads, but NOPE. Apple will likely be in a trading range for the next 5-6 months, during which the market may register new lows for AAPL.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1366769314120</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-23 22:08:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366771390422-40</Id><Title>More share dilution in the proxy</Title><Msg>Enjoy while you can!

Tegra is best right? Then why did HTC ran away from tegra? After the first HTC one X, they ran far away. No new HTC phones run on tegra. New HTC one, Butterfly etc. U know why? I am using the tegra HTC one X. Just surfing net and typing on the message board can make phone heat up. When it gets hot, things slow down, cant even type properly as things slow down. Nvidia tried to be smart. You know marketing 101? Product differentiation? Only problem is Nvidia went too far. They design product that is beyond human race. Humans dun want. They designed them for aliens! Bloody Nvidia.</Msg><Username>chrisssable</Username><Timestamp>1366773123616</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-23 23:12:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
