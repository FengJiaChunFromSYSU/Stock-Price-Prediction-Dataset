From way back if I am correct you are a AMD shareholder and should know the information requested. Nvidia has stated that the opportunity costs on the console deals was not attractive to them vs. expected ROI on other businesses in the works. I share your statement that they could not have made an X86 CPU to go with their GPU but perhaps they referring to some other combination...ViA...IBM etc. But put that aside for one moment.AMD has these consoles deals and the volume could be large. AMD's CEO stated that by the 4Q of 2013 "more than 20% of AMD's revenue would be from semi-custom chips. Current analyst revenue projects are for total AMD revenue of slightly over $4B per year. So say 20% is $200M/quarter. Getanid pointed out a few days ago that AMD's semi-custom and embedded annual revenue in 2012 was $271M so using $200M a quarter as the revenue basis for these console deals seems like a fair approximation....i.e. "more than 20%." So now all we need to know is: 1) Is this a deal in which AMD manufactures the chips through their fab foundry partners or 2) Is this a license deal like Nvidia's PS3 deal was? Note: Qty of expected sales for the consoles can be obtained from the tech press I guess. If someone as knowledgeable as you obviously are would post that information then one can determine if Nvidia was correct in passing up the deal. I eagerly look forward to your response to the question on hand. Others please chime in if they have any knowledge on this matter.

Just so people won't thing we are losing 'focus' - those transferred will still be working on Tegras, just the TEgra GPU side and under GPU books. For doing such a great job of controlling Tegras loses, the board has given myself and top management another $10M shares stock grants. This concludes our financial presentation and I am sure you are as pleased about the financial progress of Tegras and I am. Guys, after 5 years of 'technolody', predictions, promises, and huge loses. The only thing left that's real is money.</Msg><Username>whosunw</Username><Timestamp>1363552036543</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-17 16:27:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363552431452-32</Id><Title>Finally - Some Cost Data On Cloud Gaming - Nvidia Grid</Title><Msg>"Relan believes that we have arrived at the "inflection point" for cloud gaming. The next two years will herald the emergence of a similar platform to the compute cloud, but based on high-performance GPUs. And, as is often the case with impassioned executives, he has a dog in the fight: Agawi True Cloud, which will offer content creators a choice of server architectures built on Nvidia's Kepler GPUs. With a minimum performance target of 720p resolution at 30 fps with less than 100 milliseconds latency, Agawi True Cloud will cost 39 cents per user hour, per stream. With the release of Nvidia's Maxwell processors in 2014, the price should drop below 20 cents.

Super hardcore PC gamer.....They probably will buy the game on Steam or a physical disk. Xbox, and PS4 user.....some will upgrade I would think....especially heavy users, but some might just click on their TV and pay for gaming as they go. Parents of kids might just add the Gaming Channel on their Cable service. Certainly tiered pricing will be available.

Three factions are fighting for control in a battle that will host thousands of troops and their vehicles. Battles can last for days or weeks across huge continents. Congratulations soldier, you turned back an invading force and secured the base. How long can you hold it? At the heart of the game is Sony’s proprietary ForgeLight game engine. It springs from a partnership between NVIDIA and Sony using the PhysX platform. According to Sony, ForgeLight will do away with the use of zones and loading screens in MMOs. It will allow for massive worlds and atmospheric effects as detailed as sunlight filtering through clouds. Movable and player objects will cast shadows will react realistically, possibly lending a battlefield advantage. ForgeLight promises more realistic facial animations on both player and NPC characters. Sony’s using ForgeLight on both Planetside 2 and Everquest Next. It pays to be nice! and smart.</Msg><Username>nvdarocks</Username><Timestamp>1363567677455</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-17 20:47:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363568263237-40</Id><Topic><Title>A conversation with OUYA ceo J.

Besides it's just a phone although it will help pay the bills in the Tegra Processor division. I like investments in potentially disruptive technologies such as Cloud Gaming. Smartphones are so last year. Maybe cheap smartphones have another couple of years to run. A little history....Once upon a time before PC's, minicomputers sent data and images to thin clients called CRT terminals from the company data center. Is not cloud computing, cloud storage, GPU virtualization using Nvidia VGX, along with Cloud Gaming with Nvidia Grid exactly the same thing.
