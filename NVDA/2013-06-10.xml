I had to buy a new phone recently and ended up getting the HTC One because it 'currently' is the best high-end smartphone out there now IMO. I wanted to wait until some of the T4i phones came out but my old phone really just couldn't last (though it really did take a beating from me and used Tegra 2 believe it or not). I hope to be getting one of the new laptops or combo units (tablet and keyboard) with Tegra 4(5?) at some point. If you were looking in the market right now for a smartphone, the word on the street favors something like the HTC One (for now) which hurts both the market for iPhones and Samsung 3 and 4. So Qualcomm ultimately loses overall on what they project in their outlook, but can claim a victory in one very well designed phone. BTW, I think HTC One would be a hit whether it has Tegra 4/4i or Snapdragon chipsets. It's the overall design of the phone that sells it, much like the way iPhone has in the past with their first entries and design. I think the real news for Nvidia is in the gaming ecosystem and similar ecosystems in cars and anywhere else they can envision the use of their mobile and high-end graphics know how. Catching larger volume with growing margin is where they well be hitting Qualcomm hard, ie sub-$200 phones, cloud systems in design and gaming, cars and other transit systems and so on. It's going to be fun for Nvidia investors . .</Msg><Username>roundhouse_c</Username><Timestamp>1370841482969</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-10 01:18:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370843457905-5</Id><Topic><Title>OMG, the flagship handset of QCOM's 3rd major customer, HTC One, is also in trouble.....</Title><Username>moorelawyer</Username><Timestamp>1370837612169</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-10 00:13:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The fact is that HTC has trimmed Q3 orders for One. This apparently caught the locals/suppliers in surprise too, as they had expected a pent-up situation in Q2 would have generated an robust increase in orders. With all due respect, I think it is safe to assume that HTC knows the demand situation better than you or me, or anyone in the user's camp. Don't forget, also, the smart phone market is a bit like real estate, showing unique sales profile depending on localities. Overall, on a global basis, HTC isn't so optimistic about their ONE, thus trimming the orders for Q3.</Msg><Username>moorelawyer</Username><Timestamp>1370843457905</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-10 01:50:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370843991840-6</Id><Topic><Title>OMG, the flagship handset of QCOM's 3rd major customer, HTC One, is also in trouble.....</Title><Username>moorelawyer</Username><Timestamp>1370837612169</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-10 00:13:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think this is only true if the market for high-end smartphones is fading across the board (and Nvidia would realize that too). I don't think the news you are picking up really says much and it will be more evident at the end of the year what is really happening overall. My main point was the HTC One may actually hurt Qualcomm's bottomline more then it helps because of what I think it could be doing to the latest iPhone sales and the latest Samsung (3 &amp; 4) sales. Especially if the overall high-end is diminishing at least for the smartphones, not necessarily the tablets.</Msg><Username>roundhouse_c</Username><Timestamp>1370843991840</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-10 01:59:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370844502382-7</Id><Topic><Title>OMG, the flagship handset of QCOM's 3rd major customer, HTC One, is also in trouble.....</Title><Username>moorelawyer</Username><Timestamp>1370837612169</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-10 00:13:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You need to spend the time and get Google translation for the entire article (which I did).

It came on all of a sudden, without a big flashing number or display. It hung in the air just the same. The Xbox One will retail at $499 when it releases in November, and that could prove a very dangerous price for Microsoft’s new console. That number is so dangerous to Microsoft because it won’t play with casuals, especially not in year one. It is a price aimed directly at the core gaming community. Hardcore gamers are the only people who spend that much money on new consoles — they’re the ones who need to experience the biggest, newest games, no matter what the cost, and they’re the ones who can prop up a system until it grabs a large enough install base. But they’re also the people who have been most vocal about their displeasure with Microsoft Xbox One’s used games policies. To say that the Xbox One is unpopular in the forum communities right now would be an understatement. At a lower price, Microsoft might have been able to focus on the casual consumer, interested in fantasy football and TV integration, but less concerned about DRM and the philosophical implications of always-online. That’s where it seemed the company was heading — building a console for a broad audience that would finally take the games system from a niche piece of hardware to a ubiquitous part of the home entertainment system. With a lower price, or a subscription price, that could have been possible. Last week, analyst Michael Pachter predicted the machine would cost $399 based on the shelf price of the parts, and even that seemed a little pricey — I assumed that Microsoft would be taking the hit in order to tap a broader market and find its way into more people’s homes. Sony ‘s PS3 launched at $599, now widely regarded as a colossal mistake.... SOURCE: Forbes just in At $499, this still feels niche.

Back during CES 2013 the company unveiled a series of peripherals that would be compatible with most platforms including mobile for mobile gamers. Mad Catz has now announced a partnership with Nvidia revolving around their GameSmart Technology and any product that uses that technology will be compatible with Nvidia Tegra-based devices. The compatibility will be built right into the GameSmart products so there won't be any need for any sort of real set-up aside from tweaking your peripheral's settings to how you want them. The entire line of products that feature GameSmart technology will be compatible with Tegra devices. This includes the R.A.T.M. mouse, F.R.E.Q.M headset, M.O.U.S.9 wireless mouse and the C.T.R.L.R wireless gamepad, all of which can already connect through Bluetooth already. Also in the flurry of Mad Catz announcements for E3 2013 was the mentioning of Project M.O.J.O. which is an Android-powered micro-console. This console will also be seamlessly compatible with any GameSmart product as well. Unfortunately the company doesn't go into detail when it comes to Project M.O.J.O. including what hardware will be coming with it, how big it actually is or any other features. We will have to wait until E3 2013 begins before we get further details on this product.

The Xbox One will cost $499, 499 Euros and 429 British Pounds when it launches in November. That price includes a controller, the new version of Kinect. The console itself comes with 500 GB of storage and a Blu-ray player. Players who pre-order the Xbox One from major retailers will recieve bonus content for Ryse: Son of Rome, Forza Motorsport 5, Kinect Sports Rivals and Dead Rising 3. They’ll also get a commemorative Day One achievement on their Xbox Live accounts, and a special controller with the words “Day One” on it."
