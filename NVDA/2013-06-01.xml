Anyway, I love how obsessed you are with me, and I've enjoyed the love that you're sending my way, especially since I've been gone from the boards for quite some time, but I'm going to have to put you on ignore now for being a rather sad troll.

If there is full disclosure about their investments pertaining to the article, I think sometimes the best writing comes from someone that has invested time AND money into the company they are discussing. That said, someone without any vested interest can be a little tougher in his criticism to be sure, but I've read some of the SA bloggers who claim to never have any interest or plan to buy any of the stocks they are discussing and they seem to have a more cavalier attitude to writing what is actually true about a company. In other words, they have nothing to lose or gain so they basically write to get a reaction and probably make money or get some other benefit for an increased volume in the comments they generate.</Msg><Username>roundhouse_c</Username><Timestamp>1370067378072</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-01 02:16:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370084248809-3</Id><Title>Samsung’s processor chaos affects Mobile divisions processor choice</Title><Msg>sammobileDOTcom/2013/05/30/samsung-processor-chaos-disappointments-and-their-current-soc-future</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1370084248809</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-01 06:57:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370086816155-4</Id><Topic><Title>Samsung’s processor chaos affects Mobile divisions processor choice</Title><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1370084248809</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-01 06:57:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"BIG.little is an abomination"</Msg><Username>whosunw</Username><Timestamp>1370086816155</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-01 07:40:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370094851228-5</Id><Topic><Title>Full disclosure by Tiernan Ray, Barron's principal tech columnist</Title><Username>moorelawyer</Username><Timestamp>1370055380362</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-31 22:56:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"troll"?? hardly. as I said before, ibey has a unique contribution here: he offers a window into what is happening inside nvda. Right now, Tegra is totally cooked and Jen knows it. But instead of blaming himself for making bad decisions, Jen is on a war path, going after friends and foes alike. And anybody who is not a full brown noser singing "all hail the chairman" from the roof tops is foe. "how do you model the Tegras?" with Nexus 7 refresh out, I model it as fighting to stay above $100M/Q the rest of the year. And that is counting in the very successful 'cheap' Icera radios. In fact, I expect Icera to carry over half of Tegra sales. T4 is totally dead - Transformer, Toshiba, totally toothless wonders, ibey can go ahead count the number of design wins that won't count for naught. We've all been there before. Tegra sales won't lift until T3i phones come out next year. T4 is dead.... so follow the chairman, all hail Logan 'next year'</Msg><Username>whosunw</Username><Timestamp>1370094851228</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-01 09:54:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370096214788-6</Id><Topic><Title>Full disclosure by Tiernan Ray, Barron's principal tech columnist</Title><Username>moorelawyer</Username><Timestamp>1370055380362</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-31 22:56:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So are you saying Jen lied to investors that Tega sales will be flat this fiscal year?</Msg><Username>indycohiba69</Username><Timestamp>1370096214788</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-01 10:16:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370099418373-7</Id><Title>Here comes Intel..</Title><Msg>Thu May 30, 2013 6:15pm EDT.
