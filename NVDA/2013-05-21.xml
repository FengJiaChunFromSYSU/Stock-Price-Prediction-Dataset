NVIDIA shows off Tegra 4i with 4G/ LTE-Advanced (150 Mbps, Cat 4) at CTIA</Title><Msg>You might be asking yourself what Cat 4 LTE-Advanced is, and you should be. Most current LTE networks run up to 100 Mbps (theoretical) 4G LTE data speeds thanks to Cat 3, and the future will bring Cat 4 and beyond as we get into the next generation of LTE, also known as 5G. Today NVIDIA is showing off their Tegra 4i running stable as it churns through 150 Mbps data speeds and Cat 4 with ease, all thanks to software updates. When we say software updates, that’s because NVIDIA showed off Cat 3 and 100 Mbps tests at Mobile World Congress back in February when they announced the Tegra 4i. One of the important aspects of the testing they’re doing here in Vegas is the fact that the same exact silicon, the same Tegra 4i chip, is now handling Cat 4 150 Mbps speeds with no hardware changes. Everything was done on a software level. Which is showcasing NVIDIA’s adaptable software-defined radio technology. The demo was shown off running on the NVIDIA Phoenix, which is their Tegra 4i reference phone. Then it’s also being done on a test machine emulating Cat 4 LTE, since live and current local 4G LTE doesn’t exist on Cat 4. In these demos NVIDIA is showing off a few things. One being their ability to keep up with the times and rapid changing network technology using their software-defined radios, as well as showcasing how far their 4G LTE Icera modem has came in such a short amount of time. The Tegra 4i 4G LTE modem is 40% smaller than conventional 4G LTE modems currently being used in smartphones, and is extremely efficient. Add in the adaptability and efficiency of that to their Tegra 4 quad-core 4-PLUS-1 mobile processor, and you have a full package. Sadly we still won’t be seeing Tegra 4i powered LTE devices til late 2013 or early 2014. More details are available from their official blog post linked to below.

The hardware is identical to the part shown off back at Mobile World Congress, but because it features a "software-defined modem," Nvidia simply applied an update to the chip's integrated modem circuitry to bring it up to spec with LTE-Advanced. The company says that another update that it's currently working on will make the 4i compatible with voice over LTE (VoLTE), the long-awaited replacement for old-fashioned circuit switched calling that many carriers — Verizon and AT&amp;T included — will end up using."" thevergeDOTcom/2013/5/21/4350772/nvidias-newest-tegra-chip-is-ready-for-faster-lte-advanced-networks</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1369146627360</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 10:30:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369150575878-3</Id><Title>World's most efficient Cat 4 LTE-Advanced Modem by NVIDIA (wow, the tech press is all over this....)</Title><Msg>SOURCE: The Standard "" At CTIA 2013 in Las Vegas this week, Nvidia demoed the Tegra 4i, a mobile processor for mainstream smartphones. The 4i includes an integrated NVIDIA i500 LTE modem, which blew through 150Mbps of LTE data in a demo during the event. The amazing thing about the Tegra 4i demo is that it is fully based on a software update – no new hardware, no new processor. That’s incredibly impressive, showing off the adaptability and flexibility of NVIDIA’s software-defined radio technology. The i500 LTE modem and NVIDIA Tegra® 4i’s processor (which uses an integrated i500 modem) use a revolutionary new software defined radio technology that supports the latest wireless protocols such as DC-HSPA+ and LTE, and also has the flexibility of being fully programmable to support next generation interfaces and standards. The NVIDIA i500 has a smaller die size, consumes lower power and offers greater implementation flexibility compared to competing LTE modems. Unlike conventional modems, the software reconfigurability of the i500 soft-modem makes it easy for carriers and OEMs to update modem features and to take advantage of performance-improving algorithmic innovations in the field through over-the-air updates. Because of its size (40% of a conventional LTE modem), it brings high performance with great adaptability and many modes. Not only is it 4G LTE Advanced, but the modem also supports LTE Cat 3, 3G, and 2G, working perfectly where LTE is not available. Nvidia is leading the charge when it comes to mobile processor technology, showing off great progress in Tegra 4i modem stability and performance. theslantedDOTcom/2013/05/5300/worlds-most-efficient-cat-4-lte-advanced-modem-by-nvidia/#sthash.9iYl8mnM.dpuf</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1369150575878</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 11:36:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369152506280-4</Id><Topic><Title>Good news!
