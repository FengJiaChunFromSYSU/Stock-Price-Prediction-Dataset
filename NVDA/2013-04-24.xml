The British chip designer, which runs rings around Intel when it comes to processors used in smartphones and tablets, said first-quarter earnings rose a better-than-expected 39% to £51.9 million ($79.4 million). The shares gained another 12% Tuesday and have now risen more than 70% over the past 12 months. But ARM may be just starting to flex new muscles. ARM already dominates the chip market for fast-growing mobile devices; its processor designs are found in 95% of smartphones. But there should be plenty of growth to come: While developed markets are maturing, many consumers in emerging countries are just now buying their first smartphones. Meanwhile, ARM is benefiting from the shift from PCs to tablets. As well as its large share of the tablet market for processors, its graphics technology Mali has a 60% share of the market for devices using Google's GOOG Android. ARM expects its customers to ship 250 million Mali chips in 2013, 60% more than last year. But can ARM continue to grow its share of more markets? That seems increasingly plausible. ARM's royalties typically grow 15% to 20% faster than its underlying markets. Currently, it is growing most quickly in areas like digital TVs, where there are fewer entrenched competitors. Its order backlog rose 5% in the first quarter compared with the fourth, which bodes well for licensing. Sure, there is the lingering threat of Intel becoming a more credible competitor to ARM; its Bay Trail processor, which starts production this year, looks like a closer match to ARM designs in tablets. Conversely, there is no guarantee ARM will over time be able to take a chunk of Intel customers in the server market. Even if it does, it will take years, as developers build out a whole new ecosystem. The shares trade at 46 times forecast 2013 earnings, well above their historic 30 times average, based on UBS UBSN.VX +1.05% estimates SOURCE: WSJ</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1366821521439</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 12:38:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366822686294-17</Id><Topic><Title>Nvda Higher?

You had some great initial traction with your dual core 3G baseband platform, obviously initially with Samsung, the S II Plus, the Galaxy Grand. I think there are another three or four new smartphones including some of the models like the Ace 3 and the Galaxy Pocket follow-ons that are targeted to ramp during Q2. So, I guess the question is how is your pipeline in the second half shaping up for your dual core and single core platforms in terms of new smartphone ramps? Again in other words, do you expect your 3G platforms to continue to drive growth through the second half of this year? Scott A. McGregor – President and CEO: One of the drivers certainly for the first quarter was the dual core basebands. As you pointed out there is a pipeline of new designs, some already announced and some not yet announced that we think will continue the momentum through the course of this year and we do expect our baseband business to grow because of that. Yes ladies and gents, that's what it takes to develop a good mobile strategy - lots and lots of 'cheap' radios that nvda does not have.

Revenue in the three months ended in March rose 24%, year over year, to $6.12 billion, yielding EPS of $1.17, excluding some costs. Analysts had been modeling $6.08 billion and $1.17. For the current quarter, Qualcomm sees revenue in a range of $5.8 billion to $6.3 billion, and EPS of 97 cents to $1.05, which is above consensus for revenue of $5.87 billion, but below the average $1.04 EPS view. For the full year, Qualcomm sees revenue of $24 billion to $25 billion, higher than its prior $23.4 billion to $24.4 billion outlook, and above the $24.1 billion the Street has been modeling. Qualcomm shares are down $3.38, or 5%, at $62.62 in late trading.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1366834680833</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 16:18:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366835397809-38</Id><Title>CNET: Could Qualcomm's streak be slowing?

And I'm not denying there is strong possibility it's 'lost' for this round (due to timing, not battery life), but the rumors are still very mixed about Nexus 7 (and all the other Google products btw). Nothing is confirmed at all yet. Though I doubt this, the Facebook phone could have been what Jen was hinting at . . we'll see. Jen also made it very clear that Tegra 4 had more design wins then Tegra 3 and that we hadn't seen most of these wins yet. That hasn't changed, nor the expected timing for those wins towards the end of this year. No matter what is happening with the Nexus 7.7, Nvidia is doing far better then the bashers and perma-bears would have you believe.</Msg><Username>roundhouse_c</Username><Timestamp>1366837434328</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 17:03:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366851481706-43</Id><Title>Forbes on Qualcomm earnings: 3G sales estimates for North America continue to deteriorate</Title><Msg>Qualcomm QCOM +1.13% met the earnings estimates and beat the revenue estimates for its March quarter – but its projections for 3G and 4G device shipments continue shifting in fascinating ways. Qualcomm now estimates that North American 3G/4G device sales actually declined in 2012, slipping to 199 Million units in 2012 from 200 Million units in 2011. Qualcomm is also revising its year 2013 North American device sales downwards; to 215 Million from 220 Million it previously expected. This is a pretty remarkable development. It implies that despite the widening availability of LTE-equipped smartphones and tablets, the North American demand remains remarkably tepid. This could well have something to do with Apple AAPL -0.2%‘s growth problems in its home market; Apple’s growth in Americas slipped below 10% in the most recent quarter. One reason for disappointing North American 3G/4G device volumes is the US consumer preference for WiFi-only tablets. The mobile industry once dreamed about consumers flocking to tablets with LTE support. That has not happened yet. What this means for the smartphone industry is that Asia’s role in the handset market continues growing strongly – at the expense of North America. Qualcomm revised the China/India device volume estimate for 2013 notably, up 13 Million to 256 Million units. As recently as in 2011, North American market was still clearly bigger than China/India, by 200 Million vs. 165 Million units. But now Qualcomm is projecting that in 2013, China/India 3G device shipments will outpace North America by a huge margin; 256 Million vs. 215 Million units..... forbesDOTcom/sites/terokuittinen/2013/04/24/qualcomm-3g-device-sales-estimates-for-north-america-continue-to-deteriorate/</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1366851481706</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 20:58:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366854071660-44</Id><Title>Tegra could be taking marketshare from QCOM.

"Indeed, this is another quarter of little overall growth in revenues and profits dating back to mid-2007." Berger added that the company is "clearly being negatively impacted ... chipset share losses to Mediatek and Broadcom (US:BRCM), chipset pricing pressure due to intense competition, device pricing pressure as smartphones get cheaper (impacts royalty business), still falling royalty rates, and excessive operating expense spending." Brigantine Advisors analyst Allan Mishan also noted that, "for the fourth quarter in a row, Qualcomm provided quarterly guidance that points to a sequential revenue decline." On the other hand, Charter Equity analyst Edward Snyder offered a more upbeat view, saying in a note, "We believe that skepticism about Qualcomm's prospects is kicking in at exactly the wrong time." Among the reasons he cited was the "market wide shift towards 3G which we think will lead to a sharply improving outlook once the company reaches the trough for declining chip [average selling prices] and margins in the upcoming period." Late Wednesday, Qualcomm reported a fiscal second-quarter profit of $774 million, or 46 cents a share, compared with a loss of $289 million, or 18 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Revenue rose to $2.7 billion from $2.45 billion. Adjusted earnings were 59 cents a share, after taking out one-time events. Analysts had expected Qualcomm to earn 57 cents a share, on revenue of $2.6 billion, according to a consensus survey by Thomson Reuters. Chief Executive Paul Jacobs attributed the company's results to "healthy 3G device shipments and greater than expected demand for our chipsets." However, Jacobs also noted the company continues "to operate in a competitive chipset pricing environment."
