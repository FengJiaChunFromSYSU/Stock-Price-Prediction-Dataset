So Best? If Intel's new Xeon Phi (Knight's Bridge) co-processor gets 9% more MFLOPS/Watt than the aging, energy wasting nvidia Tesla, why on Earth would any supercomputer builder use the nvidia Tesla? Times tens of thousands of chips -- why -- that's a fortune wasted on electricity. Needlessly. I think future supercomputers will use Intel's Xeon Phi co-processor chips instead. Heck, maybe they'll retro-fit the old ones too. For a 9% savings in electricity. Probably pays for the new energy-efficient Intel chips in no time at all, right? . .</Msg><Username>ask.best</Username><Timestamp>1346733893130</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 00:44:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>19</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346736564925-2</Id><Topic><Title>Intel opens up about its "Knight's Corner" parallel superputing coprocessor</Title><Username>moorelawyer</Username><Timestamp>1346728651514</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 23:17:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>9% percent better MFlops/Watt... compared to Fermi</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1346736564925</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 01:29:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346737172468-3</Id><Topic><Title>Nexus 7 with 3G reportedly to arrive in six weeks</Title><Username>ibexx88</Username><Timestamp>1346675414875</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 08:30:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Because Asus keeps using Nvidia - Asus is now the largest Tablet manufacturer after Apple.

If it was a Fermi chip it would be called GeForce GTX___. And what idiot would put a Locked double precision floating point chip in a supercomputer anyway? . The new Intel Xeon Phi (Knight's Corner) co-processor handily beats nvidia's best Tesla 2090 chip by a whopping 9% more MFLOPS/Watt.

Since then, it has consistently set new standards in visual computing with breathtaking, interactive graphics available on devices ranging from tablets and mobile phones to notebooks and workstations. NVIDIA's expertise in programmable GPUs has led to breakthroughs in parallel processing which make . supercomputing inexpensive and widely accessible. DENVER in 2014 as a long range goal/ . Momentum has accelerated With media tablet sales to end users believed to reach 110 million units this year and cross 220 million unit by 2016, there is huge potential for growth in the market. GOOGLE and MSFT wins- With Tegra 3 processors being present in Microsoft’s Surface PC tablet as well, we feel the company will leverage from the growth in both these operating systems. The Company holds more than 1,900 issued patents worldwide, including ones covering designs and insights that are essential to modern computing . This company is probably the best positioned chip maker in the market right now. The potential and pipeline for earnings /estimates have been increasing rapidly. Tegra 3 revenues increased by almost 50% in Q1 2012 and Nvidia expects the shipment to almost double in 2012. The company also hasn't had a negative earnings surprise in over two years. SEPT 1 news reports- It’s widely expected that Amazon will drop Texas Instruments (NYSE: TXN ) for the tablet’s processing brains, and that NVIDIA (Nasdaq: NVDA ) has scored that seat with its quad-core Tegra 3 chip -- the same one powering the Nexus 7. The display should get upgraded from the current 1024 x 600, and match the Nexus 7’s resolution of 1280 x 800. We may see a camera added, while the first-generation model lacked one. Unlike Apple’s supply chain, which is full of leaks, not much else is known about Amazon’s new device. The FIRE is selling out and Amazon is out of stock. NVDA WINS WITH A 199$ PRICE RANGE. The Nexus 7 carries Android 4.1 Jelly Bean, and the Google Play content storefront. Amazon should, again, use a heavily modified, or forked, version of Android, but it remains to be seen which version it might have tinkered with. Google definitely has an advantage in apps, but Amazon has an enormous selection of books and movies. Amazon has come a long way since the dawn of the Internet, and is now a dominant force in cyberspace. Smartphones are the largest market for mobile appli¬cation processors, with shipments on track for 670 million units and a growth rate of 37% in 2012. Shipments of tablet computers are expanding even faster, with a pro¬jected 77% growth in 2012 to 113 million units.

The deal gave Nvidia access to Icera’s more than 550 patents for 3G and 4G wireless modem components, positioning it to offer not only the chipsets that power smartphones and tablets but also their wireless connectivity capabilities as well. Low Cost Kai Platform to Make Android Tablets Available at $199 and selling out. They estimate Nvidia’s revenue from mobile and game consoles will reach $0.8 billion by the end of this year, and more than double by the end of our forecast period. leveraging its acquisition of Icera, Nvidia is working toward LTE integration. In order to grow further in the smartphone and tablet market, the company thinks the integration of the LTE modem will substantially grow its market opportunity in the future. APPLE has the US and the world sales are wide open. Nvidia’s focused growth strategy in the tablet market will help it register substantial growth in Tegra revenues. Many expect Tegra to become the most important division for Nvidia by the end of our forecast period. While Tegra2 featured in 15 smartphones last year, Tegra3 is expected to power around 30 devices in 2012. It is believed to have by far the strongest software system for graphics in the mobile world. [1] The Company operates in three segments: graphics processing unit (GPU) Business, professional solutions business (PSB) and consumer products business (CPB). Microsoft announced its own tablet that will be equipped by Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA ) . According to Digitimes, "HP has already decided to halt development of Windows RT tablet PCs, while Dell reportedly may also back away from the segment." NVDA still has an envious lineup of partners for its Tegra family of chips, including Google, which offers the popular Nexus 7 tablet and Microsoft's new Surface tablet. NVIDIA® Icera® soft-modem chipsets deliver high-performance communication engines for cellular products. Their unique system architecture enables the highest user throughput and advanced modem features with the smallest footprints and the lowest costs. This gives you a powerful solution for creating smaller, faster, and more affordable high-technology devices. ICERA 410 10MHZ LTE AND DUAL CELL PLATFORM The Icera 410 platform is targeted at enabling early multimode LTE devices that are comparable with current HSPA devices for price and form-factor. It’s based on the ICE8061 baseband and the ICE8261 RF IC. The Android-based market and MSFT OS will remain a growing presence and will probably gnaw away at Apple's lead. NVDA hits it big with the Electric Vehicle- the car's interior completes its futuristic appeal with a 17-inch touchscreen powered by NVIDIA's (Nasdaq: NVDA ) Tegra 3 processor. Tesla CEO Elon Musk chose NVIDIA's chips because of their ability to render crisp 3-D graphics and maps without draining the car's battery. The Tegra 3 is the first generation that I feel has the capability to catapult Nvidia to the top of the market. This reminds me of the late 90′s when their graphics chips where clearly becoming the best on the market.</Msg><Username>delldudelives</Username><Timestamp>1346766718607</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 09:51:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346767048255-23</Id><Topic><Title>downgrade = buy</Title><Username>nasdaq6001</Username><Timestamp>1346766167326</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 09:42:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Open: down 46 cents.....downgrade=sell.

While Tegra2 featured in 15 smartphones last year, Tegra3 is expected to power around 30 devices in 2012. It is believed to have by far the strongest software system for graphics in the mobile world. [1] The Company operates in three segments: graphics processing unit (GPU) Business, professional solutions business (PSB) and consumer products business (CPB). Microsoft announced its own tablet that will be equipped by Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA ) . According to Digitimes, "HP has already decided to halt development of Windows RT tablet PCs, while Dell reportedly may also back away from the segment." NVDA still has an envious lineup of partners for its Tegra family of chips, including Google, which offers the popular Nexus 7 tablet and Microsoft's new Surface tablet. NVIDIA® Icera® soft-modem chipsets deliver high-performance communication engines for cellular products. Their unique system architecture enables the highest user throughput and advanced modem features with the smallest footprints and the lowest costs. This gives you a powerful solution for creating smaller, faster, and more affordable high-technology devices. ICERA 410 10MHZ LTE AND DUAL CELL PLATFORM The Icera 410 platform is targeted at enabling early multimode LTE devices that are comparable with current HSPA devices for price and form-factor. It’s based on the ICE8061 baseband and the ICE8261 RF IC. The Android-based market and MSFT OS will remain a growing presence and will probably gnaw away at Apple's lead. NVDA hits it big with the Electric Vehicle- the car's interior completes its futuristic appeal with a 17-inch touchscreen powered by NVIDIA's (Nasdaq: NVDA ) Tegra 3 processor. Tesla CEO Elon Musk chose NVIDIA's chips because of their ability to render crisp 3-D graphics and maps without draining the car's battery. The Tegra 3 is the first generation that I feel has the capability to catapult Nvidia to the top of the market. This reminds me of the late 90′s when their graphics chips where clearly becoming the best on the market.</Msg><Username>delldudelives</Username><Timestamp>1346774719620</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 12:05:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346774855674-53</Id><Topic><Title>Back to $14 on Thursday</Title><Username>lukedukez</Username><Timestamp>1346770557267</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 10:55:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Many pundits will say that Nvidia doesn’t stand a chance against bigger rivals like Qualcomm which makes the Snapdragon processor, Apple’s A5 chip, or Intel’s Atom chip. The true story is not only does Tegra 3 compete with these, it’s beating them in most benchmark test. And let me warn you Qualcomm, Apple, and Intel, the beating is only going to get worse. I have seen this story before, once Nvidia gets the edge it maintains it. The launch of Tegra 3 accelerated Nvidia’s revenue contribution from its consumer products business, showing a 36% sequential increase last quarter to just over $179 million. Those record sales of Tegra 3 processors last quarter will continue, as Nvidia has had a number of big design wins lately, most notably Google’s Nexus 7, the world’s first $199 quad-core 7-inch tablet, and Microsoft’s Windows RT Surface tablet. So we have two parts to Nvidia now. It’s not just a graphics chip company anymore, as it has a growing mobile computing business as well, which could become larger than its core graphics business in the future The success of Tegra 3 as well as a rebound in its GPU business translated into blowout earnings last quarter, with EPS coming in at 27 cents vs estimates of 15 cents. For the current quarter, the company expects revenue of $1.15 billion to $1.25 billion, the average estimates of analysts was $1.09 billion. Nvidia’s core business is going to be fine, and they will be widely successful in mobile computing as well. Most gamers don’t go to that extreme, but they still want a high performance graphics card for their pc. Nvidia’s current market cap is $9 billion, and they have almost $3.3 billion in cash and no debt. Given the earnings guidance, the company’s EPS should be about $1 for the year, giving it a current p/e of 14. Considering the growth of Tegra 3, and the company’s market share position in graphics, next year earnings could be blowouts, possible $1.50 a share or more for the year. Diversifying- Nvidia knows that tablets and smartphones are only going to become more popular, and who better than to make a central processing unit (CPU), graphics processing unit (GPU), northbridge, southbridge, and memory controller onto one package to go into these devices? Don’t be fooled by the market that don’t get NVDA or understand it. The true story is not only does Tegra 3 compete with these, it’s beating them in most benchmark test. And let me warn you Qualcomm, Apple, and Intel, the beating is only going to get worse. I have seen this story before, once Nvidia gets the edge it maintains it.

Analysts forecast earnings of 22 cents per share. Better outlook- Generally speaking, the company’s chips sales outside of the PC market appears to be boosting revenue. Sales in this area will likely be critical to the company going forward, as global PC sales appear to be waning, so says noted research firm Gartner. NVIDIA's Tegra series chips will be featured in both Microsoft's (Nasdaq: MSFT) upcoming Surface Windows RT tablet PC and are already featured in Google's (Nasdaq: GOOG) Nexus 7 tablet. In addition, investors might keep an eye on new cloud computing technologies, which NVIDIA announced at its recent GPI Technology Conference SALES RECORDS- "Our investments in mobile computing and visual computing are both paying off," said Jen-Hsun Huang, president and chief executive officer of NVIDIA. "Tegra has achieved record sales as tablets come into their own. Our GPU business made strong gains in a weak market, boosted by our breakthrough Kepler architecture. Looking ahead, we're optimistic, as our investments position us right at the center of the fastest growing segments of computing." FUTURE PROOF- Nvidia’s Grid and VGX cloud graphics processors enable gamer-grade or professional-grade graphics capabilities on absolutely any device, including desktops, laptops, tablets or even smartphones. 100% - Without doubts, cloud graphics processing technologies are among the most important technologies Nvidia has ever developed. However, it will take some time before they will be adopted by the mass market. The key technologies powering the new platform are Nvidia GeForce Grid GPUs with dedicated ultra-low-latency streaming technology and cloud graphics software. Together, they fundamentally change the economics and experience of cloud gaming, enabling gaming-as-a-service providers to operate scalable data centers at costs that are in line with those of movie-streaming services. Gaikai will be the first Nvidia customer to adopt GeForce Grid MULTI MEDIA- Fast streaming technology reduces server latency to as little as 10 milliseconds by capturing and encoding a game frame in a single pass. The GeForce Grid platform uses fast-frame capture, concurrent rendering and single-pass encoding to achieve ultra-fast game streaming.</Msg><Username>delldudelives</Username><Timestamp>1346774926958</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 12:08:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346775285686-55</Id><Topic><Title>Back to $14 on Thursday</Title><Username>lukedukez</Username><Timestamp>1346770557267</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 10:55:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I FEEL there are enough variables with the competition to look at this stock very hard. IF INTC or QCOM stumble at all it could be a windfall. The digital marketplace and different industries going digital warrant a position.

And now we’re working on first quad-core processor will be Tegra 3, which is really going to be called Kal-El. Huang notes that Kal-El is Superman name, and that the rest of the product line up is also comics-based: “Wayne” for Bat-Man, etc. Anyway: Getting performance is easy part. Challenging part is delivering that performance with low power, and better and better efficiency. The low-power core with Kal-El is 20x “less hungry” for energy. Second invention: Use image-processing technique to look at the color content of an image. That allows us to save a ton of power that way. It allows us to sort of “cheat” on colors and use similar colors, with different lighting – human eye can’t tell. having the first step advantage into the quad core speeks for itself.

EPIC deal is like a Netflix deal..... Amazon will sell the 199$ dollar tablet that streams..... NVDA is in the middle of a digital cloud revolution with the first quad core. The stock is under valued here. Tegra 3 accelerated Nvidia’s growth in the mobile computing segment, which is evident from 36% sequential increase in the consumer products business. Hitting record sales in Q2 2013, Tegra 3 processors featured in a number of exciting devices this year – Google’s Nexus 7, the world’s first $199 quad-core 7-inch tablet, Microsoft’s Windows RT Surface tablet, Fujitsu’s ARROWS X, the world’s first quad-core LTE smartphone, and the World first RT device by Asus. - Nvidia’s Grid and VGX cloud graphics processors enable gamer-grade or professional-grade graphics capabilities on absolutely any device, including desktops, laptops, tablets or even smartphones. 100% - Without doubts, cloud graphics processing technologies are among the most important technologies Nvidia has ever developed. However, it will take some time before they will be adopted by the mass market. The key technologies powering the new platform are Nvidia GeForce Grid GPUs with dedicated ultra-low-latency streaming technology and cloud graphics software. Together, they fundamentally change the economics and experience of cloud gaming, enabling gaming-as-a-service providers to operate scalable data centers at costs that are in line with those of movie-streaming services. Gaikai will be the first Nvidia customer to adopt GeForce Grid MULTI MEDIA- Fast streaming technology reduces server latency to as little as 10 milliseconds by capturing and encoding a game frame in a single pass. The GeForce Grid platform uses fast-frame capture, concurrent rendering and single-pass encoding to achieve ultra-fast game streaming. Tegra related revenues crossing the $2 billion mark to become Nvidia’s most valuable segment by the end of our forecast</Msg><Username>delldudelives</Username><Timestamp>1346776703643</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 12:38:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346776820887-64</Id><Title>Longs, if you have any links to show why NVDA is anything but a worthless POS please post them.</Title><Msg>The whole link, so we can click right on it to verify some of your pumping.

On Feb. 14, NVidia officials revealed that the SEC has begun an investigation into how the company recorded reserves during the fourth quarter of its 2000 fiscal year and the first quarter of fiscal 2001. In addition, the SEC is investigating the possibility that US$3.6 million in product costs should have been recorded by the company during the first quarter of fiscal 2001, but were instead recorded during the second and third quarters of that same year, the company said. NVidia's fiscal 2000 year ended January 30, 2000 and its fiscal 2001 year ended January 28, 2001. During a conference call with analysts on Feb. 14, Jen-Hsun Huang, NVidia's chief executive officer (CEO) and president, declined to comment on specifics of the SEC investigation, including the nature of the reserves under investigation." .

Here's what appears to have happened. ibexx88 posted something slanderous-looking about two funds and past SEC investigations. He called them by name -- maybe not so smart when you are likely slandering them on a global venue. Anyway, the fine Yahoo Monitors apparently immediately removed ibexx88's message from view. Without leaving an "X" or anything -- like on the good old board. Meanwhile, best.here was doing his exhaustive on-line research into the SEC's 2002 investigation into nvidia's investigatable accounting. And by the time best.here posted his diligent research -- ibexx88's slanderous-looking message had already been wisked-away from public view. Resulting in this mighty puzzling-looking thread. With best.here quoting a message from ibexx88 -- which has been deleted by the Monitors. . .</Msg><Username>best.here</Username><Timestamp>1346816840776</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 23:47:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
