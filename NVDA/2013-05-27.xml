Double the core count and massively increase the GPU size, and what do you end up with? Increasing the size of the two largest units on the chip may not double the area, but it won’t be far off that mark. Clover Trail is massive, so big that it is not economically viable in the markets that they are fighting for. That promise from the last financial analyst day of good margins on Atom in the phone/tablet market would go up in smoke if Intel released the die size, and they know it. Intel can’t compete in tablets and phones." Every Smart Phone chip Intel had ever came up with was garbage big BIG - so BIG that Quad cores are unimaginable. 25% GM! Sell Sell Sell INTC - Its heading the way of Xerox, Kodak, Rimm. Their BOD must be illiterate!

Zero clue about what's underneath Android.

The final obstacle that Intel would encounter, &amp; not used to is penetrating a very established, &amp; highly competitive sector where customers &amp; developers are very acclimated &amp; content with ARM. I'm not saying it's impossible, but it might just be an insurmountable task even for Intel and its mega billions, and not being in the comfortable monopolistic position that allowed them to manipulate many aspects, legally &amp; illegally, since Intel's inception. Perhaps this is one sector where Intel will not compete effectively in, and will have to be content with dominating most everything else.</Msg><Username>fairbanksmorse1</Username><Timestamp>1369681059491</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-27 14:57:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369684881458-10</Id><Topic><Title>The great Clover trailed</Title><Username>ltenow</Username><Timestamp>1369643318086</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-27 04:28:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>", &amp; not used to is penetrating a very established, &amp; highly competitive sector where customers &amp; developers are very acclimated &amp; content with ARM" Right, remember how Intel took over the server space? IBM's POWER and Oracle's SPARC are on their last breaths as Xeon E7 cleans up what's left of that market. Intel started from 0. And what's this nonsense about Intel not being able to compete on cost. They have their own fabs, have a node size advantage, amortize the R&amp;D across multiple product lines that ship in high volume, and don't pay ARM a dime. Seems like the cost structure is actually in Intel's favor.</Msg><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1369684881458</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-27 16:01:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369687398408-11</Id><Topic><Title>The great Clover trailed</Title><Username>ltenow</Username><Timestamp>1369643318086</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-27 04:28:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ashraf, I think we're talking about margins and what Intel is willing to sacrifice in terms of profitability to win in mobile.

Look at how important margins are to every other semi for investors and fund managers. It's been a major concern of Intel by analysts. Nvidia's recent stability in the stock price can be attributed in part to the positive surprise in their margins. You can argue that many semis would be farther along now if it weren't for the concern to keep the margins at a reasonable level for an investor's outlooks. Too much capital in the development too fast makes it hard to keep the margins up, if not the profits. Ashraf, I respect your bullish position(s) but this is a valid point.</Msg><Username>roundhouse_c</Username><Timestamp>1369708361023</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-27 22:32:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369709759066-18</Id><Topic><Title>The great Clover trailed</Title><Username>ltenow</Username><Timestamp>1369643318086</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-27 04:28:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's usually not a good idea to spread misinformation about the competitors to your investment; this leads to very bad investment decisions. I am long both Intel and Nvidia, and I respect each firms' strengths and weaknesses, and think both are pretty reasonably priced. If ARM ever craters to $15-$20, I'll be positive on them, too. People tend to forget that this is a stock market, not a fanboy club. Think of all the $ left on the table by the folks who wouldn't touch AMD at $2.50 or so simply because Nvidia is a better company? Yes, Nvidia is better, and it is good to own, but there is money to be made owning competitors too.</Msg><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1369709759066</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-27 22:55:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
