Some nerve you have armchairing on a message board...." Well, it's not armchairing actually. As you may know, I'm the son of a Chief Engineer for a Very Large company. He was in charge of the design of about 10,000 products. With an army of electrical engineers spread throughout many countries. Before discovering the obscene riches to be earned in the World of Finance, I thought I wanted to become an engineer too. So I spent three summers as an engineering intern, assisting two PhD electrical engineers in a high-security new products development lab. I was the young kid doing the testing -- substituting capacitors, resistors, tweaking voltages, substituting diodes, rectifiers, changing the printed circuit card layout.... and then subjecting the device to military and UL type reliability testing. Been there, done that. Brought a brand new product from design to manufacturing in one summer. I've got the second one ever made, if you'd like to see it. So like I said, it's really not armchairing. I know the world in which engineers live.</Msg><Username>best.here</Username><Timestamp>1359437515379</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 00:31:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359437987479-2</Id><Title>The Bank Of Nvidia Will Just Have To Return Cash To Shareholders</Title><Msg>Do you really think the Bank of Nvidia will satisfy shareholders with reference designs of Red Army phones. Of course not! Yes by all means do reference designs of Red Army phones. Not a bad idea. But it's time to buyback shares and perhaps increase the dividend.

Why would Google charge $400 - $500 for a table that costs half that to manufacture? They want to sell these things, right? I suppose that, if they can command margins like Apple's, then more power to them. But they will only do that if they can still sell millions. If they could, that would be great news for NVDA, being in a desirable AND high margin product. That is not Google's business model, though, so why even bring it up?

Google’s (GOOG) follow-up to the popular Nexus 7 tablet will reportedly debut in May as a cooperative effort with manufacturing partner Asus. Digitimes on Tuesday cites multiple unnamed sources from within Google’s supply chain in claiming that the second-generation Nexus 7 tablet will feature a tweaked design and a full 1080p high-definition display. The bezel around the screen will be narrower as well according to the report, and the tablet will supposedly run an “upgraded Jelly Bean-based Android operating system to enhance integration between the software and the hardware.” According to the site’s sources, combined first- and second-generation Nexus 7 shipments are expected to total 10 million units this year.</Msg><Username>on2five</Username><Timestamp>1359486913465</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 14:15:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359487432979-40</Id><Title>technical breakout yesterday but gap needed filled at $12.40</Title><Msg>today's action is typical: break-out with gap fill &amp; pullback to prior resistance at $12.30ish.

Hedge funds get plenty of pointed fingers. How about starting with boring old mutual funds — like those run by American Funds, among the staidest of them all? The $113 billion Growth Fund of America – the third-largest in the mutual fund industry, according to Morningstar – dumped something like $3 billion worth of the stock during the fourth quarter, according to portfolio disclosures. The story is similar at the $52 billion Fundamental Investors A, whose third-largest stock position as of June 30 was a 1.9 million- share stake in Apple worth approximately $1.1 billion dollars, about 2.3% of the portfolio. Amcap Fund, another growth fund, this one with $25 billion under management, reduced its stake to 360,000 shares last quarter, or 0.75% of assets as of Dec. 31, from more than twice that. The $7.9 billion New Economy Fund, where you’d presumably expect a strong opinion on the subject, also dropped Apple, and it picked up Facebook (FB). This fund held a 0.26% sliver of the portfolio in Apple as of Dec. 31 and a 0.84% Facebook weighting. That’s versus a 4% Apple weighting at May 31.

We cannot confirm it at this time and we don’t know whether the M7 is HTC’s Tegra 4 phone, but we can confirm that Nvidia has won a design win for a future phone from HTC. It is coming in the next few months, but other than that, we don’t know much. We expect this phone will show its face at the Mobile World Congress in roughly a month from today, but it’s also quite clear that it won’t start shipping right away, as Tegra 4 is just entering mass production. It takes some time to ramp up the volume and stamp out enough chips. Reports that Nvidia partners might tap NV reference designs for their own tablets and later even phones sound logical from Nvidia’s point of view, but won’t be welcomed by its long term supporters like LG and HTC. Such a move would increase competition and drive down prices. We are not sure how the new phone will be branded but we expect to see a full HD screen, just like the one we saw on the HTC Butterfly and it has been rumored that the M7 comes with full HD 1920x1080 screen as well. The bottom line, we can confirm that flagship phone based on Tegra 4 is coming from the house of HTC. We’re just not sure whether it’s the M7.

Now the company is rumored to be interested in manufacturing smartphones and tablets for other corporations. According to DroidGamers (which translated a report by Russian tech site Mobile Review), NVIDIA is investigating the possibility of producing smartphones and tablets as a so-called "white-label" manufacturer. White-label companies typically produce items for one or more partners, who then place their own names on the box. If the report is accurate, NVIDIA hopes to begin the design and manufacturing process by May or June, leading to a fall or winter ship date. It is not yet known which companies may be interested in buying NVIDIA's creations. Another option could be lesser-known Chinese corporations that are trying to break into the global market. They could use the NVIDIA name -- which would likely be highlighted in some capacity -- to bolster their own brands. GameStop (NYSE: GME) could also provide NVIDIA with some interesting opportunities. The retailer intended to break into the tablet business by applying the GameStop brand to an existing device. Those plans did not pan out, however, as the company decided to sell refurbished tablets instead. Without a key partner (or several partners) that want NVIDIA's items, it is unclear how the company may proceed with this venture. NVIDIA could simply push ahead and send the items straight to retail. Until the company has produced an actual device, it is difficult to say how well it could perform. However, there is no denying that tablets and smartphones are two of the toughest industries in technology. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has already taken a large part of the tablet market with the iPad and the iPad Mini. The two devices have sold more than 120 million units worldwide. With so many other corporations already fighting for the remaining market share, NVIDIA might find that it is impossible to compete. The same could be said for the smartphone industry, which is arguably the most crowded in the world. In both cases, NVIDIA is faced with a series of obstacles it may not be able to overcome.</Msg><Username>luizimonti</Username><Timestamp>1359500258719</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 17:57:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359500982033-60</Id><Topic><Title>Fudzilla just in: Tegra 4 is in new HTC phone</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1359493458962</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 16:04:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nope Ibexx...Just calling it like it is.

It's huge $0.43 GAAP vs.$0.76 Non-GAAP. The watch what Yahoo finance posts tomorrow as actuals......Non-GAAP earnings of course.

A purportedly plugged-in user on Korean-language tech forum Ruliweb claims knowledge of Google’s next-generation Nexus smartphone, the LG-built Nexus 5. The handset reportedly features a 5-inch full-HD display, a quad-core Tegra 4 processor, 8GB or 16GB of internal storage, 2GB of RAM, a 13-megapixel camera and Android “Key Lime Pie,” the next version of Google’s mobile operating system.</Msg><Username>on2five</Username><Timestamp>1359512326042</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 21:18:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359512454726-76</Id><Title>Tomshardware comments on NVIDIA's making its own tablets and phones</Title><Msg>By building its own reference designs, Nvidia will have complete control over the entire product design, maximizing the performance of its Tegra SoC. Nvidia will also be able to build its SoCs on a much higher scale, thus low-cost partners will be able to distribute even more cheap, high-quality units in developing markets. In turn, distribution and volume will be scaled up, allowing Nvidia to buy the components it needs at a competitive price. Ultimately this means partners will be able to undercut first-tier brands in price while delivering devices with comparable quality. That said, Nvidia is reportedly looking to saturate the market by focusing on those that have up until now sold low-quality Chinese-made tablets and phones in local markets. Several examples are Fly and Wexter in Russia, and Micromax and Lava in India. Nvidia is shooting for one or two strong partners per market that, thanks to the reference designs, will become strong regional vendors over time. Nvidia will reportedly start churning out the tablet reference designs in May or June of 2013. These will consist of cheap and high-quality models ranging between 7 to 10-inches, and will appear in various markets under different brands. Some will actually have the Nvidia or Tegra branding, and some will not – this will ultimately be left up to the OEM, the report said. This isn't Nvidia's first dip into the reference design waters, as the company was highly successful offering designs in the PC graphics card market. But Nvidia may gain more traction in the mobile market due to its existing Tegra 3 platform, and the upcoming Tegra 4 which was announced weeks ago at CES 2013.
