Like any other greenfield product launches, Tegra has had its ups and downs and we never anticipated a linear path to success. Management has even acknowledged that Tegra 4 came to market roughly one quarter behind plan, although this was primarily a function of accelerated investment in the LTE integrated Tegra 4i that is six months ahead of expectations. The development here is significant in that expands the existing Tegra product into the mainstream smartphone market ($100-200 retail price point), which Nvidia currently has little to no presence. All things considered, Nvidia believes that Tegra 4i will help it expand in both China and integrated LTE phones, a market that should be ~230 million units (excluding Apple (AAPL) and Samsung [Electronics (005930KS)] by 2014, which is well above its current TAM of ~90 million units. Assuming that Nvidia can get just 10% of this market, that suggests revenue of $300-400 million in smartphone revenue in the next two years (vs. ~$200 million today). At the end of the day, we believe Tegra’s opportunity is well beyond the $1 billion breakeven mark set for Tegra, and that we should see leverage on current investments over the next few years. Those looking for more near-term leverage may take solace in Nvidia’s FY14 opex guidance of $1.6 billion given at the GTC conference last week, which is below consensus of $1.7 billion and implies ~$0.15 in EPS upside all else equal.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1364223865439</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 11:04:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364225990404-12</Id><Topic><Title>A STRONG buy rec this morn yet NVDA shares still fall 10 cents!</Title><Username>moondpotus</Username><Timestamp>1364222820467</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 10:47:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Must be the asr-holes the company hired to buy back shares.

Ltd. to develop reference design flows using PowerVR Series 6 GPUs for manufacturing processes including the forthcoming 16-nm FinFET process. GPU cores are coming to dominate the area, power and performance of SoCs and therefore process design flows and libraries need to be tuned and optimized for them. The use of high bandwidth memory channels and 3#$%$ assembly will be part of the collaboration and should allow the two companies to demonstrate high performance, small physical footprint and low power, said Imagination Technologies Group plc (Kings Langley, England). "Just as memory drove silicon processes in the 80s and 90s, and CPUs drove processes further in the late 90s and 00s, high performance mobile GPUs for graphics and compute applications are one of the major drivers for our most advanced process technologies," said Cliff Hou, vice president of R&amp;D at TSMC (Hsinchu, Taiwan), in a statement issued by Imagination. Hossein Yassaie, CEO of Imagination, said: "Through advanced projects initiated under this partnership, Imagination and TSMC are working together to showcase how SoCs will transform the future of mobile and embedded products." As well as developing the widely licensed PowerVR series of graphics processors, Imagination also offers the PowerVR VPU video decoder and encoder, the Ensigma radio processor unit (RPU) which covers connectivity applications and the recently acquired line of MIPS processor cores</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1364230506871</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 12:55:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364232273009-15</Id><Title>EETimes comments on NVIDIA's new roadmaps (2 parts)</Title><Msg>Part 1 Nvidia revealed an updated roadmap for its GPU and Tegra mobile processors at its annual GPU Technology Conference (GTC), and other product announcements for taking on Intel and AMD as well as its smartphone competitors. It also showed its graphics chips are breaking out of the mould of media and technical processing to take on business apps. Maxwell is the next big step on Nvidia's road map, a graphics chip due in 2014 using virtual memory shared by the GPU and host CPU. The approach, likely implemented in Nvidia's proprietary Cuda environment, is similar to what Advanced Micro Devices is enabling with its HSA group supported by ARM, Microsoft and others. In 2015, Nvidia will pack a Maxwell core along with its first 64bit ARM design into a sixth-generation Tegra chip called Parker. The device is the first of Nvidia's Project Denver designs and will be made in a FinFET process, said Jen-Hsun Huang, Nvidia's chief executive in a keynote here. Separately, Nvidia will sample Tegra5, aka Logan, this year, its first mobile processor to support its Cuda environment for general-purpose graphics. It also supports OpenGL 4.3 and will be in production in 2014. The company also disclosed a 2015 graphics processor called Volta, its first to use stacked memory with through-silicon vias, similar to the Hyper Memory Cube defined by Micron and supported by a host of other chip makers. Also at GTC, Nvidia is rolling out its Grid Enterprise initiative. It consists of a new layer of systems and software to provide business users virtualized access to apps running on Nvidia graphics processors. Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang presents the company's latest roadmap at the GPU Technology Conference Tuesday. Dell, Hewlett-Packard and IBM are among companies who will make Grid Enterprise servers and appliances for large and small businesses. Citrix, Microsoft and VMWare are among those making the software.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1364232273009</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 13:24:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364234115403-16</Id><Topic><Title>BARRONS just in: NVIDIA can reach break-even on Tegra, says Raymond James (1)</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1364223727552</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 11:02:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>so Raymond James' Hanns 'nvda to $40' Mossesman is being bullish on nvda again?</Msg><Username>whosunw</Username><Timestamp>1364234115403</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 13:55:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364234570446-17</Id><Title>Tegra break-even when?</Title><Msg>Is that supposed to happen this year?

Nvidia has established a VERY clear game plan for these first two quarters where the stock price is stabilizing. If you aren't happy with it, move on. Otherwise, continual posting about the next announcement forthcoming for Tegra doesn't make these announcements come any faster, unless you are one of the CEOs of the companies involved . . and obviously, you would be on this board if you were one of these CEOs . .

But this is only the 2nd time in my life writing calls. So I'm no expert for sure. I did sell some shares to reduce my exposure and still holding some shares with no calls written against them. That way I can be wrong, wrong, wrong, or right, right, right or any combination in between. Jeez....I have never seen a stock flat line like Nvidia has recently.

Retail GPU down $100m from last Qtr? T3 down $50m from last Qtr? Grid / HPC up $25m That put my guess at ~ $975m. A nice monkey range in the Q1 numbers would be - if they start shipping T4/T4i in April in some meaningful quantities. At that point - the numbers don't matter - it's the T4/T4i momentum that takes over :). Q3 should be a blockbuster in terms of Revenue and Earnings - Tegra in full shipment mode, Shield (Almost certainly the Tegra biz would break even in Q3 and the super margins HPC/Grid/VCAs.</Msg><Username>ltenow</Username><Timestamp>1364255650631</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 19:54:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364259701128-39</Id><Title>Chinese Allwinner selling its quad core chips for $10.

I understand that Jen-hsun tends to use superlatives in excess. He does delivers what he says in the past year. He said quad-core tablets would sell for $199, and they did 6 months later. He said Win RT should be released prior to Win "Classis", and Microsoft listened. Now he pleaded for Outlook on RT, I think Microsoft will listen. He says the phone rings off the hook for Tegra 4i, you'd better take a notice as an investor (short/long).</Msg><Username>findingnemoyes</Username><Timestamp>1364268153060</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 23:22:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
