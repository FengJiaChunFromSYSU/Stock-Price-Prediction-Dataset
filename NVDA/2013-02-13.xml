It may have been a sound business decision to not "win". AMD has been under tremendous financial pressure. No doubt they aggressively bid on the design work. Their existing CPU and GPU expertise and designs are sunk costs that their shareholders won't see a return on if they don't get cash flow positive. Keeping the design team working (and paid) with a bid just above cost is their best approach. Nvidia, on the other hand, sees that consoles have gone from 100x the performance of a more expensive PC to falling behind in price and realism. Only the input devices, simple setup and consistent experience remain advantages. They can be a low margin, low visibility supplier to a mature market that might be fading away, or they can try to shift the whole market to a new model where they have a much bigger slice of the pie. It's certainly not worth losing money to be in the former position. I see both AMD and Nvidia making the right decision for where they are at. It's survival revenue for AMD, and minimal profit with high opportunity cost for Nvidia. I suspect Nvidia's view is that even if it's not Shield or grid gaming that marginalizes the console market, something similar will.</Msg><Username>watergatefive</Username><Timestamp>1360738996275</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-13 02:03:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360740639676-4</Id><Topic><Title>Wii/PS4/Xbox 720 impact</Title><Username>best_ivideo</Username><Timestamp>1360733853634</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-13 00:37:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I agree with watergatefive. Winning a design win is thought to be good business on the button line, but maybe only if you look at the profit statement and not the overall cost of the win compared to the sales opportunity. Jen said in a recent interview that console business is quite a distraction for (any) company, since the console makers are often building an entirely new hardware architecture. Hence it is not only about supplying the customized chip but also about dedicating hundreds of engineers to build the software stack around it and do bug fixing and learning to optimize for the new architecture ect. Not a triviel task by any means. These RD/"Sales support" expenses are not a long term investment beyond the design win as the architecture is not likely to show up elsewhere. With Shield Nvidia is leveraging an existing Android eco system and PC Steam games library and the Tegra SOC architecture. Hence, those expenses are useful for the longer run. It is interesting to note that AMD is not announcing any new discrete graphics cards until 2013 Q4. Maybe exactly because they have to support a new architecture for Xbox/ps4 first and their engineers can not be dedicated effieciently to two separate tasks. So maybe AMD has won in one turf but is loosing in another.

Jen Hsun had mentioned numerous times - since a few years ago - that the console business was not worth going after. No profits there, period. This statement was made even it became clear game consoles are on their way to extinction. At least 2 players will exit the space within 5 years if not sooner. Sony will announce PS4 formally on February 20th. i do them luck in finding early buyers because many people are concerned about the backward compatibility issue with existing game titles.

I think as an analogy to consoles we can also look into the space for Bluray/DVD players. A lot of the existing hardware players are leaving the field (Even Sony). I guess they can more clearly see that still less people buy them as stand-alone-players. Now people prefer Netflix and other streaming services. Cloud gaming and streaming locally from your PC are becoming the similar approach. I used to buy my games as DVD's and preferred the physical DVD copy and box. Now I prefer to buy my PC games using Steam (maybe Origion) as I can simply download it (and often with more discount than going with physical media). In addition I can simply install Steam on a new computer and Steam automatically enables download of all the games in my Steam library (free backup service - and games are always kept up to date). These features are great and provides great service and convinience to the user. Android is somewhat similar and games bought in Google Play automatically shows up on compatible Android devices (maybe requires selection for download) - but purchased content is then included for free. So I always have a secure copy and ease of use. /Frank.</Msg><Username>frankduxbusborg</Username><Timestamp>1360744674611</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-13 03:37:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360755523523-10</Id><Title>earnings, before or after the bell???</Title><Msg>thank you</Msg><Username>hex_60638</Username><Timestamp>1360755523523</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-13 06:38:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360758071742-11</Id><Topic><Title>NVIDIA GPUs Accelerate Adobe Creative Suite 5.5 Production Premium</Title><Username>bulademple442</Username><Timestamp>1302536061000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2011-04-11 11:34:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Clear analysis.</Msg><Username>edwardantony835</Username><Timestamp>1360758071742</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-13 07:21:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360759717469-12</Id><Topic><Title>earnings, before or after the bell???</Title><Username>hex_60638</Username><Timestamp>1360755523523</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-13 06:38:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>after</Msg><Username>o08o.ugh64w</Username><Timestamp>1360759717469</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-13 07:48:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360764135937-13</Id><Title>Tom's Hardware on Titan specs; impressed by jaw-dropping performance</Title><Msg>Tom's Hardware Feb 12th "latest news" text from report There's been no shortage of rumors over Nvidia's upcoming GeForce GTX Titan and we can't help but be impressed by the latest reports that the Titan will deliver truly jaw-dropping performance at an equally staggering price. According to an Australian online retailer, as reported by WCCF, the GTX Titan will feature 6 GB of DDR5 memory, a 512 bit memory interface (rather than 384 bit), a base clock of 915 MHz (instead of 732 MHz) and a boost clock of 1019 MHz. It therefore seems that the GK110 chip in the consumer Titan card might actually be quite different from the GK110 chips in Nvidia's professional Tesla K20 and K20X cards. With the increased performance has unfortunately come a dramatically increased price tag. The already incredible retail price of $899 is now is listed at a frankly insane $1599. While it is unrealistic to expect the GTX Titan to arrive with a sub-$1000 price point, the estimate of $1599 seems a bit too far-fetched.</Msg><Username>livinlifeveryday</Username><Timestamp>1360764135937</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-13 09:02:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360765148282-14</Id><Title>Shorts; here is an "info gift" for you</Title><Msg>This report below from Steam shows the % of GPU by brand &amp; model in use by its gaming customers Use the sort option on upper right "% changed this month" storeDOTsteampoweredDOTcom/hwsurvey/videocard/?sort=pct for a channel check go to Newegg and find Desk top grpahics and choose bestsellers You can thank me later</Msg><Username>livinlifeveryday</Username><Timestamp>1360765148282</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-13 09:19:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360765243710-15</Id><Topic><Title>Broadcom unveils its first LTE chip to rival Qualcomm, Where's NVDA Jen?</Title><Username>rounhouse_c</Username><Timestamp>1360713460889</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 18:57:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Hmmm, it will be 10 months minimally from sampling to production....tough telco business!

In doing so, I’ve identified what could be an important area of opportunity for Microsoft’s marketing department: They need to play up the fact that this tablet/ultrabook hybrid is quite adept at running a wide range of AAA video games. The Surface Pro handles Diablo III at 1920 x 1080 resolution with most specs except shadows maxed out. Popular MOBA League of Legends kicked out a smooth 30FPS (frames per second) at the same resolution with quality settings defaulted to High. How about the endlessly-playable, touch-enhanced version of Civilization V? Beautiful, stable, and a joy to experience on the Pro’s excellent display. Ditto for Portal 2, XCOM: Enemy Unknown, and StarCraft II. Surprised? So was the majority of my Twitter audience. As I spent the day testing various high-profile — and most importantly, evergreen — game releases, a fascinating trend emerged. People previously on the fence about purchasing a Surface Pro reversed course and started hunting down the hardware. Their prior perceptions held that the Surface Pro was strictly a business machine. Nevermind that Microsoft is targeting anything but the business professional with their new breakdancing-laden commercial. The culture Microsoft has fostered for decades assumes that the Surface Pro is for work. It’s time for Redmond to change the messaging. Tech-savvy consumers want to carry around a single multipurpose device. One that fits the bill at work, is easy to travel with, and powerful enough to aid in productivity. Shouldn’t that same device be useful during leisure time? Several of my Twitter followers want to play World of Warcraft during their downtime, and had no idea that the Surface Pro’s Intel Core i5, 4GB of RAM, and integrated Intel HD 4000 graphics could facilitate that.</Msg><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1360766020653</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-13 09:33:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360766599196-17</Id><Topic><Title>Read this now - NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA).</Title><Username>martinsgeorge951</Username><Timestamp>1360760975244</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-13 08:09:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>they are beastr</Msg><Username>lucio.declouette</Username><Timestamp>1360766599196</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-13 09:43:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360767328360-18</Id><Topic><Title>Surface Pro Can Run Diablo III, Portal 2, Other AAA Games - Why Isn't Microsoft Evangelizing This?</Title><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1360766020653</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-13 09:33:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Intel Haswell GT3 Graphics To Ship With Low Power Ultrabooks Hardware Posted 2 months ago by Hassan Mujtaba Intel Haswell GT3 to Power 3rd Generation Ultrabooks Now as we reported a day ago, Intel plans to launch Ivy Bridge-Y series low TDP chips in Q1 2013. Haswell series chips would arrive in Q2 2013 with the most basic Dual Core models featuring GT1 and GT2 level graphic chipsets. Chinese publication of VR-Zone now confirms that there would also be Haswell-U based chips featuring the GT3 level graphic chipsets which would be fused on certain CPUs with TDP ranging between 15-25 Watts (14″ and 15″ models). The following is an Haswell-U Core i7 series ES with a rated TDP of 15W: If you didn’t know already, Haswell GT3 graphics chipset is said to be 3 times faster than Ivy Bridge HD 4000 series and would most probably be know as the Intel HD 5000 series graphics chip. The specific codename of the chip is ‘Intel Haswell HD Graphics – GT3ULT’ from a leaked specification shot by VR-Zone. Furthermore, the Haswell GT3 chips would come with 40 Execution units compared to 16 EUs on IvyBridge. This however doesn’t rules out the possibility of Haswell GT3 graphics on desktop variants but we have to wait to see those.

Fortunately, Retina displays are getting slightly more accessible: Apple said today that it was lowering the price and boosting the processors on its 13-inch and 15-inch Retina display MacBook Pro notebooks. The 15-inch Retina display MacBook Pro, unfortunately, isn’t getting a price cut. Instead, it has two upgraded processor options, 2.4 gigahertz and 2.7 gigahertz, with the top-end version boasting 16 gigabytes of memory — which previously cost buyers an additional $200. The 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina now starts at $1499 for 128GB of flash, and $1699 for an upgraded 2.6ghz processor and 256GB of flash. The Cupertino-based company also lowered the price on the 13-inch, 256GB flash drive MacBook Air to $1399 from $1499. The (non-Retina) Air has a 1.8ghz dual-core processor and 4GB of memory. It’s not unusual for Apple to lower prices on its products mid-cycle. Earlier this week at the Goldman Sachs conference Apple CEO Tim Cook reiterated the company’s strategy of looking at different ways to lower price points, and also said that the company “sweats every detail” when it comes to displays.</Msg><Username>livinlifeveryday</Username><Timestamp>1360769890995</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-13 10:38:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360769966762-26</Id><Topic><Title>Breaking News:Apple MacBook Pros Get Faster, Cheaper</Title><Username>livinlifeveryday</Username><Timestamp>1360769890995</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-13 10:38:10 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The integrated Intel HD Graphics 4000 processor boosts performance by up to 60 percent.1 That extra power gives you a smoother, more fluid experience than before.

To put it in simple terms, AMD is in 15% of the PC market or 30 million units. AMD will be in more gaming console units than PC. AMD is expected to be cash flow positive by Q3. In order to do that, AMD must generate of $250 million added cash. Both the new PS4 and Xbox will be shipping in time for Christmas so the components must be shipped from AMD no later than the Q3.

The integrated GPU on Tegra 4 is great for saving power, but does not have enough performance for a console connected to the mains. Performance wise, it is obliterated by a current A10 CPU from AMD. This is the reason Nvidia lost this generations (Nintendo, Sony), and possibly XBOX-720 design wins. The final Xbox/Playstation consoles will probably use a variant of an A10 successor chip, though the current A10 has been used in early PS4 developer versions."

That sounds a bit more like conjecture rather than fact.</Msg><Username>lrkbik4</Username><Timestamp>1360780330993</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-13 13:32:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360780376999-62</Id><Topic><Title>Do You Think NVDA is a BUY, SELL, or HOLD?</Title><Username>missionmildred</Username><Timestamp>1360080660065</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 11:11:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ok cool.

You just claimed its a mobile part right and its not fair to compare it to an A10 right? So why didn't Nvidia know that? The console makers knew it which is why that reportedly passed on adding a part in over its head, and sent Tegra 4 walking, right? A 32 bit Tegra 4 couldn't hold a candle to the current 64 bit console parts so forget the NEW stuff. Nvidia must have been desperate to find anyone to buy Tegra 4, failing that its off to play with itself made SHIELD toy. imho</Msg><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1360781221507</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-13 13:47:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360782068560-64</Id><Topic><Title>Apple has $42.40 Cash Per Share (mrq), Nvidiia has $5.50 Cash Per Share (mrq)!</Title><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1360288104528</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-07 20:48:24 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>xc3155 is the most stupid guy in investment world.

Analysts were expecting revenue of $1.102 billion for the quarter ended in January and $1.067 billion for the quarter ending in April, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. AMD's revenue forecast is about $1.056 billion. Once the PS4, Xbox 720 and the Wii U revenue kicks into high gear, AMD will start doing Much better. If you look at AMD, you will see that AMD was in only 30 million PC's in 2012. Gaming consoles for 2013 are estimated at over 37 million and over 44 million for 2014. These estimates are not counting China lifting the ban on game consoles. I am not that good at math, but even I know that 30 million PC units VS 44 million game consoles spels a large increase in revenue for AMD.</Msg><Username>whysolow2000</Username><Timestamp>1360792333782</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-13 16:52:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360792402109-116</Id><Title>LinkedIN guided down and wall st. upped to Strong BUY.</Title><Msg>Nvda needs to play ball with wall st. crooks.</Msg><Username>avb911t</Username><Timestamp>1360792402109</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-13 16:53:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360792544421-117</Id><Topic><Title>$100M 4Q Share Buyback and Dividend + additional $300M Cash Gain</Title><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1360791694058</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-13 16:41:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>But are you?</Msg><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1360792544421</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-13 16:55:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360792893943-118</Id><Title>JUNK JUNK JUNK, DOWN HUGE TOMORROW HUGE! 10% at least</Title><Msg>WHAT JUNK.

It’s a bit of a Hail Mary pass for HP, which has fallen years behind its rivals in the mobile space. It’s also a big win for Google, which adds another powerful partner to the Android ecosystem. HP’s first Android device will be a high-end tablet that is powered by NVIDIA’s Tegra 4 chip, and it could be announced soon, according to two sources familiar with the matter (the sources spoke on the condition that they not be named because they are not authorized to discuss unreleased products). The tablet has been in the works since before Thanksgiving and sources say it could be one of the first tablets to ship with the Tegra 4. NVIDIA’s latest mobile chip was just announced during the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in January and it features some impressive specs, but we have not seen many devices adopt it yet. NVIDIA’s own Project Shield gaming system is slated to debut Tegra 4 in the second quarter of 2013, while partners Toshiba and VIZIO are also reported to be working on Tegra 4 tablets. Sources also say that HP is currently exploring the launch of an Android-powered smartphone, but recent comments from CEO Meg Whitman indicate HP will not offer a mobile phone this year. HP declined to comment on its plans, but the news of such a tablet shouldn’t come as a big surprise. HP has been toying with Android devices since 2010, and some might remember the mysterious TouchPads that shipped with Android installed instead of webOS. Most recently, HP has teamed up with Google and released its own Chromebook. readwriteDOTcom/2013/02/13/hp-to-adopt-android-for-upcoming-mobile-devices</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1360795530298</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-13 17:45:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360795654828-163</Id><Topic><Title>AMD even had more revenue than nvidia</Title><Username>golongandstrong</Username><Timestamp>1360791354612</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-13 16:35:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Share price will drop in the single digits within the next month.

Sales in the current quarter, which ends in April, will be about $940 million, plus or minus 2 percent, Santa Clara, California-based Nvidia said today in a statement. That compares with an average analyst projection of $1.07 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg."

The Op Ex increase to $430M / Qtr cannot be explained by staff additions. What else is going on? According to Nvidia - there is no market for standalone LTE Modem. How can you get away with saying BS like that? See BRCM releasing its first LTE Modem yesterday. Majority of the market today exists as Standalone market. If you cannot prove yourself and establish in the standalone market then forget about vendors trusting you in an integrated, bundled solution. Nvidia just doesn't get telecom business and is destined to struggle in this market.</Msg><Username>o.investor</Username><Timestamp>1360796939384</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-13 18:08:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360797065311-189</Id><Topic><Title>"Nvidia Forecasts Sales That Fall Short of Analysts’ Predictions"</Title><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1360795994750</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-13 17:53:14 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nvidia is lower AH than on Dec. 31, 2012.

Hopefully it's enough of a step forward that it's got at least 6-9 months of staying power before becoming outdated by next generation SOCs from the competition.

And they stated very clearly that this quarter's guidance is based on the traditional PC industry affecting GPU sales (discrete) with the sales of Tegra 4 ahead of where Tegra 3 was about the same time last year. I think guidance was only 'rough' with regards to their market tied to x86 desktops and laptops. I guess we'll have to disagree on this point because you are off-base on how Tegra 4 is doing imo. I think your expectations for the Tegra 4 launch's timing is misguided. And btw, the push back on the 'rumor' about the Nexus 7 design loss is getting louder as of today.</Msg><Username>roundhouse_c</Username><Timestamp>1360801722132</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-13 19:28:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360801733252-236</Id><Topic><Title>Y should this POOS go down tomorrow?

If they're ship Tegra 4 in Q2 that places new devices coming to market at the end of Q2, at the earliest, but more likely Q3. That leaves them with at least a full quarter of not having a high-end SOC to actually ship into the market. That's disappointing to me. And obviously they wouldn't have planned to have such a delay between Tegra 4 and the end of life of Tegra 3--so I am concluding the rumors about a manufacturing delay and having to re-spin the Tegra 4s have credibility. And I'd actually disagree on the GPU business--the guidance there was actually inline or slightly better than I think most analysts and investors were expecting. Definitely slightly better than my personal expectations--I just thought Tegra 4 would be shipping by the end of Q1 and coming to market in commercially available products in Q2. Evidently that was too optimistic, I don't dispute that. $540M for the year was right inline with what they guided originally -- but can you honestly say you didn't expect them to beat that original estimate once they got the Nexus 7 and Surface RT wins? I definitely thought they would... considering that the $540M guidance was released before they had those wins.</Msg><Username>joshpritchard</Username><Timestamp>1360802349039</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-13 19:39:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360802489040-238</Id><Topic><Title>Y should this POOS go down tomorrow?

The last thing I read was the Fudzilla article from the 11th that said they heard from their sources that QCOM did indeed win the spot, but it wasn't due to pricing or LTE integration, just that Tegra 4 wasn't going to be ready in time.

I really don't have the time to keep posting in response to someone that is repeating the same thing here as in their articles at SA and elsewhere. I actually have another profession to maintain. I'll just say Nvidia has been better at executing their roadmap then the competition imo (and they are more transparent with their roadmap(s) and their adjustments) and that if you just read through the articles today, there were at least two more articles questioning the validity of the Nexus 7 loss at this point. In any case Josh, I'm not nearly as worried as you seem to be after this current earnings and outlook. IMO, I think Nvidia is trying to be conservative with their outlook quarter to quarter now in many ways like Apple has done to ensure a beat every quarter . . that pattern has been in place for awhile.</Msg><Username>roundhouse_c</Username><Timestamp>1360803307850</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-13 19:55:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360803362166-243</Id><Topic><Title>Y should this POOS go down tomorrow?

It isn't shipping until Q2. Planned or unplanned, this feels like a strategy that's leaving money on the table and giving up at least part of the momentum that they invested so heavily in building. Their technology is very competitive -- as far as I can tell, it's even market-leading -- but it can't translate to revenue until it's actually available. Design wins are the best proxy for measuring demand, but they're NOT sales -- so the reality is a significant Q/Q decline for Q2, and an opportunity for competitors to bang the drum with PR saying that Nvidia doesn't have anything competitive in the market (e.g. Qualcomm's CMO's comments the other day). 2) Icera modems will no longer be targeted at the [waning] discrete modem market; they'll only be sold with Tegras as a kit. If NVDA management is correct and the discrete modem is disappearing, this is probably the right strategic choice, but it's nonetheless a change from previous guidance by the company (see Q3 and Q2 earnings transcripts), and even felt inconsistent with their own commentary on today's call about the discrete modem having a TAM of 150M units. One of the analysts challenged them on this directly and I doubt he found the answer he received to be adequate. They're now saying they're not even going to try to target what is still a large chunk of the TAM they quoted; it would have been more satisfying if they would at least quantify the market that they believe Tegra 4 will actually be able to service during its lifetime. 3) Management language softened to saying they "will be in a position" -- not that they ARE in a position -- to "engage" the SOC-with-integrated-modem market this year, then proceeded to explain, more firmly than before, that integrated connectivity is going to be make or break for Tegra SOCs. Put those together and the company is saying they'll soon be in a position to "engage" a market with what they've concluded are the minimal requirements to compete, after several years and billions in investment "engaging" approximately the same market. Not exactly the most confident language. Still, they now have $3.7B in cash, leaving an enterprise value of around $4B with trailing twelve month free cash flows from operations of $640M. They pay a 2.4-2.5% dividend. Guidance for operating expenses are up, but the company expects "revenue leverage" in the second half of the year--so depending on how much you trust management's loose guidance, there's arguably good reason to believe their FCFO won't dip much, if at all (enough "revenue leverage" could mean it actually grows!). That leaves an attractively valued GPU business with what I'm considering an essentially free option on their Tegra/integrated modem business. Overall, I think the Q2 guidance was disappointing, but I think the stock has already been priced for the disappointment.</Msg><Username>joshpritchard</Username><Timestamp>1360806813136</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-13 20:53:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360806817389-258</Id><Title>Nvidia’s Huang Sees Wireless Chips Helping ‘Tegra’ Sales Going Forward</Title><Msg>Nvidia’s Huang Sees Wireless Chips Helping ‘Tegra’ Sales Going Forward . Email Print smaller Larger By Tiernan Ray Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jen-Hsun Huang was kind enough to speak with me this evening following the company’s conference call with analysts to discuss fiscal Q4 results that featured better-than-expected earnings per share, though the revenue view for this current quarter was a bit lighter than the Street had been modeling. The company this quarter started a new reporting format, separating into two segments what it views as its principal product lines: graphics processing units (GPU) such as its “Tesla” line, and its “Tegra” application processor for smartphones and tablets. The details of the new reporting structure can be seen in Q4′s commentary by CFO Karen Burns. GPU revenue of $832.5 million in Q4 was up 7%, year over year, while Tegra revenue of $208 million was up 90%, year over year. On the call, Huang told analysts the company was holding off on giving any forecast for the year for Tegra revenue, something analysts who listened expressed an interest in. Huang said the company was reviewing various factors for the year, and anyway he wasn’t sure if it was worth forecasting Tegra: I think we haven’t decided yet whether to guide the full year or not. At the moment we decided to guide a quarter out and to tell you the truth I am not sure how helpful it was to all of you that we guided the whole year, and so I think that at the moment we are still thinking through it but some of the comments that you heard related in Rob’s comments were that specific to Tegra, at this point we have more design wins than we had at this point with Tegra 3. I asked Huang during our conversation whether he thinks the company’s forthcoming “Icera” baseband chip, which handles the wireless functions of a phone, will help sell more Tegra units. I pointed out that for the most expensive smartphones, phone makers have tended to want to choose and purchase the baseband chip separately from the application processor. “Absolutely,” said Huang, regarding whether Icera will help sell units of Tegra. “I think the market is already in the process of changing”: There’s a segment of the marketplace where connectivity is not needed. But going forward, the largest TAM [total addressable market] is going to be in the LTE-connected device market. The baseband has changed from being a separate part. Nearly all our opportunities have been where LTE not required. When we are in situations where LTE is required, it’s harder for us to compete for that business because competition has had the edge in that.” He was referring, of course, to the dominant position in baseband sales of Qualcomm (QCOM). Huang had said on the call that in large part, the outlook for this quarter’s revenue reflected the ongoing weakness in the PC business: Our GPU business will be down very much in line with the PC industry and as you know, Intel (INTC), AMD (AMD), and other companies have already disclosed. During our conversation, then, I asked Huang why he sees his GPU sales being affected by the PC market’s broader weakness, given that his sales tend to come from the higher end of the PC market, where gamers sustain demand for performance products of the kind Nvidia provides. “Well,” said Huang, “there’s guidance, which is one thing, and then there’s what one delivers, and as you know, they’re not exactly the same thing.” “We should guide to a number that we have a fairly high certainty of reaching.” Then he added, “But the dynamics are right for us, the rise of massively multiplayer, and free to play are growing, and we have these new growth opportunities” such as the Icera baseband business. “Whatever happy results end up coming our way, we’ll be happy to have them.” Nvidia shares are down 17 cents, or 1.4%, at $12.20. ________________________________________________________________________________ CLASSIC---I love it “Well,” said Huang, “there’s guidance, which is one thing, and then there’s what one delivers, and as you know, they’re not exactly the same thing.” “We should guide to a number that we have a fairly high certainty of reaching.”</Msg><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1360806817389</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-13 20:53:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360807118799-259</Id><Title>Never ever ever ever ever ever ever HOLD THROUGH earnings.

If NVDA management is correct and the discrete modem is disappearing, this is probably the right strategic choice, but it's nonetheless a change from previous guidance by the company (see Q3 and Q2 earnings transcripts), and even felt inconsistent with their own commentary on today's call about the discrete modem having a TAM of 150M units. One of the analysts challenged them on this directly and I doubt he found the answer he received to be adequate. They're now saying they're not even going to try to target what is still a large chunk of the TAM they quoted; it would have been more satisfying if they would at least quantify the market that they believe Tegra 4 will actually be able to service during its lifetime." It was an analyst asking about how much extra in revenue they should expect Nvidia to earn from Icera modems...$100M or $150M. Can you give us a ball park. Nvidia replied that they only sell bundled so they can't break it out. Nobody mentioned 150M units. In fact Jensen said they have done great selling into applications without the need for LTE but when the customer wants LTE he wants the application processor and the baseband bundled from the same supplier. I assume it's a price issue. Therefore they aren't planning on selling the Tegra 4 alone. Doesn't sound good for Baseband suppliers only.

He definitely said 150M units was the TAM for something when giving an answer about Icera, but I guess I'll check out the transcripts if you think I might have heard it wrong. And you missed the point about only selling the Icera modems in kits--I'm talking about them now changing their messaging saying they won't be selling discrete modems (i.e. Icera i500 as a standalone product). Previously they talked about doing just that with the 400 series, and how the discrete modem market would be a natural first step before selling Tegra SOCs with integrated modems, as the technology matured. Qualcomm does sell SOCs with integrated modems AND standalone modems... which is what Nvidia had said they were going to in previous guidance. That's the change I in messaging about Icera that I was honing in on as a disappointing change; particularly disappointing since it was so casually thrown out there that apparently many people listening missed it.</Msg><Username>joshpritchard</Username><Timestamp>1360812335865</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-13 22:25:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360813406579-294</Id><Title>Barrons interview: Huang sees wireless chips helping Tegra sales going forward</Title><Msg>Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jen-Hsun Huang was kind enough to speak with me this evening following the company’s conference call with analysts to discuss fiscal Q4 results that featured better-than-expected earnings per share, though the revenue view for this current quarter was a bit lighter than the Street had been modeling. The company this quarter started a new reporting format, separating into two segments what it views as its principal product lines: graphics processing units (GPU) such as its “Tesla” line, and its “Tegra” application processor for smartphones and tablets. The details of the new reporting structure can be seen in Q4′s commentary by CFO Karen Burns. GPU revenue of $832.5 million in Q4 was up 7%, year over year, while Tegra revenue of $208 million was up 90%, year over year. On the call, Huang told analysts the company was holding off on giving any forecast for the year for Tegra revenue, something analysts who listened expressed an interest in. Huang said the company was reviewing various factors for the year, and anyway he wasn’t sure if it was worth forecasting Tegra: I think we haven’t decided yet whether to guide the full year or not. At the moment we decided to guide a quarter out and to tell you the truth I am not sure how helpful it was to all of you that we guided the whole year, and so I think that at the moment we are still thinking through it but some of the comments that you heard related in Rob’s comments were that specific to Tegra, at this point we have more design wins than we had at this point with Tegra 3. I asked Huang during our conversation whether he thinks the company’s forthcoming “Icera” baseband chip, which handles the wireless functions of a phone, will help sell more Tegra units. I pointed out that for the most expensive smartphones, phone makers have tended to want to choose and purchase the baseband chip separately from the application processor. “Absolutely,” said Huang, regarding whether Icera will help sell units of Tegra. “I think the market is already in the process of changing”: There’s a segment of the marketplace where connectivity is not needed. But going forward, the largest TAM [total addressable market] is going to be in the LTE-connected device market. The baseband has changed from being a separate part. Nearly all our opportunities have been where LTE not required. When we are in situations where LTE is required, it’s harder for us to compete for that business because competition has had the edge in that.” He was referring, of course, to the dominant position in baseband sales of Qualcomm (QCOM). Huang had said on the call that in large part, the outlook for this quarter’s revenue reflected the ongoing weakness in the PC business: Our GPU business will be down very much in line with the PC industry and as you know, Intel (INTC), AMD (AMD), and other companies have already disclosed. During our conversation, then, I asked Huang why he sees his GPU sales being affected by the PC market’s broader weakness, given that his sales tend to come from the higher end of the PC market, where gamers sustain demand for performance products of the kind Nvidia provides. “Well,” said Huang, “there’s guidance, which is one thing, and then there’s what one delivers, and as you know, they’re not exactly the same thing.” “We should guide to a number that we have a fairly high certainty of reaching.” Then he added, “But the dynamics are right for us, the rise of massively multiplayer, and free to play are growing, and we have these new growth opportunities” such as the Icera baseband business. “Whatever happy results end up coming our way, we’ll be happy to have them.”</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1360813406579</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-13 22:43:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360813564270-295</Id><Topic><Title>disappointing guidance</Title><Username>joshpritchard</Username><Timestamp>1360806813136</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-13 20:53:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think Huang was explicit in implying that NV's guidance is conservative.

Now the problem is that Nvidia had stated that Icera acquisition would be accretive to earnings in 2012. That was obviously bogus or, the products from Icera just didn't cut it. I would have really wanted Icera acquisition to be successful but unfortunately that doesn't seem likely. Nvidia has become a highly speculative play all of a sudden. Its really sad... QCOM is projecting a 25% Y/Y growth and they have a $6B Qtr revenue run-rate.</Msg><Username>o.investor</Username><Timestamp>1360813777696</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-13 22:49:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360813989297-299</Id><Title>That was 50% earnings growth year over year.

Check the transcripts by all means, but what I heard was this loud and clear: We get the orders where LTE is not needed and we don't when it is because we get squeezed on the price by bundling from a competitor...i.e QCOM. Therefore we are playing the game this way....You want Tegra 4...here it is but you have to take our modem too if it for an LTE application Remember the bundling Intel did with the Atom chips in the netbook days that lead to lawsuits. Same thing. He doesn't want to go down that road again and crash margins down into the 40's Case in point the gross margin stays at 53% when the top line revenue drops 14% next quarter. So it's a game of price negotiation. Plus for the 4th quarter in a row I heard tablets, tablets, tablets...not phones. Gartner even said phone sales are dropping fast. After all when you think about, they are just phones. I can get a really decent quad core processing phone for $230 on Amazon unlocked for gosh sakes. I did like the breakout of the Intel royalty away from GPUs. When the 10Q comes out we will see the operating income for the GPU business unit. I'ved tried to calculate it without the Intel Royalty stream but I am not a CPA. The closest I got is it is adding $06 / quarter in earnings but will see. But take heart---Nvidia is active in the market buying back shares, pays dividends, and growth and income funds are their too. Besides.....this Gaming thing has real legs in my opinion. All the MoMo investors will be looking around for the next big thing now that Apple has gone off the radar along with phones and we do have the console launches this year along with a multiple AAA games. I even heard CNBC talking about Electronic Arts yesterday. Perhaps they will find Nvidia Grid and the Shield as the next big thing. Who knows. In the meantime love dividend and the over $6 in cash. Hope they got Goldman or JPM doing the buybacks because those traders never lose...LOL</Msg><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1360814080709</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-13 22:54:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360814694679-301</Id><Title>HP Android Tegra 4 tablets on the horizon</Title><Msg>Hewlett-Packard is reported to have plans to enter the Android tablet market by joining hands with Google and creating an tablet, according to a report by ReadWrite. The tablet will have an NVIDIA Tegra 4 chip, which was announced during the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas in January. Tegra 4 is one of the first quad-core chips based on the more modern ARM Cortex-A15 design which would make the tablet quite powerful. HP already offers a Windows 8 tablet but does not have plans to create tablets with Windows RT. The move with Google should be beneficial for the company, which has come behind HTC, Motorola, Apple in the mobile computing race. The move will also help Google with getting a even larger footing in the Personal Computer area. HP is one of the largest computer maker in the world. HP’s recent history in the mobile computing world has not fared well. HP acquired Palm in 2010 at a cost of $1.2 billion but had to stop its mobile products unit after failures. HP however still leads the market in Personal Computers, with sales better then Lenovo, according to Canalys. We will have to wait for official word from HP on this matter, as HP declined to comment on plans.

WHile NV's parts are sold into the high end segment, Huang would rather offer the most conservative numbers, rather than oounting the chicken before they are hatched 2) Seasonality always calling for a significant decline going from Q3 (when components were shipped for the holiday sales) to Q4 (market calming down but still robust due to Lunar New Year buying in emerging markets). Q1 is usually the weakest one for up stream component suppliers. I just looked up some historical numbers: NVIDIA's revenue for quarter ending Jan 2012 (a year ago) was $924 million - a huge step-down from the previous quarter. It was not considered too unusual. 3) Last but not least important: Huang said that device vendors winded down their Tegra 3 orders ahead of Tegra 4's release. If you noticed, there was always a sales gap right before Apple introduced its next-gen devices - be it the ipad or the iphone. The next 2 quarters will involve the release of some revolutionary product such as Project Shield. It is prudent (which I appreciate) for NV management to give conservative guidance - numbers that they can deliver with a high level of confidence. Please read my post re. Huang's interview with Baroons.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1360815558154</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-13 23:19:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360815751340-305</Id><Title>Tegra numbers</Title><Msg>I am a bit confused about the Tegra numbers.

I think the focus of his comments really being on what he understands to being the real revenue stream from Tegra 4 coming in Q2 now is reflected in that slip. I think Jen's comments in the transcript show where he is being conservative and clearly signalling that Q1 can easily go higher, because the reason for the 'miss' is the downturn in everything tied to discrete at this time. We really don't have certainty about the launch of Tegra 4 yet, and Jen clearly hinted that certain announcements will be made 'soon' involving Tegra 4 which seems to be pointing to MWC to me.</Msg><Username>roundhouse_c</Username><Timestamp>1360816576316</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-13 23:36:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360816909240-309</Id><Topic><Title>Profit will be minimal in Q1...</Title><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1360808828280</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-13 21:27:08 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ashraf, I disagree about Q1, I don't think that is the right read on the guidance.
