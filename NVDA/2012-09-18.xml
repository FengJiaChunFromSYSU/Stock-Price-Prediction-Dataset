Mentioned Grand Era based on Tegra</Title><Msg>ZTE Corp, the world's fourth-largest mobile phone manufacturer by shipments, aims to increase the number of smartphones it produces this year to 35 [ˌmænjəˈfæktʃərər] manufacturer million, according to a company executive. 制造商; 制造厂; 厂主 n. But for all types of mobile phones, ZTE is likely to ship about the same number in 2012 as it had last year, He 下载桌面版 必应词典 Shiyou, executive vice-president of ZTE, said at a Beijing news conference on Monday. "We will secure our position as the world's No 4 mobile phone manufacturer." According to the market research firm IDC, ZTE sold 66.1 million mobile phones in 2011, securing a 4.3 percent share of the global market that year. He said he expects ZTE to ship between 30 million and 35 million smartphones by the end of the year. In the first six months of 2012, ZTE shipped more than 13 million of the devices, an achievement He described as being "right on track". The company also hopes to receive a further boost in the second half of 2012 with the release of its quad-core, ultra-thin Grand Era smartphone. ZTE officially introduced the device in Beijing on Monday. "Grand Era exhibits the stature that ZTE has in the manufacture of advanced, high-end smartphones," He said. "However, ZTE will not stay at this level. The company needs to move on." In an interview in February, He expressed ZTE's ambition to challenge Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd in the advanced smartphone industry. He also said ZTE is developing its own mobile operating system. Noting that Apple and Samsung have sued each other over alleged patent infringements, He said ZTE will not put all of its smartphone eggs into one basket. "We will avoid relying too greatly on one single operating system," he said. For the first time in its history, ZTE has become the world's fifth-biggest maker of smartphones, reaching that milestone in the second quarter of the year, according to an IDC report released in July. ZTE shipped 8 million smartphones during that period, giving it a 5.2 percent share of the market for those devices. That put it just behind its Taiwanese rival HTC Corp, which had an 8.8 percent share, and the Finnish phone giant Nokia Corp, which had a 10.2 percent share. The chief source of ZTE's gains has been its shipments of inexpensive, entry-level smartphones in the Chinese mainland, where the company is based, the report said. The IDC report also said the company has been selling a larger number of smartphones in other countries, particularly in the United States, "where its smartphones can be found under other brands". Neil Mawston, an analyst with Strategy Analytics, said ZTE is moving quickly into the entry-level and mid-range smartphone business. "The United States represents the world's largest pool of mobile phone profits," he said. "Chinese manufacturers will need to play a bigger role there to become more profitable."</Msg><Username>chrisssable</Username><Timestamp>1347966430325</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 07:07:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347967655356-12</Id><Topic><Title>Where is the amdshortisstupid guy?</Title><Username>chrisssable</Username><Timestamp>1347933558352</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 21:59:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I heard he moved to Canada and moved into the same trailer park that the POS Royderelict lives in.</Msg><Username>chitownbarber22</Username><Timestamp>1347967655356</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 07:27:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347969077352-13</Id><Topic><Title>Where is the amdshortisstupid guy?</Title><Username>chrisssable</Username><Timestamp>1347933558352</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 21:59:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How much money you lose being long NVDA?

You can do real work conveniently with Surface. It's preinstalled with office. It has slick keyboard! U can't do work with other tablets. Not even with iPad. Also Microsoft is working with studio to make Surface a great gaming platform.

If the Win8 x86 tablets cost a even buck more than a capable laptop, you can forgetta 'bout the Enterprise trade, boys. They have professional purchasing agents, don't u know. Who's job it is to place those forklift sized orders. Laptops are by definition x86 capable, can run all of the millions of Windows apps right out of the box, and are much more durable than tablets. So why pay more? Makes no sense at all. Maybe nvidia/icera can catch a piece of the laptop cheap radio dongle business? At best. Regarding Win RT -- talk about being LATE to the mobile OS game! There's too many flavors already -- and most are free. As in Gratis. $600 bucks for a Win RT tablet = Dead on Arrival in today's market. Win 8 looks like a scratch, boys. Both versions. Once again Jen his hitched his wagon to a fad going Nowhere. .</Msg><Username>it_is_best</Username><Timestamp>1348019407664</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 21:50:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348019458382-41</Id><Topic><Title>field is wide open for a $350 10" Android, who will take that challenge</Title><Username>whosunw</Username><Timestamp>1348013926570</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 20:18:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why do you bother to post on this board..?
