There are many flavors of 28nm technology even at TSMC. For Samsung 28nm - they have multiple 28nm process problems - a big part of it is - it's not stable and can be a contributing factor to excessive leaky transistors. Their 28nm process may not have a good leakage vs performance characteristics to start with. And the Exyhosed 5 certainly have a lot more transistors and die area then T4 making the power situation worse. Besides the power scheme of the T4 is a 2nd generation and appears a lot more effective than E5. So E5 mwith a dumb down GPU may appear in a tablet instead.</Msg><Username>mark1289b</Username><Timestamp>1361769148339</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 00:12:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361769196816-2</Id><Topic><Title>Why Get Your Specs From The Tech Press When You Can Go To The Source!</Title><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1361756768814</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-24 20:46:08 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Idon't know. I guess I'm kinda old school. I can go to Ti's website and get specs, package sizes, data sheets. Same with Intel and AMD especially back in the days of the benchmark wars. Microchip, Atmel, On Semi everythinbg is available on the website. Same with Nvidia but when I go the Qualcomm website all I can find is the S600 doesn't have a modem and the S800 when it arrives will have an integrated modem. Plus I can't find datasheets or package sizes for any Qualcomm part. Perhaps only customers get that info. Strange if the Chief Marketing Officer says "Snapdragon cleans Tegra 4 clock". I would have thought he have all the data in the world up on the website to prove it.

The announced "octo-core" part will have four A15+A7 paired cores. This is apparently an integrated set that ARM licenses as a pair. That suggests that they may be tightly coupled in hardware, rather than two very different CPU cores merely adjacent on the die. My guess is that this part will be marketed under a new name to distinguish it from the existing Exynos 5.</Msg><Username>watergatefive</Username><Timestamp>1361799912119</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 08:45:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361800322122-17</Id><Title>et tu Asus</Title><Msg>why the heck is Asus going with Snapdragon 600?

Offering a more powerful GPU, four times the memory and nearly eight times the memory bandwidth of the RG220, the R5000 will allow us to deploy remote systems for our more advanced classes and configure multimonitor set ups our students will eventually encounter in the workplace." ___ Again, I have no idea if this is actually competitive with NVDA Grid in performance, but it seems safe assume this product, or some closely-related variant, is being pitched to Sony to go along with the AMD GPU/CPUs in the upcoming PS4s.</Msg><Username>joshpritchard</Username><Timestamp>1361807977267</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 10:59:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361808088916-36</Id><Topic><Title>Tegra 4i SoC is also built on TSMC's 28 HPM process</Title><Username>joshpritchard</Username><Timestamp>1361804426405</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 10:00:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Im with you. I just don't see the appeal of QCOM anymore, seeing as how NVDA can (or will be able to in a short time) match QCOM in pretty much every aspect of mobile. Granted, QCOM may be able to undercut NVDA on price, which means alot, after the benchmarks were released on Tegra 4, and by most accounts, T4i will also out-perform Snapdragon, I cant understand why we aren't seeing more wins for NVDA. Long term, I think NVDA is in a much better position for growth than QCOM, with T4, T4i, Shield, Grid, and eventually Denver. I'm sitting on roughly 10K shares, so I'm content on collecting the dividend while I wait for positive movement. In all, I think NVDA is a good long term investment with groth opportunity, decent dividend, and a robust buy back program. Good luck to all longs.</Msg><Username>delano_00</Username><Timestamp>1361808088916</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 11:01:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361808258732-37</Id><Topic><Title>NVIDIA Corporation featured on MAD MONEY!</Title><Username>browndavid977</Username><Timestamp>1361452514381</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 08:15:14 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>great report</Msg><Username>edwardmiller957</Username><Timestamp>1361808258732</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 11:04:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361808407085-38</Id><Topic><Title>Tegra 4i SoC is also built on TSMC's 28 HPM process</Title><Username>joshpritchard</Username><Timestamp>1361804426405</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 10:00:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"QCOM may be able to undercut NVDA on price," Tegra 4 is only 80 sq mm... gonna be hard to beat such a small die on price...</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1361808407085</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 11:06:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361808537394-39</Id><Topic><Title>Tegra 4i SoC is also built on TSMC's 28 HPM process</Title><Username>joshpritchard</Username><Timestamp>1361804426405</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 10:00:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It shouldn't be too long...Nvidia announced they have partnered with D2 technologies for Voice over LTE software stack.

The device, which still features the same 5.7-inch 720p display, 13-megapixel rear camera and 3,200mAh battery, is nearly indistinguishable from the other variants we've seen. But for this go-round, ZTE's added in Dolby Digital Plus Surround for a superior audio experience and an extra GB of RAM. Its external chassis may have remained the same -- plasticky and lightweight -- but the difference in this 8.9mm thick Memo's real-world performance is immediately noticeable. OS actions on the skinned Jelly Bean UI don't just zip, they now quite literally fly -- truly, this device is deserving of the long-deceased "beast" moniker. Although international tradeshow WiFi connections are typically dreadful, we did manage to successfully run the Sunspider benchmark to get a quick taste of its rendering performance. The result? The Grand Memo notched a score of 1,186.7ms -- an unimpressive result when contrasted with the Tegra 4's 499ms (as derived from a reference tablet). As for ZTE's MyFavorite UX layered atop Android 4.1.2, well, we're pleased to say it yields some neat animations. The entire homescreen, including widgets, revolves with a smooth 3D effect that just imbues the handset with a special "feel." It's a shame then that the Memo's encased in a less than premium shell, as it creates a disconnect between the smoking internals and humdrum exterior. But with a newly announced commitment to building its brand (a sentiment popular with Chinese OEMs as of late), this particular Memo is proof positive that ZTE's serious about raising its profile and consumer perception. You won't be seeing this Grand Memo hit US shores anytime soon -- it's a China and Europe-only affair for now. So while you wait (and hold onto hope), check out our video tour after the break.</Msg><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1361816561784</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 13:22:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361816724306-58</Id><Topic><Title>T4 and Q800 were both introduced at the same time</Title><Username>xavigonza</Username><Timestamp>1361814880538</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 12:54:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You are referred to QC announcements at CES re.

You've got Engadget, TheVerge, TechCrunch, etc. all reporting the same thing. So either ZTE made a mistake, or the device actually has an early S800 in it for the demos... but I agree that makes little sense. But it also seems odd that QCOM wouldn't quickly get ZTE to make a correction. I'd guess it's probably actually the S600... but it does seem odd so many sources have hands on videos and are repeating that it's the S800. Especially given the "common knowledge" argument made by ibexx.</Msg><Username>joshpritchard</Username><Timestamp>1361825843609</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 15:57:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361825918974-75</Id><Topic><Title>IMPORTANT REPORT ON NVDA (MUST SEE)</Title><Username>jaredmurray772</Username><Timestamp>1360272322771</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-07 16:25:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>great update.</Msg><Username>crislee598</Username><Timestamp>1361825918974</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 15:58:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361826192643-76</Id><Title>2nd Dividend In Hand</Title><Msg>Many more to come!</Msg><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1361826192643</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 16:03:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361826349260-77</Id><Title>Motley Fool Article was the kiss of death....</Title><Msg>NVDA is probably worth $4 bucks</Msg><Username>wowowowow872</Username><Timestamp>1361826349260</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 16:05:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361826425589-78</Id><Topic><Title>Motley Fool Article was the kiss of death....</Title><Username>wowowowow872</Username><Timestamp>1361826349260</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 16:05:49 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Worth less than net cash huh..

Ibexx can correct me on this but I think the general understanding is that the S600 is just a slight iteration on the S4, so that SunSpider score sounds like it's roughly what would be expected. Of course, SunSpider is a hard benchmark to rely on since it's particularly software-dependent, as you probably already know. I'd have to imagine QCOM marketing is not too happy with ZTE right now.</Msg><Username>joshpritchard</Username><Timestamp>1361828465817</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 16:41:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361829867741-83</Id><Topic><Title>T4 and Q800 were both introduced at the same time</Title><Username>xavigonza</Username><Timestamp>1361814880538</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 12:54:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Look at the benchmark scores for the Samsung octa and you will find the scores are lower than for the S600 powered galaxy s4 and the htc one. the a15 at low clock is a dog.

The wins announced so far are for launches in March.</Msg><Username>roundhouse_c</Username><Timestamp>1361832934231</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 17:55:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361835070129-86</Id><Topic><Title>Sold today and moving on</Title><Username>wowowowow872</Username><Timestamp>1361817294304</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 13:34:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Dividend + promising future is good enough for me to deal with boring for years to come.</Msg><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1361835070129</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 18:31:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361837373796-87</Id><Topic><Title>The market could care less about T4 benchmarks...</Title><Username>mslans</Username><Timestamp>1361805789220</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 10:23:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>but but but... all the pumper boyz all said that Charlie was lying through his teeth.... now I know whom the liars are.</Msg><Username>whosunw</Username><Timestamp>1361837373796</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 19:09:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361839724519-88</Id><Topic><Title>The market could care less about T4 benchmarks...</Title><Username>mslans</Username><Timestamp>1361805789220</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 10:23:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Tech markets don't usually case much about $$$ in the short term. In the short term, good benchmarks are helpful because they speak to the likelihood of future design wins. Design wins are even more helpful, because they speak of future $$$. These benches are good because they dismiss at least part of the rumor mill that said NVDA chips were underperformers. Being an underdog with underperforming chips is hopeless. Being an underdog with great chips is something that you can build on. For stock pickers, it is something that you can speculate on.</Msg><Username>pjcrocker</Username><Timestamp>1361839724519</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 19:48:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361840997678-89</Id><Title>Has Nvidia decided to dump this tegra nonsense...</Title><Msg>Qualcomm has cornered the smartphone market.
