LTENOW I'm up 10% from where I bought this time. Liked the idea of the dividend and the active share buyback along with all the technology. Always thought Nvidia was way too much of a trader option player type stock, but that looks like it's waning. To me it's just a nice growth and income stock with some serious long term potential with an Un Godly amount of cash on the books $6.01 a share.. Excellent presentation at Wedbush. It's worth the time to listen and peruse the Power Point. They got the VP of IR running around the country showing the change. Still have too much hype, but at least Jensen doesn't have to carry all the load like he use too. Institutional ownership is changing too and is up pretty substantially. Note: If you like the Hype be sure and watch Jensen March 19th at the GTC conference keynote....but there is big change this time. Immediately after his address he will make a financial presentation to the analysts and web streaming to the public I hope too. Not sure if you have to be invited. it was unclear in the Wedbush presentation. If they don't put something up soon I expect I will email the VP of Investor relations and ask for the an invite so I can watch.</Msg><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1362860815846</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-09 15:26:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362860823257-22</Id><Topic><Title>IN DEPTH NVDA Analyst Report.</Title><Username>sherrie.morris</Username><Timestamp>1362325153713</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-03 10:39:13 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Report Abuse.....scam</Msg><Username>aburneer</Username><Timestamp>1362860823257</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-09 15:27:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362862038856-23</Id><Topic><Title>MISSION X; XOLO to annouce the fastest phone on March 14th</Title><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1362854139109</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-09 13:35:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This phone has not been annouced so would not be on their phone list yet androidauthorityDOTcom/lenovo-k900-intel-clover-trail-plus-benchmark-161440/ The K900 has been unveiled at CES in Las Vegas, where we got to take Lenovo’s gorgeous device for a quick spin. Now, the Clover Trail+ equipped device has made an appearance at Mobile World Congress, and we were curious to see how Intel’s first dual-core mobile chip is doing in the benchmarks. The device we got to try was a pre-production model, so it’s possible that the software wasn’t fully optimized, which may explain why the UI occasionally felt sluggish. We installed v3.1.1 of the AnTuTu synthetic benchmark, which tests memory performance, CPU performance, and graphics, and proceeded to run it on the sleek K900. You can see the process and the results in the video below. As you can see, the 2.0GHz Clover Trail+ processor that powers the Lenovo K900 is quite a beast. The device managed an impressive 25,138, which is ahead of the quad-core Snapdragon 600, which just made its debut on the HTC One and the Optimus G Pro. The Qualcomm chip managed a very good 22,678 in an earlier test.

That's helpful. If Apple did go with Intel, Intel could say goodbye to 60% gross margins forever. Might be able to hold 45% to 50%. But I suspect they would never do that so it's moot. But G/S putting a sell on Intel is serious and based on my experience with other semi's that Goldman put a sell on shareholders of Intel should just sell now or plan on waiting a very long time. GS will stay with the sell and short or do what ever to hit their sell target. Then when they hit their target, they will just lift back to neutral and the stock will slowly rise back up to where it was. Did Goldman give a reason and a price targart? I'm smelling an opportunity down the road.</Msg><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1362866878142</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-09 17:07:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362868081466-28</Id><Topic><Title>MISSION X; XOLO to annouce the fastest phone on March 14th</Title><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1362854139109</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-09 13:35:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Intel's profit margins will be driven downward by a myriad of factors: --Ipad Mini cannibalizing regular Ipad to a significant extent --the imminent release if a low-price iphone --Business model changing - going after the foundry business which is inherently lower in margin and heavy in capital outlays --uncertainties associated with the change of guard - Otellini leaving and an unproven successor coming in --lower margin for mobile chips in general, assuming that Intel will be successfully break in the communication space in a marginal way ("marginal" is the term a recent WSJ article used in describing Intel's mobile effort) The list goes on - it definitely looks like Intel's low-hanging fruits have all been picked.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1362868081466</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-09 17:28:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362868385024-29</Id><Topic><Title>Project Shield will sell for $300-$400</Title><Username>norcalnative_2</Username><Timestamp>1362768059200</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 13:40:59 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>nobody cares what you post</Msg><Username>eir951</Username><Timestamp>1362868385024</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-09 17:33:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362868923648-30</Id><Topic><Title>MISSION X; XOLO to annouce the fastest phone on March 14th</Title><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1362854139109</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-09 13:35:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Every phone chip that Intel says, is one less from tegra.

They lifted the sell to neutral in Dec. of 2012 when the stock hit $30 and it's since popped back to $37. I did find their rating history for Intel. They have had a sell on it for a year or so. Just keep lowering their price target...this time from $20 to $16. Geez $16 is 5.6% dividend. They must really hate the company's prospects. The article I read said it all about but the huge rise in Capex. Who knows...they certainly have $$$ behind them to make it happen. Opportunity...Never Short but a buy at $16-$17 around August might be in the cards.</Msg><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1362869197300</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-09 17:46:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362869525272-32</Id><Title>Will Nvidia's share of the graphics market drop to 10% from 16% by year end.</Title><Msg>That is the question BOYS.

I did notice that the Goldman analyst showed up on Nvidia's Feb conference call for only the 2nd time out of the last 5 calls. Asked about clarification on the Tegra 4 ramp and Opex spending. Thought it was kinda funny but both the VP of investor relations and even Jensen went out of their way to ask whether they had answered his questions and even said will get back with you to make sure! I guess he liked what he heard because he didn't downgrade Nvidia to a sell. He's neutral. I was bracing for a sell with the low guidance, but whatever was said during the conference call and offline placated him. GS is about the only big WS house that puts sells on stocks and people do pay attention to them.</Msg><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1362874102221</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-09 19:08:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362875652416-35</Id><Topic><Title>MISSION X; XOLO to annouce the fastest phone on March 14th</Title><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1362854139109</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-09 13:35:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Loser, #$%$... harassing message board on Saturday night..</Msg><Username>fdigiovanni01</Username><Timestamp>1362875652416</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-09 19:34:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362875696063-36</Id><Title>Project Shield will change the way gaming is done.</Title><Msg>Its so revolutionary, that Nvidia will make billions from it.</Msg><Username>will_amd_yu</Username><Timestamp>1362875696063</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-09 19:34:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
