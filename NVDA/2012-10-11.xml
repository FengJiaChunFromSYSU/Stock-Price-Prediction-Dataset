Will it be worth its $799? I can't say I'm excited about the Yoga 11. A Tegra 3 tablet running Windows RT and priced at $799 definitely wouldn't be my first choice, based purely on specs. The keyboard attachment is appreciated, but whether it justifies this tablet's very high price remains to be seen.

Only a union would have a chance of forcing it in a market only alternative.-- -This is named after a person who had found out years later that she was being unfairly payed. Then a decision came down that she had to bring it up on the first paycheck. How many people know on the first paycheck that they have been subject to pay bias already. This was set to fix that. -Cash For Clunkers - Probably the most successful thing he's done. It greatly helped with clearing excess inventories. With low inventory they had to manufacture more cars, helping to create/maintain more jobs. Plus it helped cut our dependence on foreign oil a little since the trade in was based on the miles per gallon of the cars. One other thing, A lot of the people who bought the cars, where the kind with good credit and only bought the cars because they saw it as an amazing deal. These were mostly people who would pretty much only buy a car if their old one broke down/got to expensive to maintain. And likely many of them today would still have those cars if not for the program. -Don't Ask Don't Tell policy removed - It was policy set to appease people at a time gays were not as accepted. They still have crap to deal with but its much more accepted today. Removing personnel who are completely capable of serving the nation is bad policy. -Bin laden dead - Obama had to give the order to do so. Their was a lot of unknowns. It was an enormously risky decision that payed off big time. He gave the order to send people in. If it failed, people like lets say the republicans, would have not hesitated to hold the whole thing against him. Saying something like he made the wrong decision he should have never sent people in. Think about it. On a side note this argument when applied to Romney is like saying he didn't do the work, he was just the CEO that gave the order to do the work. Health care law - I don't particularly like the Health care law but its a step in the right direction. The reality is Insurance only works if everyone is in it. Without it, the taxpayers and/or the people with insurance would have to pay with the costs passed on to them anyway. May as well be an upfront cost. This law at least make sure something like no more than 20% of the money is the limit for administrative costs. The rest is refunded if they take in more for administrative costs than that. If it is repealed that would increase my hopes of the chances of getting a public option.</Msg><Username>x1x4x1x13</Username><Timestamp>1349946472123</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 05:07:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349954306776-6</Id><Topic><Title>belong in the I told you so column, roflol</Title><Username>whosunw</Username><Timestamp>1349917092930</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 20:58:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ballmer will be forever be noted for taking down the house that Bill built, while Cook says," Thank you Ballmer!"

Or not Comprehend the news? Or both. This is Not about Microsoft licensing their patents. Oh no no no. This is about Google trying to injoin folks from using Motorola's standard-essential patents. Or demanding a ridiculous $4 Billion for their use. If Google/Motorola doesn't get reasonable -- and quick -- the Judge will decide what the nominal fair licensing rate will be. How does this effect nvidia, you ask naively. nvidia's tegra chips Rely on the very existence of the hacker-prone android os. Which is under fire for patent infringement. And has Lost Seventeen (17) different patent infringement cases already. As the noose tightens on Google's android, Google had hoped, at best, to cross-license their crapola patents. This strategy is failing. And failing Badly. In court. So when Apple is finally successful in vaporizing the android os from the face of the planet -- what's nvidia's tegra chip gonna run? Hummm?

I understand that the FOSS article you were trying to spin into a bearish story on NVDA was about Motorola and MSFT, and Florian Mueller's spin was that this indicated that Motorola's IP overall will be ineffective in protecting Android in the platform war vs Apple and MSFT. I get that. Not sure why you pivot to talking about Apple vaporizing Android... but did you see reporting on Schmidt's comments yesterday that Android is now activating 1.3M devices per day (and these are only official Android devices, that run Google services -- so not counting the Fire, small Chinese OEMs that don't run Google services, etc). 1.3M per day, outselling iOS devices more than 4:1, on pace to have 1 BILLION active devices by the end of the year. As far as which devices Tegra will get go into, Windows RT, and Android from any/all OEMs that have already settled with MSFT. Is apple suing Asustek or MSFT? Any chance of winning an injunction on any key Tegra-powered devices? NO?

The .5x multiple on the GPU business assumes that the discrete GPU market is continue to contract, trending towards zero over the medium term. The 1x multiple on the performance computing market assumes that the segment will continue to show flat/anemic growth.

To be short here I think you have to be able to answer "No" confidently to all of those questions.</Msg><Username>thetrade50</Username><Timestamp>1349972940139</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 12:29:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349972952195-32</Id><Topic><Title>12.65 bounce of support many times</Title><Username>jtownzu</Username><Timestamp>1349970861996</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 11:54:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Don't think nvda has determined a bottom yet.

The company previously forecasted third quarter 2012 revenue to decrease 1 percent, plus or minus 3 percent, sequentially. The lower than anticipated preliminary revenue results are primarily due to weaker than expected demand across all product lines caused by the challenging macroeconomic environment. The company now expects third quarter gross margin to be approximately 31 percent; less than the previous expectation of approximately 44 percent primarily due to an inventory write-down of approximately $100 million due to lower anticipated future demand for certain products. Third quarter gross margin was also negatively impacted by weaker than expected demand, which contributed to lower than anticipated average selling prices (ASPs) for the company's Computing Solutions Group products and lower than expected utilization of its back-end manufacturing facilities. Operating expenses for the third quarter are expected to decline approximately 7 percent sequentially as a result of tightly controlled expenses in the quarter. AMD will report third quarter 2012 results after market close on Thursday, October 18, 2012.</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1349989125688</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 16:58:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349989808794-40</Id><Title>NVDA eating AMDs lunch</Title><Msg>And many others</Msg><Username>jtownzu</Username><Timestamp>1349989808794</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 17:10:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349990091882-41</Id><Topic><Title>AMD Announces Preliminary Third Quarter Results - BAD</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1349989125688</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 16:58:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>i like to go to amazon and look at the video card category, sorted by most popular...

EIGHTY PERCENT (80%) of nvidia's graphics chips go into those out-of-fashion PC's</Title><Msg>"NVIDIA (NYSE:NVDA) is the only publicly traded company that focuses exclusively on graphics chips. About 80% of the company’s graphics chips go into PCs, with the rest split between servers, handheld devices, and video game consoles. NVIDIA’s primary competitors are AMD and Intel, and NVIDIA and AMD each focus on building graphics chips for high-end products. NVIDIA's long term growth is most threatened by competitors offering platforms that combine several chips using a central processing unit (CPU), operating system, and graphics processing unit (GPU). As a result, the growth of platforms is a major threat to NVIDIA’s core business. NVIDIA is at a severe disadvantage to competitors AMD and Intel who have been developing an array of different chips for years, making the transition to platforms far more natural for them. NVIDIA sells the vast majority of its chips to companies that make computers. It is dependent on a small number of these companies as NVIDIA's two top customers account for 25% of the company’s revenue, with its largest customer being Asustek (12% of revenue)." Google this: Stock:nvidia (nvda) Wiki Analysis My my my. EIGHTY PERCENT (80%) of the company's graphics chips go into PC's. 80%, boys. As in, eight out of ten end up in PC's. And aren't PC's currently out-of-fashion among astute Wall Street investors? They sure as heck are. What with the global macroeconomic depression, and Apple's Genuine iPads capturing the tablet market for mobile computing. nvda -- Not the place to have your hard-earned cash invested, boys.

Let's say an astute institutional investor has a conviction that the days of the PC are numbered, that the PC will be replaced by those mobile Apple IPad tablets, -- The Fastest Selling Electronic Device in the History of Mankind -- and that the PC will go the way of the Woolly Mammoth. It's not easy to short the entire PC industry, right? 'Cause there are so many companies building them. But shorting nvda -- with 80% of its graphics chips going into PC's -- makes a really nice, simple surrogate for shorting the PC industry. And besides, it pays no dividend -- which the short would need to pay. No wonder the short interest in nvda has been skyrocketing lately.
