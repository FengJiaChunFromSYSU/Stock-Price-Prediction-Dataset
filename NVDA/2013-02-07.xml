The conclusion the pro hybrid is both a tablet and a laptop but does neither well (just as I had predicted).

For starters, he asserts that Nvidia plans to exit the chipset market in 2009. “Our checks confirm that Nvidia has decided to exit the chipset market next year,” he wrote. McConnell notes that chipsets are expected to account for 21% of the company’s revenue in the January 2009 fiscal year; he estimates today come down dramatically to reflect that expected move. Meanwhile, McConnell also says that due to “fallout from defective notebook GPUs,” the company’s share of the notebook market will likely drop below 50% once Intel’s refreshed Montevina platform ships in the second quarter of 2009. McConnell asserts that a negative pre-announcement on results for the fiscal third quarter ended October “appears imminent.” McConnell cut his rating on the stock to Sector Perform from Outperform; he says there is downside in the graphics chip company’s shares to $7. McConnell cut his EPS estimate for FY ’09 to 70 cents, from 78 cents; for FY 2010 he drops to 46 cents, from 72 cents. NVDA today is down $1.25, or 13.8%, to $7.78.</Msg><Username>polysario</Username><Timestamp>1360241683423</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-07 07:54:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360241798729-11</Id><Topic><Title>Pacific Crest’s credibility</Title><Username>polysario</Username><Timestamp>1360241683423</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-07 07:54:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>he asserts that Nvidia plans to exit the chipset market in 2009 not true</Msg><Username>polysario</Username><Timestamp>1360241798729</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-07 07:56:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360243478980-12</Id><Topic><Title>Did you see this report yet?

So do a little more research and then you can argue that NVDA actually spent over $1B, before factoring in any R&amp;D, to be able to bring Icera soft modems to their SOCs. You'll still be spouting BS, though, if you're somehow arguing that this has left the company in a bad position to eventually provide integrated connectivity to the wide range of international carriers. It hasn't. Quite the opposite. They spent over $1B buying Icera + additional wireless patents -- but the investment was relatively small compared to the market it will open for them.</Msg><Username>joshpritchard</Username><Timestamp>1360259032179</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-07 12:43:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360259439384-26</Id><Topic><Title>Did you see this report yet?

The Chromebook is still in its infancy and the past few days we’ve seen reports that Google may in fact be working on their very own Chromebook. Now it looks like it could be powered by the new NVIDIA Tegra 4, and even have some Android included. A new NVIDIA Tegra 4 quad-core Cortex-A15 powered Chromebook with the code name “puppy” is apparently out and in the wild as we speak, being used by a few lucky developers. Reports from ChromeStory have uncovered the new Chromebook, the details regarding the Tegra 4, and even hints of Android as well. We’re not sure if this will be a laptop or maybe some sort of Chromebox, or even something else at this point. Yesterday reports surfaced that Google has their very own device in the works with a Retina display being dubbed the Chromebook Pixel. Here’s where this gets interesting. Google’s used the term “dogfooding” while testing smartphones in the past, and this device is codenamed puppy — so it’s possibly the device we’ve been hearing about coming directly from Google. Interestingly enough the leak doesn’t reveal too many details, but according to ChromeStory there’s tons of Android code being found in the leak. If Google ends up delivering their own device with a Tegra 4, an HD “Pixel” display, and possibly even dual-boot Android functions this would be amazing. The last bit seems a bit farfetched, but we’re still hopeful.

Nvidia’s Tegra 4 processor is already in the hands of numerous manufacturing partners, and at least one has been testing it in a Chromebook. It’s Codenamed Puppy, not Pixel, but the name’s not the important bit. The fact that it’s running one of the development boards that was recently added to the Linux kernel is. The Tegra 4 features four ARM Cortex-A15 cores instead of two, and it’s believed that clock speeds will top the 2.0GHz mark. That should provide a healthy performance boost over the existing ARM Chromebook from Samsung, and it likely won’t be as expensive (or hard on the battery) as switching to an Intel chip. While it’s becoming clear that next generation Chromebooks will be more powerful and offer welcome upgrades — like high-resolution displays, touch input, and backlit keyboards — there’s also no question that value will continue to be an important component, too. Chromebooks are slowly but surely beginning to make their presence felt in the marketplace, but the charge is being led by the $249 Samsung. If manufacturers like Samsung, Acer, HP, and Lenovo can figure out how to bundle these features up inside a sexy chassis, the next Chromebooks could make serious waves in the computing world.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1360284800605</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-07 19:53:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360284911366-62</Id><Title>something will break soon IMO...the balance sheet must be equitable to all</Title><Msg>shareholders must be rewarded by the company if the market will not..</Msg><Username>smallstock1</Username><Timestamp>1360284911366</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-07 19:55:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360285523840-63</Id><Topic><Title>Nvidia Has Twice The Cash per Share That Apple Has!</Title><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1360282938040</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-07 19:22:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Dear j7777kxx, To address you obsession with NV's cash position. re: It would please me if you would get some perspective on NV's cash position.

The next-generation Nexus 7 tablet could see Nvidia's Tegra 4 System-on-a-Chip (SoC) ousted in favor of Qualcomm's Snapdragon S4 Pro silicon. According to Pacific Crest analyst Michael McConnell, Google is choosing to go with the Snapdragon S4 Pro APQ8064 chip over the Tegra 4 hardware, not only because Qualcomm is willing to offer a better deal but also due to the S4 Pro's tighter integration with 3G and 4G modem technology. This simplifies the supply chain, which means ultimately means lower costs. The S4 Pro is a good choice for the Nexus 4 because it offers integrated cellular technology; something that even the upcoming Tegra 4 SoC—which Nvidia claims is the world's fasted mobile processor—will not. The Tegra 4, previously codenamed "Wayne", was unveiled at CES 2013 and features at its heart 72 custom Nvidia GeForce GPU cores, giving it six-times the graphics processing power of the current Tegra 3. The Tegra 4 also comes with worldwide support for 4G LTE voice and data by utilizing the optional fifth-generation Nvidia Icera i500 chipset. The loss of a place in the Nexus 7 represents a big hit for Nvidia. At an average price of $20 to $25 per Tegra processor McConnell estimates that it will mean an "adverse revenue impact of $200 million to $250 million." McConnell claims that the new Nexus 7 is scheduled to begin shipment in the second quarter of 2013. But it's not all bad news for Nvidia."

Google deliberately rotates among suppliers for their exemplar products. But an estimate of $200-$250 million seems pretty high. That's 10 million SoCs, which is far above sales estimates for the current generation of Nexus 7 tablets. Combined with likely lower pricing for the SoC on a 7" tablet, it's likely a quarter of that number. Put another way: if Tegra is in the next Nexus 7, would this same analyst suggest that it's worth $200M-$250M to Nvidia? Certainly not. It's more likely to be worth about 0.7-0.9 this past quarter's revenue on the Nexus 7.</Msg><Username>watergatefive</Username><Timestamp>1360288481528</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-07 20:54:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360288884013-72</Id><Topic><Title>Apple has $42.40 Cash Per Share (mrq), Nvidiia has $5.50 Cash Per Share (mrq)!</Title><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1360288104528</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-07 20:48:24 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That PHONY claim that "Nvidia Has Twice The Cash per Share That Apple Has!" is ONE BIG LIE.

I didn't say sold 10 million tablets but purchased 10 parts from Nvidia? Sometimes OEMs buy more parts than they can sell. Didn't a large outfit have a tablet sale when they announced they were existing that business before they announced otherwise after a CEO change? What was that outfit again, H somthing wasn't it? lol imho</Msg><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1360289529678</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-07 21:12:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360289666576-74</Id><Topic><Title>"Next-gen Nexus 7 could see Nvidia ousted in favor of Qualcomm"</Title><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1360286488125</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-07 20:21:28 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The $200-$250M is just BS.

You are correct regarding his Fermi's die size gibberish. He used the formula for the area of a circle to calculate the area of a Fermi die and came up with a number that would make a Fermi die as round and as large as an oatmeal cookie. He assumed becuase the wafer is round then so is each die? lol And this is a guy with has his money in semiconductors right, thinking a Fermi die is round like a cookie? Even Nvidia longs must have cringed when they read his post titled: "Nvidia Has Twice The Cash per Share That Apple Has!" .
