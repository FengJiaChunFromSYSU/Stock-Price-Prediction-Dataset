Nvidia said the proliferation of computing devices beyond the PC means, especially the explosion of devices running Google‘s (GOOG) Android software, mean that that there are more opportunities to license the Kepler core, the company asserts: PC sales are declining with the rise of smartphones and tablets. High-definition screens are proliferating, showing up on most every machine. Android is increasingly pervasive. Yesterday’s PC industry, which produced several hundred million units a year, will soon become a computing-devices industry that produces many billions of units a year. And visual computing is at the epicenter of it all. Nvidia said the move has precedent: Nvidia licensed GPU core technology to Sony (SNE) for the PlayStation 3 game console in past, and also receives hundreds of millions of dollars per year from Intel (INTC) for the license to Nvidia graphics technology. In other Nvidia-related news, Bloomberg’s Ian King and Dina Bass this afternoon reported that Microsoft (MSFT) is going to make some new versions of its “Surface RT” tablet computer using chips from competitor Qualcomm (QCOM), even though it still plans to use the “Tegra” processor from Nvidia in production of some other versions, citing a single unnamed source. Nvidia shares are up 5 cents, or 0.4%, at $14.45 in late trading." source: barrons</Msg><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1371640745881</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 07:19:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371640990964-11</Id><Topic><Title>the question is not licensing, the question is ....</Title><Username>whosunw</Username><Timestamp>1371639096326</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 06:51:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>with this tacit admission that Tegra is dead, you think any OEM would be foolish enough to start a Tegra design?</Msg><Username>whosunw</Username><Timestamp>1371640990964</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 07:23:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371642487261-12</Id><Title>"Battlefield 4 will be optimised for AMD GPUs"</Title><Msg>"Battlefield 4 will be optimised for AMD GPUs" "AMD says EA partnership makes sense given its components form the backbone of the PS4 and Xbox One. Battlefield 4 screenshot AMD and DICE have formed a relationship to optimise the performance of Battlefield 4 when played on AMD's Radeon hardware. "DICE has a partnership with AMD specifically for Battlefield 4 on PC to showcase and optimise the game for AMD hardware," an EA spokesperson told IGN. "This does not exclude DICE from working with other partners to ensure players have a great experience across a wide set of PCs for all their titles." AMD believes the partnership makes perfect sense given the PS4 and Xbox One are built on AMD tech. "It makes sense that game developers would focus on AMD hardware with AMD hardware being the backbone of the next console generation. At this time, though, our relationship with DICE and EA is exclusively focused on Battlefield 4 and its performance optimisations for AMD CPUs, GPUs and APUs," AMD said. "Additionally, the AMD Gaming Evolved program undertakes no efforts to prevent our competition from optimising for games before their release." Battlefield 4 will be released November 1 for current generation systems, with PS4 and Xbox One versions expected at their respective launches. VideoGamer Analysis Given the PS4 and Xbox One share similar hardware from AMD it will be interesting to see if the component maker can turn this into a selling point for PC hardware.

Street observers have differing points of view on what the payoff will be. Hans Mosesmann, of Raymond James, who has a Strong Buy rating on the shares, thinks the licensing path might give Nvidia a route into products from Apple (AAPL), and that it may curtail the advance of ARM Holdings‘s (ARMH) own graphics intellectual property: If there was ever a way for Nvidia to get into Apple, the IP licensing angle is likely it. This is particularly true if Apple has ambitions in the datacenter (although nothing has been announced to date). In this case, licensed graphics from Imagination Technology (used by Apple, Samsung Electronics (005930KS), and Intel (INTC) in mobile platforms) are not suitable in higher-end computing. This also could limit ARM’s Mali effort, which is just starting to gain traction. Regarding Intel’s licensing agreement with Nvidia, we still believe that Intel will have to pay Nvidia for many years to come. Remember, Intel’s Larrabee project was cancelled years ago and it now has a dual Imagination and internal graphics strategy that is not ideal in our view. Lazard Capital Markets‘s Daniel Amir, reiterating a Neutral rating on the stock, thinks it may expand Nvidia’s addressable market: We believe that the licensing model provides the company with an additional revenue stream and the potential to attract new customers. While we do not see any near-term revenue impact, we do see a benefit of moving towards the licensing model for greater reach, similar to ARM’s approach with its mobile processors." source: barrons</Msg><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1371653848363</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 10:57:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371654074685-35</Id><Title>Nice move</Title><Msg>Licensing is an easy path to profits on top of the current profit base.

Regarding the big two, we believe Apple (OW, covered by R. Cihra) is unlikely to adopt Kepler as our checks indicate significant internal GPU design efforts, perhaps looking to eliminate the royalty expense. Further, Samsung is possible but is cycling through IP vendors and chip suppliers today. Wang also wonders about the potential rise in operating expense to support markets such as industrial or consumer electronics, where the customers based is very large and very specific." source: barrons</Msg><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1371654100477</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 11:01:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371654442245-37</Id><Title>You know how this buying frenzy will end right?

This is particularly true if Apple has ambitions in the datacenter (although nothing has been announced to date). In this case, licensed graphics from Imagination Technology (used by Apple, Samsung Electronics (005930KS), and Intel (INTC) in mobile platforms) are not suitable in higher-end computing. This also could limit ARM’s Mali effort, which is just starting to gain traction. Regarding Intel’s licensing agreement with Nvidia, we still believe that Intel will have to pay Nvidia for many years to come. Remember, Intel’s Larrabee project was cancelled years ago and it now has a dual Imagination and internal graphics strategy that is not ideal in our view. --Lazard Capital Markets‘s Daniel Amir (Neutral): We believe that the licensing model provides the company with an additional revenue stream and the potential to attract new customers.

In the past couple of years Nvidia invested over a billion dollars in R&amp;D on what could become the first of the ultimate cores—Kepler. Kepler is the first architecture ever designed to scale all the way from mobile to its highest end Tesla processors. It’s unique in that at its most atomic level (192 processors) it is a half-watt device. That is “the core”. That basic Kepler core can be (is) used in all the processors in Nvidia’s entire product line from Tegra to Titan. How’s that for common IP and scalability? And there’s no tricky political side-mouth talking here—it is that core, no special sauce wrapper, or depopulation fusing, or emulations, just one operational core. --The ultimate in scalability, Nvidia’s Kepler core Again the good-bad news. The core could be used in anything from AR glasses to game consoles, to medical equipment, avionics, to CAVEs and super computers. But Nvidia couldn’t ever even find all the applications and potential customers for its core so it’s going to share the processor. Nvidia has set up a business unit run by the formable Bob Feldstein, who knows a bit or two about the embedded and core licensing business, to run Nvidia’s core business. Feldstein will offer a RTL Kepler design to new customers. Bob isn’t a one-man band and has an equally formidable team of engineers and AEs to work with and support customers. So Bob and team are hanging out their sign—Open For Business. This is major undertaking for Nvidia, and something that has taken many months to work out; and they’re not finished yet.

It will take that long for the new (non-traditional) customers to spec, design, and manufacture their parts and/or systems. Having said that, don’t expect to hear a bunch from Nvidia about this operation. Obviously they won’t be able to talk about new products their new customers might be designing. What do we think? If you’ve ever played a AAA FPS game on a PC you’ve probably seen the “The way it was meant to be played” Nvidia tag. I guess we can now expect to see a “The way it was meant to be seen” boot-up tag on our TVs, car dash ports, handheld medical devices, CNC machines, and store signs. (HUGE UNTAPPED MARKET!) Nvidia is right about the abundance of opportunities. Most, if not all of them are being satisfied today with tiny dedicated and un-programmable graphics controllers. But in the world of the internet of things where every machine can talk to every other machine, an un-programmable device is no longer acceptable. The Nvidia Core can be a basic high-performance parallel processor, and/or a great programmable display processor. The opportunity is there, the processor is here, now all Nvidia has to do is let the 8 billion inhabitants of this world know about it. ___ Google Techpions and Jon Peddie for source article</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1371666386981</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 14:26:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371666706855-96</Id><Topic><Title>NVIDIA's "core" business - comments about NVIDIA's expanded business model</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1371666074542</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 14:21:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How much do you get for shuffling shopping carts at Wal Mart?</Msg><Username>chitownbarber25</Username><Timestamp>1371666706855</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 14:31:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371667147094-97</Id><Title>What value does cut-n-paste boy think he adds w/o one original thought?</Title><Msg>Other than: Just In: Breaking News: Must Read, Update, WSJ comments, Bloomberg comments, Anad said, Tom's HW said ...

""We believe the company [Nvidia] hopes to leverage its graphics investments made over the years through licensing deals (and through expanding its reach beyond providing silicon solutions). We believe the announcement marks the entrance of a viable competitor in the graphics space to ARM Holdings. Over the past few years, ARM has emphasized its Mali graphics cores and has emerged as the primary competitor to Imagination Technologies. While Mali is still a fairly small portion of ARM’s overall business (and Imagination remains the market leader), we believe Nvidia’s licensing model could prove to be a credible competitor to ARM’s graphics segment momentum.""

Just ask Pixomondo. They labored over nearly 300 shots for the film Star Trek Into Darkness, which opened last month, grabbing strong reviews and more than $200 million in U.S. box office sales. ........... Visual effects scene from Star Trek Into Darkness Director J.J. Abrams wanted to be able to move the camera through scenes with maximum flexibility. So Pixomondo had to build incredible depth into the entirely computer-generated city. Each scene burst with detail — 3D images with 130 million active polygons and up to 32GB of textures. Pixomondo’s systems did the best they could, but frustrated artists encountered response times of more than an hour. Systems frequently froze. And a 3D digital paint tool ran so slowly that artists spent nearly twice as long waiting as they did working. ...... Darkness Turned To Light After Pixomondo tapped NVIDIA Quadro K4000 GPUs to accelerate their Autodesk 3ds Max workflow for modeling, animation and rendering, the artists could process assets much faster and work in full detail. They could turn on shadows and move light sources around within a scene with real-time feedback. And, they no longer had to split data-heavy scenes into separate files, which would double the amount of effort and time needed to make edits. In the end, Pixomondo had the K4000-accelerated workstations running practically 24/7. When one artist would leave for the day, another could take over on the same system. Most importantly, they could create more accurate previews of how a scene was taking shape — and quickly fulfill the director’s vision for the shot. “Before we got these cards, I would run to the producer and scream for better machines,” said Damm. “It turns out our machines just needed a K4000 boost.” SOURCE: NVIDIA website</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1371673422916</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 16:23:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371673852192-113</Id><Topic><Title>Nvidia must be buying Nvdia today to make a dumb move look smart</Title><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1371655389656</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 11:23:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Your ID is less than a year old so what are you talking about?

Licensees can choose whether or not to adopt an architecture right away or wait for any potential revisions, similar to what ARM does with its cores (e.g. Tegra 4i uses a later revision of the Cortex A9 core). This move has huge implications. Theoretically a licensee could bring an NVIDIA GPU to market before NVIDIA itself, although that does seem pretty unlikely. What we could see however is a licensee introduce a GPU configuration that NVIDIA had no intentions of bringing to market. The model makes a lot of sense and expands NVIDIA’s role in the computing world beyond its life in PCs. In the PC space, NVIDIA built discrete GPUs that system integrators (and end users) put in their machines. In the post-discrete world where SoCs rule the landscape, NVIDIA believes it can be just as relevant by doing the same. The difference here is instead of NVIDIA building cards out of its GPUs and selling them, the SoC manufacturer would be responsible for all integration. It’s the same playbook, just modified to deal with the new world around it."" Final words: ""Although unexpected from a timing perspective (we had no hint that NVIDIA was going to drop this on us today), NVIDIA’s move to license its GPU IP is very sensible. All growth markets where compute is concerned are moving forward with high levels of integration. For NVIDIA to not only remain relevant in the broader world but also grow with it, it must have a strategy in place for markets where integration is required. Where those new markets are, and ultimately what this means for NVIDIA’s financials is beyond the scope of our analysis - it’s simply the right (only?) move.""

The point is, at THIS point, long and short term, it seems like a good play. Their quality is pretty universally acknowledged. What I don't get is your venom.

"One of them" means yiu don't know which on right? But that didn't stop you from posting nonsense did it? Sony said the PS4 would be profitable on day one becasue it was not investing in developing the Cell processor this time around with IBM. Nor would Sony have to partner with AMD to develope a 64 Bit x86 CPU+GPU APU since AMD already had the Jaguar APU IP as part of its Custom Desgin Business. The idea is to get OEM/ODMs to select IP blocks from AMD's IP and add thier own IP if desired, as Sony did, to build custom chips for high volume products. Sony and IBM spent a lot of money to develope the Cell processor and it was that R&amp;D that set Sony back. The exact amount spent has not been disclosed but Sony said it took years for the PS3 to break even on HW because of Cell R&amp;D. Sony did not pay Nvidia to develope a GPU. Nvidia licensed Sony existing GPU IP. Something Nvidia cited as precedent for their new low margin GPU IP business venture. If you read more and spew less BS you'd stop making a fool of yourself with "One of them has specifically stated" nonsense a "One of them has specifically stated" comment is an oxymoron. If you don't know who said what it can't be "specifically stated".

I said Nvidia is TRYING TO COPY what HSA is doing But what Nvidia is doing is NOT HSA Samsung, Qualcomm, TXN, ARMH and Imag Tech DID NOT JOIN FOLLOW Nvidia's HSA-LIke-Almost-but-Not-Quite-Scam-Due-2015 They did join HSA. Now why don't you read Anandtech's article and pay attention this time. If it ain''t the REAL HSA Spec so it won't match what the above including what ARMH is doing.

If Qualcomm is kicking Nvidia's rear w/o Kepler and Nvidia can't seem to digest its own cooking, Qualcomm would be crazy to eat that JUNK. lol imho</Msg><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1371699708797</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 23:41:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
