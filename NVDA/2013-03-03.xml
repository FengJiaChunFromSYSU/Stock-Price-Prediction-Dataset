T3i however, stands a chance iff i500 can do 3G. That would allow aapl or even samsung a single quick to market world wide solution for a cheaper iPhone/Galaxy S. And that is a big if, seeing how i400 ANG for 3Gs. I ,would look to samsung adopting an outside solution much quicker than aapl doing it, Samsung, in using brche m's totally integrated solutions, has proven they are not just tied to their own processors. heck, samsung might even fab the T3i for nvda. Die is cast for the bleeding edge, T4 wouldn't play regardless of benchmark or no benchmark. The fight is for the huge non bleeding edge market where there is a chance to differentiate in the chips by integrating more onto the processor. By fight, I mean fight for something that counts, like sales $s. Jen can have his bragging rights. BTW, Samsung is supposedly ramping dual core A9 single chip solutions from brcm later on in the year. They are ramping single core single chip brcm solutions now. BTW, I reiterate, regardless of benchmarks, Vizio backing out of T4 tablet to me means T4 is not ready for prime time for whatever reason. If you are expecting T4 to ramp back Tegra sales for nvda, better relook at that model, for those who do model Tegra sales.</Msg><Username>whosunw</Username><Timestamp>1362324012497</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-03 10:20:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362324226721-19</Id><Topic><Title>getanid....</Title><Username>hydroponic_tomatoes</Username><Timestamp>1362300295985</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-03 03:44:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"With all due respect, you're easily the most knowledgeable person on this board.

Despite being an ARM architecture licensee, NVIDIA once again licensed a complete processor from ARM rather than designing its own core. I do fundamentally believe that NVIDIA will go the full custom route eventually (see: Project Denver), but that’s a goal that will take time to come to fruition. In the case of Tegra 4, NVIDIA chose to license ARM’s Cortex A15 - the only vanilla ARM core presently offered that can deliver higher performance than a Cortex A9. Samsung recently disclosed details about its Cortex A15 implementation compared to the Cortex A7, a similarly performing but more power efficient alternative to the A9. In its ISSCC paper on the topic Samsung noted that the Cortex A15 offered up to 3x the performance of the Cortex A7, at 4x the area and 6x the power consumption. It’s a tremendous performance advantage for sure, but it comes at a great cost to area and power consumption. The area side isn’t as important as NVIDIA has to eat that cost, but power consumption is a valid concern.

Conclusion on that one is the obvious one - i400 did not work. as I said, IF 3G is good, it will be a one model world wide solution and cuts down on time to market, especially making sure that the processor plays nice with the separate modem. just stringing up ARM cores doesn't cut it anymore, any joe blow can do it - nvda, aapl, samsung, Hauwei, qcom, brcm, freescale, txn, mediatech, amd..... and that list gets longer anyday. One has to bring something extra to the party (eg brcm's full single core single chip solutions, won't get you Jen's bragging right, but is reeling in the $s). if and when nvda's tegra sales ramp, I can bet you $ to donut it will be from T3i and not T4. T4 has no market to sell into, with the exception of the guy into spreading the wealth.

You can get a decent Dell laptop for $600 with the same I5 processor. Now I swear all I hear is that Legacy stuff, but in reality what is it? Do you run macros off DOS. Not kidding but I have never seen anyone mention what those must have legacy Apps are? Perhaps you could enlighten me and list what Legacy Apps you must have? I truly haven't run anything but Excel and PowerPoint in the last 10 years. Use to do Macros but learned how to do the same in excel. But fear not Microsoft took an ARM 64 license in 2012 and will fix Win RT so you can run your Legacy Apps next year. When buying anything other than WIN RT which deal do you think is better: - Paying $179 per computer - Or renting for $99 per year. Something to consider. Price is an issue!</Msg><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1362371042629</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-03 23:24:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362371346323-63</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft Surface RT Tablet Adds 6 More Countries to Sales Distribution In Late March</Title><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1362335855144</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-03 13:37:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Legacy apps compliance is important for the enterprise sector. You need to be familiar with corporate IT to understand the issues.
