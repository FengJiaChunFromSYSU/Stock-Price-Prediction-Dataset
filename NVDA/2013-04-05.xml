Double nonsense. 1. If T4 is sucking too much power for performance reasons then why not just throttle back and lower power usage. Nvidia does that now with their GPU products. Either run T4 at a slower clock or turbo up and down. It must mean at a slower clock T4 can't compete on performance. 2. So QCOM must have skated to where the puck would be and Nvidia went the wrong way. That means QCOM guessed correctly that OEMs would value LOW POWER over raw performance at the expense of battery life. Nvidia built a T4 power hog that Google had no use for so they went with QCOM. imho</Msg><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1365172998994</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 10:43:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365174052470-9</Id><Topic><Title>Do We have Nvidia Marketing PR Hacks Posting Here?</Title><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1365140575607</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 01:42:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Posting on stock message boards is a violation of corporate policy and doing so is a terminable offense.</Msg><Username>norcalnative_2</Username><Timestamp>1365174052470</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 11:00:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365175939290-10</Id><Topic><Title>Do We have Nvidia Marketing PR Hacks Posting Here?</Title><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1365140575607</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 01:42:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Posting on stock message boards is a violation of corporate policy and doing so is a terminable offense."

Then, after driving 5 hours to my mother's, I saw the stock moving higher with virtually EVERY other tech/semi DOWN. Later, I saw the turn in ARMH but almost nothing else. I DO think that some "other people" noticed what I had noticed, i.e. that there looked to be a "floor" at that level, and most likely it WAS The Company deciding that trading at 2 Times Cash was ABSURD and wouldn't allow it to drop any further. Once others started to realize this, some of the "smarter" shorts began to cover. As I've tried to emphasize, The Final Hour is the key. And, we had just over 7mm shares at 3PM, and the stock was near its high of the day, so far, at 12.30-31. At 3:30, we had 8.188mm and we were at a NEW HOD at 12.34-5. 8.85mm at 3:40, 12.41-42, and now 13.75mm and a close at THE HOD, 12.46, although that volume includes a block of 1.5mm in the after market down 1.5 cents. All-in-all I'll take it, and I'm glad I "figured out" there just might be a specific "floor" and added to my stake. Down for the week, but a beautiful reversal on stronger volume is fine by me. I still have a "feeling" that some kind of announcement is coming. I still strongly "suggest" that anyone short ANY calls at 13 or 14 from May on out think about covering. As always, we'll know in the fullness of time.

He may very well have a different view of what a bull is in this market, but your response is weird to me and off-base. I've always appreciated your posts and faithful listing of links on issues related to our investments here, but sometimes, you just take a haughty path that isn't warranted . . hope you have a great weekend!</Msg><Username>roundhouse_c</Username><Timestamp>1365197722194</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 17:35:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365200416339-38</Id><Topic><Title>Nvidia's buyback is working</Title><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1365195078539</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 16:51:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>roundhouse_c, ibexx has shown that he dislikes me, especially as he takes great pains to insult anybody who contributes to Seeking Alpha (which is obviously a dig at me).

That is why he called the comment sophomoric in my opinion. See below. Timing of Purchase. If the security is traded on a national exchange or the Nasdaq National Market, the purchase must not constitute the day’s opening transaction for the security. Such a security also may not be purchased during the last half hour of scheduled trading on the exchange that is its principal market or on which the purchase is actually made or during the last half hour before termination of the period in which last sale prices are reported on the Nasdaq National Market.</Msg><Username>btpuckfan</Username><Timestamp>1365206215466</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 19:56:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365214114966-43</Id><Topic><Title>Nvidia's buyback is working</Title><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1365195078539</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 16:51:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Look at the price action today - the momentum gained steam well before the last half hour of trading. That being said, I suspect that a lot of value oriented funds are also trying to build positions in the stock. Who knows, man. This is better conversation than the millionth basher saying "TEGRA SUX" or the millionth pumper saying "ZOMG LOOK AT HOW FAST TEGRA 4 IS!!" We all know that this is a very cheap, well run company, and while the stock remains "boring", it's nice to have something to talk about.

I don't post very often anymore but I've been on the board over 10 years back to Sage's calls. I don't understand the constant tension between posters that bring good insight and opinions to the company and its stock movement. I also read all of Ashraff's articles on SA which in my opinion are well researched and very well written. Thanks for all of the information and time taken to do so.
