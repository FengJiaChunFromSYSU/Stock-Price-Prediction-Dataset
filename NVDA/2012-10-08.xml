This Christmas?</Title><Msg>That's the bet that Apple has taken with their custom-designed A6 chip, says Barron's. You pumper boys still like Barron's, right? Okay then. Here's that most fascinating article from Barron's: AAPL: Bold Gambit with New ‘A6′ CPU, Says Microprocessor Report And for those who aren't the web surfing type, here's the article. AAPL: Bold Gambit with New ‘A6′ CPU, Says Microprocessor Report October 8, 2012, 1:22 P.M. ET.. By Tiernan Ray "Microprocessor Report’s Linley Gwennap today pens a rather fascinating article about the “A6” chip in Apple‘s (AAPL) iPhone 5. Gwennap writes that Apple has developed its own central processing unit, or CPU “core,” based on the chip design technology of ARM Holdings (ARMH), but completely different from the chips based on ARM intellectual property developed by Qualcomm (QCOM), Nvidia (NVDA), and Texas Instruments (TXN). The subject of A6 having a new CPU of Apple’s own design was discussed a bit last month by Anand Lal Shimpi of AnandTech. Writes Gwennap, At the iPhone 5 announcement, Apple did not disclose what CPU it used in its new A6 application processor. Recent information, however, indicates that it designed its own CPU rather than licensing a Cortex-A9 or next-generation Cortex-A15 from ARM. Rumors about Apple working on a CPU design have swirled for the past several years, but the company had never publicly confirmed them. Initial analysis of shipping iPhone 5 units, however, confirms that the A6 uses a unique ARM-compatible CPU design that has never been seen before. The result is a chip that in general doubles the performance of the chip in the iPhone 4S, the “A5,” while being more power-efficient than ARM’s own top-of-the-line CPU, the “Cortex A-15.” That lets Apple use a smaller, lighter battery in the iPhone 5 compared to other phones, among other things. Apple has spent hundreds of millions of dollars in acquisitions to bring in the development teams to develop the new CPU over the last few years, probably half a billion at least. Is it worth it? asks Gwennap. On the one hand, Apple is now in a race with Qualcomm and others, “a competitive race that is difficult to win.” On the other hand, Apple was able to beat Samsung Electronics (005930KS) to market with this latest chip generation, something that may have made the effort worth it: It appears that the end result will be that Apple ships a Cortex-A15–class CPU about three months before archenemy Samsung. These three months happen to come during the big holiday buying season, during which time the iPhone 5 could generate $20 billion in revenue. So that half a billion dollars could be money well spent." Wow! Apple's in-house, custom designed A6 processor Doubles (2X) the performance of the already lightning-fast iPhone 4S “A5,” while being More Power-Efficient than ARM’s own top-of-the-line CPU, the Cortex A-15. Remember the ARM Cortex A-15 processor? Which nvidia hasn't even built yet. Leap frogged already, boys. By Apple's in-house development teams. My my my. It looks like Apple will be the Big Big Winner this Christmas. And beyond.</Msg><Username>i_read_best</Username><Timestamp>1349742190061</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 20:23:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>44</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349742468681-25</Id><Topic><Title>Would you invest a Half Billion Dollars, to make $20 Billion?
