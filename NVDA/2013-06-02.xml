WSCS This guy actually laid out the data instead of writing copious amounts of nonsense opinions - Decreasing Earnings &amp; Revenue last 4 Quarters! It's downhill from here on - mobile simply keeps their fabs busy for revenue at low GM if they are half way successful at it. GM will be compressed more rapidly - they need to buy more McAfees with GMs of 75% to hide and slow down the GM compression.</Msg><Username>ltenow</Username><Timestamp>1370152047394</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-02 01:47:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370152740770-2</Id><Topic><Title>Clobbered and Bashed Trails</Title><Username>ltenow</Username><Timestamp>1370152047394</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-02 01:47:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Geez whats this to do with NVDA? Well certainly doesn't look like NVDA is getting squeeze by Intel or AMD - Revenue pretty much flat to positive and earnings and margins improving overall. Going forward - undoubtedly will improve further. At the high end PC/NB - NVDA will do as well as Intel or better going forward as it takes market share from AMD and it looks like it might even do better then the expensive high end Haswell GPU/CPU by providing a lower cost higher performance GPU/CPU combo. On the mobile stuff NVDA will do very well whilst securing 50% GM. On the GRID, VCA and Tesla - NVDA has no competition.</Msg><Username>ltenow</Username><Timestamp>1370152740770</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-02 01:59:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370162426564-3</Id><Topic><Title>Here comes Intel..</Title><Username>roundhouse_cc</Username><Timestamp>1370099418373</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-01 11:10:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>'sadly this is not even possible with the overall PC market shrinking 7%.' That figure is misleading as it primarily indicates the collapse of netbooks which is really a tablet form factor. The Korea Times article said Samsung wants to sell 33m Galaxy Tabs in 2013, Atom haver sold anywhere near that volume so clearly they can make up any low prices with serious volume. Haswell will cause a PC market comeback anyway as great new PC processors do.</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1370162426564</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-02 04:40:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370181205903-4</Id><Topic><Title>Clobbered and Bashed Trails</Title><Username>ltenow</Username><Timestamp>1370152047394</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-02 01:47:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you know it's funny . . . , the volume of chatter than intel can generate around a new launch is immense. Funny thing is it's mostly noise. Some bits of the noise might have some nugget in it, but history shows those nuggets don't add up to much. And yet there are many many Intel koolaid drinkers in the world telling you those nuggets are momentous. Thanks for keeping it real.</Msg><Username>eir951</Username><Timestamp>1370181205903</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-02 09:53:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370186689209-5</Id><Topic><Title>Here comes Intel..</Title><Username>roundhouse_cc</Username><Timestamp>1370099418373</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-01 11:10:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>with content stuck at 1080 for how long, notebooks nor desktops not showing any movement towards higher screen resolutions, I think Haswell graphics may actually be good enough to displace nvda add on graphics for anything other than gamers. I am not expecting nvda's good financial fortune in graphics to continue. With Tegra totally dead. If Shield does not take off, I think longs here singing graphic praises are in for a nasty surprise at eoy. btw, I saw a couple of 4k screens at the local SNE showroom. Wow, impressive. VERY impressive.</Msg><Username>whosunw</Username><Timestamp>1370186689209</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-02 11:24:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370211601521-6</Id><Topic><Title>Clobbered and Bashed Trails</Title><Username>ltenow</Username><Timestamp>1370152047394</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-02 01:47:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So, Nvidia can hit 50% GM while paying ARM's licensing fees and TSMC's foundry margin, but Intel's Atoms will be at 25%?

Intel has been living on great CPU margins for years, even after building fabs. The only way they could do that was to assign a whole lot of value to their product. Mobile is changing that game. That's all he's saying. Intel isn't going to get a product mix of 80%+GMs out of their high end and 50+% out of their low end any longer. I think they will have a number products that are used to "buy share," that is, little, no or negative margins on certain transactions. Those will not be apparent for some time, Intel is large enough to hide this for some time. But their margins will continue to shrink. The PC products will become less margin rich with a viable (ARM) alternatives in tablets and mobile as well. And don't forget GPGPU is attacking the high end data center products, and soon ARM will be coming after those 80+% margins as well. The point is if Intel was earning corporate margins of low to mid 60s% in PCs, that is unlikely to continue as they go after mobile. ARM devices yes, can hit 50%GMs. I want to see Intel maintain 60+% on x86 for mobile. I think it's impossible because of two forces, silicon area and competitive price pressure from viable ARM alternatives. Intel has always positioned x86 compatibility as their Ace in the hole. While they were busy telling the world that, mobile proved it doesn't need that compatibility. So with compatibility a non-factor, why does any mobile ODM need intel?</Msg><Username>eir951</Username><Timestamp>1370214360738</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-02 19:06:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370216996725-8</Id><Topic><Title>Clobbered and Bashed Trails</Title><Username>ltenow</Username><Timestamp>1370152047394</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-02 01:47:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>AE, Of course I was yanking your chain on the 25% GM. The GM compression will accelerate the more they get into mobile - Fabs are very expensive things to build and maintain - more so when you have to be on the bleeding edge just to be competitive (against a commodity product). Bleeding edge fabs are affordable when you are drawing 60% GM and selling for $100 devices by the millions. Now in the mobile space where it's going for $10 to $25 they have to sell 1B chips to make $25B revenue and build even more multi billion dollar fabs to support the volume. See the problem. And when there is a slow down - those idle fabs are a huge boat anchor. When you are doing high margin stuff - you can afford the bleeding edge fabs but when you are selling low priced lower GM commodity products - no more. Intel should find some other high end products / market to play in or turn into a foundry or buy Nvidia if they can get through the antitrust problems. Or they can make use of their arm license and catch up on GPU (dreaming) and blow all the other arms away and still get 60% GM or more.</Msg><Username>ltenow</Username><Timestamp>1370216996725</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-02 19:49:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370219896940-9</Id><Title>NVIDIA readying Tegra 4, Tegra 4i, GeForce 700 family for Computex 2013</Title><Msg>""So what, exactly, can you expect from us at the show?

The mobile chip business is like a triathlon combining low-power processing horsepower, wireless know-how and graphics muscle. And Intel is kind of like Lance Armstrong. No, Chandrasekher isn’t necessarily saying that Intel is using performance-enhancing drugs, but rather that it is facing challenges in moving beyond its original sport. “Lance Armstrong was fantastic as a biker, not withstanding any of his habits,” the Qualcomm marketing chief told AllThingsD’s Ina Fried at this week’s D11 conference. “But when he switched from biking to marathoning and did the New York City Marathon, he didn’t do as well … I think Intel faces some of that.” As for his new employer, he says Qualcomm is “a company that is born mobile.” “This is a company that has reinvented itself over the past 20-plus years several times,” he said. So what’s coming next for mobile devices? Lots more sensors and media capabilities that approach those of a home theater, all on a phone or tablet.
