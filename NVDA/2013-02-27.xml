Recent reports showed that Exynos ran into serious problems with heat and/or imcompatibility with LTE, thus (I am guessing) NV might consider it a moot point to make comparison with a half-dead competition product. Note: I think the Exynos 5 Octa's LTE issue may be related to the thermal one - in that integration or bundling with an LTE modem could seriously raise the TDP of the SoC. Just speculating from reading the internet chatter.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1361982989143</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 11:36:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361983181642-21</Id><Topic><Title>NEW! nVidia publishes more Tegra 4 benchmarks vs Snapdragon 600/800......WOW!</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1361975124917</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 09:25:24 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>it was more for an A15 to A15 comparison...</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1361983181642</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 11:39:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361983233426-22</Id><Title>Nvidia MWC video 2013</Title><Msg>blogsDOTnvidiaDOTcom/2013/02/nvidia-mwc-booth/ Very nice video in 1080p and with display of Nvidias products from mobile to grid gaming. /Frank.</Msg><Username>frankduxbusborg</Username><Timestamp>1361983233426</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 11:40:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361983992125-23</Id><Topic><Title>NVDA CEO Buying Shares!</Title><Username>mills.claudia</Username><Timestamp>1361978640220</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 10:24:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How many shares he bought</Msg><Username>handsome868</Username><Timestamp>1361983992125</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 11:53:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361984160616-24</Id><Topic><Title>NEW! nVidia publishes more Tegra 4 benchmarks vs Snapdragon 600/800......WOW!</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1361975124917</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 09:25:24 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>NOt sure I follow you....there is a slide there (in the article) devoted to GPU comparisons.

Marty Edelman was just named to the Board of AMD, and I've known him for around 40 years, since he's married to my oldest/best friend's sister. While I haven't seen nor spoken to Marty in a year or two, and have yet to ask my best friend if he knows anything about this, I thought I'd just share what came to mind when I saw this. Marty is primarily a real estate lawyer who is uber-successful. However, I think he has also had some M&amp;A experience, and that might be why he was brought in. AMD is SUCH a BAD company, as most of the people on this board already know, and perhaps they realize that their only chance, now, is to sell the company. I'm not saying they will or are even thinking about it, but it WOULD make some sense given their cash-burn, and that they are trailing INTC and NVDA in their two main markets. If this WERE to happen, I would "guess" that it would be QCOM who would buy them to try to play catch-up with NVDA on graphics, since the latest benchmarks are looking like many of us thought they would, i.e. NVDA is leap-frogging well ahead of them. So, IF this were to come to pass, I also think it would put NVDA "in play" or at least get the stock to a much higher level, as they would be the only major standalone graphics chip designer left. I am NOT suggesting that anyone trade on this thought, especially where it concerns buying AMD. Just some "food for thought". As always, we'll know in the fullness of time.

I think NVDA is doing what they said they would. The mobile market is the most lucrative and growing semiconductor market as evidenced by QCOM surpassing INTC in marketcap. NVDA said they wanted to be a player in that space, and while they may be having a rough ride turning the ship, it looks like they are on the right track with Tegra, esp the integrated modem part. Long term that's what they need to compete. Short term there are still a lot of doubters (I have had mine, believe me). The market does not want single source anything. AAPL and Samsung I think will retain their pieces, but the rest of the pie is going to grow a lot bigger. China is the best example. Low cost smart phone parts like tegra4ti will do very well there over the next few years. PCs are not going away any time soon. Gamers still like the open platform, and content developers will still need capable parts like Quadro. NVDA's PC business will just improve (higher margin) with AMD sucking wind. (I can't see how INTC or MSFT ever regains their glory, the world has moved on). And I think Project Shield is a very interesting. NVDA is supporting an open standard, a strategy that has made a lot of tech companies very successful starting with IBM in the 1980s. It is a bold step, but they had to do something different to provide a more capable hand held platform that is not closed. It's gotta be driving sony and nintendo nuts. There is nothing on the market like Shield and I think it's the first of many flavors that will come. Haven't heard pricing yet, but if this is a few hundred dollars it's a real winner in my estimation. If you think about it, NVDA is starting to own all pieces of the pipe from server to extended client. That will give unusual advantage and differentiation. Its a very interesting strategy and they are uniquely positioned to bring all the pieces together (including the most important element, the software stack). I am still bullish. When we see a few more T4 and T4i design wins lined up the world is going to look way different, and $12 will be a distant memory. Near term, I think the company could stand some relationship repair. IR needs to get off their #$%$ and tell their story better. and Jensen needs to drop trou and cement those fall mobile design wins now.

A very lame defense. In the course of the interview, a few interesting tidbits were revealed about the S800: --S800 will be sampling in the NEXT quarter, meaning Q2. I had thought that sampling was ongoing now...this could mean that S800 is further down the road than T4, and things are finalized just yet. --QC claims 50 design wins in the works -- hey, how can you claim design wins before sampling is done? - yet NONE has been announced. Perhaps this information could offer a lesson or two to those who expressed disappointment that too few product announcements have been made.
