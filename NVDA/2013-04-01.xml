Our discovery of this issue came from discussions with multiple power management partners at the APEC (Applied Power Electronics Conference) trade show that was held March 17-21, 2013, and we were also informed that they had only just become aware of Intel’s change of direction in prior weeks. To be clear, the industry sources we spoke with indicated Haswell is working, but that “the new power approach did not live up to expectations.” It was the consensus view that timelines were also slipping, both for the Haswell refresh for PCs in 2H13 and likely down the road for the next two-socket Xeon server move to Haswell that is known as Grantley and expected in 2H14 […] Sources declined to elaborate on (or didn‟t know) the exact performance implications; however, integrated VR was touted as a key feature that will afford the Haswell platform improved power efficiency without compromising performance. We also know from speaking with senior Intel engineers that integrated VR had been “an area of great debate internally.” It seems evident at this juncture that this debate was won by integration proponents, but then lost in terms of benefit yield.""</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1364832116728</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 12:01:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364832281748-10</Id><Topic><Title>INTC: JMP cuts to hold on rumored "Haswell" power circuitry issues</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1364832116728</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 12:01:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Part 2: "It was the consensus view that timelines were also slipping, both for the Haswell refresh for PCs in 2H13 and likely down the road for the next two-socket Xeon server move to Haswell that is known as Grantley and expected in 2H14.""

Savvy option players sell puts (which is synthetic call) at market bottom or s stock's intermediate low - which is what NVDA is at now. I don't write NVDA near monthd (strike 13) calls because the low premiums don't interest me - you probably got 10 cents or 15 for the calls you wrote - these are peanuts to me, not worth bothering and exposing my large position to. Your question comes from typically someone who doesn't know anything about options. I do hope you will get it eventually. Read a good book on options strategy and don't commit your retirement nest eggs to this game. AND look up NVDA near months 12/13 puts and pay attention to the premium. You do need a much higher level of clearance before being granted the privilege to sell puts (which I suspect you might not qualify).

Sources at Intel Santa Clara have assured us that the CEO of Nvidia, Jen-Hsen Huang was approached by headhunters seeking for a replacement for Paul Otellini, who stands down at the chip giant at the end of May. Jen-Hsen, who worked for AMD in a former incarnation, is on record as saying that if he worked for Intel it would only be as the head of the corporation. Noted for his incredible work ethic, Jen-Hsen built Nvidia up more or less from scratch. But its unclear how far the approaches went – Intel’s head hunters are more or less scrabbling around trying to find the successor for Otellini. Pat Gelsinger, chief technology officer at EMC, has signalled that he’s not interested in the job. Internal candidates include Dadi Perlmutter. The future CEO of Intel, whoever she or he is, faces a daunting task. Faced with the fact of convergence and people moving in droves to use smartphones and tablets without any X86 device inside, Intel, basically, needs to be completely re-engineered.</Msg><Username>luizimonti</Username><Timestamp>1364839115515</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 13:58:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364839990757-21</Id><Topic><Title>INTC: JMP cuts to hold on rumored "Haswell" power circuitry issues</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1364832116728</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 12:01:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I rode from $7.5 up plus a few additions at higher prices.

Obviously the ISM numbers drove down all the chips. I don't disagree with you that the majority of chip companies dropped 3-4% today, but we did regain some of the loss into the close. Hopefully Tuesday through the rest of the week will also be similar to last week's action. I think the press release regarding the NVIDIA's GeForce 700M notebook technologies kept us in the $12.55 area. Then the Steinberg press that he received and traded on illegal tips from Jon Horvath, a former analyst at Stamford, Connecticut- based SAC, on technology companies Dell Inc. and Nvida Corp., came out. The was followed by the Huang and INTC rumor. I share your thoughts about the buyout, if Huang goes, he better be taking us with him!

Well, it turns out that Samsung went with the simpler and cheaper way to design 28nm chips like the Exynos 5 Octa, called gate-first, while the competing foundry TSMC designed its production capacity with the harder to implement gate-last process, developed by Intel.

Apple is a penny pinching Miser molded after it's founder - to the point of stupidity. They want the CHEAPEST money can buy and think they can wrap look and feel around it to make it great! For the same reason they'll buy some little outfit somewhere for pennies and change and think they can build it all themselves. Stupid way of utilizing their cash!</Msg><Username>ltenow</Username><Timestamp>1364862812470</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 20:33:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364862919009-65</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Haswell is NOT WELL and never was well should be called a Hasbeen</Title><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1364844302963</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 15:25:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Coming in June to put AMD out of its misery!</Msg><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1364862919009</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 20:35:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364863094796-66</Id><Topic><Title>Apple - Intel Foundry Relationship</Title><Username>ltenow</Username><Timestamp>1364862812470</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 20:33:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Looking at Apple's share price in the last months, many investors agree with you</Msg><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1364863094796</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 20:38:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364863137079-67</Id><Title>1000 dollar Titan boards still selling out after a month</Title><Msg>Hey guys...anybody else notice that there seems to be pretty healthy demand for $1000 graphic cards. The titan was introduced at the end of February and more than a month later, they sell out as soon as more stock comes in. Thats pretty amazing. Margins on this product must be very good. If nvidia can move a lot of these boards in the short term, it will boost earnings. Remember that their quarter still has another month. If they sell like 50k of these, it adds 50 million to the revenue and about 30 million to the profit. Based on the constant inventory evaporation, there seems to be significant demand for these cards. Could be a very interesting report early next month. There are over 1 billion pc gamers out there...get 50k of them to buy this board should be no problem...If they sell more than that, we are really going to crush the numbers. I think nvidia thought this would be a niche product but to me seems like demand is higher than they expected.</Msg><Username>neo_trinity1020</Username><Timestamp>1364863137079</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 20:38:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364863650554-68</Id><Topic><Title>1000 dollar Titan boards still selling out after a month</Title><Username>neo_trinity1020</Username><Timestamp>1364863137079</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 20:38:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That would be sweet.</Msg><Username>ltenow</Username><Timestamp>1364863650554</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 20:47:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364870510111-69</Id><Topic><Title>1000 dollar Titan boards still selling out after a month</Title><Username>neo_trinity1020</Username><Timestamp>1364863137079</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 20:38:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Rumor gas it that serious gamers stock up on Titan to get ready for the Project Shield.....sounds good to me, and I hope it's true.
