This is where Nvidia's credibility issue comes from." No, that is NOT where the credibility issues come from . . the credibility issues are manufactured by the many media naysayers and folks posting here that WANT Nvidia to fail. As it's been pointed out over the last few years more than enough times for those that care to remember, Nvidia has been making moves towards what includes Shield and all the other Tegra iterations with ARM processors intentionally and these decisions not to pursue or retread what appears to be a dead end on the X86 segment of consoles, has been well established. Just shut-up already on this issue, Nvidia's marketing is doing fine and will confirm the company's direction over the coming week.</Msg><Username>roundhouse_c</Username><Timestamp>1363327658352</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 02:07:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363328466692-2</Id><Topic><Title>Not Sure Nvidia's Marketing Is Correct In Their Posturing On the PS4, MS Consols</Title><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1363285440767</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 14:24:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Nvidia has been making moves towards what includes Shield and all the other Tegra iterations with ARM processors intentionally and these decisions not to pursue or retread what appears to be a dead end on the X86 segment of consoles" Roundhouse_c Your above quote would have been great from the Nvidia marketing guy. No spin zone. "Nvidia's marketing is doing fine and will confirm the company's direction over the coming week." Actually it will be Jensen that does what you said above with his financial presentation, not some marketing guy spinning. I like Jensen.

This Conference has historically been somewhat a Science Fair/Vision thing with Financial goals never mentioned. Just whoa look at this....it's really cool. Great entertainment and somewhat worthwhile if you don't know much about what they are talking about. Of course it's worth a lot for business development through the interaction between Nvidia and Industry participates. Apparently this year the same Science Fair/Vision thing will also take place BUT there is a financial presentation by Jensen embedded right after his keynote. This is UNPRECEDENTED.....I would expect we will see what is Nvidia's take on the financial impact of their new businesses and this should easily explain what that Marketing Guy was talking about when he said "Opportunity Cost". If this is not shown then one should safely assume that the Chief Marketeer for Nvidia was just spinning. In addition, the VP of Investor Relations, ran around the country for 3 weeks recently, telling Big Investors that he can't answer that now, but He did say We are more excited than anytime in recent memory. Then he added come to GTC or watch because our CEO..Jensen will be making a financial presentation, and hopefully a lot of questions will be answered. First question in the last conference call's Q/A was will you provide Full year guidance on Tegra. A song and dance ensued, artfully done but again a reiteration to watch Jensen's financial presentation! So...Everybody better watch!</Msg><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1363370030156</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 13:53:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363370172088-41</Id><Topic><Title>Using "Opportunity cost" as an excuse in this context doesn't make sense</Title><Username>lostamericanpride</Username><Timestamp>1363347764260</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 07:42:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's all about what they are ALREADY doing instead of this opportunity.

(AMD) has quietly dominated the market for commodity graphics chips and CPUs for console gaming systems, and the latest generation of consoles look to be no exception. Sony Corp.'s (TYO:6758) PS4, to launch this holiday season, will feature an AMD GPU and CPU. And there's an AMD 550 MHz Radeon "Latte" GPU aboard Nintendo Comp., Ltd.'s (TYO:7974) popular Wii U. So how does NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA), AMD's chief rival in the PC graphics market feel about AMD's dominance of the increasingly PC-like consoles? Not too bad, apparently. NVIDIA's Senior Vice President of content and tecnology told Gamespot in a recent interview that his company is essentially letting AMD win. While he's convinced his firm could be AMD if it tried, he says it just isn't worth it, remarking: I'm sure there was a negotiation that went on and we came to the conclusion that we didn't want to do the business at the price those guys were willing to pay. Having been through the original Xbox and PS3, we understand the economics of the development and the trade-offs. If we say, did a console, what other piece of our business would we put on hold to chase after that? In the end, you only have so many engineers and so much capability, and if you're going to go off and do chips for Sony or Microsoft, then that's probably a chip that you're not doing for some other portion of your business. That statement seems a bit odd -- after all, hegemony of consoles could be a ticket for a financially struggling AMD to effectively sell tens, if not hundreds of millions of chips. But NVIDIA's focus is more directed on the mobile market, where it's looking to leverage pared down versions of its GeForce GPUs beside ARM CPU cores. NVIDIA has its work cut out for it in that market; it largely lost the last round to Qualcomm, Inc. (QCOM) due to its chips being too power-hungry. NVIDIA is looking to change later this year with the refresh of Tegra 4 that will include an on-die LTE modem. Between Tegra and the development of traditional PC GPUs, NVIDIA sounds content to let AMD freely dominate the console market -- or so it says</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1363377088856</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 15:51:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363377165694-72</Id><Topic><Title>Detailed NVDA Research Report !</Title><Username>danieljones497</Username><Timestamp>1363186107555</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-13 10:48:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>good report</Msg><Username>d.daviesdonnell</Username><Timestamp>1363377165694</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 15:52:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363377358054-73</Id><Title>BANK: Will cash Sony's CHECK Payable to AMD for PS4 parts THIS YEAR</Title><Msg>Nvidia had nothing Sony REQUIRED to sell for a PS4.

But with that said let's go with his thesis. He says Nvidia didn't want the business.AMD has stated on record that the semi-custom chip program of which the consoles are the only known sales so far will generate 20% of their revenue by the end of the year. Assuming $1B in revenue/quarter times 20% gives $200M in revenue per quarter. Even assuming a low margin of say 30% would generate $60M in gross profit. Have no idea what the operating income would be but let's assume 2/3rds of that. That would give $45M in operating income per quarter. So, the question that Nvidia must answer is what do they have in the pipeline right now that will add at least $45M in profit per quarter. It's a compelling question and one that Nvidia own marketing chief did not answer, but of course it simplyt could be the set-up for Jensen's UNPRECEDENTED GTC convention's financial presentation!

Nvidia's PS3 deal is nothing like AMD PS4 deal. AMD has the CPU + GPU and because of the cross license agreement with Intel AMD can not license the x86 to Sony but must to sell Sony parts. Nvidia was NEVER going to get that deal with only a GPU to offer. Tegra 4 need not apply for a 64 bit PS4 job. So what ever Sony was willing to pay Nvidia for a GPU only is not what they would pay for a CPU+GPU solution. Nvidia is sounding off like if Sony offered them $5 for a GPU then they must have offered AMD $5, that is NONSENSE. AMD SOLD Sony more than a GPU so they should get PAID for more than a GPU. Nvidia is looking at their PS3 deal and bad mouthing the AMD PS4 deal and ignoring the fact that IBM took home the CPU MONEY in that PS3 deal not Nvidia. Sony could only pay Nvidia peanuts because they had to save the big buck to buy a CPU from an Intel, IBM or AMD. Do you think IBM took less than Nvidia in the PS3 deal? AMD got some or all of what would have gone to Nvidia and IBM if Sony stayed with the same suppliers. imho</Msg><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1363381329978</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 17:02:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363381493786-81</Id><Title>Sammie Adds A Game Controller For the Galaxy S4</Title><Msg>"Samsungâ€™s Galaxy S4 will come with a game controller that can attach to the bottom of the new smartphone.

LOTS of R&amp;D dollars for NOT much gain... at best, AMD breaks even... the worst part for AMD is the energy they put into it just to break even... distracts from other projects." Getanid, At first blush I would agree but in all fairness to AMD...they were the only company that could make a semi custom X86 part for PS4 and Xbox. The profitability really depends on how the deal was structured. For example in Nvidia's current PS3 they received NRE$ and then a royalty for each RSX chip Sony manufactured. Across 6 years they have received something like $400M in royalties which made the deal quite lucrative. Perhaps they thought the same was going to happen this time but Sony said no way. Besides their "Fictional" Project Denver wasn't ready. So it's really a moot point about Nvidia being in the consoles. Based on internet chatter...AMD cannot license the X86 instruction set to others, but I wonder if there isn't some fine print that says in a semi-custom or embedded design they can. The reason I ask this is because of Rory Read's statement about $200M a quarter in semi-custom revenue by the 4th quarter. If that is revenue from selling chips......my goodness that's giving them away, but if it is a royalty stream then it will be very lucrative. I've looked everywhere and cannot find the information required to make a determination. That's why I asked XC because I know he is a rapid AMD shareholder and I thought he would want to share the good news. The implication of the above is either AMD is a very strong buy or it will fold when the huge bond payment is due in late 2014 or early 2015.

The royalties after Sony starting selling the PS3 was pure profit!. Rumors have always stated that when Sony went with cell processor they ran into trouble and turned to Nvidia to sort it out. Nvidia had them over a barrel and charged accordingly. Other types of semiconductors are sold in a similar fashion. Once the initial proposal is made the buying company agrees to pay $ up from and at different stages of the design to front the cost of the engineers. Then the product goes into production at some margin %. Can be high or low depending on the level of the design ...i.e. competing firms can or cannot do it. Even some are done on royalty basis. Note: the engineers are not a fixed cost....they move on to other designs wins and repeat the process. The one thing AMD does have is a lot of decent CPU/GPU engineers...well maybe not near as many as before. I see no reason why AMD didn't have a similar deal, but probably low margin on the production simply because they were desperate for the deal. But rest assured they will make money on it...just how much I don't know. Probably not enough to earn enough cash to payoff their 2014/2015 bonds when due but just perhaps enough so they can sell some more debt. Note: If it is aroyalty agreement...fab space is not a consideration because Sony handles the manufacturing with their fab partner...Toshiba like in the PS3 deal. Problem is there is just no information available on how the deal is structured so I guess we have to wait until Q4 of 2013 to judge the success.</Msg><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1363387734035</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 18:48:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363387910883-94</Id><Topic><Title>NVIDIA: We Let AMD Power the PS4</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1363377088856</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 15:51:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"there is just no information available on how the deal is structured " then lets stick to the info we do have...

"Compared to gaming PCs, the PS4 specs are in the neighborhood of a low-end CPU, and a low- to mid-range GPU side," said Nvidia's Tony Tamasi to TechRadar. As Nvidia's senior vice president of content and development, he sees the PS4's specs as outdated, even today. "If the PS4 ships in December as Sony indicated, it will only offer about half the performance of a GTX680 GPU (based on GFLOPS and texture), which launched in March 2012, more than a year and a half ago." --It only gets worse Tamasi also notes that consoles, by definition, are closed platforms and not upgradeable. "What you get today in terms of performance is what you're stuck with five - 10 years down the road. PCs don't have these problems," he told TechRadar. "They are open and can be upgraded at any time to harness the power of newer GPUs for more performance and to take advantage of newer, modern graphics technologies." The gap between console and PC gaming has become more apparent this console generation, and Tamasi expects more of the same when PS4 and Xbox 720 get here. "If history predicts the future, then these next-generation consoles, while being more powerful than the current ones, will very quickly end up more than an order of magnitude behind the PC." --PS4 not worth the cost to Nvidia The comments from the Nvidia senior vice president are noteworthy because they aren't just from an industry rival trying promote PC gaming vs PS4. The remarks come from the same company that powers the PS3's graphics chip. Nvidia isn't buying into the PS4, however. Sony announced specs that include an eight-core AMD processor and a custom Radeon GPU. "I'm sure there was a negotiation that went on," Tamasi told GameSpot, "and we came to the conclusion that we didn't want to do the business at the price</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1363393310859</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 20:21:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363393335231-113</Id><Title>XC - Seriously Enlighten Me On AMD's Profit From PS4 Console Deal</Title><Msg>Hi XC, I thought you might take issue with I wrote...so I chose to unignore you to see what you would say and perhaps provide a reference for you to calculate the profit so here goes: "Finally, we have strong design wins for our embedded and semi-custom APUs.

That may be,but in reality negative never works with the end user too. People don't buy a product because someone else bashes the competition. They buy a product because someone else praises the virtues of it. It's like stock board postings. Postings that bash another stock is not a way to present the virtues of your own stock In reality, I just can't believe it will take the CEO to present the virtues of Nvidia rather than the negatives....i.e. what they can't or won't do. I miss Mike Rayfield....he was always so positive on Nvidia and very seldom if ever spoke about the competition. Probably got a few of those design wins just by his approach and personality. It's been written that the AMD console VP Nvidia hired did the same for AMD. Perhaps they hired him not only for his intimate knowledge but for his negotiation skills!

You have found so many reasons that NVIDIA is poorly managed. I am surprised you are still in this stock (Are you still?) If you can't take it, just fold your position and move on. This much whining would ruin any strongman's health.

Tegra sales far behind targets... Don't know about that.....He left and took a two week vacation and landed in a very sweet job with Micron so it was prearranged. As to Tegra sales far behind target......not the way I remember. Besides he had 2 or 3 levels of VP's over him in the mobile division. How have they been doing since he left? I haven't heard of too many design wins have you? Great chip though but that comes from the Engineering Side....Not Marketing and Sales! Again, I guess Jensen Has to step in March 19th and tell us all the positive things. Marketing is just too busy on other things.</Msg><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1363399329426</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 22:02:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363402142468-121</Id><Topic><Title>NVIDIA: We Let AMD Power the PS4</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1363377088856</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 15:51:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yes, I'm still in the stock Ibexx. And if you know anything....the reporter as well as Tony knows that Nvidia does not have a CPU other than Tegra that may only be two generations away from being comparable to AMD's custom AMU. Therefore an appropriate way to respond would have been...It would have cost us too much money to make a CPU powerful enough right now to fit PS4 specs. GPU no problem. Therefore we declined because we have all this stuff which will be revealed shortly. Simple and honest. But alas Jensen will do his job March 19th.</Msg><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1363402142468</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 22:49:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363403635050-122</Id><Topic><Title>Using "Opportunity cost" as an excuse in this context doesn't make sense</Title><Username>lostamericanpride</Username><Timestamp>1363347764260</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 07:42:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That is not the definition of opportunity cost. Opportunity cost is an intra-business concept which is self pertaining. It has nothing to do with comparative cost. What you seem to be referring to is comparative advantage which is inter-business. At any single instance in time a businesses capacity is FIXED which means your total output is fixed - so, you can either spend that capacity on all of A or all of B or some combination of the two but NOT both. Now, unless I am completely misreading Nvidia's words here, which I doubt, Nvidia is simply saying we could either do A (consoles) or B (something else - grid, tegra etc) but not all of both and it seems to me that they're (based on they're on words) are betting B will give them a higher ROI.</Msg><Username>brokeagain73</Username><Timestamp>1363403635050</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 23:13:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363404688628-123</Id><Topic><Title>Using "Opportunity cost" as an excuse in this context doesn't make sense</Title><Username>lostamericanpride</Username><Timestamp>1363347764260</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 07:42:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>" I just can't understand how they could not want to find a way to compete in this space." So that's your argument? You think they should do it? News flash: They already did. Xbox1 and PS3. They know what the business is. AND THEY WALKED AWAY.

When all your arguments fail, put a label on that poster, call him/her an option trader or someone else. I thought you told the board that getanid and ibexx were the same poster - now what happened to that theory? Hmmmm? The tension of owning NVDA stock seems too much for you to bear. You have displayed all signs of near mental breakdown, I kid you not! Here is my advice again: sell all your stocks including those penny oil like Kodiak, and buy yourself a CD. Does grandma know what you've been doing?</Msg><Username>moorelawyer</Username><Timestamp>1363405358196</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 23:42:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
