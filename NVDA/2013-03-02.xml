However, by the end of the year, we might be in a better position to #$%$ how much of a performance gap there is between Apple Ax and Tegra 4/5, if any, and which one is leading. As you mentioned, if there is enough of a performance gap in favor of the Tegra SoCs, anything is possible - even Samsung could come back to NV as a customers.

Apple obviously did not feel threatened enough by Tegra 3 which had double the A9 cores of its A5 chip to go Tegra 3. If it wants to add more performance it can produce a quad-core Swift chip and up the clockspeed on process shrinks. Apple is more likely to go Atom than Tegra as how could Nvidia guarantee it the volumes anyway but neither is likely now it has gone down the path of building its own ARM core which no doubt it will continue doing at 64-bit. Everybody else can forget doing Apple's chips especially as it is clearly negotiating fab space at TSMC for Swift production at 28nm and 20nm and lower.</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1362255072511</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-02 15:11:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362255908020-14</Id><Topic><Title>Getanid - why do you hide??</Title><Username>chitownbarber20</Username><Timestamp>1362233023716</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-02 09:03:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Apple will get any capacity leftover from their top customers.

No, TSMC will negotiate guaranteed wafer volume for Apple just like Samsung did who built a fab in the US for Apple which tells you all you need to know about how far foundries will bend over backwards to get the production volume of the world's richest IT company.

Intel has to sell $250 chips or margins will implode and fab layoffs will start. I suppose they are waiting for the new CEO. Note: Ortelina did the same when he took over. Now an ARMH vendor for a few pennies can build at one to two process nodes larger than Intel equivalent in performance. So what have you left to complain about. Oh I got it the power...but did you see the videos of the power meter showing .9 watt on the Tegra 4 while running 1080P videos. I haven't seen any Intel chips with power meters hooked up while running 1080P video. have you? If you have please post the link or hunker down for what you know is coming.

It works across all Operating systems and processors. It's a revelation. Viva Open Source. Of course we only have what Nvidia says Tegra 4 is...but let's benchmark against that number...i.e. 4592. Rest assured that the Truth will come out. but realize that $225 for an I5 mobile chip is 10 times to much to pay when compared to an A15 ARMH chip vendor like Nvidia.
