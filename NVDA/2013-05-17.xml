I think all the tablets using versions of Windows 8 hinge on whether Outlook can be used on that device. IMO, the Surface RT lack of use of Outlook really made the first tablets less attractive along with the price. I don't the chipset matters as much as the MS staples one can use on a particular tablet. I know that the lack of Outlook on Surface was keeping me from taking a serious look at Surface RT. So I'm believing MS is finally realizing they have to give more on RT which would make Tegra 4 a greater possibility for all the tablets concoctions by MS and help keep the costs down (when compared to Intel's first offerings).</Msg><Username>roundhouse_c</Username><Timestamp>1368767681610</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 01:14:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368769048936-4</Id><Topic><Title>Who Is Pre-Orderring A Shield?</Title><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1368765245491</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 00:34:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I wont be preordering it but will likely get one at some point.

I think the good games will come later once game system devices come out in a decent number and start having android games built around a controller. Most don't see android as a possible game system because touch screens and remote controls can only do so much and that's what the experience has been so far. Also, I don't think a lot of gamers know of the quality of the equipment in the system at the moment. If they knew more about it they probably wouldn't scoff at it quite so much. Still $350, even for a quality handheld is really pushing it to far for most gamers.

That 2.3 GHz figure is what is claimed for the S800. 1.6 GHz Octa still outperforms 1.9 GHz S600 and the fact that they actually got a 1.6 GHz 28nm quad-A15 into a phone, and it benches like it can use all 4 cores in Geekbench, is a minor miracle and should give you hope for Tegra 4 phones. Samsung's 28nm is brand new and just started ramping which is the reason for the shortage. When Intel's LTE chip XMM7160 is available in volume they will drop the S600 all together and use the Octa everywhere once they have their 28nm process fully ramped. No chance of Nvidia being used, sorry. browserDOTprimatelabsDOTcom/geekbench2/compare/1904492/1950328</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1368824161163</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 16:56:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368825005574-35</Id><Topic><Title>Only 1 out of 10 Galaxy 4S is powered by Samsung's own Exynos 5 octa</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1368818602235</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 15:23:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ibexx, do you think at the point Tegra starts pulling away from the pack that Samsung and Apple will be forced to use Tegra for high-end performance? When it comes to advanced gaming performance and other desirable features that Stark would offer, along with competitive pricing, it would be hard for them to resist especially with the ongoing bad-blood between them, and with the development costs sky rocketing for every iteration. I know both have more than enough money, but time, and not having the needed/desired performance features that Tegra would offer, along with the possibility of others having better performance would weigh in very heavily?.</Msg><Username>chitownbarber25</Username><Timestamp>1368825005574</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 17:10:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368832017116-36</Id><Topic><Title>Who Is Pre-Orderring A Shield?</Title><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1368765245491</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 00:34:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Typo: SHIED = Shield</Msg><Username>barjonicat</Username><Timestamp>1368832017116</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 19:06:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368837689145-37</Id><Title>Never let a design-win product become a prisoner of your invesment!!!</Title><Msg>Cheers!</Msg><Username>followon</Username><Timestamp>1368837689145</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 20:41:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368849525972-38</Id><Topic><Title>Who Is Pre-Orderring A Shield?</Title><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1368765245491</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 00:34:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sounds like lugging an Xbox, a controller and your 60" TV around for on demand games is a great idea - go ahead id!@#</Msg><Username>ltenow</Username><Timestamp>1368849525972</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 23:58:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
