I doubt there will be hard financial numbers revealed at the GTC - perhaps some conceptual outlook for 2013 results in the context of myriad new products. Market could still react positively to news re. Project Denver update with concrete timetable and meaningful details; new partnership with tech heavy weights; pricing information on prospective new products. I really don't think the GTC will be considered an appropriate time/place to announce new design wins. However, I would be happy if I am wrong.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1363667109439</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 00:25:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363667220981-3</Id><Topic><Title>Market not expecting much from tomorrow's presentation...</Title><Username>mslans</Username><Timestamp>1363619697011</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 11:14:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Anyone else care to guess what the financial news will be tomorrow?

OK here's my guess if Marketing makes the Presentation For Jen-Shun First Slide: On the left I want to show you all the things we can't do and on the right I want to show you all the things we won't do. 2nd slide Trust us! Now I don't really think that will be shown as I described so here's what should happen First slide Project shield: price and specs Pre-order on now Ship Date 2nd Slide 2013 full year guidance for both GPU and Tegra Processor business units some break out on how they get the numbers 3rd slide Non GAAP Op Ex spending Non-GAAP Tax Tate Full year Non-GAAP earnings estimate Then the magic words: "Myself and all my top manager's bonus and RSUs and stock option grants for 2013 are tied to this plan because we are Shareholder friendly! 4th slide Accelerated Share buyback program in 4Q history and current program $ amount. Let it be huge Why: We believe in the future and OUR OPTIONS ARE UNDERWATER. Well maybe not the options underwater part but it's a real incentitive for management do a big share repurchase program If it's a dog and pony show with ONLY TAMS, SAMS, etc. with no meat on the bone in the way of actual projections then what can I say......just a waste of time!

(EA), a casualty of shrinking sales as the industry gears up for new consoles no one is sure shoppers want. Chairman Larry Probst, 63, who ran Electronic Arts until 2007, becomes executive chairman and will lead management as the board seeks a new CEO, according to a statement yesterday. The Redwood City, California-based company, the second-largest U.S. game publisher, rose as much as 7.9 percent after saying Riccitiello, 53, will leave at the end of this month. “He lasted a pretty long time given that the company hasn’t really performed that well,” said Edward Woo, an analyst at Ascendiant Capital Markets in Irvine, California. “The fact that their stock is up on the news goes to show investors weren’t that big a fan.” Sales have fallen in three of the past four quarters Bloomberg data show, and the company said yesterday that fourth- quarter results will miss its previous forecast, which had already been lowered in January. “My decision to leave EA is really all about my accountability for the shortcomings in our financial results this year,” Riccitiello said in a blog posting. Riccitiello, a former Sara Lee Corp. executive, compiled a mixed record at Electronic Arts, nurturing winning franchises like “FIFA” soccer while commissioning expensive releases such as the multiplayer “Star Wars” and “Medal of Honor” that failed to meet expectations. The company flubbed the latest version of its popular “SimCity,” which some users couldn’t play because Electronic Arts’ computers were overwhelmed, said Woo, who rates the stock neutral.

NVDA said it will introduce what it called its first complete system of hardware and software, an offering designed to move graphics-heavy computing chores from desktop systems to the cloud. The Silicon Valley company calls the forthcoming product the Grid visual computing "appliance," a server-style device that is packed with Nvidia graphics chips and runs software that normally requires expensive workstations that typically reside in company offices. Nvidia said the approach means that users of, say, Apple Inc.'s AAPL Mac laptops or inexpensive tablets running Google Inc.'s GOOG Android software can remotely tap into programs that now only run on PCs running Microsoft Corp.'s MSFT Windows operating system. "They can all effectively have a powerful workstation on their desk," said Jen-Hsun Huang, Nvidia's chief executive, during the company's annual technology conference here. Besides creating animation or other graphics content, the technology can also be used to show them off, Nvidia said. Audi AG, NSU.XE -1.71% for example, demonstrated how a tablet user could view and manipulate realistic three-dimensional renderings of new cars, inside and out. Nvidia said the Grid system would be available in May from authorized dealers, starting at $24,900 for the hardware, plus an annual software license of $2,400. The company also provided new details of its chip roadmap. For its graphics chips, Mr. Huang described a future chip—code-named Volta—that will exploit a new technology for stacking memory chips to save space in a system and move data more quickly back and forth. For its Tegra mobile chip line, Nvidia described three future chips. One, dubbed Logan, will be the first to incorporate an Nvidia technology called CUDA that has been used for non-graphics chores in massive supercomputers and other systems, Mr. Huang said. Another chip coming later, called Parker, will be the first to take advantage of transistors using a new three-dimensional design known as FinFETs. Intel Corp. INTC -0.80% is the only company delivering such transistors today, but chip manufacturing services such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., 2330.TW -0.50% Samsung Electronics Co. 005930.SE +2.08% and Globalfoundries Inc. have vowed to follow suit. A third Tegra model, dubbed Kayla, is designed to draw extremely little power and combine graphics with an extremely powerful processor based on technology licensed by ARM Holdings ARM.LN -2.61% PLC, Mr. Huang said.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1363719071885</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 14:51:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363719251220-39</Id><Topic><Title>"AMD upgraded by Macquarie on videogame opportunity"</Title><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1363657556789</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 21:45:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What's is Nvdia doing with that PASS on PS4 nonsense?

It also will include CUDA, Nvidia's programming model for GPUs that allows users to do many tasks at once. Parker, meanwhile, will be Nvidia's first processor from its Project Denver push. That includes full 64-bit capabilities, making it more attractive for use as the brains in one's computer or in a server or supercomputer. Nvidia first started talking about Project Denver during the Consumer Electronics Show in 2011, but it hadn't provided many updates since that time. Parker also will incorporate a Maxwell GPU, Nvidia's next-generation architecture. "In five years time, we'll increase Tegra by 100 times," Huang said. "Moore's Law would suggest an eightfold increase." Nvidia today is hosting its GPU Technology developers conference. Traditionally known for making graphics processing units found in computers and game consoles, Nvidia has been counting on its Tegra mobile chips to help offset weakness in its core PC market. So far, it hasn't been enough. Its presence in smartphones has been minimal, and the bulk of Tegra sales are for a couple of tablets, the Google Nexus 7 and the Microsoft Surface. In addition, Nvidia now is facing more competition in the tablet market." cnetDOTcom/8301-1035_3-57574952-94/nvidia-ceo-unveils-next-two-gens-of-tegra-dubbed-logan-parker/</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1363719784841</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 15:03:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363719841368-44</Id><Title>"It May Be Time For Microsoft To Cancel Surface RT"</Title><Msg>"It May Be Time For Microsoft To Cancel Surface RT" "Smartphones and tablets based on Microsoft's Windows operating system aren't selling very well.

By all accounts, Tegra 4 is the best SoC on the market, as far as next gen chips. By independent benchmarks, it will outperform all competitors, to include QCOMs Snapdragon series. But, as evidenced by Google's decision to use QCOM for the Nexus 7, Tegra 4 isn't being awarded many design wins, despite the independently verified performance advantages. Honestly, I'm thinking Tegra 4 is looking like a bust. I love the capabilities of the chip, but for whatever reason, manufacturers aren't. So, I'm naturally questioning the marketability of another chip, with even greater peformance ability, if there is no market for it, or demand on the part of manufacturers. To be honest, at this point, I'm more excited for T4i's ability to take marketshare away in smartphones, as well as NVDA's plans for new GPUs and GRID capabilities. I don't work in a graphics intense field, but after watching the presentation today, I couldn't help but be impressed with the new processing capabilities that NVDA will be offering companies in the near future. I was expecially blown away with the instantaneous rendering of the visual effects work, doing in 1 second what currently takes over three hours to do. I'm still long on the company with a substantial position, but I find myself slowly putting more faith into the transformation of their GPU abilitiy in relation to business efficiency more than I do their abilities in SoC and mobile. I sincerely hope they prove me wrong.</Msg><Username>delano_00</Username><Timestamp>1363726557376</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 16:55:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363726718986-74</Id><Topic><Title>Passed on selling 8 cyl turbo charged engines for a Porche like outfit out of my garage because its TOO EXPENSIVE</Title><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1363370010802</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 13:53:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>May have to pass on supplying parts for space ships to Saturn too, I AM TOO BUSY TO WORK FOR MONEY just like Nvidia and besides I don't have NO STINKING SPACE SHIP PARTS TO SELL just like Nvidia has no 64 bit CPUs. lol imho</Msg><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1363726718986</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 16:58:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363727279878-75</Id><Topic><Title>Tegra 5 in 2013?</Title><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1363722356668</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 15:45:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This is ridiculous!

The presentation was terrific, and perhaps many of the PMs were too busy watching their entire positions to watch either part of this during market hours, but how anyone who DID see it could not be VERY impressed (esp. with the VCA) is beyond me. Then his explanation of the company's game plan for the business, and why they're investing as they are due to a "once in a lifetime opportunity, which is NOW or NEVER") was equally compelling to me. I'm sure some were hoping to hear about the launch date and pricing of Shield, but I think they're holding that back until PAX East, this weekend. So, today wasn't the day, and I'm sure Mslans and a few others will continue to think nothing will move this stock, but it will happen, and when it does it will come out of nowhere and you'll have missed the first 10-20%, in a matter of days or a week or two, if you leave now.

Let's see how they do on execution, but the concept is good. Just one note: 1000 Nvidia VCA's brings in as much revenue as 2M Tegras or 10 million cheap radios. Yearly site license revenue for the software is a good thing too.l Looks like a drop down a couple of notches in the importance of mobile computing to Nvidia for 3 months or so. Of course you go with what you got right now. No financials....Big Disappointment....Analyst's questions still show much confusion about Nvidia.

The second-generation Nexus 7 is expected to launch in May and without the orders, Nvidia may lose almost eight million processor shipments in 2013, the sources noted. Nvidia shipped over 10 million Tegra 3s for tablets in 2012 with six million units supplied to Google for the first-generation Nexus 7. The rest of the volume was shipped to players such as Lenovo, Acer and China's white-box players, the sources said. The sources believe pricing is not the reason Asustek turned to place orders to Qualcomm as Nvidia's and Qualcomm's chips have a similar price level and is likely because of the chips' communication chip integration process. Although Nvidia has released the Tegra 4i with an integrated 4G LTE chip, the processor was not able to catch up with the second-generation Nexus 7's launch schedule.: Source: Digitimes</Msg><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1363734273144</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 19:04:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363734387645-113</Id><Title>The companies represented at NVIDIA's GTC 2013 are mighty impressive</Title><Msg>THe list includes Apple, Neflix, Chevon, Tesla, Pixar etc. SOURCE: From Twitter</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1363734387645</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 19:06:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363734552427-114</Id><Topic><Title>"Nvidia may lose almost eight million processor shipments in 2013"</Title><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1363734273144</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 19:04:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Nvidia shipped over 10 million Tegra 3s for tablets in 2012 with six million units supplied to Google for the first-generation Nexus 7."

CEO Jen-Hsun Huang was visibly anxious to unveil the company’s Volta, their upcoming GPU targeted for a 2016 release. “Volta is going to solve one of the biggest challenges facing GPUs today, which is access to memory bandwidth. We never seem to have enough!” Huang told the attendees. “This is unbelievable stuff.” Unbelievable indeed. The Volta GPU will introduce stacked DRAM (dynamic random access memory). On a technical level, this is accomplished by having multiple layers of DRAM stacked atop each other on the same silica substrate, then drilling a hole through the silicon and connecting each layer. But what does this mean in layman’s terms for graphic artists, video editors, animators and gaming enthusiasts? 1 terabyte per second of memory bandwidth. 1TB/s of memory bandwidth means you could move the contents of a jam-packed Blu-ray disc through the chip in a mere 1/50th of a second. Consider that NVIDIA’s Titan GPU — its latest high-end graphics card — can handle about 288GB/s, and you can only imagine the positive implications for a wide range of people depending on graphics processing horsepower, from game developers to graphic artists. Obviously it’s too soon to expect a price tag or firm release date, but NVIDIA’s GPU roadmap looks exciting.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1363735423764</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 19:23:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363735541577-121</Id><Topic><Title>Tegra 5 in 2013?</Title><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1363722356668</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 15:45:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That's why you have an ignore button next to each post.

Let me lay it out there for you. I will take any and all questions to help clear it up for you." Then at the end when he took even more questions he seemed to get annoyed with them again as they wanted more and more detail. He then replied, that he didn't know what to tell them, he spilled his guts out and they wanted more detail. (assumption that they still don't get it) Just my 2 cents from the call.</Msg><Username>z24_z24</Username><Timestamp>1363735704238</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 19:28:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363735757870-123</Id><Topic><Title>"AMD upgraded by Macquarie on videogame opportunity"</Title><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1363657556789</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 21:45:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Who had the presentation today QCOM, AMD or Nvidia?

If Logan on 28nm, it's very possible it will come out by end of 2013 because it is the integration of designs on same proved technology. QCOM's only possible chance to compete with NVDA is their new chip on 20nm to compare NV's at 28nm. Most likely, NVDA won't sit idle for 20nm either. Expect QC to experience a dire threat from NV 2014. NV showed the great products roadmap so device makers are more likely to pick them and stick with them.</Msg><Username>satoricia</Username><Timestamp>1363741285584</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 21:01:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363741308500-141</Id><Topic><Title>Tegra 5 in 2013?</Title><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1363722356668</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 15:45:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>what's the matter? you don't like 'potentials' anymore?

I'm not discounting this quarter being a down quarter, because Jen has said as much as well. If you are 'man' enough to admit you are wrong when we have the products announced the next couple of months, which AGAIN Jen stated would be announced by the different vendors in the investors call, as is always the case and not by Nvidia, then I would take you seriously. Anyone that posts in the pattern you post, after stating clearly you sold out, really isn't someone to be taken seriously. The question should be for someone like yourself, why waste the time on some 'pie in the sky' company? Are you that insecure that you have to spend your nights posting and griping over and over again. Nothing else to do? In fact your comments seem to be bent on distorting anything that is clearly stated by Nvidia and the articles posted here. So in any case, no need to ignore you, if you showed some integrity as an investor.</Msg><Username>roundhouse_c</Username><Timestamp>1363749018340</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 23:10:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363749027661-151</Id><Topic><Title>Windows RT is a DUD, not merely because of compatibility, but because its SLOW.</Title><Username>will_amd_yu</Username><Timestamp>1363748691746</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 23:04:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Win RT devices's major drawback is lack of access to Win legacy applications, thus having a restricted ecosystem.
