Read all about it, boys. Apple expected to ship 850K iPad minis in first week of sales Friday, November 02, 2012, 07:56 pm By Mikey Campbell As the first iPad mini preorders are being delivered and the tablet hits shelves at brick-and-mortar retailers, shipment forecasts are already being released, with one analyst estimating a total of 850,000 units will go out to consumers over the device's first week of sales. In a report obtained by AppleInsider, well-informed KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said Apple will likely ship around 850,000 iPad minis in its first week on the market, based on supply chain checks and logistical considerations such as transportation. Kuo believes that had mass production started sooner than mid-October, the tablet would have seen higher first-week shipments. As it stands, Apple is in short supply of the 7.9-inch device as about 950,000 units were manufactured prior to launch, a statistic reflected in shipment quotes from the Online Apple Store. The analyst goes on to say his forecast would put Apple at the top of the mid-size tablet market, with shipments outperforming Amazon's Kindle Fire HD and Google Nexus 7, two of the mini's biggest competitors. In the first two days after launch, iPad mini shipments are expected to reach the Fire's half-month shipment numbers and surpass the Nexus 7's average monthly shipments for the fourth quarter. Amazon forecast shipments of its 7-inch tablet to hit 6 million in the fourth quarter, but Kuo doesn't believe will happen. He said that suppliers are beginning to see a slowdown in shipment momentum for the Fire, as well as the Nexus 7, and added that the larger 8.9-inch Kindle Fire HD is now suffering from production problems. Kuo sees lucrative holiday quarter shipments at 8.2 million for the iPad mini, followed by 4.5 million for the Kindle Fire HD, and 1.9 million for the Nexus 7. Going further, the Fire and Nexus will both see respective month-to-month declines of 47 percent and 52 percent, while iPad mini shipments will grow 11 percent over the same period due to increases in supply. After selling out of its initial preorder allotment within hours, Apple conducted its largest product launch ever on Friday as the iPad mini rolled out in 34 countries. Though Amazon's forecast is more than the chart (6M for 4Q12), very likely Amazon can't do it. Many suppliers are feeling the shipment momentum of Kindle Fire HD and Nexus 7 is becoming slow. The other not good news for Amazon is the 8.9" Kindle Fire HD has production problem now."</Msg><Username>todays.best</Username><Timestamp>1351973500568</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 16:11:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>52</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351973732208-8</Id><Topic><Title>Sales of the Genuine Apple Mini blow the doors off the tegra-powered Nexus 7</Title><Username>todays.best</Username><Timestamp>1351973500568</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 16:11:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Let the whining begin about this and that, right boys?

Advanced Micro Devices this week announced a plan to begin developing ARM-based processors targeted at the server market, in an attempt to diversify away from the core battle with Intel for the x86 PC processor market. That’s an interesting move, but one which might have deeper implications than simply trying to evade its eternal tormentor. UBS analyst Steve Eliscu thinks the odds are against widespread success for AMD in ARM server chips. “AMD will be challenged to compete vs the existing ARM-based suppliers, especially those who have an architectural license and can best optimize for performance and power consumption,” he writes in a research note this morning. “However, we believe AMD’s shift towards ARM better positions it to be sold at some point in the future to a leading ARM processor vendor. While few would dare compete vs Intel in x86, AMD offers an existing ARM supplier thousands of engineers that could provide it a huge boost.” In a sense, he’s arguing that that AMD would be a good target for an “acqui-hire” deal for a company in the chip business that wanted a ready stable of experienced microprocessor engineers. And as it turns out, there are some additional goodies hidden in AMD as well. AMD Jumps Into The ARM Server Business Roger Kay Roger Kay Contributor AMD Cutting Staff 15% Eric Savitz Eric Savitz Forbes Staff AMD: Bernstein Gives Up, Cuts Rating And Target Price Eric Savitz Eric Savitz Forbes Staff Eliscu asserts that an AMD buyer would get some useful assets that could justify a “significant premium” to its current enterprise value: A big design team, including thousands of engineers. Broadcom picked up 250 engineers in paying $3.7 billion for NetLogic, he notes. “Possible buyers of AMD could include: a major Korean semiconductor maker to augment its processor development efforts; Apple, which in addition to processors could also vertically integrate in graphics; Qualcomm, which would have better capability to provide processors for PC clients and servers/communications infrastructure,” he writes. Graphics: He thinks the graphics unit could be worth $2 billion or more to Intel. “If Intel made AMD-designed discrete graphics chips in its most advanced manufacturing facilities, Intel would potentially be able to create a much more profitable discrete graphics business than AMD has,” he writes. “We would expect Intel to focus on the premium segment of the market, including the professional graphics business, which NVIDIA currently dominates.” Embedded processors, in particular for game consoles: “Market speculation suggests AMD has swept design wins in all of the three major console platforms – Microsoft, Nintendo and Sony, each of which would result in a either IP and/or silicon sales,” he writes. “ If we estimate the business will be sustained at $500 million/year, given the low-opex intensity of the business on a go forward basis, even a blended 30% gross margin business could yield operating margins in excess of 20% or $100 million/year. If we assume a 7-year product life-cycle, this would result in a pre-tax present value of $500 million. Patents: He notes that AMD has over 4,400 non-expired patents, which he thinks could be worth somewhere between $1 billion to $2.1 billion, depending on what comparable transaction you use. Net operating loss carryforwards of nearly $1 billion. “While the price highly depends on the buyer, we believe AMD offers enough value to justify a 100% premium to its current $2.2 billion enterprise value, an offer that we believe the board would need to strongly consider,” he writes. Eliscu keeps his Neutral rating and $2.75 price target on the stock.

The result is a chip that in general doubles the performance of the chip in the iPhone 4S, the “A5,” while being more power-efficient than ARM’s own top-of-the-line CPU, the “Cortex A-15.” That lets Apple use a smaller, lighter battery in the iPhone 5 compared to other phones, among other things. Apple has spent hundreds of millions of dollars in acquisitions to bring in the development teams to develop the new CPU over the last few years, probably half a billion at least. Apple was able to beat Samsung Electronics to market with this latest chip generation, something that may have made the effort worth it. It appears that the end result will be that Apple ships a Cortex-A15–class CPU about three months before archenemy Samsung. These three months happen to come during the big holiday buying season, during which time the iPhone 5 could generate $20 billion in revenue. So that half a billion dollars could be money well spent." Did Jen not buy the blueprints? To that ARM Cortex A-15 CPU.
