Perhaps you find the Words of Cramer, well, irritating to your delicate sensibilities? And so you may decide to ignore the words of Jim Cramer, if you wish. But rest assured. The other Six Million (6,000,000) astute traders viewing CNBC sure won't. Which reminds me. One of the 101 uses for Duck Tape? To hold down the "Sell" button while the trader visits the Gentleman's Room. Time IS Money, don't u know.

I think with the macro events turning positive, there will be a tendency to look at this data as half full. The percentages listed are enough to support the full too. Any analyst that really understands the numbers can see the percentages are better then the losses due to shrinkage of the overall market. And if you did listen to the guidance in the CC, Jen actually said he is being conservative with the numbers. The guidance was only down a fraction compared to Intel fr example.</Msg><Username>roundhouse_c</Username><Timestamp>1353998624385</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 01:43:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353999334891-6</Id><Topic><Title>Top tech gifts so far this year, according to Media Buzz</Title><Username>ibexx88</Username><Timestamp>1353995462600</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 00:51:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Think you mean #3 &amp; 7, unless 9 uses Nvidia too . .

Thanks for posting that great CNBC video of Jim Cramer's Lightning round. I particularly liked that part around 2:47 in the video. Where he speaks about nvda. "The stock has been doing ABSOLUTELY NOTHING, which is a Problem." "It's a VERY EXPENSIVE STOCK that isn't performing." I have created a short-cut on my desktop, so I can watch and re-watch it. Over and over -- at my leisure. Perhaps other readers at home would like to do the same? Here it is again : Lightning Round - CNBC Mon 26 Nov 12 After you Google it, just right click, and pick "Create shortcut". And Presto! -- It's saved on your desktop for future reference.

Thank you for all your alpha pieces as they help outline the situation. It is far easier to get aggresive when cash represents almost half the stock value of NVDA. Add to that the many, many oars nvda has in the water and the existing business will be the backbone making this a safe investment; meanwhile the various new initiatives only need the pie to grow to allow a huge spike in earnings down the road. I cant say I totally understand why the market works the way it does and does not price firms accordingly (often it seems participants do not understand or want to do the work to understand the potential) , but time and time again we see funds (aka 'real money') waiting until AFTER a company is well on its way to huge profits before getting in. That's fine... it gives us 'little' guys a chance to get in early and wait for more conservative money to pour in and drive up the price later.
