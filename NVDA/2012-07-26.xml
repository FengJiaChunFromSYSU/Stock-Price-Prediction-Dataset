The flagship handset, codenamed HTC Era 42, is said to feature a new Tegra 3+ processor bumped up to 1.7GHz. HTC’s One X already comes in two flavours, an LTE-enabled version powered by Qualcomm’s S4 processor for the North American market and the Tegra 3 based international version. Now it seems the colonies will get a tweaked Tegra 3 as well. We still don’t know the exact specs, although the rumour mill has been abuzz with Tegra talk lately. It seems like nothing more than a 200MHz bump and we doubt it will be enough to outpace Samsung’s quad-core Exynos 4.</Msg><Username>frankduxbusborg</Username><Timestamp>1343290117000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 04:08:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343301207000-3</Id><Topic><Title>T-Mobile HTC One X to get Tegra 3+</Title><Username>frankduxbusborg</Username><Timestamp>1343290117000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 04:08:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nice digging!

Apple is planning to release a smaller version of its wildly popular iPad tablet shortly after the next-generation iPhone launches this fall, one industry watcher believes. Plugged-in KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who purportedly shed some light on “iPhone 5″ specs recently, says that Apple’s next iPhone will launch in September followed closely by the release of the much-rumored “iPad mini.” “IPhone 5 to debut in September,” Ming-Chi wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday. “But due to in-cell touch panel and casing yield rate limits, ability to offset older models’ shipments decrease will be moderate.” The analyst continued, “Though shipments of iPad mini’s components will start in August, the new iPad line will end production, ready for transition to a modified New iPad line. As such, component shipments will drop in August as iPad mini’s components shipments growth will be offset.” Ming-Chi’s not that a tweaked version of Apple’s current third-generation iPad will be released around the same time mirrors earlier reports, which claimed Apple is planning some internal redesigns that address heat issues and reduce Apple’s costs. According to earlier reports, the iPad mini will be as thin as an iPod touch and will feature a 7.85-inch display and a price ranging from $249 to $299. The redesigned sixth-generation iPhone is expected to feature a 4-inch display, 4G LTE, NFC, and a redesigned case that was recently examined on video." Sounds like Really Bad News for the sale of those nvidia Tegra-powered Android devices, boys. -</Msg><Username>ibest.here</Username><Timestamp>1343310144000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 09:42:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>20</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343310159000-16</Id><Topic><Title>Windows 8 graphics: Microsoft has hardware accelerated all the things</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1343306084000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 08:34:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Face it, Apple and Samsung are now joined at the hip, even though you don't want to believe it.

"I can take over your phone," Miller said. Near field communications allow users to share photos with friends, make payments or exchange other data by bringing Android phones within a few centimeters of similarly equipped devices such as another phone or a payment terminal. Miller said he figured out how to create a device the size of a postage stamp that could be stuck in an inconspicuous place such as near a cash register at a restaurant. When an Android user walks by, the phone would get infected, said Miller. He spent five years as a global network exploit analyst at the U.S. National Security Agency, where his tasks included breaking into foreign computer systems." ....

"Looks like Sameer's tablet OS predictions have now been completely torpedoed. Hot off the press: "According to the latest research from Strategy Analytics, global tablet shipments reached 25 million units in the second quarter of 2012. Apple rose to 68 percent global market share, its highest level for almost two years." The iPad has increased its marketshare from 62% a year ago to 68% this last quarter. In comparison, Android tablet shipments have plunged back to 29.3% exactly the same share they had 12 months ago. The plummeting share of Android tablets recorded in Q1 2012 has been shown to be no outlier. The iPad's marketshare has actually increased in Q2 to its highest level in almost 2 years. Got that? There is no accelerating smartphone Android marketshare land grab in the tablet world even despite all the latest iPad-killers. The Kindle Fire was a flash in the pan and it is highly likely the Nexus 7 will be similar, competing as it does against the lower cost iPad 2, the iPod touch and the rumours of smaller screen iPads and larger screen iPod touches."</Msg><Username>amdshortsrfools</Username><Timestamp>1343314073000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 10:47:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343314955000-20</Id><Topic><Title>Nexus 7 will lead Android tablets to overtake ipad</Title><Username>ibexx88</Username><Timestamp>1343313780000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 10:43:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good article, thanks for posting</Msg><Username>norcalnative_2</Username><Timestamp>1343314955000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 11:02:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343316083000-21</Id><Title>no warning fat cakes</Title><Msg>amazing non-action in the stock price...</Msg><Username>smallstock1</Username><Timestamp>1343316083000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 11:21:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343317387000-22</Id><Title>Ah yes, RMBS now a $3 stock...a multiyear low</Title><Msg>on its way to $2, $1, and delisting.....

First of all if you are holding since the split (per your own post) then you are really underwater since the last split was in late 2007 well in to $30's (split adjusted) and the stock has been in the gutter eversince. So again explain how you made money holding NVDA since the split. Second, if you were an old timer then I would've remembered you unless you changed your screen name. Third show me one post you have contributed to this board linking a useful article. Fourth you are/were not trading NVDA as it is clear you dont know anything about trading. If so then you would have known that NVDA has'nt captured any of its meaningful MA's since Feb. Fifth, not that it is any of your business but I am long NVDA. Given your lack of experience I suggest you put everyone on ignore and only follow ibexx's posts; besides if you are an experienced longterm investor then why are you so afraid wasting time here. Last but not least here I throw you a bone. NVDA is at its longterm decade old support at around $12 and chances are rather slim for it to break down. Just relax and give it a year or maybe less. But short term it is not behaving as it should. Dont waste my time anymore and put me on ignore.</Msg><Username>roydirect2003</Username><Timestamp>1343330154000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 15:15:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>24</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343330293000-41</Id><Topic><Title>Chitownbarber, who died and made you board's Biatch</Title><Username>roydirect2003</Username><Timestamp>1343324241000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 13:37:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You are another chit4brains.</Msg><Username>amdshortsrfools</Username><Timestamp>1343330293000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 15:18:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>23</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343330512000-42</Id><Topic><Title>Chitownbarber, who died and made you board's Biatch</Title><Username>roydirect2003</Username><Timestamp>1343324241000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 13:37:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Btw, you are a new "character" for the longs since the 21st?

BTW, that kind of talk is not one of a long holder of Nvidia as you claim to be? Not that any of this is your business, but I've been holding a substantial amount of shares since before the two splits, along with some active trading trading when the price dips to the low teens, and did some selling in the 16 - 18's. Also I have been actively buying leaps for the past couple of years with a very substantial recent purchase of '14 calls @ 15. All in all, I have made some very good money over the years. I have contributed a number of Nvidia articles here over the years. Not anywhere near Ibexx, or Getinad, but enough for you to find if you cared to look. I'm sure some here can back me up on my contributions. Given the lack of substance on your last post, I suggest you put a little more effort in future posts that reflect your position in the stock you say you have so you don't confuse yourself as one of the regular drive-by losers. In a strange way I like reading all the various blather from the regular "Slack Pack" crew. Although I have put all of Besty's numerous aliases on ignore because his schtick has become very old and redundant. That boy needs some serious help! I just like reminding the infidels know what king of fools and idiots they are.
