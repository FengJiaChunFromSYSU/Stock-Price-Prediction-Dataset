Its GeForce line of graphics cards is essential for playing some of the most popular computer games today. We expect NVIDIA to maintain its advantage in the gaming segment in the foreseeable future. This apart, recently the company launched the GeForce GTX 570 and GTX 560 Ti, the most advanced GPUs for gamers. This enhancement in the GeForce series is expected to attract more customers in the near future, increasing NVIDIA s market share. This integration of the CPU with the GPU is expected to result in a power efficient chip, which may help the company to further strengthen its position in the gaming market. Moreover, in March 2011, the company introduced NVIDIA PhysX technology. This was first incorporated by Funcom's Dreamworld 2.5, a leading game engine for massively multi-player online games (MMOGs). Dreamworld Engine 2.5 will help double the speed of in-game physics processing compared to the traditional client-side PhysX technology. Hence, the demand for the abovementioned graphics card is expected to increase both from local manufacturers and International players. NVIDIA being the market leader is expected to grab a major chunk of this pie.</Msg><Username>a36ftsloop</Username><Timestamp>1345015907000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 03:31:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345015970000-7</Id><Title>ZACKS reason to BUY Part 2</Title><Msg>Although gaming is the key to NVIDIA s growth, computing is becoming increasingly more visual, given the new-age tablets that are seeing tremendous demand. Software increasingly relies on a visual user interface rather than text. For example, Windows 7 requires much more graphics resources than its predecessor as it leverages improved graphics capabilities to improve user experience. This trend is very positive for a company like NVIDIA, which is the leading producer of graphics cards with a very broad range of products.</Msg><Username>a36ftsloop</Username><Timestamp>1345015970000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 03:32:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345026910000-8</Id><Topic><Title>How big of a position do you guys have?</Title><Username>sparks1112222</Username><Timestamp>1344984385000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 18:46:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm holding 14,600 shares and as of now 30 Aug 13 calls I picked up for .72 so atleast they doubled. I picked up a few thousand shares at high 9's but the majority on the way down from 26 at the average price of $13sh so I'm only up 12% overall. I've been holding NVDA for over 10 years right after they started. Its been boom times and bust times many times after I learned about options in 2004 and made a ton of money, all of which I lost in March of 2005 with the market downturn. :) I'm a strong believer in the company and Jen, and I'm more excited going forward with their success in the mobile space. For such a small company to have such massive market penetration against the likes of TI and Qualcomm really shows you their innovation. Best of Luck with your trades!

When Android becomes defacto standard, it should take over that old space too. iOS tax is just old skeleton under new clothes. I would almost suspect that nvda might be successful even though they can't ever get into aapl and samsung. However, 1. Jen is an audi kind of guy and that just doesn't fit 2. nvda does not have the expertise and ip to do single chip solutions that the ultra low price appliances demand. we haven't really since what low prices can do yet, will not get really interesting until 2 or even 3 years out.</Msg><Username>whosunw</Username><Timestamp>1345034134000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 08:35:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345034985000-16</Id><Topic><Title>Kindle Annuoncement This Week</Title><Username>snakeplizkn</Username><Timestamp>1344980574000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 17:42:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>if just the 7", should not affect nvda much, this sells into the same market segment as Nexus.

"I will go point-by-point in countering Tegra’s prospective drivers, and give you reasons why the stock still doesn’t look like a convincing investment. The Surface and the Nexus 7: Not Enough NVIDIA’s Vice-President of Investor Relations, Rob Csongor, said that the quad-core Tegra 3 is popping up in “some of the world’s most exciting mobile devices.“ The names he took after that – the Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) Nexus 7, the Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Surface and a quad-core, LTE powered, smartphone by Fujitsu that’s selling in Japan. If I have to call some mobile devices exciting, it would be the iPhone and the iPad from Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Samsung’s high-end smartphones. The Nexus 7 has opened to terrific reviews, and has been doing so well that Google has had trouble keeping up with demand. But the Nexus is no iPad or a Samsung tablet and I don’t expect it to propel NVIDIA’s top line through the sky. Again, if we are talking of a 7-inch tablet, the discussion would remain incomplete without a mention of the next generation Kindle Fire from Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), which is rumored to be powered by the Tegra. The Nexus 7 has been primarily aimed at the spot after the iPad, which Kindle Fire successfully held last year. With a refreshed version on the way, Nexus 7 will again have some serious competition to contend with. Although NVIDIA would be happy to see its chips inside both the #2 tablet contenders, competition among the two might also have a negative effect on one of them. Also, I can’t finish talking about 7-inch tablets without making a reference to the purported iPad mini from Apple. If Cupertino does decide to come to the 7-inch tablet party, and there’s a good chance of that, the Nexus 7’s and the Kindle Fire’s prospects will certainly be dented big time. And again, as I said, NVIDIA is competing through tablets belonging to the second rung of the ladder so far, way behind what Apple and Samsung sell. And finally, how successful the Surface from Microsoft will turn out to be is a big doubt. To me, it seems an experimental product at best which is trying to strike a fine balance between a computer and a tablet. Consumer acceptance of the Surface will play a major role in driving NVIDIA but what price consumers would like to pay for Microsoft’s latest adventure remains to be seen. Where are the smartphones? What I’m going to write here would seem like an extended story of the previous part. “Illustrious” smartphones powered by NVIDIA are the HTC One X and the Fujitsu phone mentioned earlier. If these are flagships on which the company is looking to ride the mobile boom, chances of success would take a solid beating. A Samsung Galaxy design win would have given me some solace as NVIDIA is far away from an iPhone slot since Apple uses its own chips. But Samsung, which used to be NVIDIA’s customer, has also gone in-house with its Exynos processor. With both the smartphone and tablet bellwethers looking away from NVIDIA, I don’t see much space for the company to flex its muscles in the mobile revolution as of now." Poor little Tegra. None of the Big Buyers want it. Kinda like the stock too, right boys? -</Msg><Username>i_read_best</Username><Timestamp>1345075025000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 19:57:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>30</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345075144000-100</Id><Topic><Title>Toshiba is basically kicked out of the Win RT club</Title><Username>antonirkusk</Username><Timestamp>1345071300000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 18:55:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Meant to say that More support with uniformly high standard would be better." still agree... more support the better for RT...</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1345075144000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 19:59:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345075760000-101</Id><Topic><Title>Kindle Fire to be 10 Inches</Title><Username>snakeplizkn</Username><Timestamp>1345060235000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 15:50:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>As long as it is in the 10 inch we're golden.</Msg><Username>snakeplizkn</Username><Timestamp>1345075760000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 20:09:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>16</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345076069000-102</Id><Topic><Title>NVDA: Analysts' recent ratings updates</Title><Username>ibexx88</Username><Timestamp>1345042480000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 10:54:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Bbb bbb but there is some unknown guy on Mötley Fool desperately trying to justify the failure of his past outlook, nobody posts that LOL</Msg><Username>snakeplizkn</Username><Timestamp>1345076069000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 20:14:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345076251000-103</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft Surface for Windows RT tablet coming Oct. 26th for $199?</Title><Username>chitownbarber22</Username><Timestamp>1344964216000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 13:10:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Marketing of the Surface should start to ramp after Labor Day.</Msg><Username>snakeplizkn</Username><Timestamp>1345076251000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 20:17:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345077951000-104</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft Surface for Windows RT tablet coming Oct. 26th for $199?</Title><Username>chitownbarber22</Username><Timestamp>1344964216000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 13:10:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Let's assume that Microsoft probably has a bit more experience in selling products directly to consumers than Google does - at least let's hope so.

Again signs point back to driver issues which could mean that Dell and Samsung might jump ship to nVidia if they cannot get them sorted out." true dat</Msg><Username>eir951</Username><Timestamp>1345080065000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 21:21:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>17</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345080074000-107</Id><Topic><Title>As expect NVIDIA will dominate Windows RT launch</Title><Username>ibexx88</Username><Timestamp>1345079140000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 21:05:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>NVDA can swoop in and save the launch date, I like it.</Msg><Username>snakeplizkn</Username><Timestamp>1345080074000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 21:21:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>16</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345080110000-108</Id><Topic><Title>As expect NVIDIA will dominate Windows RT launch</Title><Username>ibexx88</Username><Timestamp>1345079140000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 21:05:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ya beat me to the punch</Msg><Username>eir951</Username><Timestamp>1345080110000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 21:21:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>16</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345080777000-109</Id><Topic><Title>As expect NVIDIA will dominate Windows RT launch</Title><Username>ibexx88</Username><Timestamp>1345079140000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 21:05:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I have nothing against NVIDA enjoying a grand slam at RT launch, but I can't speak for others on the board.

You can be pretty sure Asus, Lenovo et al will want firm Surface pricing commitment from msft before they sign POs for their tablets.

They were wrong. It hasn't happened. On the contrary, Apple's iPad actually GAINED 11.5% market share during the second quarter of 2012. Yep. Apple took +11.5% market share in just the last 90 days, boys. And that's BEFORE the industry crushing iPad Mini is released in just a few weeks. Apple might get to like 95% of the entire tablet market at this rate. http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20120815PR203.html "Apple during the second quarter shipped 17 million iPad 2 and new iPad media tablets, up 44.1% from 11.8 million in the first quarter, according to the HIS. This industry-leading increase in shipments translated into a market share gain of 11.5 percentage points, as Apple's second-quarter global tablet share climbed to 69.6%." "In July of this year, Apple exceeded the 85 million mark for iPad tablets sold since the product's launch in April of 2010. In contrast, Samsung, Apple's closest competitor, has shipped [a mere] 13 million total tablets." There is no mention of the cummulative production for the other stastically insignificant little Android tablet makers. WOW! An 11.5% market share gain by Apple in just the last 90 days. That's a MASSIVELY LARGE, ENORMOUSLY HUGE GAIN, right boys? It sure is. -</Msg><Username>ibest.here</Username><Timestamp>1345087597000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 23:26:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>35</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345088772000-116</Id><Topic><Title>Apple iPads Gain 11.5% Market Share in 2Q</Title><Username>ibest.here</Username><Timestamp>1345087597000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 23:26:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The point of the article is that the tablet market is still units infancy, and NVDA based products such as Surface and Nexus 7 could unseat Apples dominance.
