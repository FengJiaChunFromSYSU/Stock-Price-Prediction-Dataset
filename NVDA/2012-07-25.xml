And boy, that APQ8064 really doesn't disappoint, but it should be no surprise -- we've already seen how the top dual core S4 chipsets already beat their quad core competitors in certain aspects, so it's only natural for the quad core S4 Pro to annihilate them. As you can see in our chart after the break, the APQ8064-based MDP EASILY BEAT THE TEGRA-3 based One X and Nexus 7, as well as the Exynos 4412-based Galaxy S III. And partly thanks to the Adreno 320 graphics core, the MDP even scored an astonishing 132fps in our GLBenchmark test, while the quad core Galaxy S III with Mali-400 graphics came second with 99fps, with the remaining devices lingering around 60fps only. Obviously, the question remains how big of a trade-off there is on battery life in exchange for those two extra cores and the more powerful graphics chip. That said, we have a feeling that Snapdragon's Krait architecture and asynchronously clocked cores will again prove that Tegra 3's 4-PLUS-1 design ISN'T THE BEST solution for battery efficiency -- as many of you might already know. We shall see when APQ8064-based products become available later this year.

Worth to reread: http://blogs.nvidia.com/2012/06/tegra-3-brings-googles-nexus-7-tablet-to-the-masses-2/ ...Tegra will be in well over 30 devices this year. Among them are tablets – such as the ASUS Transformer Prime, Transformer Infinity Pad TF700, and Transformer Pad TF300; Acer Iconia Tab A110, A510 and A700; Toshiba Excite 7.7, 10 and 13 – as well as super phones, like the HTC One X and LG Optimus 4X HD. For now, I’d really like to focus on what makes the Nexus 7 so amazing. KAI provides a recipe for tablet-makers looking to build low-cost tablets with a premium experience. KAI’s basics include the Tegra 3 quad-core mobile processor with its unique fifth battery-saver core, and system-level innovations like PRISM – a new Tegra 3 technology that reduces a mobile device’s backlight intensity (and power) while simultaneously enhancing color saturation. The result: undiminished visuals with longer battery life. This will be an exciting year. Stay tuned. /Frank.</Msg><Username>frankduxbusborg</Username><Timestamp>1343215711000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 07:28:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343217116000-16</Id><Topic><Title>Issues with Nexus 7 - Poor Google</Title><Username>mohsinu1</Username><Timestamp>1343197152000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 02:19:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Speaking of failures, why are you up so early? did you wake up from a nightmare that your government checks were cut-off and you actually had to get a job?</Msg><Username>chitownbarber22</Username><Timestamp>1343217116000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 07:51:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343221189000-17</Id><Title>CNETNewsMobileExpert claims Google's Nexus 7 display has flaws</Title><Msg>"Google's popular Nexus 7 tablet has display issues, according to an expert. First of all, let's be clear: Google seems to have a certifiable hit with the Nexus 7 tablet and reviews have mostly been positive, if not very positive. And there have been no major complaints from review sites about the display. That said, Raymond Soneira at DisplayMate Technologies says the tablet's display "falls short." Not mincing words, he says in a new blog post that he knew "something was seriously wrong" when he looked at the standard photos that DisplayMate uses to visually evaluate displays. "Many of the images were noticeably washed out -- they looked like over exposed photographs with missing highlights, reduced image contrast, and weak colors," Soneira wrote. But I was curious why these shortcomings weren't showing up in reviews -- and why Soneira seemed to be contradicting himself when he told me that the display itself was "high quality." So, I asked him to clarify this. Here's what he said. The LCD panel itself is excellent. Good luminance, high Contrast Ratio, excellent Color Gamut and Color Saturation. So the raw LCD display itself is great. The problem is that the factory calibration of the display parameters (generally performed via firmware) is way off (particularly the Intensity Scale) so the images that appear on this fine LCD display look washed out...the display produces washed out images and colors in spite of the fact that it has a display with excellent color saturation and contrast. Similarly, a great camera will take poor quality photos if it isn't properly factory calibrated." http://news.cnet.com/8301-1035_3-57479059-94/expert-claims-googles-nexus-7-display-has-flaws/</Msg><Username>amdshortsrfools</Username><Timestamp>1343221189000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 08:59:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343223701000-18</Id><Topic><Title>CNETNewsMobileExpert claims Google's Nexus 7 display has flaws</Title><Username>amdshortsrfools</Username><Timestamp>1343221189000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 08:59:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>LOL.

They must have hired a bunch of people from CNN and FOX news in their technical department. They had 12 additional months after the T3 to get the it right and they didn't :). It beating the T3 on performance is not so surprising especially coming to market a year later - it will take another 3 to 6 months before you see real products in any volume.
