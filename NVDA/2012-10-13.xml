For example, here's what bigonnvda didn't want the readers to see from that Motley Fools article -- A Mountain of Cash and a Bargain Price! "At the beginning of 2012 Nvidia commanded 15.7% of the GPU market, compared to a 24.8% share for AMD and a 59.1% share for Intel. The market as a whole is in decline, with volume declining 3.5% from 2011. This is tied to the general malaise in the PC market. In the mobile market Nvidia faces even more competition. Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) is the market leader, capturing 31.4% of the market in 2011. Qualcomm's Snapdragon processor is used in a huge number of devices, including Android and Windows phones. Nvidia has a small market share of just 3%, although more tablets than phones have adopted the Tegra chip. There is certainly plenty of space for Nvidia to grow its mobile business, and with a declining PC market the company will need to. The Death of the PC The days of paying for costly software upgrades are numbered. The PC will soon be obsolete. And BusinessWeek reports 70% of Americans are already using the technology that will replace it. Merrill Lynch calls it "a $160 billion tsunami." Computing giants including IBM, Yahoo!, and Amazon are racing to be the first to cash in on this PC-killing revolution." The PC business is dying, boys. And unfortunately -- nvidia is a PC parts supplier. Meanwhile, the mobile business is growing rapidly. Unfortunately, nvidia is only a miniscule bit-player in the mobile chip arena. Where according to bigonnvda's own article, nvidia "has a small market share of just 3%" Compared with Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) the mobile market leader, capturing 31.4% of the market in 2011. Conclusion: nvidia has some cash -- so what? nvidia is, and will remain, a supplier of PC parts to the dying PC business. And that's just not where folks want to be investing their money Period.</Msg><Username>bestropolis</Username><Timestamp>1350106044659</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-13 01:27:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350109327316-2</Id><Topic><Title>Amazon preemptively disclosed PaperWhite tablet's shortcomings before release</Title><Username>ibexx88</Username><Timestamp>1350101801914</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-13 00:16:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ah, yet another Sour Grapes routine from ibbey.

If it's gonna be Bad -- and it will be -- clean house and make it Really Bad. So for example, that mountain of Tegra 3's that just aren't selling? Write 'em down. Like Jen did with the Tegra 2's. By taking a "One-Time Inventory Adjustment". Except of course, it happens once a year like clockwork. And it optically makes the CPB (Tegra) Division look like it's doing better than it is. Much better. That "One-Time Inventory Adjustment" charge is an Extraordinary Item charge. Which comes off towards the bottom of the Income Statement, -- not the CPB op. income line. So if Jen writes down, say half of the Tegra 3 inventory down to a buck each, it makes the subsequent quarter for CPB opticially appear much better. 'Cause the CPB would be selling written-down inventory with an artificially lower cost. And the slower sheep cheer -- mostly because they don't get the game. And somehow think that margins magically improved in just one quarter. The game is a lot like the one with the pea and the three shells, actually. Did I mention? "Never have a slightly bad quarter."</Msg><Username>in_best_we_trust</Username><Timestamp>1350135166071</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-13 09:32:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>12</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350138556328-7</Id><Topic><Title>Motley Fools</Title><Username>bigonnvda</Username><Timestamp>1350081357114</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 18:35:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>hey Best, you should send your reply here into Motley Fool so that the can foot note their article.</Msg><Username>bigonnvda</Username><Timestamp>1350138556328</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-13 10:29:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350138736839-8</Id><Topic><Title>LIKE AN APPLE: MICROSOFT WILL DESIGN THEIR OWN ARM CHIP INTEL DOOMED</Title><Username>eastofeastside</Username><Timestamp>1350062580700</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 13:23:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So Best?

The Asus Vivo RT is up for pre-sale for $599 with 32GB of memory. I think the entry level of the Surface RT will be $399, matching the price of the "old" iPad. I think it might be even cheaper if bundled with a subscription to the expanded Xbox Live service (or whatever they brand the music/video subscription service as). I think $299 might be the target price with a 1 year subscription. At $299 that'd be just about $10 below the estimated BOM and manufacturing estimates I've read online. Do a search for "Microsoft Surface RT &amp; Pro: BOM &amp; Price Estimate" to see a representative estimate. If they add a small margin they could still be at $349. Microsoft has made it clear they aim to capture mindshare and marketshare in the tablet space. I believe that they understand the urgency in doing this before Windows becomes even more irrelevant in the platform war, which is increasingly Apple vs. Android. I think they'll look to some sort of a penetration pricing strategy to regain relevancy and make Windows a viable tablet OS.</Msg><Username>thetrade50</Username><Timestamp>1350159689096</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-13 16:21:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350160241716-15</Id><Topic><Title>LIKE AN APPLE: MICROSOFT WILL DESIGN THEIR OWN ARM CHIP INTEL DOOMED</Title><Username>eastofeastside</Username><Timestamp>1350062580700</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 13:23:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I should add that I think the "Xbox Live" (or a rebranded media subscription cousin) will be targeted at the consumer version.

According to Bloomberg, U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) Judge Thomas Pender said in Washington on Thursday that "clear and convincing means something to me," speaking about the legalities of determining whether a patent should or shouldn't have been issued. "I have to be pretty darn certain a U.S. patent is invalid," Pender added. HTC accused Apple of infringing two patents relating to 4G technologies. While the current iPad (aka the iPad 3) already boasts 4G connectivity -- available only in North America, which led to Apple being chastised by U.K. and Australian regulators for dubbing the device as "4G" when it could not connect to local networks in their regions -- the forthcoming iPhone is thought to include the next-generation network standard. Apple is widely expected to announce the iPhone 5 at a press event this Wednesday. If Apple is found to have infringed HTC's patents, that could lead to a U.S. import ban on the iPad and iPhone 5, or give HTC enough ammunition to push for a settlement with Apple, which has its own patent claims filed against the Taiwanese smartphone maker. The two companies have been locked in legal tussles for the last three years. After Apple sued HTC over iPhone patents in March 2010, the ITC's initial ruling came down in Apple's favor, stating that HTC had violated two of Apple's patents. In 2011, HTC fired off its own patent lawsuit against the iPhone and iPad maker over Wi-Fi-related patents. HTC sought an import ban of Apple's line of Macs, iPads, iPods, iPhones, and other Wi-Fi enabled devices. Earlier this year, HTC scored a victory over Apple at the U.K. High Court, after a judge ruled that three of the four Apple-owned patents in Europe were invalid. HTC was not found to have infringed the fourth patent, which related to photo management software. While HTC is not the healthiest of companies in the smartphone space, the firm still holds a 6 percent stake in the U.S. smartphone market; partially thanks to Research in Motion's dwindling down the top five smartphone makers, as the BlackBerry maker continues its struggle for relevance and market share in an already burgeoning smartphone sector.</Msg><Username>findingnemoyes</Username><Timestamp>1350160402426</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-13 16:33:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350161704971-17</Id><Topic><Title>U.S. judge: HTC patents likely valid in Apple suit</Title><Username>findingnemoyes</Username><Timestamp>1350160402426</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-13 16:33:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This news was out more than a month ago.

A tough question with no easy answers</Title><Msg>With the chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices once again on the ropes and about to make some significant cuts to its personnel, and with chatter about a major restructuring in the works, the rumor mills will inevitably turn once again to the speculation about who, if anyone, might interested in buying it. .... The one name that has come up repeatedly is Qualcomm, though others are certainly mentioned from time to time, including PC maker Dell. But for the sake of keeping things simple, let’s stick with Qualcomm. Known primarily as the supplier of chips for wireless phones, it has in recent years expanded significantly into supplying ARM-based processors for notebook PCs running Windows RT. Dell and Samsung are said to be customers of Qualcomm’s line of chips. Qualcomm is said to covet the server market, where, not so long ago — well, about five years ago, anyway — AMD’s Opteron chips were competitive enough to cause significant headaches for the market’s perennial dominating force, Intel. AMD knows the server business well enough, the argument goes, that its expertise could be turned toward helping Qualcomm bring an ARM-based alternative to the server market. AMD also has strong ties with chip foundries upon which Qualcomm and numerous other so-called “fabless” chip companies rely to build its chips. AMD has historical ties with the world’s second largest foundry, GlobalFoundries. That company is essentially the former manufacturing arm of AMD, spun out in a complicated transaction that included investments from the sovereign wealth funds of the Arab state of Abu Dhabi in 2009. On top of that, AMD also owns a portion of the leading-edge 28-nanometer manufacturing capacity of the world’s largest chip foundry company, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp, a.k.a. TSMC. (news to me!) Qualcomm, the thinking goes, can’t help but be tempted, for the manufacturing relationships alone. And with AMD shares trading within 92 cents of its most recent historic low, its market capitalization has dropped to below $2 billion. Even after assigning a gentleman’s premium of 50 percent, which it wouldn’t necessarily command, AMD could, given its valuation of $1.94 billion as of Friday, be taken out for less than $3 billion. That’s cash that Qualcomm certainly has. But there’s a big piece of the puzzle that most people who speculate about a deal such as this always forget to consider: AMD would be an incredibly complicated company to buy. As anyone who knows their history of the chip industry will you, anyone who even thinks about buying AMD quickly learns that they will eventually have to deal with Intel. For decades, Intel and AMD have operated under a series of complicated and mostly secret patent cross-license agreements that give AMD access to the crown jewels of Intel’s intellectual property — the x86 instruction set. ..... The end result is that any company who reaches a deal in principle to buy AMD, will then have to turn right around and negotiate with Intel. And those negotiations could easily fail and send both parties to court. So, on Monday, or whatever day the rumor mill starts churning out chatter that AMD is going to be taken out, don’t think too hard about it. It’s probably not true.

"either party may assign the licenses granted under this Agreement pursuant to *****, subject to the following conditions:" So the Single Most Valuable License on the Planet IS assignable by AMD. To some other party. Like maybe Qualcomm, perhaps? Our copy is juuuust a little sketchy on the details. The Bottom Line. Someone WILL buy AMD. Why? Because without AMD (or their successor or assigns) making those Intel x86 licensed chips, Intel could easily be deemed to be a {Gasp! Shall I use the M word?} a Ma-Ma-Ma-Monopoly. Today it's Intel, with licensees AMD and VIA, whoever the heck they are. And without AMD, well, it's an unspeakable scenario, really. That's why Intel needs and must keep the AMD x86 license going. And rest assured, they will.

If AMD were acquired, I think the news would likely spark speculation that NVDA is a takeover target as well, just like when AMD themselves acquired ATI.
