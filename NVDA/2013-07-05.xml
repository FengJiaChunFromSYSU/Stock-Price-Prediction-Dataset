It literally offers no advantages over an Intel powered Windows 8 tablet; not in battery life, not in performance, and certainly not in flexibility. The only "enterprise" users of the ill-fated Surface RT are the poor souls at ARM itself, and the rest of the world will be enjoying full Windows 8.1, "Bay Trail" tablets/cheap notebooks by the end of the year. In short, if Windows tablets become popular, then this means a broad tablet market share shift in favor of either Intel or AMD (AMD). Not so great for ARM's multiple. Further, Intel will also be playing in the Android tablet space with its Bay Trail part, although I suspect that ARM's licensee Qualcomm (QCOM) will do its damnest to keep Intel Outside of the Android tablet turf that it worked so diligently to steal from Nvidia (NVDA).
