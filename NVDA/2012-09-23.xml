When is Trash Day, boys? You'll want to be sure to put the Tegra 3 out by the curb after seeing these benchmark tests, -- conducted by AnandTech, the gold standard of benchmarking -- of the Apple self-designed A6 processor which powers the Genuine Apple iPhone 5 vs. the nvidia designed tegra 3 processor which powers the HTC One X cellphone. Google this: The iPhone 5 Performance Review by Anand Shimpi AnandTech on 9/21/2012 . Let's take a look at those benchmarks, shall we? . 1. GL Benchmark 2.5 Egypt Classic (offscreen 1080p) Frames per second -- Higher is Best 91 __ Apple A6 processor (Genuine Apple iPhone 5) 31 __ nvidia Tegra 3 chip (HTC One X) The Apple A6 is 293% faster than the nvidia Tegra 3. . 2. GL Benchmark 2.5 -- Egypt HD (offscreen 1080p) Frames per second -- Higher is Best 27 __ Apple A6 processor (Genuine Apple iPhone 5) 9 ___ nvidia Tegra 3 chip (HTC One X) The Apple A6 is 300% faster than the nvidia Tegra 3. . 3. GL Benchmark 2.5 -- Triangle Texture Test -- Vertex Lit MTriangles -- Higher is Best 86.2 __ Apple A6 processor (Genuine Apple iPhone 5) 27.4 __ nvidia Tegra 3 chip (HTC One X) The Apple A6 is 314% faster than the nvidia Tegra 3. . 4.

Mobile Soc GPU Comparison GFlops as shipped 25.5 __ Apple A6 GPU (Power VR SGX 543MP3) 12.0 __ nvidia Tegra 3 GPU The Apple A6 is 212% faster than the nvidia Tegra 3. . 6.

Did I mention? Be sure to put that Tegra 3 to the curb, boys.

They are not an innovative company at all. They have been milking the same architecture with tweaks for 25 years plus. They will not be able to make inroads into the tablet and phone market. Its already too crowded and other companies basically hate intel because of them pushing everyone around for so many years. They can easily afford to buy nvidia and instantly establish a postion in these key markets. With their foundry capability and nvidias SOC and graphics patents technology, they will be able to once again grow the company. If they try to go it on their own, they are going to continue to lose market share and when project denver comes, they are really going to be in trouble. The fact that MSFT was willing to build their new OS to support an arch different than X86 should tell everyone that even they think its time to move on from intel. I think a merger is a real possibility. It benefits both companies since nvidia is getting squeezed on the graphics side and they are squeezing intc on the tablet/phone side...together they have a real chance...apart, i see intc struggling badly and nvidia making some in roads but not able to establish solid continuous growth. The stock is so cheap, that almost anyone could buy them easily. you only need to put up about 3 billion since they have the other 3 in cash already. What a joke...Can't believe somebody out there is not considering a takeover bid at this point. Probably waiting until the election and then things may happen.
