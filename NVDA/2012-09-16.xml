I seriously doubt it. 'paid pumpers' - that I can very much believe. On the more serious side, I have no doubt that is what Ballmer is being fed with by all the yes-men he must have around him. To pick the right strategy, he will have to rise above all that noise. I have zero confidence that he can do that. If in the next month, Asus and Lenovo fade away, that's a good sign. If Asus and Lenovo make noises, winRT is DOA.</Msg><Username>whosunw</Username><Timestamp>1347813399061</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 12:36:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347815353843-8</Id><Topic><Title>Firmware maker says it could enable dual-boot Windows RT, Android devices</Title><Username>ibexx88</Username><Timestamp>1347806057454</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 10:34:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>IOS/Windows - I run it every day.
