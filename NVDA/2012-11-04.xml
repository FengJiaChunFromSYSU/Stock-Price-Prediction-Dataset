The Google Nexus 7 comes with a 7-inch screen supporting a resolution of 1280 x 800 and a pixel density of 216 ppi. It also arrives with an Nvidia Tegra 3 quad-core processor running at 1.3 GHz, 1 GB of RAM, it’s currently available with 16 GB of storage and you can also pre-order the 32 GB model on the Google Play Store, it packs Android 4.1 Jelly Bean out of the box and a 4,325 mAh battery. The iPad Mini on the other hand comes with a slightly larger 7.9-inch screen, a resolution of 1024 x 768, a pixel density of 162 ppi, a dual core A5 CPU clocked at 1 GHz, 512 MB of RAM and 16/32/64 options of storage. It also arrives with a 5 MP camera on the back, a feature that is missing from the Nexus 7. Clearly and undeniably, the iPad Mini has inferior hardware in almost every aspect, but as we’ve said before, that wouldn’t be a problem if the price would’ve been set accordingly. Unfortunately the “entry-level” Mini costs more than a Nexus 7 by quite a lot, so it will set you back $329. Spec and price-wise, the Mini doesn’t stand a chance against Google’s tablet, but it might take the cake in terms of build quality and design, right? Well, not necessarily. Yes, the Mini is very, very thin and it comes with a nice aluminum case, but Google’s 7-incher comes with a more convenient form factor and the rubbery material used in constructing the case feels very good in the hands. It also comes with a thicker bezel, which might sound like a disadvantage but most of the time it isn’t, simply because with the iPad Mini and its thin bezel, your hands will oftentimes cover up a portion of the screen. In any case, we think that the Nexus 7 wins the battle hands down, but if you wish to see them both side-by side, feel free to check out the video below.

In just Two (2) days on the market, mind you. Witnesseth the Truth for yourself, boys. Google this : Apple expected to ship 850K iPad minis in first week of sales Apple Insider Apple expected to ship 850K iPad minis in first week of sales Friday, November 02, 2012, 07:56 pm By Mikey Campbell As the first iPad mini preorders are being delivered and the tablet hits shelves at brick-and-mortar retailers, shipment forecasts are already being released, with one analyst estimating a total of 850,000 units will go out to consumers over the device's first week of sales. In a report obtained by AppleInsider, well-informed KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said Apple will likely ship around 850,000 iPad minis in its first week on the market, based on supply chain checks and logistical considerations such as transportation. Kuo believes that had mass production started sooner than mid-October, the tablet would have seen higher first-week shipments. As it stands, Apple is in short supply of the 7.9-inch device as about 950,000 units were manufactured prior to launch, a statistic reflected in shipment quotes from the Online Apple Store. The analyst goes on to say his forecast would put Apple at the top of the mid-size tablet market, with shipments outperforming Amazon's Kindle Fire HD and Google Nexus 7, two of the mini's biggest competitors. In the first two days after launch, iPad mini shipments are expected to reach the Fire's half-month shipment numbers and surpass the Nexus 7's average monthly shipments for the fourth quarter. Amazon forecast shipments of its 7-inch tablet to hit 6 million in the fourth quarter, but Kuo doesn't believe will happen. He said that suppliers are beginning to see a slowdown in shipment momentum for the Fire, as well as the Nexus 7, and added that the larger 8.9-inch Kindle Fire HD is now suffering from production problems. Kuo sees lucrative holiday quarter shipments at 8.2 million for the iPad mini, followed by 4.5 million for the Kindle Fire HD, and 1.9 million for the Nexus 7. Going further, the Fire and Nexus will both see respective month-to-month declines of 47 percent and 52 percent, while iPad mini shipments will grow 11 percent over the same period due to increases in supply. After selling out of its initial preorder allotment within hours, Apple conducted its largest product launch ever on Friday as the iPad mini rolled out in 34 countries. Though Amazon's forecast is more than the chart (6M for 4Q12), very likely Amazon can't do it. Many suppliers are feeling the shipment momentum of Kindle Fire HD and Nexus 7 is becoming slow. The other not good news for Amazon is the 8.9" Kindle Fire HD has production problem now." .</Msg><Username>todays.best</Username><Timestamp>1352047940424</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 11:52:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352048176838-4</Id><Topic><Title>Ipad MIni sales appears to be underwhelming.....</Title><Username>ibexx88</Username><Timestamp>1352047508413</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 11:45:08 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>For NVDA's sake, I'd actually hope that the iPad Mini would draw a lot of attention and bring a lot more folks into the big retailers that are offering both the iPad Mini and the Nexus 7.

Why did he resign or was let go? 1. Mismanagement: NVIDIA should have landed one of the following design wins: Kindle Fire HD or LG Nexus 4. Yes Nvidia scored Nexus 7 win. But failure to win a spot in Kindle Fire HD and LG Nexus 4 is a pretty serious flop, as the analysts widely expected a Kindle Fire HD win and LG traded S4 for T3 in Optimus Vu. LG Nexus 4 is a wonderful device at an incredible unlocked price and can operate on global networks without LTE support. Tegra 3 could be an ideal candidate for Nexus 4 with no supply constraints. 2. Historical finale: 2 years ago, S/A spread rumors that Mike Rayfield was out: "Why was a General Manager shown the door? ... Keep dropping the ball at critical points ... NVidia needs to take swift action. ... Please note that this is unlikely to affect anything until after the Tegra 3." Could this be a finale of the play? If NVIDIA can find a capable substitute, Rayfield’s departure could be a long-term positive. Short-tem pressure is building up quickly.
