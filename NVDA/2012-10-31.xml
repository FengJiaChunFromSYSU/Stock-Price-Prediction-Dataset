The two models, designated A1429 and A1442, were approved by the China State Radio Management agency, meaning that the handset is one steop closer to going on sale in that country, reports Chinese language news site Sina (via Unwired View). According to Apple's iPhone webpage, the A1429 model is compatible with China Unicom's 3G network and China Mobile's GSM network, while the A1442 can operate on China Telecom's CDMA bands. China Mobile, the world's largest cellular carrier by subscribership, has yet to officially ink a deal with Apple, though talks are said to be moving forward toward an agreement. Some analysts believe an Apple partnership with the telecom could result in a DOUBLING of sales in the country. A definitive launch date has not yet been announced, however it is believed that Apple will release its newest iPhone by the end of the year. Hong Kong Apple Stores began selling the handset on launch day, Sept. 21, as part of its most aggressive iPhone rollout to date, which is expected to bring the device to 100 countries on 240 carriers by December."

By Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols for Between the Lines | October 24, 2012 Windows Surface RT, like a certain coyote we all know, is destined for failure. I think it's already dead. Oddly enough, we agree on the main point, "It’s more than an iPad, and less than a PC." Where we differ is what that means. He sees it putting RT Surface into a middle-ground. I see it as being neither fish nor fowl; it's not entertaining enough to replace a wildly popular tablet, nor work-friendly enough to replace a laptop. That has far more to do with the software, Windows RT, than it does the hardware. Windows RT, Windows 8 for ARM, is both a confusing mess and crippleware. To be exact, Windows RT is a limited version of Windows 8 that runs on ARM-based devices, not on traditional PCs. It is compatible with most, but not all, of the Metro-style apps that also run on Windows 8. Windows RT will not run any desktop Windows applications beyond the applications that are bundled with the operating system. What are these bundled applications? They're the usual Windows built-ins such as Paint and WordPad, but for some reason Windows Media Player isn't included. It does include, however, Office Home &amp; Student 2013 RT. Unfortunately Office RT comes with restrictions for office use. This suite includes Word, Excel, OneNote, and PowerPoint... but not Outlook. In short, it may look like a Windows 8 tablet, but it comes with even fewer applications than the Windows Phone. You may think I'm just saying this because I favor Linux for the desktop and Android for tablets. Wrong. I'm saying it first because it's true and, as it happens, I'm paraphrasing Paul Thurrott. You may know him as the guy behind Paul Thurrott's Supersite for Windows, arguably the best Windows-specific Web site in the world. There's more though. For example, you can indeed use Flash on Windows RT, but only on Microsoft approved sites with Internet Explorer 10. Chrome? Firefox? Opera? What about them? You can't run them on RT. You can only run applications from Microsoft's Windows Store, they, and most other Windows programs, aren't to be found on its shelves. Thinking about using Windows RT tablets on your business network? You can't do it. Windows RT doesn't support Active Directory (AD). There's not even, and this one surprises me just as much as the lack of AD, a RT native client for Microsoft's cloud-storage service, SkyDrive. Just when everyone is building in cloud storage to their tablet and desktop offerings, Microsoft pulls back from what seems to me to be a perfectly natural and smart move. That's all bad enough that I wouldn't give two-cents for Surface with Windows RT's future, but then there's the pricing and the timing. Those seal the Surface's fate. The entry-level 32GB Surface, without a keyboard, costs $499. With its Touch Cover and Type Cover keyboards, which Bott "can’t imagine using this device without," add an additional $100 to $119 to the tab. The comparable and brand new and exciting iPad 4, without a keyboard, costs $599. On the other hand, lots of business users have no trouble using the iPad for business without a keyboard. Indeed the entire BYOD (bring your own device) to business movement started because of the iPad. It will take a much bigger price advantage than the one Microsoft is offering to sweep iPad users to a Windows Surface RT. But, I really don't know that the Surface was meant to be an iPad competitor. If indeed it's greatest value is with a keyboard then isn't it really a laptop competitor? If that's the case, then why not buy a "real" Windows laptop? A Surface RT with Type Cover will cost you $628. Over on CNET, I found over 740 Windows laptops for that price and below. Now if you really want a revolutionary laptop, which comes with a free, no-restrictions office suite and an amazing price of $249 what you really want is the new Linux and ARM-powered Chromebook. Here's the truth of the matter: the Surface RT isn't good enough, cheap enough, or nifty enough to matter in today's market. It's dead technology as it sits there. The Intel-powered Surface with Windows 8 will probably be better... but they'll cost even more and they won't be out for months yet. With a new full-sized iPad on one front, a wave of 7-inch tablets on another, a new model of desktop computing led by the Chromebook on yet another front, and last, but by no means least, cheaper real Windows laptops everywhere, the Surface RT's only fate will be to end up with the Kin and Zune in Microsoft's hardware trashpile." This Windows RT crippleware thing. Remember when Jen was sayin' it was gonna save nvidia? Boy, was he wrong.</Msg><Username>best.here</Username><Timestamp>1351740240087</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 23:24:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351741988732-25</Id><Title>Surface RT – hands on: new, work, and play</Title><Msg>The chance you take when buying a Surface RT is that you can do all you need using Office, the built-in apps like Mail and Calendar, and whatever you can find in the so-far sparsely populated Windows Store. Windows 8 can be (and usually is) perplexing for users familiar with earlier versions. Surface purchasers get little help with this – Microsoft's line is that detailed help is not necessary. However, once you become familiar with Windows 8 and Surface, it is generally pleasing to use. The transition between the desktop and the modern touch user interface will always be an odd one, but becomes something you accept as normal in this dual personality operating system. The reason you might buy Surface is for its design – this is not just another me-too Windows 8 tablet. Heavy use of custom components and an intensive design process have resulted in an elegant device. A fold-out kickstand fits perfectly and closes with a satisfying click, for example. Microsoft also claim exceptional strength for the device, thanks to the use of VarporMg, which is magnesium processed with a Microsoft-developed technique, along with the usual Gorilla Glass on the screen. Sinofksy proved the point at the launch by strapping on wheels and using it as a skateboard. A near-essential accessory for Surface is a keyboard cover, which comes in two varieties. The Touch cover feels like thin, flexible fabric-covered plastic, though apparently it is formed of seven layers. The keys lack any travel, but with practice you can type at a reasonable speed; I'm using it for this review. The beauty of the Touch cover is that it adds little bulk when it folds over to protect the screen. The Type cover is more traditional, though still elegant, with keys that actually depress making it easier to type at speed. Both keyboards can also fold back under the device so there is no need to remove them when using Surface as a tablet. The magnetic attachment used by the keyboards makes a firm grip, but is easy to attach and detach, another detail that is important to the overall experience.

"All of the accolades and advantages of retina displays work in reverse." •"I don't think the lower resolution is a deal-breaker in this product, but it is a compromise you have to be aware of," writes The Verge. "It simply doesn't look as clear as other products on the market." •"But oh, that screen," concludes CNET. "It's not bad, not at all, but it's not Retina Display.

The other tablets that The Verge and CNET are referring to -- Google's (Nasdaq: GOOG ) Nexus 7 and Amazon.com's (Nasdaq: AMZN ) Kindle Fire HD -- sell for nearly 40% less. Is Apple going to sell a ton of these things? Absolutely. Folks trying to buy them online now are being told to either try their luck at a local store or wait two to three weeks for shipping. Unlike the other new tablet maker using a similar tactic -- Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT ) with its Surface now at a three-week delay for all of its models -- Apple probably is the one that can't really keep up with the initial demand.</Msg><Username>findingnemoyes</Username><Timestamp>1351742260354</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 23:57:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351742315195-27</Id><Topic><Title>Who Does Apple Fire for the iPad Mini Fiasco?</Title><Username>findingnemoyes</Username><Timestamp>1351742260354</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 23:57:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>iQuandary Apple knew that it couldn't pack all of the features of the fourth -- or even the third -- generation of its iPad into the $329 iPad mini. Too many consumers would simply trade down to the cheaper iOS tablet. the launch would be a cannibalization disaster. Somewhere along the way, it was decided that the iPad mini would go with two features -- the slower A5 chip and the 1024-by-768 resolution -- of the $399 iPad 2. If the iPad mini would eat into sales, it would be preferable if it was the iPad 2 that's $70 more than the new iPad that's $170 more. The chip isn't much of a problem. Most consumers can't tell the difference between the dual-core A5 and the dual-core A6X that raises the stakes with quad-core graphics. The same can't be said for the display. Seeing truly is believing, and anyone walking into an Apple Store to see the two devices side by side will see the problem. Apple has spent the last two iPad incarnations pitching consumers on the merits of Retina Display where individual pixels can't be discerned. Now it doesn't want the same consumers that it educated to notice the difference? It's like taking someone on a fine wine tasting, only to wash it down with cooking wine. It's like explaining the finer points of music on the way to a Justin Bieber concert.</Msg><Username>findingnemoyes</Username><Timestamp>1351742315195</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 23:58:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351742355056-28</Id><Topic><Title>Who Does Apple Fire for the iPad Mini Fiasco?</Title><Username>findingnemoyes</Username><Timestamp>1351742260354</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 23:57:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>They're mocking you, Cupertino The competition is starting to sense Apple as vulnerable. You saw it last month when Samsung mocked the iPhone 5 early adopters. Ads made fun of those standing in line for Apple's shiny new smartphone, just as Apple would ridicule PC users a few years earlier. Over the weekend, it was Amazon going on the offensive on its magnetic website's home page, pitting the iPad mini's inferior specs against its much cheaper Kindle Fire HD. Is Apple going to admit that it made a mistake, here? If Scott Forstall was let go as a result of Apple Maps, who will take the fall for Apple craps? It's not just me seeing this, right? The iPad mini's refusal to go high-def is a call that undermines everything Apple has done to get to where it is today. Junk in the trunk Steve Jobs mocked the 7-inch gadgetry as tweeners. He also mocked the manufacturers that would sacrifice features for the sake of nailing a low price point. "We just can't ship junk," he famously said five years ago. "There are thresholds that we can't cross because of who we are." Well? Apple won't win with this strategy in the long run. It's in the company's best interest for it to fail here. Why? Well, if consumers do accept the iPad mini with a display that is inferior to even the $199 tablets on the market, it will only encourage Apple to settle in the future. If shoppers are such lemmings that they'll buy anything with a bitten Apple logo on it, the quality of the company's products will decline in a hurry. In time, they'll smarten up and stop trusting Apple. The iPad mini needs to fail for Apple to succeed. Wrap your head around that until it sinks in. You'll probably agree.</Msg><Username>findingnemoyes</Username><Timestamp>1351742355056</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 23:59:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
