Sporting a 21.5-inch touchscreen display, this device is meant for desktop use, and can be propped up with a kickstand on the back. Inside, the HP Slate 21 AIO runs on the Nvidia Tegra 4 processor, which promises better graphics performance compared with the older Tegra 3. This should come in handy when playing games on the device, which is appropriate given it's meant to be a home entertainment product. We first heard about the Slate 21 when benchmark results appeared online earlier this year. HP has not given the availability and pricing of the new AIO, but said local information will be available when the Slate 21 is launched in each country. ______ PS: HP'a first Tegra 4 tablet was announced in May: HP SlateBook X2 features a 10 convertible tablet to be released in August.

By Michael Rougeau June 17th Asus-made 2nd gen new Nexus 7 peeks out from FCC filing Google Nexus 7 2: Like this, but better? The next-gen Google Nexus 7 could indeed arrive soon, like the rumors say. And the kicker is that the new Nexus 7 will be made by Asus, if a recent FCC filing is any indication. The Federal Communications Commission published a listing that appears to show the full specs for the Nexus 7 2 under the model numbers K008 and K009. Android Authority delves into the legitimacy of the filing and the likelihood of it being the Nexus 7 2, but suffice to say it's looking likely. So let's get on to the specs, shall we? You're welcome The new Google Nexus 7 2 by Asus appears to sport a significant upgrade in the display department, up to 1080p, and more memory at 2GB. It looks like Asus is also switching the new Nexus 7 from Nvidia's Tegra 3 to Qualcomm's Snapdragon S4 PRO. The camera situation is also upgraded from 1.2 megapixels to 5 megapixels on the back, and with a new 1.3-megapixel snapper on the front. NFC, LTE and wireless charging are all new as well, not to mention Android 4.3 out of the box." source: techradar</Msg><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1372076364240</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-24 08:19:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372081682229-7</Id><Title>While Nvidia is being tattooed RED the other GPU outfit is UP</Title><Msg>What was that about $20 any minute and "Going straight up" during that buying frenzy? lol Anyone one here have a clue what happen? imho</Msg><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1372081682229</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-24 09:48:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372081948013-8</Id><Title>That Rally CRY turned from $20 any minute to HOLD $14 Please. lol</Title><Msg>Did yiou dump your Nvidia when you had a chance to dump your Nvidia HIGHER?

After numerous beta version of Nvidia’s Shield console, we were lucky enough to see the final retail version demonstrated by Nvidia's Vice president of corporate marketing Ujesh Desai. We didn’t really spent days with the console, we had a few minutes with this busy man, but it was enough to get a first-hand impression. Ujesh demonstrated that he is a skilled first person shooter player and he showed us how Dead Trigger 2 looks on the final version of the console. The graphics are better than anything we saw on Android so far, and the game is worth of few bucks when it comes out. We also had a chance to see Virtual Tennis and this Android game from the Play Store also looked nice. It was easy to navigate through to Android 4.2.2 and the speaker quality is quite nice. You can use this small device to play some loud music outside, which can’t be said of most tablets, let alone smartphones. We liked the build quality and that Nvidia used a matte black finish that doesn’t really attract finger smudges. In the video, Ujesh demonstrated taking off the magnetic custom tag removal and magnet powered attaching it back. It looks really nice and works well. We also mentioned battery life and Ujesh went in detail about the console's battery life, with some optimistic figures. With gaming PC streaming you should expect 10 to 12 hours, because all the heavy lifting is done on the desktop that sends the end result as a compressed H.264 HD video. If you are doing basic Android gaming, such as some of the older Tegra 3 games, you should expect six to eight hours battery life. With games optimised for Tegra 4 with a lot of visual effects, you can expect 4 to 5 hours, claims Ujesh.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1372102360174</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-24 15:32:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372104994941-27</Id><Topic><Title>AMD and Microsoft Holding Their Own in spite of this Market, Nvidia NOT</Title><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1372087600724</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-24 11:26:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>AMD and Microsoft HELD Their Own, didn't they?

Based on our recent checks across the supply channel, we highlight the impact and reasons why a widely anticipated deal with Apple as a potential foundry customer is becoming more likely,” writes Amir. Among the factors Amir includes are newly installed CEO Brian Krzanich being more open to the prospect of Apple as a foundry customer; having the technology edge in manufacturing over contract foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM); having some excess capacity in new factories that will be rolling out in the next two years; and having already dedicated resources to contract work for other large customers. _____ On the flip side, however, I doubt Apple would allow Intel a hefty gross margin if deal materializes.

Probably, writes Rasgon, Intel is betting not only on its “Core” family of mainstream PC processors, but also on new chips for mobile, such as the forthcoming “Bay Trail“: “We believe the company has high hopes for their forthcoming Bay Trail quad-core Atom chip.” “We hope so too, as the company will need to sell huge amounts of them to achieve growth goals for the year,” he writes. Intel announced on April 16th, following its Q1 report, that it expects revenue growth this year “in the low single digits,” after a decline of 5% or so this quarter. To achieve the year’s target, writes Rasgon, Intel needs to see shipment growth of 12% to 20% in PC microprocessors in the back half of the year. However, “Given atrocious PC results in Q1 (down ~14% YoY, the worst quarter since data collection began), it seems unlikely that this kind of growth could be driven by PCs.” “Rolling normal seasonality out would suggest total PC unit growth down 5-12% YoY, which would suggest unit growth for Intel that is flat, to down 10% YoY in the second half.” Even server microprocessors and mobile chips don’t seem likely to make up the difference, he writes. For server chips to grow by Intel’s suggested “low double digits” this year, the business would have to see 20% or more unit growth the latter part of this year, but “the business has never seen growth on that order for two quarters in a row.” And for mobile, “Intel will need to ship 20-50 MILLION of the chips [Bay Trail, etc.] all in the second half to make up the shortfall from traditional PCs assuming roughly seasonal outlook for Core products.” Rasgon models $53.82 billion in revenue this year, which would be a fraction of 1% growt</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1372111784854</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-24 18:09:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372111835683-37</Id><Topic><Title>Intel's 2013 growth projection doesn't add up, says Bernstein analyst</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1372111784854</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-24 18:09:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Source article: Barrons just in.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1372111835683</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-24 18:10:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372113089700-38</Id><Topic><Title>Intel likelihood of fabbing for Apple rises, says analyst</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1372107934966</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-24 17:05:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good to have 2 sources... Apple has reportedly reached deal with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the world’s largest chip manufacturer, as it continues its efforts to end its business relationship with rival Samsung. According to unnamed sources speaking with Digitimes, Apple has inked a three-year deal with TSMC that will see utilize the company’s foundry services for the upcoming A8, A9 and A9X chipsets. Production of the A8 is supposedly scheduled to begin in small volumes next month for testing, and it will utilize a 20-nanometer process. The A9 and A9X will use 16-nanometer and 10-nanometer processes, respectively, according to the report. Digitimes reported earlier that TSMC will also be building Apple’s A7 processor, which is expected to power the upcoming iPhone 5S. The A8 is then expected to be included in the iPhone 6 and other mobile devices, and the A9 and A9X will be found in Apple’s 2015 and 2016 lineups, respectively.</Msg><Username>chitownbarber25</Username><Timestamp>1372113089700</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-24 18:31:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372114845412-39</Id><Title>Uh oh..

BRCM at risk as Samsung cuts S4 outlook</Title><Msg>Wedge analyst put numbers on the sales deficits. SOURCE: Barrons today Brian Blair of Wedge Partners today reflects on the reports of slowing sales of Samsung‘s flagship Galaxy S4 smartphone, which numerous Street observers have attempted in recent weeks to quantify. Writes Blair, the reported initial sales of 10 million of the device were below even greater expectations on the part of the South Korean giant: ""While 10 million units was an impressive number, particularly given that it was only one Samsung SKU, we understood at the time that the 10 million reported was much lower than Samsung’s own target of 14 – 15 million units for that same period [...] To start, we believe Samsung’s original 1-year unit projection for the S4 was initially in the 100 million unit range. We now believe that number has been cut 10-15 million, and is now in the 85-90 million unit range for the first 12 months. We also estimate that Q3 S4 production had been in the 40 million unit range, but has been cut to approximately 30 million units or roughly 3.5 million less per month for the September quarter. In addition to Galaxy unit declines, iPhone units from June to September quarters over the last two years have been down ~16% sequentially to flat last year. We believe a 5-10% sequential downtick in iPhone units is likely. " Reasons, Blair writes, range from “saturation of high end smartphones in first world markets” to greater competition from devices such as HTC‘s “HTC One” device, also recently released; to “a lengthening in the replacement cycle for smartphone users, who are keeping existing handsets for longer periods of time (longer than 1-2 yrs. The slowing, if true, puts a “cap” on the upside for chip makers, including Broadcom (BRCM), Qualcomm, Skyworka, ST Microelectronics, Maxim, and Synaptics. Broadcom and Qualcomm have the most exposure to the S4, providing NFC, WiFi, and GPS chips in BCOM’s case; wireless modem, power management, and the app SoC in QCOM's case.....</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1372115942362</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-24 19:19:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372117586550-42</Id><Topic><Title>Update for whosunw as requested: QCOM.
