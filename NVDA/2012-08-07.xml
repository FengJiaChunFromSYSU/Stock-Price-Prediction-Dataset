To a PE of 17.11 Which begs the question, is nvda Really worth that nose-bleed multiple? 17.11 times earnings. The answer of course, is found in Relativity. How does nvda's multiple compare to other, better companies in their sector. In a relative sense. So let's compare earnings multiples, shall we? Price/Earnings Ratio Trailing twelve months earnings Source: Yahoo Finance 17.11 __ nvidia 14.98 __ Microsoft Corporation 14.63 __ Apple Inc. 14.44 __ IBM 13.01 __ The Entire Semiconductor Industry 11.31 __ Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd 11.17 __ Intel Corporation 7.27 ___ Hewlett-Packard Co. Is nvda Really worth 17 times earnings -- where Apple is valued at a PE of 14.6? Hummm? Or is nvda worthy of a multiple 6 times Higher than Intel or Samsung Electronics? The answer: Nope. It isn't. nvda is shrinking year-over-year in the only Department that matters, -- the Earnings Per Share Department -- and the others are Growing. Take Apple for example. First Call EPS Estimates for the year are as follows: $27.68 __ Actual for YE 9/30/11 $44.16 __ Consensus for YE 9/30/12 Really really nice growth in Apple earnings, right? And it trades for a multiple of 14.63 times earnings. Now let's compare that to nvda. First Call EPS Estimates for the year are as follows: $0.94 __ Actual for YE 1/31/12 $0.69 __ Consensus for YE 1/31/13 nvda's earnings are Shrinking. And shrinking badly. According to the consensus of First Call analysts. Yet it trades at a nose-bleed multiple of 17.11 Did I mention? Irrational Exuberance has driven nvda to a ridiculous multiple. Again. And accordingly, Best today started a new short position in your precious nvda. Again. Seriously. Oh, and thanks to all those nice folks that lent Best your nvda shares. Best promises to take good care of them -- paying any dividends which have never been declared in nvidia's 18 year history -- and return 'em just as soon as the Irrational Exuberance has been wrung out, and the coming PE multiple adjustment is complete. -</Msg><Username>epic.best</Username><Timestamp>1344312291000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 00:04:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>49</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344318263000-2</Id><Topic><Title>Seriously, is nvda Really worth a PE of 17.11?</Title><Username>epic.best</Username><Timestamp>1344312291000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 00:04:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wow... the all- wise market places a greater value on NVDA than most tech stocks.. thanks for pointing that out... you have waste several years of your life bashing the industry leader...</Msg><Username>mikeywalson</Username><Timestamp>1344318263000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 01:44:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>25</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344318987000-3</Id><Topic><Title>Seriously, is nvda Really worth a PE of 17.11?</Title><Username>epic.best</Username><Timestamp>1344312291000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 00:04:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>- "First Call EPS Estimates for the year are as follows: $0.94 __ Actual for YE 1/31/12 $0.69 __ Consensus for YE 1/31/13 nvda's earnings are Shrinking.

Similarly Ti, Samsung, Apple pays the leading GPU - Imagination PowerVR or Arm for the Mali GPUs. The only company with a credible high performance GPU and not have to pay royalties is Nvidia. Quallcom with the Adreno GPUs is not in the same class - they pump it to be - the reality is the Poor guys realized only recently that Adreno doesn't cut it and they had to license the Imagination PowerVR adding another layer of royalty for each chip sold. Adreno is good for playing Angry Birds and Zynga in high performance mode - Birds gets angrier and Zynga games gets more Zyngged. Now, it's not just the royalties increasing costs that is the problem - the performance, die size and power dissipation of these cores are almost certainly not as optimal as Nvidia's GPUs as well. It's easy to add more cores to get performance - but you are adding costs and power at the same time and increasing the battery size of the end product increasing costs yet again. If the 1st generation Apple A5 (Dual core dual PowerVR GPU 122mm2 45nm) had gone into the Nexus 7 - they wouldn't be able to sell it for $199 - the T3 Quad CPU in 40nm is only 80mm2! Now you can argue that T3 could have had 24 GPUs instead of 12GPUs and still cost less than the A5 - sure but it would not have met the $199 target and it would have required a larger battery to boot. Sure helps when you have a great die size, no GPU royalties and deliver a great performance using yesterday's technology. Mr Joe Six Pack don't care about a Quad 28nm costing $1300 he cares about a Quad costing as close to ZERO as possible. If the GPU performance measurements include having to perform the exact Physxs that games using the T3 uses all the other GPUs would CROAK! The 4+1 CPU architecture in 40nm is truly amazing - the fact that that it can almost go toe to toe with a DUAL core at 28nm in terms of power dissipation is just amazing. Normally you would expect a 50% improvement between a Quad core at 40nm compared to a Quad core at 28nm and perhaps a 60% advantage for the Dual S4 at 28nm - instead it's barely a 10% overall advantage. The analysts are clueless and QCOM people are shamelessly touting their 10% advantage! It would be interesting to see 4+1 for T4.</Msg><Username>qmtai2</Username><Timestamp>1344325214000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 03:40:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>14</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344337848000-7</Id><Topic><Title>INTC Device Problems LEAD TO NVDA BUYOUT AT $21.50</Title><Username>ohthestupidity344</Username><Timestamp>1344286180000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 16:49:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'll take 25.00!</Msg><Username>ohthestupidity344</Username><Timestamp>1344337848000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 07:10:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344345231000-8</Id><Title>BEST shorted at $14.. for the record</Title><Msg>Yet, he never covered from his announced short position in the $13s...</Msg><Username>mikeywalson</Username><Timestamp>1344345231000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 09:13:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344345796000-9</Id><Topic><Title>BEST shorted at $14.. for the record</Title><Username>mikeywalson</Username><Timestamp>1344345231000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 09:13:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That's why he lives in a trailer parked next to the railroad tracks, and a creek in Cicero, IL.</Msg><Username>chitownbarber22</Username><Timestamp>1344345796000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 09:23:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344347478000-10</Id><Topic><Title>BEST shorted at $14.. for the record</Title><Username>mikeywalson</Username><Timestamp>1344345231000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 09:13:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Isn't it also near a graveyard where some of the bugsy's and scareface's were buried?</Msg><Username>valleybard</Username><Timestamp>1344347478000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 09:51:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344347695000-11</Id><Title>Same old same old, run up to earnings then plop</Title><Msg>I hope nobody is falling for this head fake.

He thinks the company can âmeet or beatâ the forecast, with GPU revenue rising perhaps 10%, quarter over quarter, âdriven by the ramp of Apple (AAPL) (add $30MM/qrt or 5% of Q/Q growth)â plus gaining share from Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) with other notebook makers.â Gill sees revenue from the companyâs âTegraâ application processor rising 35%, quarter over quarter, to $110 million, comprising 7 million units at an average selling price of $15. FBR Capitalâs Craig Berger is in agreement with Mosesmann that revenue was on the low side, relative to the forecast. He observes âPC builds were weak in June and July, affecting GPU sales,â and its possible the forecast for this quarter will be $1.02 billion to $1.07 billion, below the Streetâs âseemingly stale $1.10B.â But Berger also thinks thereâs âupsideâ come October because of the introduction of Microsoftâs (MSFT) Windows 8, and upside as well from new tablet computers running Tegra. (For example, Googleâs (GOOG) âNexus 7.â) And like Mosesmann, he thinks âNVIDIA should benefit from ramping 28 nm Kepler exposure with improving gross margins.â http://blogs.barrons.com/techtraderdaily/2012/08/07/nvda-fyq2-street-says-look-to-28-nano-ramp-win-8/?mod=yahoobarrons</Msg><Username>eir951</Username><Timestamp>1344374140000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 17:15:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344376351000-59</Id><Topic><Title>NVDA struggling trying to move up today</Title><Username>ghadji</Username><Timestamp>1344367985000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 15:33:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's all about the outlook and I have a feeling the outlook will be much better than last time, regardless ifnit beats or not.

I would be interested in hearing from Ibexx, Schmenkle, along with other valued posters about the said possibility? âThereâs an incredible cost to doing that, and it would be very difficult,â said Michael Hasler, a former supply-chain management executive at chipmaker Applied Materials Inc., who now lectures at the University of Texas at Austin. âOn the surface it seems like an obvious thing to do, but actually executing it would be very expensive.â http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-07/apple-ties-to-samsung-in-sharp-contrast-to-courtoom-clash.html</Msg><Username>chitownbarber22</Username><Timestamp>1344378213000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 18:23:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344380013000-62</Id><Topic><Title>Nexus 7 on Steroids at 1.64GHz</Title><Username>qmtai2</Username><Timestamp>1344376512000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 17:55:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I forgot to mention - you have to cut a circular window on the backside of the N7 for it to breathe :)</Msg><Username>qmtai2</Username><Timestamp>1344380013000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 18:53:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>18</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344386543000-63</Id><Topic><Title>Will Apple use custom Tegra chip?</Title><Username>chitownbarber22</Username><Timestamp>1344378213000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 18:23:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ibexx, I understand the article was posted last night, and discussed, but I wanted to focus in on the plausible reasoning of Nvidia doing a custom Tegra for Apple?

HA HA HA HA HA HA HA! Cash is ethereal and diaphanous. It is here today, and maybe gone tomorrow. Like Knight Capital's $450 million of cash. That disappeared in an electronic screw-up last week. Cash is impermanent, delicate, fragile and transient. Just one more bad acquisisition by Jen. One more major product recall or lawsuit lost. And Poof! That cash is gone gone gone. With absolutely nothing to show for it. Nada. One more Icera acquisition. But a mere six times larger. And nvidia has no cash -- and no earnings from it either. Just like the $367 million of cash burned on the Icera acquisition. Only a ridiculous multiple of shrinking Earnings remains. You are a fool to justify an unwarranted Price/Earnings multiple based on ethereal and impermanent cash. -</Msg><Username>eminent.best</Username><Timestamp>1344392713000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 22:25:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>30</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344393133000-67</Id><Title>NVIDIA Announces Kepler-Based Quadro K5000 &amp; Second-Generation Maximus</Title><Msg>http://www.anandtech.com/show/6140/nvidia-announces-keplerbased-quadro-k5000-secondgeneration-maximus</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1344393133000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 22:32:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344393747000-68</Id><Title>NVDA NEWS is all coming up as Forecast UpSpin!</Title><Msg>If NVDa meets or beats and just look at the news plus INTEL flush with cash and seeing the need and future explosion of NVDA chips, this stock could blow up Friday.</Msg><Username>upinouthome8594</Username><Timestamp>1344393747000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 22:42:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344395472000-69</Id><Title>Strong demand for Tegra3 processor</Title><Msg>Nvidia Corp.
