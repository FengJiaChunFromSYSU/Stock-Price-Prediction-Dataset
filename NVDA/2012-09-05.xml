Google this: "ARM Holdings: Don't Dig In Your Heels, Just Sell" . "Arm Holdings (ARMH) took a beating yesterday as CEO Warren East warned of weaker sales expectations, saying that some of its customers are "indicating that they are not expecting an uplift, and mathematically that will hit us." At least he didn't sugar-coat the sad truth. If I was interviewing him, I would have asked, "By hit, do you mean lightly smack, or uppercut to the chin? Perhaps the answer to this question I wish I could have asked was answered by Deutsche Bank's downgrade to 'sell' a short time later. Deutsche Bank's Kai Korschelt cited these reasons for the downgrade: ARMH's former monopoly position supplying the smartphone chip market is coming to an end as competitors such as Intel (INTC), Qualcomm (QCOM), Nvidia (NVDA), and Broadcom (BRCM) fill the technological gap that once separated them from ARM. Korschelt also sees Intel making big strides in mobile: "We believe that Intel could manage to win between 5 and 10% unit share in the next 3 years and possibly more further out in the future. While the immediate financial relevance of a 5 or 10% market share loss in smartphones and tablets for ARM is relatively modest, we believe when combined with the impact it could have on ARM's P/E, it could drive meaningful downside to the share price" (Source) Wow, need I continue? Let's do so anyways by taking a quick look at the valuation and other fundamentals of ARM Holdings. Let's compare ARMH to who other than Intel (such a righteous choice). Company Yield P/E P/Sales P/Book Forward P/E (1 yr) INTC 3.62% 10.51x 2.28x 2.55x 9.57x ARMH 0.65% 55.63x 14.67x 7.00x 29.65x My Take: ARMH's monopoly-like advantage on the mobile chip market is coming to an end. With this inevitability happening relatively soon, ARMH's 55x P/E valuation is no longer warranted, especially when you could swap out into INTC, BRCM, NVDA or QCOM, which all trade at a much more reasonable levels. ARMH's sell off yesterday is just the beginning of a long-term valuation downtrend. Time to sell." . .</Msg><Username>best.short</Username><Timestamp>1346850775680</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 09:12:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346851241196-8</Id><Title>Canaccord reiterate buy.

Longer term, Nvidia's bundled LTE solution for smartphones should drive design wins as an alternative/second source to QCOM." Ashraf Eassa expressed similar sentiments in a detailed analysis posted on Seeking Alpha.   "Nvidia's Tegra 3 has already found its way into Google's Nexus 7 tablet and into Microsoft's Windows RT-based Surface. Rumors also point to a win in Amazon's next generation Kindle Fire product," he opined.  "While there are certainly risks here, it seems irrational to make such a claim well before the iPad Mini, Surface and Kindle Fire 2 are on the shelves and we see some hard data." Eassa also noted that the firm's aspirations with its ARM-based Tegra chip for tablets/smartphones, Project Denver for notebooks/desktops/servers, and high performance GPUs leveraged as high performance compute accelerators (Tesla), all represent fairly logical and safe, yet aggressive, growth plays in segments adjacent to the firm's core competency. "The hard data speaks for itself: Nvidia blew away analyst estimates and guided well. Until the next earnings report (or until Nvidia issues an earnings warning), these analyst 'concerns' seem to be speculative at best and fear-mongering at worst," he added.</Msg><Username>patent_killr</Username><Timestamp>1346863067094</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 12:37:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346865598436-29</Id><Topic><Title>Evercore Analyst Getting Smashed Today</Title><Username>patent_killr</Username><Timestamp>1346863067094</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 12:37:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>don't think they are too worried or even listening, they are busy laughing all the way to the bank.</Msg><Username>whosunw</Username><Timestamp>1346865598436</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 13:19:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346868830399-30</Id><Topic><Title>2 for 1 stock split coming IMO</Title><Username>stocktrader4444</Username><Timestamp>1346862909821</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 12:35:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This is not the AMD message board!</Msg><Username>razorgarf</Username><Timestamp>1346868830399</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 14:13:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346869715038-31</Id><Topic><Title>Nokia unveils new Lumia 920 with Snapdragon S4 inside, stock fell 12%</Title><Username>ibexx88</Username><Timestamp>1346857322896</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 11:02:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think it's a very nice phone though, I kinda want one :p</Msg><Username>razorgarf</Username><Timestamp>1346869715038</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 14:28:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346871280794-32</Id><Topic><Title>Not able to break 13.5 - easy short here</Title><Username>o.investor</Username><Timestamp>1346854861298</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 10:21:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>looking to cover in 12s when Kindle Fire 2 disappointment weighs NVDA down.</Msg><Username>o.investor</Username><Timestamp>1346871280794</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 14:54:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346871902452-33</Id><Title>Looking for 40% pop when EOY numbers come out.</Title><Msg>Will see +40% soon.</Msg><Username>stocktrader4444</Username><Timestamp>1346871902452</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 15:05:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346872335650-34</Id><Topic><Title>Motorola unveils 3 new phones today..Pat Moorhead tweets "boring...."</Title><Username>ibexx88</Username><Timestamp>1346871858493</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 15:04:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>if NVDA was going to be in Kindle Fire 2, this stock would be at 20.
