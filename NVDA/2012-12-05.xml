Both are already heavily invested in their own platforms with their own design teams. NVIDIA doesn't really help apple much as NVIDIA is fabless and uses an off the shelf core and if Intel is heavily investing in it's own mobile chips. If Intel bought NVIDIA it wouldn't be for mobile but rather the high end high margin products, particularly for the cloud and accelerator products as this has been Inel's target market for years that the no well. And despite the #$%$ pundits who claim the "PC is dying" it has lots of growth potential but with relatively few players - buying NVIDIA they'd own it. I simply don't see what the tegra line does for Intel. All this the PC is dead nonsense has because become mantra of wall street pundits who know nothing about the industry. Just because more of the casual user market, the home user who use to use a laptop or PC to simply to browse the web is switching to tablets doesn't mean the PC market is dead. There is still a huge market for top end PC's workstations and servers especially with advent of more applications moving to the cloud. Do you think they are going to stream those line of business apps and games in the cloud from iPad and android devices?

It may not be growing in respects to the casual industrialized consumer but it is growing.

Even at 1.10 (which is a low end estimate) represents ~720 million in operating income and translates a 12% yoy increase in net income. All things considered macro and micro those are pretty good results for the semi industry. Consider this; at 12/shr this stock is trading at just under 11x's forward earnings... that is very low for this sector especially a company with a proven growth profile..I think O.Invest wants to abstain from fundamentals and key technicals and in lieu of those uses a dart-board for his stock analysis although I do believe his eyes are closed prior to the release of the dart! :-) One more point, I think the other poster touched on this, that I think Shafer didn't consider is that, despite the declining demand for PC's and notebooks as the web consumer moves to tablets, there is still a lucrative demand for PC/Laptops with high end graphics and as AMD exits (virtually the only other player in town) that additional capacity will have to go somewhere - and that somewhere is NVIDIA.</Msg><Username>brokeagain73</Username><Timestamp>1354763064829</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 22:04:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354763177157-65</Id><Title>NVDA : Days of Shredding</Title><Msg>Check out this incredible video, boys.
