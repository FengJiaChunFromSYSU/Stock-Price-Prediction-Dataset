AMD has gone up from a very low level. It is unlikely it will go up significantly in the foreseeable future. The reasons are simple to understand and accept, matter of factly: serious investors look at a company's profitability (AMD has performed very badly all these years. NVDA has been profitable almost every quarter since its founding) and its balance sheet (AMD has negative net worth. NVDA's is top of the line by any measure). I assure you AMD will not survive for long unless something dramatic, such as a new revolutionary product line, happens within the next year or two. But, of course, you are entitled to your opinions as I am to mine.

In fact Nvidia is showing that at the end of next quarter they will have retired an additional 29 million shares (590 million vs 619 million) and will do so with profits made each quarter. Buying back stock helps in two ways, #1 it raises earnings per share (since there are fewer shares) #2 It costs less for issuing dividends (since there are fewer shares) Just reducing by the 29 million shares in the upcoming quarter increases earnings-per-share by 4.9% and will add at least 1 cent to earning next quarter and will also save $2.175 million in dividend costs.</Msg><Username>salemthecat100</Username><Timestamp>1368199186785</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 11:19:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368199313523-55</Id><Title>When the supply of NVDA is exhausted....watch out</Title><Msg>NVDA will explode.....

"Quick Take --Due to seasonal variation, declining PC shipments and lower Tegra sales, Nvidia witnessed a 13.7% sequential decline in revenues; however, it saw strong sales of its high-end GPUs for PC gaming and increasing acceptance of Kepler in PCs and beyond. --With the increasing revenue contribution from the non-PC business segment and its dominance in the GPU market, we feel that Nvidia has strong fundamentals to support a higher valuation. --As PC shipments continue to decline, the robust PC gaming market will drive growth in Nvidia’s GPU shipments. The PC gaming hardware market is estimated to increase from $23.6 billion in 2012 to $30 billion by 2015. --With the extension of Kepler architecture to new markets, Nvidia is moving towards a higher share among gamers, strengthening workstation and supercomputing segments as well as new growth opportunities for its GRID server graphics solutions. --Considering that Nvidia has a negligible presence in the smartphone market, speeding up the launch of its LTE compatible chips at the expense of its short-term growth is a good move.

Judging by today's rally, many agree. RJ sees the margin strength as proof demand for high-end GPUs for gaming/computing/workstations "is likely more inelastic than thought." Others are worried about the Tegra unit, which is losing share ahead of the Tegra 4 (FQ2/FQ3) and 4i (FQ4/FQ1) launches. On the earnings call, CEO Jen-Hsun Huang admitted Tegra's gross margin is below Nvidia's total GM, but added margins for GRID and Tesla (also expected to grow fast in 2H) are above-average." Glossed-over was JHH's comment that Tegra4 will be ramping in 2H and the company will return to growth mode.</Msg><Username>eir951</Username><Timestamp>1368231020356</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 20:10:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368234531559-139</Id><Title>A spectacular day....</Title><Msg>I just wrote Tiernan Ray, of Barron's, to tell him that this was a spectacular day, from a trading standpoint for this stock. Given the gap up to 14.20, followed by a small increase in the share price, followed by an attempt by the Bears to break it back down, but it didn't even trade a PENNY lower, followed by the inexorable rise into the 14.45-50 area, where it spent several hours. Then, after a brief move to 14.53, they backed it back down to that 14.45 area, again, but the bulls were relentless and made a late run at the 14.60 area which I had mentioned earlier, only to have some last 2 minutes of the week profit-taking bring us back down to the close of 14.54. Now, since I have most of the bashers on ignore, I don't care what they post about me or what I have to say. But...for the REST of you...how many of you know that today's close was the THIRD HIGHEST CLOSE in the last 52 weeks? And, that the close, today, was HIGHER than the day the stock HIT its 52 week high last August??? It only closed higher than today's close the following couple of days, and NEVER saw this level, again, until TODAY. All one has to do is look at the "chart", the On Balance Volume, the RSI and the "Ultimate Oscillator", and it's quite clear that this was another serious "break out". While anything is "possible", without a major market meltdown, I doubt we'll see the stock below 14, again....for more than a few moments, IF EVER. My "initial target" is 20-22, but I firmly believe that this stock will be over 30 within the next 12-24 months. As always, we'll know in the fullness of time.

I think most people now belive the market will go higher for awhile and it is not a good time to be short anything. TSLA action was ridiculous this week--mostly due to a 50% short float. I should have bought call options today on TSLA and rode the wave. Anyways, back to NVDA. After reading today's article that points out that NVDA was the #34 highest shorted stock on NASDAQ, I wonder how many shorts threw in the towel today and bought to cover. (approx 26 million shares short) I am afraid that a significant % of today's volume (maybe 5 to 7 million?) was short covering because of NVDA's report and the overall recent freight train of a bull market. If that is true, a pullback next week (maybe $14?) may be likely. If no pullback, then the shorts alone will move NVDA higher next week. However, I suspect today's $14.40 to $14.50 floor will be much weaker next week if (1) a large # of shorts with weak stomachs cashed out today and (2) the longs who bought in the $12 to $12.50 range over the past 6 months are happy to walk away with a 12% to 16% gain. Not all current NVDA shareholders believe NVDA will move to $20 anytime soon and many may have their eyes on another stock that they believe has a better chance of a 40% to 50% gain than NVDA. Of course, more short covering will occur next week as well. My guess is the short covering volume next week over a 5-day period will be approximately equal to the short covering volume that occurred today. After next week, my guess is the floor created by the shorts is gone and we will then see if NVDA can keep its share price moving higher without short support. FYI--I shorted NVDA today and am now thinking it will be a breakeven trade for me.. (Which SUCKS mainly because I was this close to buying calls on TSLA this morning but then thought the short squeeze from yesterday wouldn't carry over</Msg><Username>wallstreet_donor</Username><Timestamp>1368238092520</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 22:08:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368244447243-141</Id><Topic><Title>A spectacular day....</Title><Username>kvimax1</Username><Timestamp>1368234531559</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 21:08:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Your short on NVDA is ill-timed. I bought NVDA hand over fist a couple of weeks ago because the short, mid and long term charts all showed this stock was about to break out. Now that is happening and this is in LONG TERM bullish mode. The stock buyback will keep the stock elevated until Q3 when NVDA returns to growth mode. Indications are NVDA is headed to $22.50.</Msg><Username>argyle46</Username><Timestamp>1368244447243</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 23:54:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
