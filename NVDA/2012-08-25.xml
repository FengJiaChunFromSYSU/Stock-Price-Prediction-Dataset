No company can bring a major new product line without spending heavily on R&amp;D. Tegra is it's own division - had they hidden it under the same umbrella as the Graphics unit - you wouldn't even crow about losses because the company had been accumulating tonnes of cash every qtr. In the Tegra division is also the Cell Phone division - which is also new. So they are actually bringing up two very major New product lines. The great news is that the new products are doing very well 40% growth qtr on qtr and establishing a very strong presence. The Cell Phone products would start contributing by mid year next year. Companies like Ti spend as much as Nvidia and probably more for similar products and the results are pitiful. Ti is trying to get out of the Cell Phone business - they had been trying to sell the CP division and the Arm division is also pitiful with their stock holders recommending divestiture - their business is shrinking in both areas whilst Nvidia is growing leaps and bounds. Even Qualcomm is feeling the pressure from Nvidia to the point of considering splitting the company in two - 1) The old licensing cash cow and 2) The semiconductor division so as not to loose "value" on the highly profitable cash cow by being lumped into the semiconductor side which is seeing intensifying assaults from all sides - especially from Nvidia!</Msg><Username>mark1289b</Username><Timestamp>1345874302000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 01:58:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345874621000-8</Id><Topic><Title>Tablet sales to hit 100 million units in 2012</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1345869957000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 00:45:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You need to include Ipad Mini sales as well as a few others too....

As you may already know, there are two versions of the Surface, one that runs on Windows 8 RT, and the other, which is more powerful, runs on Windows 8 Pro. That said, only one version of the Surface will gain massive success, and we believe it could likely be the Windows 8 RT version. The Surface is a tablet that is aimed at competing with the new Apple iPad and the plethora of Android based tablets out in the wild. The Windows 8 RT version of the Surface is perfect for this task, while the Window 8 Pro version is truly not needed. Want Windows 8 Pro? Get an Ultrabook, that's how we view things. 7 Print Email inShare 2 Like Us on Facebook : Below are our reasons why the Windows 8 RT version of the Surface will be successful, and why you should consider picking it up instead of the Pro version. Windows 8 RT is For Tablets Windows 8 RT is a tablet operating system, mainly because Legacy application will not work, but only those from the Windows Store. Because of this, users will be using more of the touch interface than the normal desktop UI. The normal UI is not built for touch, however, there are some elements there, but it is nothing compared to the tile interface. With the Windows 8 Pro version of the Microsoft Surface, the device is now more than a tablet and there is nothing much that is wrong with that. However, we are right back at desktop UI again, which is not as touch friendly as the Tile interface. If you want a Windows 8 Pro device to do everything, it is best if an Ultrabook is purchased instead. Size Matters Because of the ARM processor inside the Windows 8 RT version of the Surface, the tablet will be considerably thinner and lighter. Compare both tablets side by side and you will realize what we are talking about. The RT version looks that more appealing. Heat and Battery Life This is where the Windows 8 RT Surface shines yet again, and shine brightly it does. The ARM CPU inside is much more efficient than the Intel i5 in the Pro. This makes for battery life comparable to the new iPad. One cannot say the same thing about the Pro Surface. Who wants a tablet in their hands or on their lap that is prone to some serious heat? No one, and that's another reason why the Windows 8 RT Surface is right for the tablet user. Cheaper Pricing The one thing that will see the RT version of the Surface rise to stardom, is its price. Expect the pricing to be similar to current tablets on the market, while the Pro version will be similar to that of an Ultrabook. Why pay Ultrabook money for a tablet when you can go out and purchase an Ultrabook for the same money that probably has more power inside? After Windows 8 is launched, we expect many OEMs to release tablets running on ARM, instead of anything Intel has to offer for the sake of keeping prices down to compete with the new iPad. Intel has been trash talking ARM-based Windows 8 tablets. The company thinks legacy applications are that important when in truth, they are not. Intel will have no choice but to change its tune when the company sees how successful Windows 8 RT has become, and that includes the many naysayers who refuse to buy ARM.</Msg><Username>chrisssable</Username><Timestamp>1345910368000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 11:59:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345911105000-17</Id><Title>Microsoft App store = Apple's demise?</Title><Msg>http://www.forbes.com/sites/markfidelman/2012/08/15/microsofts-enterprise-app-store-will-be-apples-demise-again/   Denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance – Apple’s 5 stages of enterprise grief are still in its first stage. As you recall, the company lost out to Microsoft in the eighties by its lack of enterprise understanding. Sadly, it appears to be déjà vu all over again. Apple’s enterprise philosophy seems to consist of one sentence, ‘I’ll sell you anything you want as long as it’s for the consumer’.  Why Apple hasn’t learned from its history lessons is something they’ll need to take up with its shareholders in the future. For now, they are still drunk from the success of their mobile products. For Microsoft, the history lesson seems to be that if you don’t get your enterprise strategy right you won’t get your financials right, which is why they don’t believe the view that Apple has found the magic formula of  forcing IT departments to accept its products without so much as a phone call.  While Apple’s strategy appears to be working in the short term, it will soon fall victim to either a Microsoft, IBM or Google focus on creating holistic enterprise experiences with devices and software. The Microsoft Office and SharePoint App Store (beta) While no significant announcements have been made yet, Microsoft is quietly developing the Office App Store (in beta now).  They appear to understand that addressing the needs of the enterprise from a global and strategic level, are far superior to a tactical consumer approach. This approach will serve them well and preserve their enterprise dominance. Product Marketing Manager, Vivek Narasimhan describes the three reasons for building the store: “integration, simplicity and developer opportunity”. He seems to be understating it. Apple's Demise: What is That About? Haydn Shaughnessy Contributor More importantly, it’s about getting as Yaacov Cohen, CEO of harmon.ie describes as, “one billion pairs of eyes focused on apps that solve specific enterprise use cases.” Cohen’s company (see disclosures)has a featured app in the store, and likes Microsoft’s strategy of enabling apps that work across mobile and laptop devices. “We’ve built the store so you could integrate the very best of the web with the powerful features of Office and SharePoint,” Narasimhan explained further. Microsoft has also enabled a powerful administrator function that allows global provisioning control over apps the enterprise uses – thus saving thousands of hours and reducing the risk of security breaches. Is it Really Happening to Apple Again? One would expect Apple to be congruous with the enterprise, but it’s actually the enterprise that is congruous around them. At least temporarily. But since they don’t have an enterprise strategy, corporate leadership will eventually shrug, and move on. And watching this scenario unfold yet again, one has to wonder if Apple has a form of corporate dementia. The corporate market is far too important to ignore, and it’s not, as Apple seems to believe, ceding the selection of devices and software to its employees. Bring your own device (BYOD) may indeed be the future, but bring your own software (BYOS) will not. And over time, as you will see, Apple will become more insular, while the rest of the market opens up. Unfortunately, we’ve seen this story before and we all know how it ends.</Msg><Username>chrisssable</Username><Timestamp>1345911105000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 12:11:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345914761000-18</Id><Title>What does aapl verdict mean to nvda</Title><Msg>Any ideas???</Msg><Username>tomasco3777</Username><Timestamp>1345914761000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 13:12:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345915492000-19</Id><Topic><Title>Updated (unofficial) Kindle 2 release date, specs etc</Title><Username>ibexx88</Username><Timestamp>1345868908000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 00:28:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If you ask me, I'd say both "possible" and "probabe". There aren't that many sources of application processors with high performance/low price/ensured availability. in fact, i could think of only one, and that is Tegra 3x. And we all know Amazon is extremely price conscious. I doubt they would go for anything fabricated with the 28nm node. However, the old dual-core SoC by 40-45nm are so dated now, I don't think AMZN will use these for their next-ten products. Amazon has to bring a A-card in order to compete with ipad, ipad mini, Nexus 7, Asus infinity and the Samsung tablets. Tegra 3x are highly differentiated now; the variety of chip quality coupled with clock speeds allows NVIDIA to provide the SoC at various price points for gadgets targeted for different markets. We shall find out in October (release date) whether NV gets one slot or two. Some smart money is betting on 2....I think.</Msg><Username>moorelawyer</Username><Timestamp>1345915492000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 13:24:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345917982000-20</Id><Title>Apple:The bigger they are, the harder they fall</Title><Msg>it's a overhyped pos....http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-bigger-they-are-the-harder-they-fall-2012-08-24?link=home_carousel%3Flink+MW-FB</Msg><Username>daysofshred30000000000</Username><Timestamp>1345917982000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 14:06:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345923773000-21</Id><Title>Could there be too many shares outstanding to really get Nvda Stock to get moving North</Title><Msg>You need Spectacular Earnings to get stock to $20.00 plus. 640 million shares outstanding is alot.

Which means Samsung has to blow the dust off their seldom-used drawing board. And slavishly attempt to invent a work-around for Apple' patents. This will take time, boys. Oh so much time. In the interim Samsung will likely cancel all orders for pieces parts -- including nvidia's. Until they figure out what the heck they'll make next. Obviously, the knock-on effect is that nvidia's earnings will plunge. And Plunge Badly, boys. But at least Jen has a ready-made excuse for next quarter. "Samsung this and Samsung that".
