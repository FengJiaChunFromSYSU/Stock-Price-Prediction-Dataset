Why doesn't Intel make their own ARM chips? On their extra special teeny tiny 22nm process. They bought an ARM license and got the FedEx package with blueprints, right?. Like 172 other companies did. http://www.arm.com/products/processors/licensees.php So why doesn't Intel make their own? Theirs would be 10 times faster and 3 times more energy efficient. Than anybody elses. And Intel would have zero competition for what, six years. Maybe longer. If Best worked for Intel, he would put that in the Suggestion Box. "Make ARM chips on the 22nm process." King Otellini would give Best a baronial bonus for that idea. -</Msg><Username>ask.best</Username><Timestamp>1343104478000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 00:34:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>16</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343104827000-3</Id><Topic><Title>22nm: Intel fabs for another friendly company.</Title><Username>todays.best</Username><Timestamp>1343099802000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 23:16:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Jeepers best, here's someone who knows NOTHING about the semiconductor industry pretending he does.</Msg><Username>eir951</Username><Timestamp>1343104827000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 00:40:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343104952000-4</Id><Topic><Title>22nm: Intel fabs for another friendly company.</Title><Username>todays.best</Username><Timestamp>1343099802000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 23:16:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sounds like mularchy, just like everything else that comes out of his mouth.

Apple CEO Tim Cook meets with Samsung execs to discuss patent war By: Anthony Garreffa | TweakTown | Posted: 4 days, 5 hours ago "US District Judge Lucy Koh of the Northern District of California ordered Apple CEO Tim Cook, as well as the top-ranking Samsung executives Choi Gee-sung and Shin Jong-kyun on July 16, where they met in the US to discuss putting an end to the on-going patent lawsuits that are being fought across the world. The US jury trial was scheduled for July 30, but The Korea Times reports that the two technology leaders met early. This is the second time in two months that they've met, with Samsung Electronics' COO Lee Jay-yong also reported to have scheduled talks with Cook while the Apple CEO was attending the Sun Valley Media Conference between July 10 to July 14. Where it gets more interesting, is that an 'unnamed Samsung official' told the Korean news website that Samsung placed an added importance on the meeting as they were "very important business partners", in which they very much are. This is thanks to large orders for processors, LCDs and memory components that are using in Apple's iDevices. Samsung provided a whopping $7.8 billion in parts for Apple devices in 2012, meaning that Apple is Samsung's largest customer. Both companies are headed back to the court halls in California in just over a week, meaning we should know what the second round of talks means for not only the companies, but us, the mere mortal consumers." http://www.tweaktown.com/news/24943/apple_ceo_tim_cook_meets_with_samsung_execs_to_discuss_patent_war/index.html "We are now engaged in a great civil war, testing whether our patents, or any patents so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this." -- Supreme Commander-in-Chief Timothy Cook -</Msg><Username>todays.best</Username><Timestamp>1343135207000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 09:06:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>17</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343135299000-12</Id><Topic><Title>Krait vs Tegra 3 battery life comparison</Title><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1343097926000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 22:45:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>not only process technology but also chip architecture.

In addition, there are several other tablet manufacturers (e.g., ASUS, Acer, Toshiba, etc.) that use NVDA's TEGRA-3. Since NVDA's TEGRA-3 is more powerful than the CPUs in AAPL's IPAD, MSFT's Surface, GOOG's Nexus7, ASUS's Transformer Pad Infinity 700, and Toshiba's AT300 have very GOOD CHANCES to CAPTURE MARKET SHARE from the IPADs.

The problems being reported are no small peanuts either.

Plus I am not too fond of light bleeding out of the sides of my devices - though it might make a somewhat interesting child's night light.

Now, I will try and see whether there is light at the end of the tunnel for Cypress. But before that, let’s see what ails the company. What gives? A sluggish economy and delays on the part of Cypress, which led to the loss of a few design wins, weighed in on the top line which went down a staggering 21% from last year. Moving forward, the company sees muted growth in the third quarter, primarily due to a gloomy economic outlook and lower bookings by customers. A silver lining However, quite impressively, Cypress kept its costs under control. Its gross margin declined only 0.2 percentage points from last year to 57% in the quarter, as against the massive drop in revenue. Also, there were some other positive takeaways from the quarter. Cypress’ top line improved 9% on a sequential basis despite seasonality. Moreover, its TrueTouch touchscreen controllers, which had helped Cypress enjoy a good time last year, saw demand increase by 21% sequentially. Moreover, Cypress has a long standing partnership with NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) for developing these TrueTouch controllers. Now, these controllers are used in Android-based devices, and utilize the Tegra 3 processor. Although NVIDIA itself hasn’t done pretty well this year on the whole, the Tegra 3 architecture has been a hit among smartphone makers because of its efficiency. It is featured in the HTC One X. Rough weather ahead But here’s the problem. NVIDIA’s Tegra 3 isn’t the chip of choice for the major brands yet. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) uses in-house chips for its phone and tablet. Also, Samsung is also down this path with its own Exynos processor. Hence, even though Cypress’ partnership with NVIDIA is an important one, it might take some time before we see some solid gains from it. But there are other possibilities for Cypress going ahead. I have previously spoken of Cypress’ controllers being used in the next iteration of Amazon’s (NASDAQ: AMZN) Kindle Fire. Brokerage firm, Sterne, Agee &amp; Leach which hosted CFO Brad Buss at the Sterne Agee Tech Conference, is of the opinion that the next Kindle Fire will help drive Cypress’ prospects. Now, the Kindle Fire is among the best-selling tablets after the iPad, and if Cypress does become a supplier, it would help the company see better days going ahead. But, I am afraid that even Amazon might not be able to help Cypress much in the case that Apple's iPad mini becomes a reality and Google’s Nexus 7 becomes a raging hit. Fool analyst Evan Niu recently told us what various industry watchers had to say about the iPad mini, and it might happen that Apple’s smaller tablet could hit stores in a few months. Considering the $250-$300 price tag which the mini is rumored to carry, Amazon’s Kindle Fire faces some really stiff competition. The bottom line As of now, Cypress looks like a game of pros and cons. It is capable of tilting either way depending on the end users of its products. Moreover, the company’s wireless communications business hasn’t been in the best of health, just like the rest of the industry. It is engaged in an antitrust suit against GSI Technology as well, which is again a point of concern.</Msg><Username>oa92000</Username><Timestamp>1343179263000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 21:21:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343180680000-67</Id><Title>appl</Title><Msg>Fourth, the new MacBookPro has proven to be a big success.

Note, Apple’s revenue share of the market is almost double its unit share, indicating that Apple can command much higher ASPs than its competitors.</Msg><Username>on2five</Username><Timestamp>1343180680000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 21:44:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343182052000-68</Id><Topic><Title>appl</Title><Username>on2five</Username><Timestamp>1343180680000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 21:44:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>did you mean "aapl"?</Msg><Username>moorelawyer</Username><Timestamp>1343182052000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 22:07:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343185218000-69</Id><Topic><Title>Analyst (via Barrons): QC using supply constraints to cover demand issues</Title><Username>ibexx88</Username><Timestamp>1342714302000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-19 12:11:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>status of integrated solutions, from brcm cc: Several significant smartphone launches in Q2 meaningfully expanded our 3G baseband business. First, we saw continuing momentum at Samsung, with several new single sim and dual-sim Android handsets introduced globally. Second, we saw the launch of the TCL W989, which is shipping into China Unicom. In addition, Vodafone launched their latest Vodafone-branded device, the Smart II, a cost-effective 3G Android smartphone that's shipping globally. The Smart II enables Vodafone to convert existing feature phone users to their first smartphone. This momentum enabled us to gain share in 3G basebands in Q2. During the quarter, we also received production orders for our 40-nanometer, single-core and dual-core basebands with ramps expected in the second half of 2012. These basebands are part of Broadcom's next-generation cellular platform that includes our industry-leading wireless connectivity, including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS and NFC. 3G tegra 2 class integrated solution ramping in 2H at samsung as starter smart phones. no, no audis here, just chevys. lots and lots of chevys.</Msg><Username>whosunw</Username><Timestamp>1343185218000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 23:00:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343186062000-70</Id><Title>Apple: Samsung owes us $31 per device.</Title><Msg>- Apple claims $2.5 billion damages in Samsung patent case By Jonathan Stempel | Tue Jul 24, 2012 (Reuters) - Apple Inc claims it is entitled to $2.525 billion of damages in its high-stakes battle against Samsung Electronics Co over patents for technology used in smartphones and tablets, such as the iPhone and iPad. The estimate was revealed in a court filing early Tuesday, six days before the world's largest consumer electronics companies are scheduled on July 30 to begin a jury trial before U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California. Apple accused Samsung of infringing its patents by making its popular Galaxy phone and computer tablets "work and look" like Apple products, enabling the South Korean company to overtake it as the world's largest maker of smartphones. Samsung has countered that it simply developed its own "unique" products in a bid to "best the competition," and that Apple actually owes money for using its patented technology. In its court filing, Apple said Samsung owes "substantial monetary damages" because it illegally "chose to compete by copying Apple." It said Samsung has been "unjustly enriched" by an undisclosed amount -- presumably $2 billion -- and deprived Apple of $500 million of profit and $25 million of reasonable royalty damages. This results in "a combined total of $2.525 billion" of damages, Apple said. Apple called its estimates conservative, and still plans to pursue a permanent injunction to stop future violations. Thirteen minutes after Apple's filing, Samsung countered with a filing accusing the Cupertino, California-based company of trying "to stifle legitimate competition and limit consumer choice to maintain its historically exorbitant profits." It said Apple should pay for using patented Samsung technology, "without which Apple could not have become a successful participant in the mobile telecommunications industry." The dispute is part of a worldwide legal battle over the alleged theft of technology used in smartphones and tablets, including those powered by Google Inc's Android, which Samsung uses in its most popular devices. In its filing, Apple claimed it is entitled to reasonable royalty rates equal to more than $31 per unit. This includes $24 for use of Apple's "design patents or trade dress rights," $3.10 for a patent related to "scrolling" technology, $2.02 for a patent covering a "tap to zoom" feature, and $2.02 for a patent that tells users with a "bounce" when they reached the bottom of screens. Apple also said that any remedy to which Samsung could be entitled over its "declared-essential patents" is limited to one-half of one cent per unit for each infringed patent. Last week, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook and top Samsung executives participated in court-supervised mediation to try to resolve the case but a resolution appeared to be unlikely, people familiar with the matter said. The companies also disagreed on the value of the disputed patents, one of the people said. In afternoon trading, Apple shares fell 69 cents to $603.14 on the Nasdaq. The company is expected to report quarterly results after the market closes. The case is Apple Inc v. Samsung Electronics Co et al, U.S. District, Northern District of California, No. 11-01846." Thirty One bucks ($31.00) apiece, boys. For each and every slavishly copied Samsung phone and tablet. That's what Apple's patented IP is worth. "Conservatively", says Apple. So much for Samsung "besting the competition". Best, being an authority in such things, can assure you that Samsung bested Nobody. All they did was create an extremely large wire transfer liability. iPayable to Apple. -</Msg><Username>ibest.here</Username><Timestamp>1343186062000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 23:14:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>33</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343187060000-71</Id><Title>Samsung has Apple by its throat</Title><Msg>If Samsung should decide that there might be problems manufacturing A6, Apple stock will crumble over night.
