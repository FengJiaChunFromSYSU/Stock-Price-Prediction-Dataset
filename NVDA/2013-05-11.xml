I would be happy to see a pullback to mid 13's to recover the assigned block I will lose next week and that may not be likely barring an overall correction - which we are due for. Either way the stock is worth 18 based on potential revenue and is undervalued even at current revenue - technicals aside. The only thing that could be perceived as negative is their redefinition of the Tegra TAM - apparently automotives is going to be a larger driver of revenue than I thought in lieu of say high end smart phones. I know they won the next ford/ms contract for the sync apps processor so this does appear to be the case.</Msg><Username>brokeagain73</Username><Timestamp>1368293362924</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-11 13:29:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368293599188-17</Id><Topic><Title>Only in Nvidialand is $100 to $5 a great stock!</Title><Username>chrisssable</Username><Timestamp>1368257215149</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-11 03:26:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If you truly think that this thing is #$%$, get yourself a short position.
