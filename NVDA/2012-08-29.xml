Much of Wong’s report is a run-down of the state of play for Tegra to date, with $360 million in revenue from the product last fiscal year, ending in January, which is expected to rise to $540 million, at least, this year. The company has 34% of the market for tablet processors for machines that are not Apple‘s (AAPL) iPad, he writes, citing data from research firm Strategy Analytics. Wong sees Nvidia gaining a “significant position” as a supplier of microprocessors for the Windows-based tablet computers, like Surface, that are based on the “Windows RT” flavor of the operating system, as opposed to the models running straight Windows 8, using Intel (INTC) processors. But perhaps the central point of Wong’s note is how the company may have an edge in processors thanks to its background in graphics chips for PCs: We view Nvidia’s graphics expertise as a potential competitive strength in applications processors, and its lack of any history in communications chips (baseband or connectivity chips) to be a weakness. In the long run, we think that Tegra has more opportunity in the tablet market than in the smartphone market. However, Nvidia has put substantial effort and investment into building its position in the smartphone market and developing applications processors with integrated modems. In February 2012 Nvidia announced that the ZTE Mimosa X smartphone would feature Nvidia’s Tegra 2 processor as well as an Icera modem. In 2013, with Grey, Nvidia plans to release an apps processor with an integrated Icera modem.</Msg><Username>chitownbarber22</Username><Timestamp>1346268562139</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 15:29:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346270510100-32</Id><Topic><Title>NVDA: Wells Likes Graphics Edge to Tegra in Tablets</Title><Username>chitownbarber22</Username><Timestamp>1346268562139</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 15:29:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>bb.bb.b.bb..b.bb. but Tegra doesn't make any money, fire the CEO, fire the board, scrap Tegra.

It's really not a surprise to see quotes like "We view Nvidia’s graphics expertise as a potential competitive strength." Long term Longs have been saying this for years. Graphics, and it's parallel characteristics, the massive computational needs it entails, is about the most complex undertaking in state of the art semiconductors. That's where you want an edge, people. Integrating modems? Well that's a walk in the park after executing big honking graphics engines and enormous bandwidth in memory interfaces. GRX competency will pay huge dividends as the market matures.</Msg><Username>schmenkle321</Username><Timestamp>1346271070661</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 16:11:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346275915670-34</Id><Title>Sony S tablet to sport NVDA chip</Title><Msg>Just saw on yahoo..
