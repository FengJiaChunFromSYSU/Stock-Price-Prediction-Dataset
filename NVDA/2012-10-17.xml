Where do you see it? You've mentioned the 10-K, then after I pointed out the actual figure listed for the CPB segment's operating loss, I got weird replies acting as if page 28 of the 10-K provides the $180M figure you're quoting, but it doesn't. Nor does any section of the 10-K, unless you've found a page that my copy is missing. So again, where is the figure from? Made up? You've mocked me as though I haven't gone through the most recent 10-K... but I'd challenge you to provide any source that actually supports your claim that Tegra lost $180M last quarter. I do notice you slightly rewording your original claim to sound a bit less inaccurate, but nonetheless it simply isn't true. Good luck to you as well. It'd be great if we could debate the information that's actually in the 10-K, or any real objective info -- rather than a consistent reference to a made up "$180M loss last Q due to Tegra", which is false and makes it hard to engage in discussion of the actual data. And, honestly, it just seems odd to me that you wouldn't use the real numbers, since they seem to support your premise well enough.... CPB had an operating loss just under $90M last quarter in spite of ~$180M in sales. The segment was definitely far from profitable. Shorts seem very confident that the accelerated sales in Q3 (everyone seems to agree CPB will be much higher Q3/Q2) and thus, if your argument is generally valid (though still false on specifics) then we should see Q3 CPB losses grow at a similarly accelerated pace, in Q3, right?</Msg><Username>thetrade50</Username><Timestamp>1350491093606</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 12:24:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350491343539-22</Id><Topic><Title>LIKE AN APPLE: MICROSOFT WILL DESIGN THEIR OWN ARM CHIP INTEL DOOMED</Title><Username>eastofeastside</Username><Timestamp>1350062580700</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 13:23:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>See this specifically seems to be inaccurate.
