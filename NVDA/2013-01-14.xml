"Nvidia has pretty much lost out to Advanced Micro Devices in the race to supply chips to next-generation consoles. In that respect, Nvidia has made this business decision from a weak position, too, but it also has nothing to lose. Nvidia has probably lost some trust among its partners and customers. How do they know that Nvidia won’t compete head-on with them? The tough challenge for Nvidia will be marketing since it has very little elbow room in a crowded market. Rivals such as PowerA (the maker of the Moga controller) and Green Throttle Games (the creator of an upcoming Android game controller) will be selling their products for a lot less. How will Nvidia convince customers to pay a lot more for its device? JJ Richards, the head of marketing on PowerA’s Moga mobile-gaming controller marketing team, doesn’t think adding the screen to a controller will add much value, and he notes that it entails a lot of cost. The challenge is that Nvidia is going into areas where it has little experience, such as mass-market customer support and heavy-duty marketing. Nvidia also lacks the kind of design expertise that makes consumers lust after a new tech product. Some observers have reacted with disdain to the system’s design and wondered why it has a tablet that can’t be detached. If Nvidia gets one aspect of the design wrong, you can bet a competitor will get it right. One of the key features of Tegra 4 is its support for 4K video and 4K games. But there is very little 4K content out there. This feature adds costs, but it may not gain any new customers for Nvidia. Anand Shimpi, the head of tech analysis site Anandtech, said... he isn’t so sure that Android developers are up to the challenge of producing mobile games that people really want to play on a TV. And if there is no killer content for Nvidia, then the Project Shield system will fail. And what about the fact that the system can play titles from Valve’s Steam digital distribution service? Valve itself is expected to launch its own Linux-based open game console, dubbed the Steam Box. If that box takes off... at some point, Valve’s success means Nvidia’s failure." Maybe Jen will ship the toy Shield with one game pre-loaded? "Final Doom" would be appropriate.</Msg><Username>best.again</Username><Timestamp>1358140891122</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-14 00:21:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>11</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358142111039-2</Id><Topic><Title>Project Shield Price-My Guess $299</Title><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1358010908582</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 12:15:08 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>$399 is too expensive. Maybe $349 bundled with a blockbuster game or with a $50 off with a top end gamer discrete card. But $299 with no bundles it will sell well. A tie end with Gamestop stores would be an added benefit.

The fresh Microsoft devices will, of course, represent upgrades of the initial mobile hardware attempt from the company, which according to analysts had generally failed to achieve even the modest goals earlier outlined by Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer. Citing reports from a source identified only as MS_Nerd, BGR News said that Microsoft plans to rollout three variants of the Surface slate beginning Q4 2013, all sporting three different screen sizes that purportedly will cater to specific target markets. Most notable of the planned release is the 8.6-inch Surface RT 2, which will do away with the Nvidia Tegra chip that used with the first iteration. This new Surface RT is set to be deployed with Qualcomm chipset. Already in the Microsoft hardware pipeline too is the Surface Book, a hulking tablet with a 14.6-inch screen display that will rely on Intel's 22-nanometer Haswell chip for its processing power. The 2013 Microsoft Surface thrust will be completed by the 11.6-inch Surface Pro, which according to MS_Nerd will be powered by AMD's Temash APU. Note that this Surface Pro is different from the 64-bit tablet PC with a Core i5 processor that Microsoft said will hit global markets early this year." source: auDOTibtimeDOTcom</Msg><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1358193453852</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-14 14:57:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>37</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358194256289-49</Id><Topic><Title>"Microsoft Eyes 3 New Surface Tablet Servings for 2013"</Title><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1358193453852</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-14 14:57:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That's too bad...I guess NVIDIA will just have to be happy with owing a majority of the growing Android tablet market instead of being invested in a DOA mobile os.
