While the HTC One X+ for T-Mobile will likely lack LTE, which is fine by me, it should nonetheless prove to be a solid contender with anything on the market. We’re a couple of months away until we’ll likely see the handset materialize but a HTC One X with a Tegra 3+ inside is something to hold out of if you’re in the market for a smartphone.</Msg><Username>findingnemoyes</Username><Timestamp>1343365355000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 01:02:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343380062000-3</Id><Topic><Title>ZDNet just in: iPhone 5 delay worries surface</Title><Username>ibexx88</Username><Timestamp>1343311264000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 10:01:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>http://messages.finance.yahoo.com/Business_%26_Finance/Investments/Stocks_(A_to_Z)/Stocks_N/threadview?bn=13029&amp;tid=689334&amp;mid=689347 "To all those who keep bashing qcom and aapl, I'll give you a what-if: what if qcom's lament about 28nm availability is aapl needed to hold up releasing their quad core iPhone5 so much because they both are waiting for enough 28nm qcom cheap radios.

Nvidia has a clear mobile roadmap and is relatively new to this mobile game. But they are quick learners and will get stronger with each generation. I admit they have very strong opponents, but Nvidia is in it for the longer run and fight and might win on stamina down the road. I believe Nvidia will capture a strong place for itself in the market and that it will become more clear down the road.

Some of the new phones were launched with solid sales already. Going forward, as an investor, you have another possible big win in the kindle fire 2. I can't imagine them releasing and updated tablet that is not quad core...only nvidia has it right now and qualcom can barely make enough 28nm to fill current demand for s4 phones so that's not likely. TI has basically nothing to offer right now. Also, we are only about a quarter away for windows 8 and that is going to create quite a bit of buzz. I wonder how many GTX 670 and 680's they sold this quarter. Demand is still strong for these products and supply recently seems to be keeping up. These are high margin products. How many macbook's did apple sell..They said their sales were good. You can go on and on with all the products nvidia's chips are in and lots more are coming. The professional workstation market is still growing and they dominate that market. I think we get a decent run in the stock price leading to the release of the numbers. Its hard to imagine them missing their estimates and not having good guidance. The environment for them is as good as its going to get. If they can't capitalize now when they have the lead, not sure when they will have another opportunity this big. Its a big quarter for them.</Msg><Username>ninascottfl</Username><Timestamp>1343397304000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 09:55:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343398106000-16</Id><Title>does it get walked to 12.90 today?</Title><Msg>a slot machine can't match those odds..</Msg><Username>smallstock1</Username><Timestamp>1343398106000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 10:08:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343400252000-17</Id><Topic><Title>earnings and guidance will be strong</Title><Username>ninascottfl</Username><Timestamp>1343397304000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 09:55:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>My understanding, the new Kindle was to be showcased this month, we're running out of days this month, anyone have an update?</Msg><Username>bigonnvda</Username><Timestamp>1343400252000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 10:44:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343403507000-18</Id><Topic><Title>earnings and guidance will be strong</Title><Username>ninascottfl</Username><Timestamp>1343397304000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 09:55:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No mention of Nexus 7.. sales soaring, yet NVDA didn't make a wave not even a splash.
