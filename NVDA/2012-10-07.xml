They grow 35% from Q1 to Q2, and the midpoint of the updated range for Q3 guidance suggests another quarter of 35%+ quarter over quarter growth. The Consumer Products segment of the business is set to post 100% growth for FY13 (current year) over FY12 -- and is on pace to be well over $1B in FY14 (calendar 2013).

Almost every major technology company is involved in ongoing patent battles, but the most significant player is Apple, industry executives say, because of its influence and the size of its claims: in August in California, the company won a $1 billion patent infringement judgment against Samsung. Former Apple employees say senior executives made a deliberate decision over the last decade, after Apple was a victim of patent attacks, to use patents as leverage against competitors to the iPhone, the company’s biggest source of profits. Apple has filed multiple suits against three companies — HTC, Samsung and Motorola Mobility, now part of Google — that today are responsible for more than half of all smartphone sales in the United States. If Apple’s claims — which include ownership of minor elements like rounded square icons and of more fundamental smartphone technologies — prevail, it will most likely force competitors to overhaul how they design phones, industry experts say. Patents for software and some kinds of electronics, particularly smartphones, are now so problematic that they contribute to a so-called patent tax that adds as much as 20 percent to companies’ research and development costs, according to a study conducted last year by two Boston University professors. One consequence of all this litigation, policy makers and academics say, is that patent disputes are suffocating the culture of start-ups that has long fueled job growth and technological innovation. “Think of the billions of dollars being flushed down the toilet,” said Ms. Heinen, the former Apple general counsel, who left the company and paid $2.2 million in connection with a federal investigation of stock option backdating. “When patent lawyers become rock stars, it’s a bad sign for where an industry is heading,” she said, adding that she had no issue with the lawyers themselves. In its response to The Times, Apple addressed “standards-essential” patents, which companies are obligated to license to competitors at reasonable rates, and wrote that it was “deeply concerned by the rampant abuse of standards-essential patents by some of our competitors.” Another sign of fatigue is the frequency with which executives and lawyers from Apple and Google speak to one another about patent disputes. Earlier this year, Google proposed a cease-fire, according to people familiar with the conversations. And when Google withdrew its Motorola suit last week, it was widely seen as a peace gesture. But Apple has been hard to pin down, said one person from Google who was not authorized to speak publicly. “Sometimes they’re asking for money. Then they say we have to promise to not copy aspects of the iPhone. And whenever we get close to an agreement, it all changes again. “Our feeling is they don’t really want this to end. As long as everyone is distracted by these trials, the iPhone continues to sell.” Apple declined to comment on the negotiations.</Msg><Username>best_ivideo</Username><Timestamp>1349664132886</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-07 22:42:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349664568297-24</Id><Title>HTC One X+ coming to Telus Canada “this fall”</Title><Msg>Source: androidauthorityDOTcom/htc-one-x-coming-telus-canada-this-fall-no-words-pricing-119687/</Msg><Username>findingnemoyes</Username><Timestamp>1349664568297</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-07 22:49:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349665213547-25</Id><Title>Jen Hsun to send get well cards to shareholders?</Title><Msg>would not cost much, easily covered by the stock sales made by the booard of directors over the past year... actually pathetic.....</Msg><Username>smallstock1</Username><Timestamp>1349665213547</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-07 23:00:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349667736215-26</Id><Topic><Title>NYTimes: The Patent, Used as a Sword</Title><Username>best_ivideo</Username><Timestamp>1349664132886</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-07 22:42:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Boy, those New York Times guys sure like to write, right? They sure do. Here's the best of their voluminous article. “Apple has always stood for innovation,” the company wrote in a statement in response to questions from The New York Times. “To protect our inventions, we have patented many of the new technologies in these groundbreaking and category-defining products. In the rare cases when we take legal action over a patent dispute, it’s only as a last resort. “We think companies should dream up their own products rather than willfully copying ours, and in August a jury in California reached the same conclusion,” the statement said. Patents are vitally important to protecting intellectual property. Plenty of creativity occurs within the technology industry, and without patents, executives say they could never justify spending fortunes on new products. “If we can’t protect our intellectual property, then we won’t spend millions creating products like the iPhone,” a former Apple executive said, noting that some of Apple’s patents, like the “slide to unlock” feature on the iPhone, took years to perfect. The concept “might seem obvious now, but that’s only after we spent millions figuring it out,” the executive said. “Other companies shouldn’t be able to steal that without compensating us. That’s why the patent system exists.” In its response to The Times, Apple addressed “standards-essential” patents, which companies are obligated to license to competitors at reasonable rates, and wrote that it was “deeply concerned by the rampant abuse of standards-essential patents by some of our competitors.” “Standards-essential patents are technologies which these companies have volunteered to license to anyone for a reasonable fee,” the statement said, “but instead of negotiating with Apple, they’ve chosen to sue us.” Samsung, Motorola, Nokia and HTC have sued Apple, claiming it violated standards-essential patents. “Intellectual property is property, just like a house, and its owners deserve protection,” said Jay P. Kesan, a law professor at the University of Illinois. “We have rules in place, and they’re getting better.
