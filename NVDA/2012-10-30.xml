The phone will be launched in time for Christmas, with sales in selected markets from next month. Nexus 4 comes with a Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 Pro processor and 2GB of RAM. The new phone comes with am 8-megapixel camera and a 4.7" display with 1280-by-768 pixel resolution. "This is the first time we collaborated with LG to build a Nexus device," said Andy Ru-bin, Senior Vice President of Mobile and Digital Content at Google. "They brought an extraordinary amount of talent to the project, and the result is a feature-packed device that feels great in your hand, and blazingly fast under the hood." Nexus 4 is sold unlocked and is GSM/HSPA+ compatible so it will operate on more than 200 network providers worldwide. It will be available to purchase in both an 8GB version and a 16GB version on Google Play starting November 13 in the USA, UK, Canada, Germany, France, Spain and Australia. Retail stores will start selling the smartphone in Europe, Central/South Americas, Asia, CIS and the Middle East will begin from the end of November. Separately, the nvidia camp is said to be sulking about Qualcomm eating their lunch.

Here are the benchmarks and the scores: SunSpider: 668.5ms (lower is better) V8: 3871 (higher is better) Octane: 3465 (higher is better) Now that we have these scores, let’s compare them to the main competitors of the Exynos 5 Dual chip: the A6 chip in the iPhone 5 and the Atom Z2460 in the Motorola Razr i. Exynos 5 Dual (Samsung Chromebook) Apple A6 (Apple iPhone 5) Intel Atom Z2460 (Motorola Razr i) Snapdragon S4 (HTC One X) Tegra 3 (HTC One X) SunSpider 668.5 908 1086.6 1608 1737.7 V8 3871 1533 2209 1507 1162 Octane 3465 1672 2048 1280 1131 * The benchmark scores listed above are courtesy of AnandTech. As you can see, Samsung’s latest chip handily beats the previous leaders, with the difference being especially visible in the SunSpider test. For some perspective, consider that the iPhone 5 is the first device to complete SunSpider in less than 1000ms. At 668.5, the new Exynos just smashes that record. SunSpider, V8, and Octane are all JavaScript tests, so results may vary when using other benchmark suites. Still, it’s impressive to see what Samsung was able to achieve, and we are looking forward to see what the Exynos 5 Dual can do in next year’s Samsung Galaxy S4 and Galaxy Note 3</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1351594240080</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 06:50:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351601956271-3</Id><Topic><Title>3G Nexus 7, Nexus 4, Nexus 10 to be available on November 13; Nexus 7 32GB is available now in US</Title><Username>ibexx88</Username><Timestamp>1351545036671</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-29 17:10:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>16G Nexus 10 w/Exynos for $400, retina display.... count one sold here! so again waht did you say Jen was going to do at the next CES?</Msg><Username>whosunw</Username><Timestamp>1351601956271</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 08:59:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351602461954-4</Id><Title>ZTE unveils $160 Tegra 3 quad-core smartphone</Title><Msg>The world can use a few more low-cost, high-powered smartphones. Chinese manufacturer ZTE has announced its new U950 Android mobile, which features a quad-core processor and a low price tag of $160. The first 100,000 consumers to step up will be able to place an order on November 11. The ZTE U950 measures in at 9mm thick, and features a 4.3-inch display and runs Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich. Inside you’ll find a 1.3GHz quad-core NVIDIA Tegra 3 processor and 1GB of RAM. There’s a rear 5MP camera, and VGA-resolution front camera for video calls. Sadly, the device only has 4GB of internal storage space. ZTE has been swept up recently in accusations of possible espionage for the Chinese government, which has also been brought against Huawei. The US House Intelligence Committee recommended that ZTE and Huawei both be avoided, saying, “China has the means, opportunity, and motive to use telecommunications companies for malicious purposes.” ZTE responded with the statement, “ZTE has set an unprecedented standard for cooperation by any Chinese company with a congressional investigation.” While the features are all pretty basic, it’s obviously the processor power-to-cost ratio that makes the phone attention-worthy. The U950 is priced at 999 yuan, which is about $160USD. The handset is slated for release in China next month. There’s no word on whether this cheapo quad-core will be making its way stateside or elsewhere.</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1351602461954</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 09:07:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>37</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351603701458-5</Id><Topic><Title>ZTE unveils $160 Tegra 3 quad-core smartphone</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1351602461954</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 09:07:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"The first 100,000 consumers to step up will be able to place an order on November 11."

The House intelligence committee report said the companies failed to cooperate with a yearlong investigation and to adequately explain their U.S. business interests and relationship with the Chinese government. “Huawei and ZTE seek to expand in the United States, but as a result of our investigation, we do not have the confidence that these two companies with their ties to the Chinese government can be trusted with infrastructure of such critical importance,” the committee’s chairman, Michigan Republican Mike Rogers, said. The U.S. government should block acquisitions or mergers by Huawei and ZTE, the report said. Government agencies and contractors shouldn’t use equipment from the companies, and U.S. intelligence agencies should “remain vigilant and focused on this threat,” the report recommended. The House investigation found credible reports of illegal behavior by Huawei, including immigration violations, bribery and corruption, based on statements from current and former employees, according to the report. Allegations will be referred to federal agencies including the Homeland Security and the Justice departments, according to the report, which didn’t provide full details or identify the accusers. ‘Political Distraction’ The committee will forward information on a “clear case of bribery in order to get a contract here in the United States” to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, probably tomorrow, Rogers said at a U.S. Capitol news conference today with the panel’s top Democrat, Maryland Representative C.A. “Dutch” Ruppersberger. ‘State Influence’ Dai Shu, a ZTE spokesman, called it “noteworthy” that “after a yearlong investigation, the committee rests its conclusions on a finding that ZTE may not be ‘free of state influence.’” That standard “would apply to any company operating in China,” Dai said in an e-mailed statement. Almost all telecommunications-infrastructure equipment sold in the U.S., by any company, contains Chinese-made components, Dai said. “ZTE recommends that the committee’s investigation be extended to include every company making equipment in China,” including Western companies that use equipment made by Chinese joint-venture partners and suppliers, Dai said. ZTE shares fell 6 percent to HK$12.60 at the close of Hong Kong trading, the biggest decline since Aug. 27. The stock has lost 48 percent this year, compared with a 13 percent gain for the benchmark Hang Seng Index. Rogers and Ruppersberger announced the probe of the Chinese companies last November, citing concerns about hacking into U.S. systems and theft of intellectual property. U.S. counterintelligence officials called China the world’s biggest perpetrator of economic espionage in a report last year, saying the theft of sensitive data is accelerating and jeopardizing an estimated $398 billion in U.S. research spending. Odd Behavior “Private-sector entities in the United States are strongly encouraged to consider the long-term security risks associated with doing business with either ZTE or Huawei for equipment or services,” the report says. The committee received reports that routing equipment supplied by Huawei to U.S. customers “acted oddly,” Rogers said. He cited a process known as beaconing, which he said involves unauthorized processing and sending of information. One example would be a router that turns on in the middle of the night and sends large packets of data to China, he said. Huawei first learned of the beaconing allegation at a House intelligence committee hearing last month, and it’s unclear what the committee is referring to, Plummer said in an interview." “Private-sector entities in the United States are strongly encouraged to consider the long-term security risks associated with doing business with either ZTE or Huawei for equipment or services,” the report says.
