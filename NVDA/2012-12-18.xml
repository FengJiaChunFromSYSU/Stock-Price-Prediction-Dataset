First, Apple sells their superb self-manufactured iPhone-on-a-chip processor. Plus their really good, non-patent infringing operating system to go with it. And provides their world-renowned Apple expert service for the licensed devices. And pays the licensed copy-cat people half of the carrier fee to boot. Why, I'll bet Everybody would sign-up for that program. Yes boys, EVERYBODY. Acer, T &amp; A Phones (Formerly Alcatel), Asus, Audiovox, Benefon, Blackberry, Casio, Dell, Fujitsu, HTC, Huawai, Karbonn, Kyocera, L-G, Lenovo, Motorola, NEC, Nokia, Panasonic, Pantech, Philips, Sagem, Samsung, Sanyo, Sharp, Siemens, Sony Ericsson, Viewsonic and ZTE. Well okay, maybe not Microsoft. But everybody else. Did I mention? It's an Absolutely Brilliant and Diabolical Plan by Apple to Conquer ALL of Mobile. Jeepers Best.

With Apple breaking-up with Samsung and moving out to their own fab place, Samsung won't get to peek at Apple's fantastic chip designs any more. Or steal Apple's design ideas -- never ever ever again. Oh no no no. Like Apple taking the standard out-of-the-box Cortex A-15 FedEx blueprints -- and tweaking them to be the very best. Yes, the very Best, boys. So Samsung loses the benefit of peeking at Apple's great chip designs. Like, forever. Separately, that's a Great Idea for an Apple commercial, Best. Taylor Swift singing, "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together" Played on a couple Genuine Apple iPad Minis. Maybe they add Korean captioning too? And run the TV commercials in Korea!

I’m just speculating on industry rumors, but it makes a lot of sense. Nvidia could lay two to four graphics chips down on a 2.5-D substrate using through silicon vias to create an ultra powerful graphics-card-on-a -chip driving a muscular iMac. It might even add a memory chip to the mix to create a device with fast memory access, good for either an iMac or Macbook. What’s more, Nvidia could place one of its new Project Denver ARM cores next to a graphics chip and maybe some memory to enable a high performance, low power Macbook running iOS. A low cost iOS laptop could leapfrog anything we have seen to date out of the Windows 8 crowd. Here’s the kicker: Apple could supply its A-series SoC to Nvidia which could add graphics and memory to a stack for a high-end iPad. It would create a novel premium product injecting fresh life into tablets at the high end, putting more distance between Apple and its growing Android tablet competitors. The stacking technology is still too expensive, hot and power hungry for smartphones. But come 2015 or so, it may start appearing there, too, in the form of full 3-D stacks. This isn’t rocket science. Xilinx started the trend of 2.5-D stacks in late 2011 with an ultra dense chip that put two of its top FPGAs on a single substrate. Huawei said it is working on a similar device using an Altera FPGA and a memory chip for a router. In computers, IBM is working on 2.5-D chips that marry its Power server processors and memory. IBM is already pitching to customers it a ability to make such stacks as is TSMC which helped make the Xilinx part. One market watcher tells me there are as many as a dozen of these designs in the works for 2013.</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1355843986809</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 10:19:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355844183333-16</Id><Topic><Title>Q: When will Tegra be able to target the mainstream smartphone market?</Title><Username>mslans</Username><Timestamp>1355843791037</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 10:16:31 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>IF Grey has just taped out... what do you think</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1355844183333</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 10:23:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355845817914-17</Id><Topic><Title>Apple, Nvidia may stack graphics for Macs, iPads</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1355843986809</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 10:19:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>" not authored by Getanid." ya think...

The slide leaked by Chinese tech site Chip Hell details a 28-nanometer part featuring "4-plus-1" quad cores with a fifth battery saver core. It is likely that with this new processor Nvidia will shift to ARM's latest Cortex-A15 design. Graphics are handled by a 72-core GPU that the slide claims offers 20-times the performance of the Tegra 2 and six-times that of the current-generation Tegra 3. The chip can pump enough pixels to fill a 2,560 x 1600 resolution display -- the same resolution as Google's Nexus 10 tablet -- and 1080p output at 120Hz. There's also mention of 4K support, but no details are provided. Apple's current A6X processor which powered the iPad 4 is about four times as fast as the Tegra 3, so this could put pressure on the Cupertino, Calif.-based technology giant to squeeze more power from its A-series parts. "Wayne" is also Nvidia's first chip to support USB 3.0, along with dual-channel DDR3L memory.</Msg><Username>bemneiny</Username><Timestamp>1355851424531</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 12:23:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355855113410-31</Id><Topic><Title>Looking at NVDA stock price action with markets soaring past two days</Title><Username>retorfuk</Username><Timestamp>1355849969623</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 11:59:29 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I gained 12 big cents, lol looking to add once it stabilizes above 13.5</Msg><Username>guy_8619</Username><Timestamp>1355855113410</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 13:25:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355856363268-32</Id><Topic><Title>Atom beats tegra3 in Windows 8.

According to a survey conducted between October and November 2012 by market research firm Parks Associates, 44% of the tablet-seeking holiday shoppers polled planned to purchase an iPad this year and 24% were eying a Kindle Fire. The study gets interesting in the No.3 and No.4 slots, however — the firm’s data shows that 21% of consumers polled planned to purchase Microsoft’s (MSFT) Surface tablet compared to just 12% who planned to by a Nexus tablet. Considering the continued heavy interest in Google’s Nexus 7, this could be a solid indication that Surface sales this holiday quarter won’t be the catastrophe many industry watchers have predicted. Additionally, Microsoft recently announced that it has increased Surface production and expanded retail distribution. Another interesting note from the Parks Associates study: The world was Microsoft’s oyster with the Surface tablet… until it announced pricing. “Consumers initially expressed interest in the Microsoft Surface, but once pricing and product details were announced, holiday intentions to purchase a Microsoft Surface dropped to 21% in Q4 from 45% in Q3,” Parks Associates’ director of consumer analytics John Barrett said. In other words, interest in Microsoft’s Surface was higher in the third quarter than interest in Apple’s iPad lineup was going into the holidays.</Msg><Username>livinlifeveryday</Username><Timestamp>1355857224951</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 14:00:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355857692163-35</Id><Topic><Title>AMZN Kindle Fire Struggling, Says Pacific Crest, Cuts Estimates</Title><Username>bemneiny</Username><Timestamp>1355850941633</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 12:15:41 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Uhm, really?

It is easy to screw up your designs in the cpu world, ask AMD who have been under more severe competition than Nvidia has in those 15 years. A15 is a hot chip, a 2 GHz 28nm quad-core going flat out could be close to 10W if this review is any indication which is not compatible with phone usage which is why Nvidia has a separate phone chip design, Grey. anandtechDOTcom/show/6422/samsung-chromebook-xe303-review-testing-arms-cortex-a15/7</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1355889956945</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 23:05:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355892951720-70</Id><Topic><Title>While the Market rallies, nvda is struggling in the La Brea Tar Pits</Title><Username>bestnhighest.wins</Username><Timestamp>1355888777434</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 22:46:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Jeepers Best, Apple Inc. was UP $15.07 (+2.90%) today! Which, times Apple's 940.7 million shares iOutstanding means that Apple increased their Market Cap by $14.176 Billion Dollars today. + $14,176,000,000.00 Yes just today, boys. Which is about Twice (2x) little nvidia's Entire Market Cap. So Apple grew by two (2) nvidias today. And to think it took current CEO Jen nineteen (19) years to grow just one. Maybe nvidia needs a more growth-oriented CEO. And fast.</Msg><Username>jeepers.best</Username><Timestamp>1355892951720</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 23:55:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
