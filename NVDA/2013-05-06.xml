Most of my game playing is casual, and I do it on a medium size tablet, followed by a phone. Serious games are played solo on a PC+GPU system, and family games are played on a Wii. When I'm serious, I want the full experience. I don't want to play a beautiful game on hardware that doesn't provide the whole experience. Consoles were great when they were the best experience, or an equivalent experience. But once it was clear that PC+GPU systems were better, most of the appeal of the console went away. Paying full price for a game, knowing that I'm only seeing part of it, doesn't sit well with me. And I think I'm pretty typical in that respect. The next generation of consoles are lining up to be pretty much a mid-range PC. And if the past is any indication, they'll stay with that configuration for at least five years. So from day one it's easy to buy better hardware, and by year two you know you'll be missing part of the experience of new titles. Console makers are hoping that consumers won't notice that they are getting essentially a repackaged, limited capability PC. But this is a market that is smart. Part of it lives and breathes this stuff. They make up their draft Christmas list in July, after six months of research. And tell all of their friends what to buy. Nvidia could have fought to retain the console business. But they already know it would be a low value business. They only get a tiny slice of the zero-margin hardware revenue, not a chunk of the profitable game content business which is where the money is made. And the business might not have last generation's volume. AMD, on the other hand, is in a different position. Since they have a CPU, they can deliver the whole hardware solution and get a much bigger slice of the hardware revenue. Plus they might get to make the chips, reducing their penalty payments to GF for not using capacity.</Msg><Username>watergatefive</Username><Timestamp>1367877473109</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 17:57:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367880277670-60</Id><Topic><Title>Intc.

Intel does not price its mobile chips expensively as they end up in competitively priced designs. They are also enabling new players some of which are just using the standard intel reference design. Medfield/Clovertrail are good designs, they give similar performance/power to Apple A6 and slightly better performance/power than Qualcomm Snapdragon designs. Silvermont will take this equal/slight advantage and make it a big advantage making it hard to ignore by big traditional ARM OEMs as customers will eventually be picking the winners. Apple will still be using its own ARM chips and the cheap $10 Chinese chips will still survive but everyone else using ARM faces severe competition which will reduce their prices.

SOURCE: Anandtech Final Words Silvermont really is Intel’s Conroe for the mobile market, but not in the sense that many have been expecting. Given that success in mobile is so closely tied to device wins, Silvermont alone isn’t enough. Unlike Conroe, a very competitive Silvermont won’t change the world overnight. What Silvermont does however is offer a great foundation for Intel going forward. Conroe lead to Penryn, Nehalem, Westmere, Sandy Bridge, Ivy Bridge and soon, Haswell. It was the platform that Intel could build on regularly by executing on tick-tock. Conroe paved the way for the insane advantage Intel has held onto for the past few years. Silvermont is like Conroe in that it provides that same foundation. _____ It is a START.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1367896019966</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 23:06:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367896621838-71</Id><Topic><Title>Intc.

Intel also took too long converting 1st generation 45nm Atom into a 32nm SoC, 4 years !, which held up the micro-architectural pipeline.</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1367897858786</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 23:37:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
