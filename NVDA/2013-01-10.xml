Being able to stream PC games is only a plus but certainly no requirement. I think you underestimate the target ordience of the device. I play some Android game on my HTC one X but i sometimes miss the ability to use a proper controller, which i believe would improve my reaction time and precision and hence improve my high score. So even before they annonced Project shield I was contemplating on how to achieve that. If price is fine then I could easily see myself by it just for that purpose. Anyway I can also stream TV and netflix etc. to the device. The device have many selling points and I would think it would become a favorite for the very young ordience from 6- 18 years. But indeed also very interesting for the grown ups. Let us see what the future brings.</Msg><Username>A Yahoo!

But the chief executive of the world’s biggest graphics chip maker had to pull a lot of things together first before deciding to make it — like figuring out how to make a gaming console. Nvidia designs chips such as the Tegra 4 inside the Project Shield, but it’s never gone directly into the consumer market with its own game system. (It did go out on its own into the retail market before with its 3DVision 3D glasses in the past). Nvidia has also worked to establish a cloud gaming network dubbed the Nvidia GeForce Gaming Grid, which provides the underlying foundation for delivering games to the Shield device, which includes a 5-inch screen atop a game controller. Then it designed a new kind of processing for its latest graphics chips. And in the past year, it put the finishing touches on its Tegra 4 mobile processor, which has four computing cores and 72 graphics cores. It would be wrong to think that Shield is just another Android game controller. It has a whole ecosystem built around it and high-end components for hardcore gamers. In short, Project Shield is a massive effort that required the work of thousands of Nvidia employees. Now, it’s finally ready, and Huang showed Project Shield to us in an interview at the Nvidia booth at CES. (See our hands-on vide0). Here’s an edited transcript of our exclusive interview. Huang: Exactly. That’s ideal. We haven’t tuned any of the knobs on this, or the buttons, but ideally it should respond just like one. The moment you pick it up, you should recognize it as a controller. There are two things that we wanted to do. We wanted to make sure that for anybody who picks it up, and in the moment that they do, they’re instantly familiar with it. All the controls are exactly where they expected. Secondly, because it’s pure Android, you know exactly how to use it. Because this is pure Android. If you’re an Android user — and this is targeting Android users — the moment that you turn it on, your whole life shows up. All your music is there. All your movies are there. All the Tegra Zone games you’ve already bought on your phone are there. GamesBeat: What are some of the reactions you’ve heard so far? Huang: I would say that the No. 1 reaction is, “Wow, it’s a lot smaller than I expected.” GamesBeat: What design decisions can you talk about? You could probably have just had a tablet sitting on top of something that you could attach, taking the controller away. I think I’ve seen other designs like that out there already. Is there a reason not to do that? Huang: First of all, a tablet is too heavy. It’s too top-heavy. Second, notice that this isn’t a tablet. It’s just a display. All of the electronics, the batteries, are in here. The balance of the system wants to be in your hand. Even a phone is too top-heavy. Worse, you don’t want to drain the battery life of your phone. Your phone is used for communication. The benefit of using Android is that all of the content on your tablet or your phone automatically shows up here. The instant familiarity of the system is a real plus. The connection to your open system, with all of your digital content, is a plus. The design decisions started with this. It has to be a wonderful gaming device. The controller can’t be sacrificed. We started with the palms of your hands, how everything fit into your hand — the bumpers, the triggers, the buttons. They have to be in the appropriate places. Then we fit all of the technology around it. That’s No. 1. No. 2, it has to be as small as possible, to the point where the volume of this device is approximately a game controller. The reason for that is because if you’re willing to carry a game controller in your bag, then from a volume perspective, you want to carry this in your bag. The third thing, of course, is that the performance has to be amazing. And then, the magic trick … as a device that is consistent with the way we expect to consume media in the future — wireless, cloud, streaming — those kinds of experiences have to be introduced. Streaming from your PC. We do streaming to your TV. In the future we’ll do streaming from Grid. Not only is this a wonderful game device, but it’s also gaming in a new way, the way that we expect to consume digital content.</Msg><Username>livinlifeveryday</Username><Timestamp>1357821734393</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 07:42:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357821909695-9</Id><Topic><Title>Jen-Hsun Huang interview re Shield (sec 1)</Title><Username>livinlifeveryday</Username><Timestamp>1357821734393</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 07:42:14 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>GamesBeat: What was going on in your heads during all of this time? People were saying that free-to-play was disrupting everything on Facebook, for instance, or iOS. They said that somebody had to bring this to the consoles and disrupt those $60-dollar console games, but nobody did it. Then things like Ouya started popping up. It seemed like it was taking startups to do something the established companies wouldn’t. You guys are an established company in different ways, partnering with some of those guys. What was your thinking when the opportunity for something like this came up? Huang: If you talk to Julie at Ouya, she’ll tell you that her best partner in the world is Nvidia. We have hundreds of engineers working on her behalf to realize that game console. We love what they’re doing. But I frankly think that Ouya and that game console could be made by other companies aside from us. We can do it, but other companies can do it too. The reason why I built this device is because only we can build this device. This device, Shield, has such incredible performance. It’s got the software stack that treats it like a server to stream to television. It treats it like a receiver for servers in the cloud and on your PC. The software that’s necessary to do that is so complicated. No company in the world is going to get it together. We’re going to have to do this. It’s the same technology that I was going to use for GRID anyway. The GRID technology goes into my PC. My PC now becomes a GRID server for this. I put that same technology in Shield. Now Shield becomes a GRID server for television. I’ve got all the technology that I can leverage. It’s very delicate and complicated technology, because it has to work, but it also has to work with very low latency. GamesBeat: What came first here? Graphics chips for supercomputers, or this? /strong Huang: In the schematic that I drew, we have a supercomputer in the cloud streaming to PC, to a mobile device, and to a receiver on television. I put “receiver,” because it could be Ouya. It could be a dongle. It could be an Xbox. It could be a smart TV. It could be anything, right? It doesn’t matter. Receivers of all kinds. I’ve been working on that schematic for almost seven years. The question is, how do I get it all connected in a way such that not only will the technology come together, but there’s a way to bring the whole service to the marketplace, the whole experience. That’s why we had to create GFE. The reason why this works is because Tegra Zone is here. That’s why we had to create Tegra Zone. Without Tegra Zone, how would I have the games? Without the games, why would this be special? All of this technology had to be built in pieces and taken to market. We had to allow them to be enjoyed in the marketplace individually. Then, finally, when the final piece comes together, everything else clicks in. It’s been quite a journey. GamesBeat: With GRID, it looks like that strategy is a broad strategy where you could have lots of partners. In this business, it almost seems like you compete with some of those guys. I wonder how you navigate that. Huang: I don’t think anybody’s going to make a mobile device like this. I think this is a little extreme. The R&amp;D budget necessary to create something like this is pretty significant. GamesBeat: So a simple game controller attached to an Android phone is not going to do what you just talked about here. Huang: It’s a very different experience. It emulates or approximates the experience. We’ll work with all of them. We’ll help them in fact. The reason for that is because the more devices are out there, the more Tegra Zone will become valuable. The more Tegra Zone becomes valuable, the more devices will be out there. We don’t mind that this is the center of the ecosystem. It doesn’t have to be the only device in the ecosystem. If other people would like to build Android devices for gaming, that’s fine. We can’t stop anybody. But this is a device, a game store in Tegra Zone, and an integrated ecosystem that quite frankly I don’t think anybody else in the world can do.</Msg><Username>livinlifeveryday</Username><Timestamp>1357821909695</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 07:45:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357821965243-10</Id><Topic><Title>Jen-Hsun Huang interview re Shield (sec 1)</Title><Username>livinlifeveryday</Username><Timestamp>1357821734393</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 07:42:14 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>GamesBeat: You make someone like Google happy doing this, I think. Huang: They should love it. GamesBeat: But Microsoft and Sony, maybe… [laughs] They may have to get used to this kind of future. Huang: Well, a console is a dedicated gaming experience. It’s a very specific experience. It’s beneficial in its own ways. The platform stays constant. It’s just less messy. They’re perfect experiences made possible because of the nature of the business model. I don’t think that’s going away. We’re not trying to be that. We’re going to try to be something very different. If anything, this is just an extension of your Android device family. I now have a smartphone. I now have a seven-inch tablet. I have a 10-inch Android tablet. I have a 10-inch Android transformable. And now I have a sexy little Android device for playing games. People are making Android TV pucks. There’s Android stuff all over my house. This is just yet another Android device. GamesBeat: For games, are we going to see 4K content materializing because something like this exists? Huang: We will definitely be able to generate 4K content from games sooner than 4K video content becomes available to consumers. I can synthesize the pixels. GamesBeat: Is that what you’d call scaling up…? Huang: I can upscale it, but I’d probably just synthesize it. GeForce renders to 4K all day long, right? On 25″ by 16″.= GamesBeat: So it’ll be more like a good PC game display. Huang: Exactly. I’m going to stream 4K right to this thing and HDMI it right to the TV. GamesBeat: Valve are very interesting partners here, too. They like openness. Is that a reason for you guys to tie up here? Huang: Because we’re open and because they’re open, we are tied by definition. Notice that we instantly demonstrated Steam running on this thing. They didn’t have to lift a finger. We instantly put Steam on television. That’s the beautiful thing about it. That’s the whole point of openness. All of my available digital content is instantly available on this device. Here’s the wonderful thing. Next year, Shield 2 comes. I buy it, I turn it on, and all of my Shield 1 stuff is there. GamesBeat: That’s another question. How many models do you think you’ll need to have? Huang: We’ll make one model a year. GamesBeat: Are they backward compatible? Huang: By definition. Just like an Android device. GamesBeat: Do you want to change around your screen size? Have multiple models that way? Huang: The second generation, of course, I don’t know what it’s going to be yet, but obviously we’ll keep innovating and keep making it better. People are telling us how we can improve and we’re learning from that. GamesBeat: It seems like there would be one challenge, in that you might have to teach people that this is more than a game controller. They’re used to paying $40 dollars for a nice game controller. They might not realize… Huang: For people that have seen it and read about it on the web, I think the reaction has been pretty overwhelmingly exciting. The reason for that is, we’re targeting Android gamers and PC gamers. They’re not six years old. They’re not grandmothers. We’re targeting our core market. They understand what this is. Our core market are open-platform gamers. They want to be able to do free-to-play. They’re the guys that buy brand-new GeForce cards every year at $300 dollars. They’re the guys buying GeForce cards at $1,000 dollars. These are people who love gadgets. They get it. GamesBeat: Backing up a little, how did you get past the point of making your own hardware and selling your own hardware? In the same way that Microsoft was a software company until they decided to do the Xbox, or Intel at some point made systems… Huang: We never once thought like that. We always think like this. First of all, “Is this something that the world would benefit from if we were to build it?” Number two, “Is this something that we should go off and build?” Then we ask ourselves, “Is this something that we can build better than anybody else in the world?” You ask yourself, “Who would build this?” It turns out that Sony’s not going to build this. Nintendo is not going to build this. It doesn’t make sense for Dell to build this. This is something that we believe could make a real contribution to the world. We believe that this is something we could build like nobody else could. This is something that none of our existing customers really make sense to build. So if it’s something that has to be done, and we’re the best in the world to do it, and we’re actually the only person to do it, then of course we’re happy to do it.</Msg><Username>livinlifeveryday</Username><Timestamp>1357821965243</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 07:46:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357821997633-11</Id><Topic><Title>Jen-Hsun Huang interview re Shield (sec 1)</Title><Username>livinlifeveryday</Username><Timestamp>1357821734393</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 07:42:14 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>GamesBeat: Did this make sense, too, because you were not deeply involved in a particular console project at this time as well? Huang: We started this project long before any console project. We’ve been working on this whole system now for five to seven years. It’s not related to that. I would still love to have built any of the game consoles, so long as two conditions would have happened — that the economics were right, and that it wouldn’t have distracted the company too much. These game consoles are very consuming. Every console is a radically different computer — different operating system, different system logic, different architecture, different system software. Everything is brand new. There’s no leverage whatsoever, except for the core technology and the expertise. It’s very disruptive to a company. It’s very dangerous. Every single time I’ve worked on a game console, I’ve almost lost my life. [laughs] You’ve been watching me a long time. I think the reason for that is because they’re just radically different computers. It takes a lot of energy to build a computer. If I could do it, I would have enjoyed doing it. We just couldn’t do it. This is a leverage of our existing capabilities. Everything here is exactly what we were building anyways. By building this, it contributes to our existing strategy. This will help GeForce. This will give GeForce users yet another way to extend and enjoy their game experience. This will help Tegra. Every one of these games that are optimized and whatnot for Shield are going to show up in Tegra Zone. Tegra Zone helps all of the Tegra users. Everything here is amplified by the work that I do. Not a game console. Once I’m done with that, if the economics are terrible, there’s no recurring benefit. GamesBeat: How much of this are you going to do yourself? When you describe GeForce GRID, people wonder, “Is Amazon going to help you with some part of that? They’ve already got lots of infrastructure.” Are contract manufacturers going to make this? Are you going to find those partners out there to help you in this business? Huang: Same thing. We should only work on the pieces of technology and the pieces of capability that nobody else is doing. We’re working with great partners to build this device. With respect to the cloud, cloud game streaming is going to come from a lot of different places. It’s going to come from hosted infrastructures like Amazon. It’s going to come from cable companies who have their own headends and their own data centers, because they want to stream the video game directly over a channel to you. They want to give you another premium channel to subscribe to. You have ESPN and you have HBO and here comes another channel called GRID or something. Then there’s also telcos who want to stream it as a game service over the 4G network. There’s a lot of different ways that people are going to try to deliver this content and this service to their end users. Sometimes it makes sense for Amazon to host it for us or host it with us. Sometimes it makes sense for them to host it themselves. Other times, you’re going to find that cable providers or telcos are going to host it themselves. GamesBeat: Is there some part of the infrastructure that’s not so great here? I would think of the wireless part of all this being, in some ways, not quite mature. I don’t know if Bluetooth Smart has to be used in this in some way. Or you’re using a cable because wi-fi is just not good enough, especially with something like 4K. How do you get stuff from Steam to the TV? Huang: All of those things are exactly the same as it is for video. The way to think about it is this. If Netflix doesn’t run, there’s no hope for GRID to run. There are many environments where Netflix doesn’t run at all. If Netflix can’t deliver decent service, then it’s going to be hard for us to deliver decent service. So we have all the same constraints. But if you’re sitting at Starbucks, my guess is that you’re going to rock and roll pretty well. If you’re sitting at an airport, you’re going to get a pretty good shot. If you’re sitting in a hotel room, you’re in pretty good shape. If we can’t figure out a way to deliver all 720p, they can always scale down to 480p, just like Netflix does. We understand the connection and we’ll adapt just like video streaming. GamesBeat: I think some people who watched the demos were skeptical of how powerful Tegra 4 might be and whether it’s really approaching the high-end PCs in some ways. Where should the expectation be about how good the graphics will look, both on this screen and on a big screen? Huang: Well, you saw Hawken. That was ported from a PC. Hawken is pretty stunning. The capability of the GPU is surely there. If we were to run the same game as Tegra 3 was running at the same framerate, the power is about half Tegra 3. However, you could deliver two or three times the performance at about the same power as Tegra 3. That’s the benefit of 28nm. That’s the benefit of better design and so on and so forth. It depends on what you’re trying to do. If I’m delivering the exact same experience as Tegra 3, I will deliver it at lower power. Most of the Tegra Zone games today, I’ll play them with lower power on Tegra 4 than I do on Tegra 3. But if it’s an extremely optimized and amped-up game like Hawken, we’ll run many times the performance of Tegra 3 with about the same or slightly higher power.</Msg><Username>livinlifeveryday</Username><Timestamp>1357821997633</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 07:46:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357822031911-12</Id><Topic><Title>Jen-Hsun Huang interview re Shield (sec 1)</Title><Username>livinlifeveryday</Username><Timestamp>1357821734393</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 07:42:14 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>GamesBeat: You guys haven’t quite said anything about pricing yet. Huang: We haven’t decided yet. Obviously it’s going to have to be priced for the value that it delivers. It’s going to be priced like an Android device. That’s the way to think about it. GamesBeat: The timing here looks good. There are no consoles arriving in the next quarter or two. On the other hand, did you have to wait for anything to get this shipped? Huang: The most important thing is Tegra 4. We are basically the first device on Tegra 4. We’re running at the speed of Tegra 4. The moment the chips come out of the fab, it’s going to drop like that 3D animation. It’s going to go right into another production line and come out the back end. That’s the beautiful thing about this. The customer who buys Shield is going to get the state of the art in everything. GamesBeat: But it’s probably good that you’re not going to be selling up against an Xbox 720 or whatever. Huang: Yeah, I guess at some level that’s right. At another level I just don’t think it’s exactly the same. This is targeted at people who are Android users and PC gamers. This is a device that helps them enjoy that better. If you say, on the other hand, that when Xbox comes out, everybody stops buying everything else in the world — tablets and keyboards and monitors and graphics cards — we don’t generally experience that. They’re related, but they’re not exactly the same. My sense is that we’re targeting a completely different audience. We’re targeting a completely different value proposition and a completely different business model. It’s not designed to be a game console. It’s a gaming device.

Then it designed a new kind of processing for its latest graphics chips. And in the past year, it put the finishing touches on its Tegra 4 mobile processor, which has four computing cores and 72 graphics cores." I think this sums it up. Nvidia vision is on leveraging their core competencies in all their product lines in order to streamline and bring a one of a kind user experience. Thus differentiating themselves from being "Just a chip maker", or "Just a console developer" or "just a cloud computing platform". All of these together could offer a better one of a kind user experience for the niche that they feel comfortable with. I think for the most part especially those dismissing this as just another mobile device clearly aren't seeing the forest for the trees, but that's ok there are very few visionaries in the world. Pundits can say what they want but Nvidia is really way ahead of the game in terms of vision - call it a gamble but success or failure the concept is ahead of it's time, certainly ahead of most of the copy cats in this industry. BTW: Does anybody else think that the NVIDIA MS is strained or at least, from NVIDIA's perspective, financially or technologically passe? The reason I say this is because their wording seems to very deliberate and emphatic when speaking of the shield - "pure android", "platform for open systems" - all things MS is NOT! Maybe I am just reading too much into this...Any thoughts?</Msg><Username>brokeagain73</Username><Timestamp>1357826831270</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 09:07:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357827501123-18</Id><Topic><Title>pre-market up, it'll open down, like clockwork</Title><Username>smallstock1</Username><Timestamp>1357826168228</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 08:56:08 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You do know that I am heavily loaded, do you?lol</Msg><Username>guy_8619</Username><Timestamp>1357827501123</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 09:18:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357827766518-19</Id><Topic><Title>Jen-Hsun Huang interview re Shield (sec 1)</Title><Username>livinlifeveryday</Username><Timestamp>1357821734393</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 07:42:14 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Here's one of the inconvenient parts that was edited out.

I am not sure exactly why - maybe analyst sentiment, but those guys are clueless, however the markets do act as they are told until empirical data proves otherwise. I haven't heard anything official from any analysts but we'll see. I honestly get the impression that the introduction of the Shield really confused everyone... I disagree about the cash - it gives a company a lot of leverage. I think the SG comparison is way off base. NVIDIA has a much better track record, following and history. SG died out in what 10 years well before it was able to root itself (typically of academically centered companies - professors have no business in business, their just not good at it). The company was unable to establish it's niche (changed course 11 billion times), eventually tried to compete with Win-Tel and had horrible business fundamentals. The dynamics driving NVIDIA are so much more different; marketing, business segments, products, timing - you name it. NVIDIA innovates and delivers (the balance sheet and dividend are a testament to that).</Msg><Username>brokeagain73</Username><Timestamp>1357833124339</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 10:52:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357833189603-37</Id><Topic><Title>retail investors have jaw wide open - volume slam down by those who have control</Title><Username>toddboehmer</Username><Timestamp>1357830067876</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 10:01:07 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>hmmm, ' hurts so good' huh?</Msg><Username>nvda_4_ever</Username><Timestamp>1357833189603</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 10:53:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357833658839-38</Id><Title>Did You see Nvidia's Tegra 4 Reference Tablet</Title><Msg>Was that the Nexus 11?</Msg><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1357833658839</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 11:00:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357836162388-39</Id><Topic><Title>Jen-Hsun Huang interview re Shield (sec 1)</Title><Username>livinlifeveryday</Username><Timestamp>1357821734393</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 07:42:14 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"We should only work on the pieces of technology and the pieces of capability that nobody else is doing."

They just move from product launch to product launch. They are all gamers so they talk the lingo. Nvidia has tons of technical hardware people on their staff. Heck for years they designed and built motherboards and still produce reference designs for discrete GPU cards. Product testing - pick just about anybody at the company...LOL R&amp;D is invested in the Tegra department sure, but that's spent even if there is no consol produced. R&amp;D is invested in Geforce discrete GPUs, but that's spent even if they don't sell the Shield. R&amp;D is invested in software...sure but they are already on the payroll so this will start the revenue stream. P.S. The BOM cost of 32 GB Iphone 5 is $207 according to Isupply. Taking out 4G modem chips and cameras reduces the cost by $52. Foxconn assembles it for $8 so net is $163. The product is targeted solely at gamers. You know the ones that buy the expensive PCs and the latest GPUs. $399 a pop is not that much to them. Any selling outside of this group is gravy, but there will be some of course. Great marketing ploy and a wonderful showcase for the next Tegra chip every year at CES. Can't you see Nvidia setting up a Geforce Grid Server at the March GTC conference in March and handing out these consols for one gigantic LAN party. Same thing at E3 in Boston. No additional expense because they already budget and spend huge amounts of money at these events. 2 million units a year is a reasonable target.

The Samsung Exynos 5 Octa is, as the name suggests, an eight core processor. It is built on a 28nm manufacturing process and employs ARM's big.LITTLE architecture. While Samsung is not ready to share all the detailed under-the-hood details, the Exynos 5 Octa has four Cortex A15 cores clocked at 1.8GHz paired with four Cortex A7 cores clocked at 1.2GHz. With big.LITTLE, the SoC has both high performance, high powr cores and lower power cores. The configuration is invisible to the end user, and the chip will use the Cortex A15 cores when in 3D applications or other CPU load intensive applications. Then, while the phone is idle or simply running background applications (notifications, checking email, updating twitter and facebook feeds, ect), the SoC will power down the Cortex A15 cores and use the lower power-drawing A7 cores. Ideally, this will give users a "best of both worlds" situation and a balance of performance and battery life. Samsung claims that the Exynos 5 Octa offers up to twice the 3D performance of other existing current-generation SoCs. However, we do not yet have details on the GPU improvements (if any) over Samsung's other Exynos 5 chips much less benchmark-able products running this chip yet so it is difficult to say whether that statement is true or not. Also, Samsung claims as much as a 70% improvement in power savings over its dual core Exynos 5 processor, which is certainly a bold claim. According to Engadget, Samsung plans to reveal all the nitty-gritty details on the eight-core Exynos 5 Octa SoC at the International Solid State Circuits Conference on February 19, 2013. It should give NVIDIA's "4+1" core Tegra 4 a run for its money, at lest on the CPU front (and maybe 3D graphics as well, but it's hard to say at this point).</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1357866177472</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 20:02:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357868381478-73</Id><Topic><Title>Why did NVDA struggle all day to close at $12.23</Title><Username>iroc88joe1234</Username><Timestamp>1357863253036</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 19:14:13 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Aren't you the same guy who predicted a close of $12.38.

Granted, by the drop over the last few days, I don't think they view it as a particular success yet either, but the jury is still out. Let's wait and see what pricing and a finished product look like. After all, it's still in development. I think the drop has been the lack of announced Tegra 4 products, which I think will change soon, probably in the lead up to earnings. QCOM is touting Snapdragon, but lets be honest, its only roughly a 70% increase over the previous model, while Tegra 4 is 400% better than Tegra 3. For what it does, Tegra 4 is currently the best of the best. Lack of LTE is another can of worms, and that's definately giving QCOM the lion share of smartpone market share. NVDA definately needs to roll out Grey soon, and implement LTE capability into Tegra 4. I think this year will still be a good year for NVDA, regardless of the success of Shield. Almost every review I've seen likes the product, and thinks there is a place for it in the market, but the fact is we just don't know. Only time will tell.</Msg><Username>jrdelaney1</Username><Timestamp>1357871042338</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 21:24:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357871380955-76</Id><Topic><Title>Pretend land here except for that DOWN hill sloping thing called a weekly chart to the right</Title><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1357863904436</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 19:25:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Were you a former employer who got canned?</Msg><Username>brokeagain73</Username><Timestamp>1357871380955</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 21:29:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357872167529-77</Id><Topic><Title>Why did NVDA struggle all day to close at $12.23</Title><Username>iroc88joe1234</Username><Timestamp>1357863253036</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 19:14:13 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yea - I sure blew that call.

If NVDA closes below 12 its time to bail. There are quite a few Elliott wave guys who are predicting 5th wave and s&amp;p 500 top at 1474. I generally don't believe in that but this time with fiscal deficit and lack of new drivers has me a tad bit concerned. But there is potential for significant upside if Obama can pull something like Clinton and come up with a balanced budget plan - I don't care if it balances in 5 or, 10 years but at least cuts US budget to 20% of GDP. Japan announced another stimulus today, China with new leadership must avoid turmoil, Europe is coming back in its own way. So really there is potential for a significant upside run but we need leadership here in US.</Msg><Username>o.investor</Username><Timestamp>1357873385984</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 22:03:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357877524914-83</Id><Topic><Title>Pretend land here except for that DOWN hill sloping thing called a weekly chart to the right</Title><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1357863904436</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 19:25:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Let's wait and see what pricing and a finished product look like. After all, it's still in development. I think the drop has been the lack of announced Tegra 4 products," Good points. But if you read some of these pumping post here, some are already countiung SHIELD revenue and estimating profit margins for a development project with no price details released and no product currently for sale. They claim they don't know what a SHIELD product will cost to produce, no idea what it will sell for or how many units will sell but this is how many millions Nvidia should rake in every quarter? hmm? Really? "Tegra 4 products" you say? Did Nvidia say Tegra 4 is shipping for revenue now? I've heard some tech companies actually announced new products at CES or new partners at CES and claimed that some of those just announced products were already shipping for revene. A development project and a spec sheet for a new product rakes in what in quarterly revenue? imho</Msg><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1357877524914</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 23:12:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
