The next-generation Nexus 7 tablet could see Nvidia's Tegra 4 System-on-a-Chip (SoC) ousted in favor of Qualcomm's Snapdragon S4 Pro silicon. According to Pacific Crest analyst Michael McConnell, Google is choosing to go with the Snapdragon S4 Pro APQ8064 chip over the Tegra 4 hardware, not only because Qualcomm is willing to offer a better deal but also due to the S4 Pro's tighter integration with 3G and 4G modem technology. This simplifies the supply chain, which means ultimately means lower costs. The S4 Pro is a good choice for the Nexus 4 because it offers integrated cellular technology; something that even the upcoming Tegra 4 SoC—which Nvidia claims is the world's fasted mobile processor—will not. The Tegra 4, previously codenamed "Wayne", was unveiled at CES 2013 and features at its heart 72 custom Nvidia GeForce GPU cores, giving it six-times the graphics processing power of the current Tegra 3. The Tegra 4 also comes with worldwide support for 4G LTE voice and data by utilizing the optional fifth-generation Nvidia Icera i500 chipset. The loss of a place in the Nexus 7 represents a Big Hit for Nvidia. At an average price of $20 to $25 per Tegra processor McConnell estimates that it will mean an "adverse revenue impact of $200 million to $250 million." McConnell claims that the new Nexus 7 is scheduled to begin shipment in the second quarter of 2013. So Master? Maybe Dr. Paul Jacobs could make a PowerPoint slide for the folks at the MWC luncheon. You know, demonstrating how Vertical Integration works. So he has two list of "wins", right? nvidia's short and dwindling list of wins -- and the hundreds of QUALCOMM wins. And with the techno-wizardry of antimated PowerPoint slides, the Nexus 7 "win" is transfered out of nvidia's short list -- and is Vertically Integrated into QUALCOMM's list of wins. Where it becomes, you know, vertically integrated with all the other QUALCOMM wins. Antimated PowerPoint slides -- folks like 'em.</Msg><Username>best.clone185</Username><Timestamp>1360992993642</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-16 00:36:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360996782057-2</Id><Title>Grey</Title><Msg>Is it A9 or is it A15? The original plan was Quad core A9 similar to T3 but in 28nM. Why 28nM? A T3 with built in LTE at 40nM would be too big and too costly 'cos yields would be exponentially lower due to large die size. LTE on it's own is already a pretty big die. So T3 at 28nm would make it about 40% smaller than the 40nM + 28nm LTE built in (40% smaller than a typical QCOM 28nm LTE - published) would probably put the T3 Grey 28nM at about 80mm2 - roughly the same size as the T4 without LTE built in. This is sweet - T3 at 28nm would have better CPU &amp; GPU performance and outperform a dual core S4 LTE by a big margin. A T4 w built in LTE would be pretty large at 100mm2 increasing cost significantly. So not sure if they will ever integrate it into T4 unless there is very significant power savings.</Msg><Username>mark1289b</Username><Timestamp>1360996782057</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-16 01:39:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361020675935-3</Id><Topic><Title>Grey</Title><Username>mark1289b</Username><Timestamp>1360996782057</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-16 01:39:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In all recent communications from NVIDIA, specifically CEO Huang, the Tegra 4/i500 version of Grey was highlighted. This processor is on the front line of development and will be shipped later this year. However, this would not exclude the release of A9 quad-core Grey which was announced about 2 years ago. The "junior" Grey could also be in development and be released to serve the mid-range market.

In the near term, shares are dead money, but the reward for the company - if it can pull off a viable LTE + apps processor combo in 2014 - could be quite good. Until then, Nvidia's share price will still be tied to its GPU fortunes. Additional disclosure: I am short ARMH" "Nvidia has a tremendous amount of valuation support as it now sports over $6/share in cash. This implies that, at the current after-hours levels, the company trades at an EV of ~ $3.8B, or less than 1x sales. While this valuation support is certainly nice, and it is encouraging that the company bought back $100M of shares and is paying a $0.30/yr dividend, this only limits downside rather than helping to create any potential upside from here." "I would advise management of Nvidia to not pursue the buyback aggressively at this time. The shares are likely to go lower, and given that this cash reserve will be necessary in the event that the core business starts to face headwinds, it seems unwise to engage in transactions that ultimately destroy shareholder value. Returning the cash as a dividend would be a slightly better idea, but this comes with the obvious tax implications for taxable accounts." ___________________________________________________________________________ Closing prices before article: Feb. 13th - NVDA - $12.37; S&amp;P 500 - 1520.07; Nasdaq - 3195.88 Closing Prices After Article Feb. 14th - NVDA - $12.73; S&amp;P 500 - 1521.31; Nasdaq - 3198.18 Feb. 15th - NVDA - $12.73; S&amp;P 500 - 1518.38; Nasdaq - 3190.66 So Ashraf thinks Nvidia is dead money above $12 and the Company should not buyback shares.

Conjecture---But the Market is always looking for the next Big Thing and just perhaps Cloud Gaming is the 2013 is the Next Big Story. I'm personally glad Nvidia is buying back shares now! "Sony Corp. 6758.TO -1.87% is planning to offer technology to stream games to its next videogame console, people familiar with the company's plans say, alongside other enhancements to bolster its position in the market. The new technology, to be unveiled Wednesday along with the new console, will allow users to play games delivered over the Internet, these people said. The streaming service, they added, is designed to use current PlayStation 3 titles on the new console; the new device is also expected to play new games stored on optical discs. Sony's plans come after it acquired Gaikai Inc. last year for $380 million. Though many companies now offer simple games over the Internet, Gaikai was one of several companies that offered online access to visually intense games, which ordinarily require specialized circuitry found on high-end personal computers and gaming consoles. The streaming technology is one of the new features and enhancements expected to be offered with the new console, which Sony plans to unveil at an event in New York. Sony's new PlayStation, for example, may control the action with higher fidelity cameras for its "Move" motion-sensing technology and touch-sensing pads on new controllers, according to people who have seen and been briefed on the devices. Microsoft Corp., MSFT -0.11% a longtime Sony rival that is expected to unveil its own next-generation console this year, has shown similar enhancements to that device, upgrades for the cameras and other components in its "Kinect" motion controller to better identify, track and hear gamers as they play, according to people who have been briefed on the company's prototypes. But Sony's streaming technology may become one of the most talked-about parts of the new device. Industry executives often say they expect cloud gaming to become an important segment of the gaming market, noting that it keeps costs low for customers and allows them to easily play intricate games on mobile devices. "Cloud gaming makes games much more convenient," said Jen-Hsun Huang, chief executive of Nvidia Corp., NVDA +0.01% a chip maker that worked with Gaikai before the acquisition and has developed technology to enable such services. "It's instant-on and you can play it about anywhere on any device; it will make for a much larger gaming industry." Building streaming services is technically difficult and costly, however. One competitor, OnLive Inc., was forced to sell itself in an alternative process to bankruptcy last year. The Palo Alto, Calif., company launched in 2010 following nearly a decade of development, but it faced heavy costs running many high-powered servers that can handle videogames, as well as supporting multiple kinds of consumer devices. Streaming also runs against consumer habits in the videogame market. Typically, games are sold to customers on optical discs, which are played using the consoles. How Sony plans to charge for streamed games remains unclear, but customers will presumably not be able to easily share them with friends or resell them to retailers as many people do now. Still, Sony is pushing ahead and has been investing heavily to prepare Gaikai's service, people familiar with the matter say. Microsoft also has experimented with its own version of cloud gaming, people at the company have said, but has in the past questioned the costs associated with building a service large enough to reach all its customers."</Msg><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1361033973410</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-16 11:59:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361036571982-8</Id><Topic><Title>Tracking Nvidia's PPS vs. Ashraf's NVDA Articles</Title><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1361027499566</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-16 10:11:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nothing more fun than watching one SA contributor harassing another. :P Both swing traders at heart, drawing their material from public forums/websites, and "dumb it down" to a dumber readership who take SA seriously. :P</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1361036571982</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-16 12:42:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361037080449-9</Id><Topic><Title>Grey</Title><Username>mark1289b</Username><Timestamp>1360996782057</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-16 01:39:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Just look at Qualcomm.

As far as Sony streaming PS3 games, I would imagine it will be to PS4 consoles only and start when Sony releases PS4. To me it looks like a win for AMD on the console parts and a Big Win for Nvidia on the streaming service which is exclusive to Nvidia hardware and software. There are several services outside of the US that are currently streaming games all using Nvidia Grid with at least a half of dozen in telco trials. G-Cluster that is the biggest in Japan put out a Press Release that they are in the final stages of a rial run with a major US cable service and yes they use Nvidia Grid too. How this all shakes out is anyone's guess but Nvidia's hardware is all the services. It could be huge IMHO.

General consensus was that $299 would be a real consideration but $399 was too high. Also started really looking at IFixit BOM reports on similar devices and found that it could be made for less than $150. Note: Apple's hardware industry leading Gross margins were around 38% in Q4 and the highest they have ever been I believe was 47%. Quantity - Thought 2M was too high for a number of reasons: Selling only in US and Canada at first and tried to think of it as a near top performance Gamer GPU and estimated quantity that way. World wide distribution would of course increase the amounts. Plus there will be some Android gamer buys, but I believe Jensen is marketing it to the Hardcore Gamers at first and Bestbuy and Walmart will not be carrying it. I see it on Newegg, Tigerdirect, and at Gamestop stores only during the first run. Also the Gamer glasses took 3 years to sell a million. The Shield will of course do better than that. Actually in Tracking Ashraf recommend price (dead money above $$12) vs the price of Nvda stock vs. indices. Think of it as if you were looking to put your money with an investment advisor. Certainly you would want to know his record vs. market averages.</Msg><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1361059793759</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-16 19:09:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361060017634-29</Id><Topic><Title>Why Shield has an likely opportunity for high volume shipments</Title><Username>livinlifeveryday</Username><Timestamp>1360945027618</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 11:17:07 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No problem, I am old school.

As to options, it's never my main investment vehicle. I set it up as a potential hedge in the event of catastrophic market crash as most investors with serious investments would do, and I never traded it regularly in the way you implied. Yes, I also bought NVDA LEAPS calls a couple of years out and have converted them into shares at maturity - it's the safest way to leverage investment in a stock that I have high confidence in. I do this with NVDA and DIS. As a well-rounded investor, I need to be (and am) well versed in all aspects of the stock markets. Stock prices are heavily impacted by options configurations, not just during the expiry periods. I pride myself in knowledge of options, having read several iconic books on this subject. It is a PLUS to any serious investor, big or small. And you? Other than swinging with NVDA with an accumulated loss, I understand you also dabbled in penny oil stocks such as Kodiak (who ever heard of it?) I wish you the best of luck! PS: If you want to know more about my Yahoo posting records, go back to Qualcomm, Broadcom, Cisco, Corning boards. These are stocks I once owned for years and in a substantial way. Some old timers on those board prolly still remember my moniker. And my other current holdings such as GOOG and VZ, I don't post much there as things are cut and dry in those stocks....not much research is required. And yeah, call me an option trader - funny thing is that option traders mostly trade on TA and instincts; they would never spend more than 30 min a day on fundamentals. Hardly my type if you have any logic in your judgement. Some bashers even called me a hired pumper...HaHaHa - for their information, I tipped my doormen (each) at Christmas time more than these punks made in a week.

There are probably improvements around memory, maybe the GPU -- but I think they'll be 4+1 with A9s rather than A15s, which was one of the main headline features of T4. If they say quadcore A9s at 28nm is also part of the Tegra 4 family, that's what they are, since it's up to them how they brand it, and as I said earlier that's probably more sensible since it doesn't sound like they're selling last year's chip (which they won't be). I called it T3 since that's what Fudzilla called it... but Fuad was pretty specific about the A9 piece.</Msg><Username>joshpritchard</Username><Timestamp>1361072577623</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-16 22:42:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361073054302-51</Id><Topic><Title>Tracking Nvidia's PPS vs. Ashraf's NVDA Articles</Title><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1361027499566</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-16 10:11:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ibexx, You have to understand the context. When you say you are long but sell calls,,,you are effectively betting on the price dropping,,,i.e.short. Like I said I do not care what you do. But in the lager context of things I wish you would post when you sold calls so people reading this oard would be able to put your comment in context. Best of luck to you Sincerely.P.S. I'm holding with $14 for Nvidia on May 1st. What say you are you still declining to participate. If so so be it it.

Absolutely Huge. The Mobile World Congress is a truly International gathering of engineering types. Including the camera-wearing Japanese engineers and their camera-wearing wives and kids, right? It sure is. And what's THE #1 Most Powerful Marketing Image in Japan? Hummm? It earns Five Billion Dollars a year -- far exceeding all of nvidia's revenues -- just for licensing a generic branding image. Give up? It's Hello Kitty. Yep. Take a look at the key to selling Anything in Japan. Google this : Hello Kitty - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia So the idea is this. After the Nexus 7 has become vertically integrated into QUALCOMM's list of wins -- Hello Kitty appears on the screen winking cutely and waving to the audience. Cutely promoting the Nexus 7. It's a killer idea, Best. An it'll sell like hotcakes. Yes boys, hotcakes.</Msg><Username>jeepers.best</Username><Timestamp>1361075847689</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-16 23:37:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361075896528-55</Id><Title>Yahoo just "flagged" me</Title><Msg>on J7777's posts that contained calling people out, slapping false identifies etc. I immediately responded with "report abuse" LOL, What a nice new feature!
