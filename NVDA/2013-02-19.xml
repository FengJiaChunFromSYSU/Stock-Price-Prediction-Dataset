Previously codenamed "Project Grey," the Tegra 4i processor features 60 custom NVIDIA(NVDA) GPU cores; a quad-core CPU based on ARM's newest and most efficient core -- the R4 Cortex-A9 CPU -- plus a fifth battery saver core; and a version of the NVIDIA(NVDA) i500 LTE modem optimized for integration. The result: an extremely power efficient, compact, high-performance mobile processor that enables smartphone performance and capability previously available only in expensive super phones. "NVIDIA(NVDA) is delivering for the first time a single, integrated processor that powers all the major functions of a smartphone," said Phil Carmack, senior vice president of the Mobile business at NVIDIA(NVDA). "Tegra 4i phones will provide amazing computing power, world-class phone capabilities, and exceptionally long battery life." Tegra 4i's new 2.3 GHz CPU was jointly designed by NVIDIA(NVDA) and ARM, and is the most efficient, highest performance CPU core on the market. "Tegra 4i is the very latest SoC solution based on the ARM Cortex-A9 processor and demonstrates the ability of ARM and our partners to continue to push the performance of technology and create exciting user experiences," says Tom Cronk, executive vice president and general manager, processor division, ARM. "ARM and NVIDIA(NVDA) worked closely to further optimize the Cortex-A9 processor to drive performance and efficiency in areas such as streaming and responsiveness. This is an example of the collaboration and innovation that enables ARM technology-based solutions to be market drivers through multiple generations of SoC solutions." Utilizing the same architecture as Tegra 4's GPU, Tegra 4i features five times the number of GPU cores of Tegra 3 for high-quality, console-quality gaming experiences and full 1080p HD displays. It also integrates an optimized version of the NVIDIA(NVDA) i500 software-defined radio modem which provides LTE capabilities, and makes networking upgradability and scalability fast and easy. ''NVIDIA's(NVDA) Tegra 4i appears to outperform the leading integrated LTE chip significantly, and also benefits from an integrated 'soft-modem' that can be re-programmed over-the-air to support new frequencies and air interfaces -- something other modem vendors can only dream of," said Stuart Robinson, director, Handset Component Technologies Program at Strategy Analytics." Tegra 4i mobile processor's camera capabilities include the NVIDIA Chimera™ Computational Photography Architecture recently announced in Tegra 4. This delivers many advanced features, including the world's first always-on high dynamic range (HDR) capabilities, first tap to track functionality and first panoramic photos with HDR. NVIDIA (NVDA) also introduced its reference smartphone platform code-named "Phoenix" for the Tegra 4i processor to demonstrate its unique mobile technologies. Phoenix is a blueprint that phone makers can reference in designing and building future Tegra 4i smartphones to help get them to market quicker. The Tegra 4i mobile processor will be demonstrated in the NVIDIA(NVDA) booth in Hall 7, Stand #C110, at the 2013 Mobile World Congress show in Barcelona, Spain, on Feb. 25-28.</Msg><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1361284077633</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 09:27:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361284130764-8</Id><Title>Phoenix reference design using T4i</Title><Msg>anandtechDOTcom/show/6753/nvidia-announces-tegra-4i-formerly-project-grey-with-integrated-lte text The other big announcement is a reference design built around Tegra 4i called Phoenix. It's a smartphone with Tegra 4i inside, 5-inch 1080p display, LTE, and just 8 mm of thickness. What's more impressive is that NVIDIA claims the reference design can be picked up by an OEM and ship with an unsubsidized price tag of between $100-$300 USD. With Phoenix NVIDIA now joins the likes of Qualcomm and Intel, both of whom already have active smartphone reference design programs.</Msg><Username>livinlifeveryday</Username><Timestamp>1361284130764</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 09:28:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361284369539-9</Id><Topic><Title>Phoenix reference design using T4i</Title><Username>livinlifeveryday</Username><Timestamp>1361284130764</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 09:28:50 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And this today from Tom's Hardware tomshardwareDOTcom/news/Tegra-Super-Phone-Project-Grey-i500-LTE-GeForce,21124.html</Msg><Username>livinlifeveryday</Username><Timestamp>1361284369539</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 09:32:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361284496312-10</Id><Topic><Title>NVDA is bad.

Nvidia's Geforce GTX Titan was perhaps one of the poorest kept GPU secrets in recent times, not least because the GPU it is based on, the GK110, made its public debut last year in the Titan high performance computing cluster and helped it take the top spot in the prestigious Top 500 list. Now Nvidia has taken the same GPU, made some minor tweaks and slapped a £827 price tag on it. Nvidia's Geforce GTX Titan is essentially a consumer version of the firm's Tesla K20X accelerator board with the same 2,699 core count and, unlike other Geforce branded boards that artificially have their double precision floating point performance limited, the Geforce Titan has the same 1.3 TFLOPS found on its Tesla branded cousin. The firm cites single precision floating point performance of 4.5 TFLOPS, which is actually 13 percent higher than that of the Tesla K20X and on a par with the Tesla K10 that focuses on single precision floating point performance. Nvidia said that the Geforce GTX Titan's base clock speed would be 836MHz with a boost up to 876MHz, though it stressed that board partners would set their own boost clock limits. Nvidia also touted an updated version of GPU boost that can over-volt the GPU in order to achieve higher overclocks with active GPU temperature monitoring that wasn't present on the Geforce GTX 680, but stressed that the upper limit would be decided by board partners as it might affect the long term life of the GPU. Nvidia has stuck 6GB of 364-bit GDDR5 memory on the Geforce GTX Titan, clocking it at an effective 6GHz resulting in a bandwidth of 288.4GB/s. While Nvidia has borrowed the GPU from its Tesla K20X for the Geforce GTX Titan, the firm opted for a modified Geforce GTX 690 cooler. The firm's decision to use a hefty cooler is not in small part due to the 250W TDP of the card, though Nvidia said that users can set the GPU temperature limit through the drivers. With Nvidia putting a £827 price tag on the card it is pretty obvious that for the vast majority of gamers the Geforce GTX Titan is not a viable option, let alone the fact that the card can be set up in triple-SLI, but that didn't lead the firm to claim that there will be a limited supply of these graphics cards. Instead Nvidia cited its ability to ship thousands of GK110 GPUs for the Titan HPC cluster as evidence of its ability to produce Geforce GTX Titan boards on demand. Nvidia might claim the Geforce GTX Titan is a gamer's dream, but in reality hard core CUDA and OpenCL programmers will find this board particularly interesting, even if it lacks the software validation of the firm's Quadro and Tesla boards. Benchmarks on Nvidia's latest range topper are due to be published later this week, but it seems likely that the Geforce GTX Titan will firmly hand the single GPU speed crown back to Nvidia.</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1361287925357</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 10:32:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361288044018-25</Id><Topic><Title>New to Nvidia..

Just an opinion, but if this chip catches on Qualcomm's margins are going to be impacted big time. The Chinese hate paying Qcom royalties hence they made their own LTE system just so they wouldn't have to pay Qcom. They are going to love this. Sure Verizon and Sprint are out right now but they both have a goal being 100% voice over LTE by 2014. In the meantime AT&amp;T and T mobilewill be all over this. A very good smartphone they don't have pay huge subsidies for.

I think the ~3% figure is about right for most OEMs, but it could/should mean more like savings of $6+ on budget phones (with ASPs around $200) and towards $15-$18 on higher end smartphone (if Tegra 4i makes it into any) for the OEMs. It's not clear to me that Nvidia sees that gross margin delta, or if it's the device OEMs, and if then the true effect is just to make Nvidia's Tegra 4i able to complete on price. (hard to sell a $10-15 modem piece if it also tacks on adds a similar amount in royalty fees to QCOM for the OEMs). Still any wins Tegra 4i steals away steals away from QCOM/CDMA would add to NVDA's sales and take away from QCOMs royalties.</Msg><Username>joshpritchard</Username><Timestamp>1361292604353</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 11:50:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361292761888-35</Id><Topic><Title>NVDA is bad.

"ARM and NVIDIA worked closely to further optimize the Cortex-A9 processor to drive performance and efficiency in areas such as streaming and responsiveness.

This blows away Nvidia theory that smartphone sales have been limited because of lack of integrated LTE. However, this also raises the question about the future of managing SKU/BOM and global platforms. If Nvidia can deliver a competitive soft-modem that can be programmed for various flavors of LTE - they will have a major differentiator and will be years ahead of competition. The real question is - can soft-modem actually outperform an ASIC solution? At this point that is a Billion $ question and I am not convinced that it can be better than a well crafted ASIC solution. A soft-modem may be a good to above-average solution that greatly benefits OEM's in managing inventory and global platforming.</Msg><Username>o.investor</Username><Timestamp>1361296735231</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 12:58:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361296900401-51</Id><Topic><Title>what's wrong wth phoenix</Title><Username>fdigiovanni01</Username><Timestamp>1361293486420</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 12:04:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>so you want others to do all your legwork...

Today's volume is anemic compared to Thursday and Friday, and even though we're at the lows of the day, they're still higher than Friday's lows, AND, the Positive Money Flow is increasing as we drop. In fact, as of a few minutes ago, it is a positive 5.66mm dollars, meaning almost 1/2mm shares have been bought "net" on upticks, so far today. Given how small the volume is, that's a pretty large number. I won't be surprised if we see another reversal, late today, but even if it doesn't happen, I think we'll continue to fight to regain the 200DMA, which usually takes several attempts. Once we get through there, it will be confirmed if we get several days of closes above it. Patience is the operative word, here. NVDA will head MUCH higher in the not so distant future.

The T4i coming by end of year won't actually be too much later (if at all) than the competitive quadcore Krait SOCs from QCOM that actually have LTE integrated in the SOC (not even the SOC rumored to have taken NVDA's spot in the anticipated-but-not-confirmed Nexus 7 refresh has the modem integrated into the chip, it's a separate part). So if they ship it by end of this calendar year, it should still be quite competitive. other international players like mediatek, huawei, and renesas are struggling with lower specced/slower SOCs that are based on even older ARM designs, and apparently ARM is working directly with NVDA to get the T4i out and make sure it's competitive. overall, just my opinion, but the timing sounds fine to me, and it's pretty close to what the roadmap leaked way back in 2011 said (unlike the Wayne, which slipped). i just hope they can deliver.... but longs should take heart in the fact that the market isn't giving them any credit and seems to be pricing in more delays already--so delivering should mean upside.</Msg><Username>joshpritchard</Username><Timestamp>1361305845629</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 15:30:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361305991971-72</Id><Topic><Title>This BS announcement of Grey, won't be available until next year?</Title><Username>will_amd_yu</Username><Timestamp>1361303888273</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 14:58:08 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>i forgot to mention amd but they're not even contenders so NVDA seems to be positioning themselves pretty darn well. any competition that i've missed?</Msg><Username>joshpritchard</Username><Timestamp>1361305991971</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 15:33:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361306364767-73</Id><Title>Tom's Hardware Has the Best Article - Check out how small Tegra 4is</Title><Msg>against Tegra 4 and Krait 800.

The HP ProLiant WS460c Gen8 blade server uses graphics processors to deliver virtual desktops, but adds a layer of virtualization on top of the GPUs to expand the number of virtual clients deployed from servers to client devices, said John Gromala, director of product marketing for Industry Standard Servers and Software at HP. Virtual desktops are typically delivered to remote devices so that they can access centralized data and applications residing on the servers. An increasing number of mobile devices like smartphones and tablets are being used for work, and there is more desire for workers to access enterprise data and applications beyond calendars, Gromala said. Deploying more virtual desktops helps reduce the cost per virtual client by 60 percent while boosting work efficiency, Gromala said. The company is working with Nvidia in order to deliver more virtual clients, but did not talk about the technology being deployed. The HP blade will harness the parallel processing capabilities of graphics processors, which will help enable the delivery of high-definition images to virtual clients. The GPUs will also be able to remotely execute specific multimedia and engineering applications faster than CPUs, which are typically more adept for everyday tasks and running single-threaded applications. The server is able to carry up to eight graphics processors, a greater number than its predecessor, the ProLiant WS460c G6. Each blade system can support multiple users using either Citrix or VMware GPU pass-through technology, for which Nvidia collaborated with Citrix and VMware to integrate into hypervisors. The blade supports Intel Xeon E5-2600 CPUs and Nvidia Quadro 3000M, 1000M, 500M as well as the Quadro 6000, 5000 graphics processors. Nvidia has also been working on a virtualization technology called VGX, in which the GPUs are virtualized so tasks can be shared across multiple GPUs and CPU computing threads. With VGX technology, graphics cards can bypass CPUs and deploy virtual desktops directly. Nvidia has built memory-management capabilities into GPUs for direct deployment of virtual machines. The virtualization technology is supported on the Grid K1 and Grid K2 boards, and could come to Quadro chips in the future. HP has also announced the new BladeSystem c7000 Platinum chassis, which delivers 40 percent more bandwidth than its predecessor, released in 2006. The chassis will host HP's C-class blades. The chassis uses a slew of new networking and fabric technologies to deliver the improved bandwidth. The larger pipe shuttles data faster and also helps balance workloads more effectively in data centers to ensure servers aren't overloaded, Gromala said. The new chassis also provides for more storage bandwidth compared to its predecessor. The enclosure also provides 3-D imaging capabilities of racks in a data center, Gromala said. The HP Systems Insight Manager server management software will be able to identify the location of a rack, which helps control various operations. It tracks IT assets and effectively manage and maintain systems, and saves hours of manual tagging of servers. It also helps improve power management and capping of servers in a data center. "We can even track down the power topology," Gromala said. The HP ProLiant WS460c Gen 8 blade is priced starting at US$5,037, while HP BladeSystem c7000 Platinum enclosure will be priced starting at $4,999. Both products will be available worldwide next month.</Msg><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1361309358750</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 16:29:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361309587916-87</Id><Title>Toms HW.

Agawi’s own executive chairman Peter Relan unveiled this system today in what the company says is the first industry-wide solution for the terribly fragmented cloud ecosystem we’re working with today. Today’s announcement has NVIDIA backing Agawi True Cloud with no less than their own NVIDIA GRID processor system. Also joining in on the fun are PEER 1, Blue Box, and XO Communications, all joining together to bring developers an opportunity to “build games ONCE and offer any game, anywhere, instantly.” Quite the miraculous feat they’re attempting here as NVIDIA’s Project SHIELD nears reality as well. One of the most important points of this announcement is the fact that True Cloud architecture will, as Agawi promises, “eliminate heavy data storage and costs” for cloud gaming. With True Cloud, game publishers will be able to stream their games “from social to mid-core to AAA” in a much more affordable environment than any solution available before." _______________________________________________________________________________ Wonder if this Cloud Gaming thing has legs?

When I first saw it, I was shocked and wondered why no one was pointing out that the company spent almost double the cash on splitting 500 patents with IV as they did purchasing Icera -- but it appears there was an error in CapIQ's data that's sense been fixed. It still shows the same issuance in May of last year, but no longer associates it with the IP Wireless deal. Has anyone found more info on what Nvidia spent on this deal? i've wondered what would happen if NVDA and QCOM went to battle over IP. QCOM with their CDMA/4G/LTE patents and NVDA with their graphics IP.

I assume they were about something on software defined radios then but perhaps they have some of those LTE essential patents other than the single on Icera owns.

The quad-core Tegra 4i will be used by device makers in LTE-capable smartphones and tablets that could arrive by the end of this year. Nvidia did not announce any customers, but will show off a Tegra 4i smartphone prototype with a 5-inch, 1080p high-definition screen and LTE at the upcoming Mobile World Congress show to be held in Barcelona next week. Nvidia is not necessarily aiming Tegra 4i at very low-end smartphones under $100, said Philip Carmack, senior vice president of its mobile business unit. The quad-core chip has fast processing capabilities and can play full high-definition video, so it is targeted at value smartphones priced under $200. The low-cost smartphone market is growing fast, especially in developing regions like Asia-Pacific, South America and Africa, where unlocked smartphones with basic multimedia are in some cases available for under $100. "We've built a really compact quad-core processor," Carmack said. "It's a triumph of efficiency." Tablets with 7-inch screens are the sweet spot for Tegra 4i, Carmack said. Nvidia has provided a tablet reference platform called Kai for companies to build devices under $200, and 4i can provide consumers with more bang for the buck with integrated LTE, Carmack said. The Tegra 4i chip is based on a modified ARM Cortex-A9 processor and runs at a clock frequency of 2.3GHz, and has a fifth core to handle low-power tasks like phone calls. The chip has an integrated software-defined modem, and can support multiple 3G and LTE technologies. The chip will support wireless connectivity standards in a majority of countries, including China. The Cortex-A9 processor design is also used in Nvidia's old Tegra 3 chip, which is in many tablets and smartphones. But the 4i chip is an architectural improvement over Tegra 3, with a smaller, more power efficient and faster version of Cortex-A9. "It has a brand new CPU architecture that we co-developed with ARM," Carmack said. "It's not a simple rev of A9, but a pretty heavy improvement."</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1361335800185</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 23:50:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361336182727-135</Id><Topic><Title>NVIDIA targets low coast superphones, tablets with Tegra4i chip (1)</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1361335800185</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 23:50:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Part 2: Last month, Nvidia announced the Tegra 4 chip for tablets and high-end smartphones, which the company claimed was the world's fastest mobile processor. Tegra 4 is based on ARM's Cortex-A15 design, and is being used in Nvidia's Project Shield, a handheld gaming console which was also announced last month and is scheduled to ship in the second half. Nvidia is primarily known as a graphics company, and the 4i chip enables booming multimedia, Carmack said. \Users will be able to play high-definition Android video games on handsets. There are 60 graphics cores in Tegra 4i, while Tegra 3 had only 12 such cores. The Tegra 4 chip has 72 graphics cores. The 4i chip is more than half the size of Tegra 4, which could lead to thinner and power-efficient smartphones, Carmack said, adding that the board size for 4i is much smaller than competitive offerings from companies like Qualcomm. "Nobody can build a smaller quad-core LTE smartphone," Carmack said. The new chip adds many more hours of video playback to a smartphone or tablet compared to its predecessors, Carmack said. The battery life of a tablet or smartphone is determined by the amount of power drawn by the screen, battery capacity and other components. Nvidia has also made some improvements so the 4i chip package can make components like screens more power-efficient without sacrificing display quality. One of the biggest advancements in 4i is the integrated modem, while Nvidia's earlier chips had to be attached to a separate modem, said Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research. "I didn't expect to see the integrated baseband this quickly," McGregor said. "This puts them in the realm of selected companies with integrated modems." For example, Qualcomm offers Snapdragon S4 chips with integrated modems. Integrating components makes chips faster and more power efficient. A challenge for Nvidia could be finding buyers for the Tegra 4 chips, McGregor said. The number of third-pary chip buyers has shrunk as companies like Apple, Samsung, Huawei use internally designed chips in their devices. Up to 60 percent of the mobile chips used in devices are homegrown, McGregor said. But the new Tegra 4i chip is impressive and Qualcomm's lead in the chip category could be challenged by Nvidia.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1361336182727</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 23:56:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
