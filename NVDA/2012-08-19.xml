"While the Nexus 7 experienced a huge initial surge in both sales and Web traffic, users don’t seem to be surfing as much as one might expect them to.” As the novelty of the device wears off and as the honeymoon phase comes to an end, people simply don’t use it as much as they used to." She's stalling, boys. The use of the Nexus 7 tablet. An epic stall. Maybe the screen kept falling out? And the Nexus 7 owners just said "to heck with it". Throwing it into the kitchen gizmo drawer.
