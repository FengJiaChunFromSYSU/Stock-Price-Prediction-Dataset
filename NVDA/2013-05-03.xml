I get that's a tough concept to grasp for some, but Intel has too much capacity and not enough demand. Whether apple, memory, or some other SoC, in the near term Intel will become suppliers of merchant semiconductor fabricating. This trend will only continue if Intel wants to keep their largest asset, their manufacturing leadership.</Msg><Username>norcalnative_2</Username><Timestamp>1367559438964</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 01:37:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367562321741-4</Id><Title>Microsoft Surface and nvidia</Title><Msg>There is a msft event in June and they may launch another surface tablet using same components.

But you might follow through on that bet you made with 'Max' for the nickel or at least respond regarding ARMH. Just saying since that is an open bet left unaddressed. I'm realizing my time is being wasted mostly on all the blogs and boards, including here and SA so I'm not on here much accept to maybe give a thumbs up or down once in a while if an article or comment is worth a response at all. I need to get my architectural practice moving forward with the momentum building there in any case. I'm being perceived as a control freak here which is very ironic considering the posters making that judgement. I'm taking a cue from that brief but intensive period of posts by Josh Pritchard (sp?) who was making a lot of informed posts and said he was making investment decisions with Nvidia and would move on once he made his buys and not bother with these boards. Should have taken that cue . . it's not worth the time on here once you have made a commitment and are willing to hold a position to see the roadmap carried out. Best of luck to you and all the investors in Nvidia on this board and beyond.

AMD was last trading up 10% to $3.75. Bernstein Research analyst Stacy Rasgon said it appears to be based on speculation that the chipmaker, which has been hurt by a collapsing personal comptuter market, may get a significant upside from its growing presence in the game console business. Rasgon cited Sony's announcement that it will be using AMD chips for the next PlayStation. He said there is also speculation that Microsoft Corp.'s MSFT +0.66% upcoming version of the Xbox will also include an AMD processor. "Right now, it's someone make a bet on the console opportunity," Rasgon told MarketWatch. AMD shares have jumped more than 55% year-to-date."

They found themselves on the wrong side of history as the discrete market shrank and as they were denied the x86 chipset market a few years ago. They are now aiming at ARM mobile devices, which is both their best shot and probably their only opportunity. This might be both their last and best chance. Time will tell.

Its all BS unless AMD was not UP 35% this week." You are new to this, aren't you? You say that AMD is alive and well today and has added 35% this week. Okay. Were you investing 8 or so years ago when they ran up to nearly $40? There have not been any splits since then, so they are something like 90% down from that point. Where you investing this time last year, when they were *double* current levels? So quickly you forget. Cash flow show they have been hundreds of millions in the red the last few quarters. Alive? Yes. Well? No. You know that they didn't just sell their corporate campus to take advantage of the strong real estate market, right? You note HSA and ATI are new factors for AMD. Okay. How much money have they lost since buying ATI? Any idea? HSA is fine, but you really think that a group that involves so many of their competitors is going to be their key to riches? How is that going to work, exactly? Will it serve QCOM and TXN to watch that happen? So, they join a "we want to beat Intel" club. Great. Doesn't mean it will happen and even if it does, it doesn't mean they will make any money from that. I have to ask, though, did you really mean to include MSFT as a member of HSA? That being said, AMD has been priced for BK recently. I think they can keep going at least another year and they might even succeed.</Msg><Username>panacro</Username><Timestamp>1367614775546</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 16:59:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367618704057-73</Id><Title>Is Qualcomm QCOM trapped in a trading range? - from the options perspective</Title><Msg>SOURCE: Schaeffersresearch schaeffersresearchDOTcom/marketcenters/optionscenter/content/is+qualcomm+inc+qcom+trapped+in+a+trading+range/default.aspx?ID=115903 ""QUALCOMM, Inc. has spent 2013 going nowhere fast; its year-to-date gain stands at 1.7%, following yesterday's 1.6% increase to $62.89. One options strategist expects this inertia to continue for the next several months, and expressed this outlook via a short strangle play on Thursday. Overall option volume was robust on QCOM during yesterday's session; 62,000 calls traded versus 27,000 puts, respectively representing mark-ups of 83% and 55% over what's typically seen. Two of the most active strikes were the October 70 call and the October 55 put, both of which saw large, symmetrical blocks change hands shortly after noon. Cutting to the chase, 9,600 calls were sold for $1.05 per contract, while 9,600 of the puts were sold for an average of $1.23 each. A floor source verified this was indeed a short strangle, scooped up for a credit of roughly $2.28 per pair of contracts. The strangle seller is assuming QCOM will continue to trade between the strike prices through Oct. 18, when the options expire. If the stock is trading anywhere from $55 to $70 at this point, the trader keeps the entire premium collected as profit.""</Msg><Username>tomasmann</Username><Timestamp>1367618704057</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 18:05:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367619171762-74</Id><Topic><Title>AMD gives us hUMA while Nvidia gives us a SHIELD Pocket Toy.

Stocks and companies are not the same. If AMD fails to deliver ACTUAL results and improved financials they will fold which is why the stock is down where it is. The stock price shows how much risk is involved in their "turn around story." Consoles are inevitably going to fail hard. The Nintendo sales have already hinted at it.</Msg><Username>manski14</Username><Timestamp>1367630961676</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 21:29:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367631877597-76</Id><Topic><Title>kvimax1 - you win</Title><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1367596840373</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 12:00:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ashraf- Thanks. I hope you know that ALL I was trying to do by goading you into this bet was to try to share my own experience and help you understand that you can NEVER SAY "NEVER" in the stock market. NEVER, EVER. I'd hoped you would take whatever loss you had on your short when the stock dipped briefly below 40, and then wait for a higher price to try again. MOST shorts who have a "reasonable argument" lose on their shorts. The cost of holding a losing short position are tremendous and tie up too much money. And, the real issue is regardless of whether your stance has merit, or not, the market doesn't care...when it doesn't care. In the long run, you MIGHT be right, but shorting via puts (if indeed you are short the actual stock) is a MUCH better strategy, since your risk is "defined", instead of limitless. The same rules apply for long call positions. I've lost many times by simply being "too early", in NVDA, and in many other places. For instance, I had a pretty large call position in the April 3 calls in AMD (expecting JUST the kind of move we saw THIS week, based on short squeeze AND my firm belief that the company will be bought out by QCOM...I don't believe it will be INTC, but what do I know)....JUST missed, by less than 2 weeks...and because the company is possibly the WORST Company in the WORLD, I didn't spread my position out over various expirations and strikes. A few times, I've missed by 1 trading day; the stock closing under the strike on a Friday, only to see the stock soar the following Monday. When I tried to suggest to JXXXX7 that he cover his short calls for anything from May on out at the 13, 14 and 15 strikes, I was building my position in those very calls in May, June, Sept and Jan '14. The amount of stock that is STILL short at the 13-15 strikes for just May and June is over 6mm shares. While the volume has strangely dried up for this week, I'm still heartened by the inability of the Bears to break the stock. Email me at yahoo..

I wish I'd been less greedy and just covered it all, but c'est la vie. Anyway, I don't think QCOM buys AMD - there's just not a lot that QCOM gets out of it. Maybe the graphics IP is worth something if QCOM wants to go into high end PC graphics, but Adreno is quite good as it is. That being said, I too hold quite a bit of AMD, but mainly for a 2H cash flow positive story...although regretfully, it is a much smaller position than my NVDA, INTC, IBM, and QCOM, but the aforementioned names are much more attractive from a risk standpoint. Anyway, like I said, always appreciate your posts. I'll shoot you an e-mail on Yahoo...it's just your handle here @ yahoo, right?

I've had an in-depth discussion with Tiernan Ray, of "Barron's" about this, and he agrees with me that there is NO fundamental reason for AMD to have had the kind of volume it had this week (other than a HUGE short squeeze) AND at one point, today, a more than 40%!!!! move in ONE WEEK, OTHER than a takeover. I think it's QCOM, although rumors have it as INTC (Which I HIGHLY doubt, since other than the hatred between INTC and NVDA, or AMD and NVDA, the hatred between INTC and AMD is SO much BIGGER). Without buying AMD, QCOM has NO, I repeat NO CHANCE to compete with NVDA in the long run in the mobile graphics arena. And, AMD has NO chance of survival without being bought by deeper pockets. They're burning through their cash WAY too fast, and there is NO killer "product" in the pipeline and their R&amp;D budget has to have been cut dramatically. I'm glad you didn't lose your shirt on your ARMH short; and as you said on your blog post, there is an entire quarter until a potentially negative earnings forecast or guidance forecast can provide a negative catalyst (So just stand aside), without a major "C" in The Market...which I doubt is coming until the market is MUCH higher...like 1650-1700+....I'll bet you ANOTHER nickel, CASH, that the market sees 1700 sometime this year...and maybe 1750 at some point. S&amp;P 2000 is likely by 2015, if not before....IMHO. Good luck with your blogs. That's not my thing.
