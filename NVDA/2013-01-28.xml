Posted: 28 Jan 2013, 00:51, by Alan F. NVIDIA really hasn't had much luck cracking the processor market that is controlled by Qualcomm and its Snapdragon chips. According to Eldar Murtazin, the company will take matters into its own hand by producing its own smartphones and tablets, but the final product may or may not have the NVIDIA and Tegra name on it. According to the plan, NVIDIA will build reference design models and have them cheaply produced by a contact manufacturer as white label devices, and sold to regional brands that had been selling low quality Chinese tablets. Potential buyers could include Fly and Wexler in Russia, or Micromax and Lava in India. Building the devices themselves allows NVIDIA to control the features that will be on the slate while still making a high quality device that will sell for a low price. The first devices to be rolled out are expected to be 7 inch to 10 inch tablets that will come out in the May to June time period. Some models will have a regional brand on it while others will have the NVIDIA or Tegra name on it. The naming decisions come from the local companies. We should warn you to take this story with the proverbial grain of salt. If you're out of salt, some rice will do nicely. source: Mobile-Review (translated) via UnwiredView Perhaps Jen missed Charlie Rose's interview of Dr. Paul Jacobs, the Chairman and CEO of Qualcomm? Where Charlie asked Dr. Paul Jacobs, "Why don't you build your own smartphone?" And Dr. Paul Jacob's response was what? Hummm? "I worry about Dissuading our customers from working with us." "Our partners do it [build mobile devices] better than us." "We create the technology better and create the chips better." "So let's focus on what we're good at, and let the customers focus on what they're good at." Google a Priceless Education boys : Qualcomm CEO Jacobs on Mobile Technology: Video - Bloomberg The best part starts about 15:15 into the Bloomberg video Oh, and somebody tell Jen to watch it too. Five minutes of that video could save Jen's shareholders BILLIONS in future losses.

MediaTek is UP +3% on news of World's First 5-in-1 Satellite Receiver chip.</Title><Msg>MediaTek Announces World's 1st 5-in-1 Multi-GNSS Receiver SoC Solutions Supporting Beidou Satellite Navigation System Press Release: MediaTek Inc. – 9 hours ago HSINCHU, Taiwan, Jan. 28, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- MediaTek Inc., a leading fabless semiconductor company for wireless communications and digital multimedia solutions, today announced the availability of its MT3332/MT3333, the world's first 5-in-1 multi-GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) receiver SoC solutions that support the Beidou Satellite Navigation System. The Beidou system has been commercially operational since the end of 2012, and is currently a constellation of 16 satellites providing positioning, navigation and timing services to the Asia-Pacific region. It can identify a user's location to 10m (33ft), their velocity to within 0.2 meters per second, and clock synchronization signals (one-way) to within 10 nanoseconds. Beidou will be one of the most important satellite navigation systems to eventually cover the entire globe by 2020. The MediaTek MT3332/MT3333 can discover GPS, Beidou, GLONASS, Galileo and QZSS constellations. Featuring a multi-GNSS receiver design, the MT3332/MT3333 can reduce the cumulative distance and positioning error accumulated over time/multiple hops, and significantly improve navigation/positioning accuracy. The MT3332/MT3333 also come with excellent signal acquisition and tracking sensitivity, which efficiently enhances signal quality within dense cities, tunnels and/or multi-storey car-parks, while delivering a better user experience. Moreover, thanks to its highly integrated, low-cost and ultra-compact system architecture, the MT3332/MT3333 enable multi-GNSS receivers with the same reference board for mobile, industrial and automotive navigation applications. "The proliferation of LBS (location-based services) using mobile applications over wireless networks such as 'social check-in' or 'nearby service recommending' is driving demand for greater satellite navigation performance and coverage beyond existing technologies. This will also lead to the rapid adoption of multi-GNSS receiver solutions in smartphones, tablets and automotive vehicles because LBS is now an indispensable way for people to interact/communicate with each other on a daily basis," said SR Tsai, General Manager of the Wireless Connectivity and Networking Business Unit at MediaTek. "We believe the market for Beidou-compatible multi-GNSS receivers in China will accelerate in the coming years. MediaTek will deliver new products that offer high value and are capable of meeting the evolving needs of our customers in the Beidou navigation system market through continuous product innovation. The MT3332/MT3333 are designed to accelerate the realization of satellite navigation services anytime, anywhere, in a seamless fashion." The MT3332/MT3333 also incorporate MediaTek's unique "AlwaysLocate™" technology that can identify the state in which the user is (regardless of on-the-go or sleeping) and automatically adjust the satellite signal receiving modes for more accurate and reliable navigation services, and to save the battery power of the navigation system. The MediaTek MT3332/MT3333 are currently in mass production stage and already being designed into major satellite navigation systems and mobile communication platforms worldwide. About MediaTek Inc.

It's one thing to sell 3D glasses or a gaming device to enthusiasts to open new markets and revenue streams. It's another to sell generic devices to the broad masses. The article points out that NVDA is providing reference design kits to white box guys. This model is exactly the same as what they've been doing with many products, from motherboards (when they were in the chipset business) to GPUs reference designs. They also sell multi-chip modules to the automotive and pachinko industries, and certain fully assembled high end graphics cards to partners to resell untouched. It's about controlling quality and the user experience. There is also a giant philosophical debate that gets raised about competing with your customers.

And this week MediaTek came out with that cool World's First 5-in-1 satellite communication chip. While nvidia/icera still dwaddles around trying to talk with cellphone towers.

The idea is that by doing that, NVIDIA gets complete control over hardware performance, while also undercutting the competition on price and hopefully flooding the market with devices based on its platform. That’s not a new strategy for NVIDIA, which has done essentially the same thing in the graphics card market, Unwired View points out. NVIDIA has some traction in smartphone and tablet processors with its existing Tegra 3 platform, and it announced the Tegra 4 was just announced at CES, with some predicting that it will be a big winner in the mobile market. But Qualcomm is the definite elephant in the room, and its new Snapdragon processors unveiled at CES look to push the envelope and help it maintain its lead among OEM adoption. Building their own white label designs with producers aiming at the bottom end of the market has a couple of advantages for NVIDIA. First, it gives them an opportunity to control the entire soup-to-nuts product design, meaning they can build hardware that will maximize the performance of the Tegra processor. Second, they can start building their own components at a much higher scale, as their low-cost partners ship more and more cheap, but fairly high-quality units in developing markets. That will help with economies of scale, making it easier to produce chips cheaply and in large batches for other hardware producers. Devices resulting from this plan will begin to come to market in the May to June timeframe, if the report’s source is correct. Some of these will carry the NVIDIA branding, Unwired View says, and some will not, but all should be relatively high-quality devices at the price points offered. This is still a rumor at this stage, but an intriguing one that if true, could help NVIDIA gain even more ground as a mobile processing powerhouse on the international stage.

It's not that important. The market is well supplied with radio chips that support GPS and other navigation systems. The ones for mobile devices typically also include Bluetooth and WiFi support. This chip's major advertised feature is that it supports a new navigation system, BeiDou. BeiDou is inferior to GPS in many ways. It's only advantage, and it's reason for development, is that it provides the Chinese military with a high accuracy signal that is not controlled by foreign powers. A few years ago you would completely ignore it. Now it's a good marketing feature for devices sold into China. BeiDou could potentially, a few years from now, become a requirement for devices sold into the Chinese market, but that's a political rather than technical issue.</Msg><Username>watergatefive</Username><Timestamp>1359404909011</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 15:28:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359405060168-36</Id><Topic><Title>Thoughts on NVIDIA selling its own phones and tablets</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1359389489359</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 11:11:29 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Whaaaaaaat?!!!

"The reference design approach could allow Nvidia to gain a lot more Tegra design wins and secure its presence in retail. It sounds like a very interesting idea to get more Tegra devices to consumers by cutting out the middle-man. Bear in mind that Nvidia has plenty of experience with reference designs, as it has been selling graphics cards through numerous AIBs for years. Since Nvidia would design and manufacture the reference tablets and smartphones itself, it should be in a good position to ensure quality and completely control the features. It is also interesting from the software side of things, as Nvidia could practically roll out updates for all the reference products at once, regardless of branding. This wouldn’t be the first time Nvidia tried to push a reference tablet platform, but its Kai platform, launched last year, wasn’t embraced by many vendors. However, this time around though, Nvidia would not just offer an open reference hardware platform, but a complete design. Mobile Review claims we should see the first 7-inch and 10-inch devices in May or June, just in time for Computex. It is a very interesting development and we will do our best to learn a bit more about Nvidia’s plans." SOURCE: Fudzilla today ___ I first talked about the Kai concept in an early post. I think Fudzilla stole ideas from me and this board - no worse than some of the SA authors did. however. :) I also wish to point out that Kai platform has been successful; ie. Nexu 7 and the low end Acer tablets etc, just to name a few. Often times, when the OEMs release Kai based products, they tended to avoid the mention of Kai - no big deal since NV would rake in the $$ regardless what the manufacturers do.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1359405878582</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 15:44:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359406024389-38</Id><Topic><Title>Thoughts on NVIDIA selling its own phones and tablets</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1359389489359</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 11:11:29 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>NVDA will do good.

They developed the x86-64 instruction set that most "x86" machines run, and forced many of the innovations over the years. I don't believe this, but I also don't credit Intel with "inventing" the PC market. They were just part of the ecosystem, contributing more than their share of bad decisions and designs. As far a licensing, Intel won't license their micro-architecture. And they'll pretty much only license the part of the x86 instruction set that you don't need a license for. Back to the original point: will Nvidia eventually suffer from the lack of competition, and be blindsided the way Intel was in the mobile space? It could have happened that way, but isn't. Because they got into the mobile market with Tegra, they are well aware of the new competition from PowerVR, Mali and Adreno. They won't be caught unaware while cashing in on the demise of ATI, the final competition of thousand. I do think that Nvidia could have easily have made that mistake. After all, they thought that the mediocre old GPU design used in the old Tegras would be competitive. Just like every company in this space, they started out expecting to be ahead for a full generation with a yearly release cadence.

"With its QRD (Qualcomm Reference Design), the company wants to assist Chinese companies that have so far only been known inside that country to expand overseas. Apparently, it was stressed that competitors’ chipsets (cough, MediaTek, cough) won’t be seen in places such as North America anytime soon, whereas using Qualcomm’s wares may help Chinese makers get a foothold in such markets. It seems that Qualcomm brought representatives from five major non-Chinese carriers to the Summit yesterday, wanting to stress that it has global reach and has ‘mastered’ the layout and advantages of overseas markets. Obviously, the message here is something along the lines of ‘work with us, and we might be able to score some carrier deals for you’. Alongside that, there’s the promise of the QRD itself: working together to dramatically reduce time-to-market for any new device. Qualcomm was also boasting that its MSM8x25Q quad-core chipset will soon be used in smartphones from Yulong Coolpad and Tianyu. As 4G LTE is going to arrive in China in the coming months, that was also a big part of the discussions yesterday. Qualcomm will obviously focus on delivering 4G-capable solutions to the market to be ready for the spread of LTE in China, and apparently it might also be working on a dual-mode TDD/FDD LTE modem for the end of this year. In the meantime, the MSM8930 Snapdragon S4 Plus (with dual-core CPU) is in the works. This will be the first chip to support all of the following network types: UMTS, CDMA, TD-SCDMA, and LTE TDD. So it could be used to power devices that would be compatible with all the Chinese carriers’ 3G networks, as well as China Mobile’s upcoming 4G LTE deployment. This chipset should be seen in shipping devices in the next few months. Before then, the aforementioned MSM8x25Q family features quad-core CPUs and dual-mode support for both UMTS and CDMA 3G (in the 8625Q part). The Chinese smartphone market is growing, and growing, and growing. It’s become (by some accounts) the biggest smartphone market on the planet in terms of sales numbers. That, coupled with the fact that most smartphones (regardless of brand) in the world are being made in China has some interesting effects. One of them is the rise of these white-box vendors, previously unknown companies that are starting to make a name for themselves in the mainland. To continue to grow, they’ll soon take international expansion very seriously, which is how Qualcomm hopes to lure them away from MediaTek’s solutions." Wow! QUALCOMM will help the little Chinese white box folks get Into the cellphone business. And then introduce them to big beautiful places -- such as North America.

Apparently, it was stressed that competitors’ chipsets (cough, MediaTek, cough) won’t be seen in places such as North America anytime soon, whereas using Qualcomm’s wares may help Chinese makers get a foothold in such markets. It seems that Qualcomm brought representatives from five major non-Chinese carriers to the Summit yesterday, wanting to stress that it has global reach and has ‘mastered’ the layout and advantages of overseas markets. Obviously, the message here is something along the lines of ‘work with us, and we might be able to score some carrier deals for you’. Alongside that, there’s the promise of the QRD itself: working together to dramatically reduce time-to-market for any new device. Qualcomm was also boasting that its MSM8x25Q quad-core chipset will soon be used in smartphones from Yulong Coolpad and Tianyu. As 4G LTE is going to arrive in China in the coming months, that was also a big part of the discussions yesterday. Qualcomm will obviously focus on delivering 4G-capable solutions to the market to be ready for the spread of LTE in China, and apparently it might also be working on a dual-mode TDD/FDD LTE modem for the end of this year. In the meantime, the MSM8930 Snapdragon S4 Plus (with dual-core CPU) is in the works. This will be the first chip to support all of the following network types: UMTS, CDMA, TD-SCDMA, and LTE TDD. So it could be used to power devices that would be compatible with all the Chinese carriers’ 3G networks, as well as China Mobile’s upcoming 4G LTE deployment. This chipset should be seen in shipping devices in the next few months. Before then, the aforementioned MSM8x25Q family features quad-core CPUs and dual-mode support for both UMTS and CDMA 3G (in the 8625Q part). The Chinese smartphone market is growing, and growing, and growing. It’s become (by some accounts) the biggest smartphone market on the planet in terms of sales numbers. That, coupled with the fact that most smartphones (regardless of brand) in the world are being made in China has some interesting effects. One of them is the rise of these white-box vendors, previously unknown companies that are starting to make a name for themselves in the mainland. To continue to grow, they’ll soon take international expansion very seriously, which is how Qualcomm hopes to lure them away from MediaTek’s solutions." Wow! QUALCOMM will help the little Chinese white box folks get Into the cellphone business. And then introduce them to big beautiful places -- such as North America. Where they can start to sell their highly affordable QUALCOMM-powered goods also. A Magnificant, Chinese Conquering Plan by QUALCOMM, right boys? It sure is. Which is no doubt why ibbey edited it out of the story he posted.</Msg><Username>best.again</Username><Timestamp>1359417300017</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 18:55:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>15</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359418324069-52</Id><Topic><Title>NVDA listed at numb. 8 in a top ten Overvalued stocks list on the site Extreme Value Stocks Interesting website.</Title><Username>aleshaalesha202</Username><Timestamp>1359403193062</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 14:59:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you also mentioned KGC.</Msg><Username>handsome868</Username><Timestamp>1359418324069</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 19:12:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359418723511-53</Id><Topic><Title>Qualcomm's new growth engine: the white box China market</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1359407950654</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 16:19:10 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Bestfucius say: 所有其他條件相同，走的傢伙，可以讓你的載體合同 ("All else being equal, go with the guys that can get you a Carrier Contract.")</Msg><Username>bestfucius</Username><Timestamp>1359418723511</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 19:18:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359419943501-54</Id><Topic><Title>Qualcomm's new growth engine: the white box China market</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1359407950654</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 16:19:10 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"NVIDIA is hoping to win back mobile processor marketshare with a scheme that involves building its own smartphone and tablet hardware designs and offering them white label to OEMs in Russia and China, aiming at the bottom end of the market." So Best? If a Chinese white label OEM was thinking about signing-up with Jen's "we'll build it for ya" scheme -- they wouldn't get a Carrier Contract from Verizon Wireless or AT&amp;T would they? Like they might teaming-up with QUALCOMM -- and using their designs and contract negotiating expertise. I didn't think so. Like Goldman Sachs says, "Ya gotta have the Best Team in your corner."</Msg><Username>ask.best</Username><Timestamp>1359419943501</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 19:39:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359422216258-55</Id><Topic><Title>nvidia's 2012 market share for smartphones? -- 00.90% -- Ha ha ha ha!</Title><Username>i_read_best</Username><Timestamp>1350912820996</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 09:33:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So let's say I was a wanna-be Chinese white box smartphone OEM.

And why Project White Label will fail too.</Title><Msg>Why Jen's Project Kai failed. And why Project White Label will fail too. What do engineers do? Simple question, right? What do engineers do? Well, they mostly tinker, and try to improve things. To make them Bigger, Better, Faster or Cheaper. That's what engineers do. They tinker. And they improve. And what did Jen's failed Project Kai attempt to do? And what will the equally failed Project White Label try to do? Hummm? They are attempting to Remove exactly what engineers do. Tinker and improve. So Jen strolls into White Box Brand X and meets with the Chief Engineer. "I've got just what you need right here in this box", says Jen. And shows the Chief Engineer of White Box Brand X his new, ready-to-go, "we'll build it for you", White Label reference platform. And what is the Chief Engineer's immediate reaction? Hummm? "I bet we can tinker with it and improve it even more." So the Chief Engineer takes Jen's new, ready-to-go, "we'll build it for you", White Label reference platform -- and they tinker with it. And they replace capacitors, and resistors, and tweak voltages, and they substitute diodes, and then the batteries, and the antenna shield, and the screen, and the printed circuit card layout, and the software.... And Eureka! They made Jen's ready-to-go, "we'll build it for you" White Label reference platform, Better. 'Cause that's what engineers do. UNFORTUNATELY, Jen's scheme is that nobody changes nuthin'. Nope. Jen wants to design the cellphone or tablet once -- and Everybody is supposed to just immediately like it -- and signs up to have Jen build it for them. Neeeever-gonna-happen, boys. Jen idea is an attempt to eliminate the need for engineers and what they do. Tinker and improve. And Jen's gotta sell this idea to eliminate engineering to the Chief Engineer? Neeeever-gonna-happen, boys. If for no other reason other than Job Protection. Of the Chief Engineer and his staff of engineers. Project Kai was a scratch. And Project White Label will be a scratch too.</Msg><Username>bestonica</Username><Timestamp>1359432271688</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 23:04:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>17</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359432775187-59</Id><Topic><Title>Why Jen's Project Kai failed.

This is one of Jen's worst dunder-headed idea yet. What's the Chief Engineer gonna do -- become the Chief decal designer? With his staff of 50 co-decal designers.
