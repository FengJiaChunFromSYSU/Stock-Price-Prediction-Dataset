Apple: "Android is a stolen product." . . Apple, Google CEOs Said to Discuss Patent Disputes By Brian Womack and Adam Satariano - Aug 30, 2012 3:34 PM CT In excerpts. Apple Inc. (AAPL) Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook and Google Inc. (GOOG) CEO Larry Page are holding discussions regarding patent disputes involving the two leading technology companies, said a person with knowledge of the talks. Cook and Page spoke by phone last week and are expected to talk more soon, said the person, who asked not to be named because the conversations aren’t public. The person didn’t elaborate on the details of the discussions. Apple is embroiled in lawsuits with several makers of smartphones that use Google’s Android operating system. Apple last week won a $1.05 billion verdict from a California jury, which found that features of some of Samsung Electronics Co.’s Android-based phones infringed patents for the iPhone. Samsung’s stock tumbled the most in almost four years after the verdict. Even though Apple hasn’t sued Google directly, the iPhone maker’s patent lawsuits against Samsung and HTC Corp. (2498) have targeted features from Android. Apple co-founder Steve Jobs told biographer Walter Isaacson that Android was a “stolen product.” Apple considered suing Google directly before filing its first smartphone patent-infringement suit against HTC in 2010, according to a person close to Apple’s legal team. Apple decided against it after determining that going after the manufacturers of rival smartphones would be a better strategy than building a case against Google, this person said. The Android developer, also owner of the most popular Internet- search engine, gives the mobile operating system away for free to handset makers in exchange for advertising revenue. . . .

The patents violated are hardly earth-shatering. With nearly all of them being in the software implementation they could develop workarounds by the end of the year. How long do you think it takes for a designer and developer to come up with something other than square buttons or the end-of-list bounce-back. Other patents, like multi-touch, will be more difficult to work around. Whole bloody thing is a bit ridiculous if you ask me though... putting a patent on a square, a rectangle or on touching a touchable screen more than once at a time. It is what it is though and we'll be paying for it. Most patents will be worked around in future models though... multi-touch, if it sticks, will win Apple some royalties.</Msg><Username>waynejoneser</Username><Timestamp>1346428384368</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 11:53:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346428440711-26</Id><Topic><Title>Strange new board</Title><Username>ibexx88</Username><Timestamp>1346421592585</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 09:59:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yeah, seems to have slowed board activity way down.

As we already know, AMD recently set up the HSA Foundation1 to promote its vision for better parallel processing -- and especially GPU compute2 -- in mobiles and PCs. Its semi-rival ARM was one of the first big players to join up, and now Samsung has decided to hop onboard too. Why would it do that? For the simple reason that the Korean company still makes its own chips, based on ARM designs, and we've seen that GPU compute is going to be a big feature in its coming Exynos 5 processor3 with Mali T604 graphics. Now, anything else at this point is pure speculation, since we only know about Samsung's HSA membership from the appearance of its logo on a relevant slide at AMD's keynote speech at IFA4, and there's no official word on Samsung's intentions. At a bare minimum, the company could simply be firming up friendships5 and hedging its bets on the future of computing. We wouldn't be surprised, however, if Sammy is looking to work with ARM and AMD to implement further aspects of the HSA philosophy into even more advanced Exynos chips down the line -- chips that are able to use both GPU compute and smaller transistors6 to achieve leaps in performance while also gobbling fewer volts.</Msg><Username>chitownbarber22</Username><Timestamp>1346430685605</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 12:31:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346431796797-29</Id><Title>nvidia looks to be the buyer of their shares right now!</Title><Msg>who else would, right???</Msg><Username>smallstock1</Username><Timestamp>1346431796797</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 12:49:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346432114000-30</Id><Topic><Title>Split board</Title><Username>on2five</Username><Timestamp>1346419626000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 09:27:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This one came up old board.

So save it" What am I saving, the fact that I pointed out that a random idiot abuses the system, I don't recall complaining about the posts he was attacking, I just pointed out the immaturity of his actions. As to "bashers" and "pumpers" I don't use the tired labels to hide my inability to discuss matters intelligently. "The pumpers here were reporting people just because they didn't like the poster, not even caring what was posted. The only problem was their replies were breaking TOS and they'd end up getting removed instead." So, then why are you bringing it up, sounds like Yahoo has it under control. "That's why we have so many ID's with numbers behind them. They kept coming back with new aliases." LOL, I only see one guy doing this, and he seems to be the one you are trying to defend. "So don't even attempt to claim pumpers don't want to hide posts from people they don't agree with." Again, I just pointed out the benefit of the new system you are the one taking sides and whining about the world being against you "pumpers" this "bashers" that....YAWN</Msg><Username>patent_killr</Username><Timestamp>1346438168517</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 14:36:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346438305031-39</Id><Title>back to $13 AGAIN.</Title><Msg>What a pos...........all good news along with earnings and nvda trends downwards.....manipulation or just a stock nobody wants to own"?</Msg><Username>dasboot_y</Username><Timestamp>1346438305031</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 14:38:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346438855965-40</Id><Topic><Title>back to $13 AGAIN.</Title><Username>dasboot_y</Username><Timestamp>1346438305031</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 14:38:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's been a stock nobody wants since 2007 when it dropped from 30+ down to 6 bucks.

The pumpers want to silence the truth tellers. I mean really.. how dare some of us post how pathetic this stock's performance is.. how dare we inform investors who read this site that pumpers lie and the "good news" they post are merely top 10 list and talk about new products like they are selling millions and we find out the real numbers it's usually less than 100,000 a quarter (ie. Xoom,Transformer) Pumpers can't stand it that posters like me have been right about the stock for so long and have done everything they can to try to have me removed by Yahoo even though I do not come on and constantly post replies like the Pumpers telling everyone to ignore them or calling them names. They want to silence the truth.. but nobody can do that.. the truth shall set you free or save you money.. depending on your position in nvda.</Msg><Username>amdshortsrfools</Username><Timestamp>1346439327610</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 14:55:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346439430498-42</Id><Topic><Title>New web chatters re.

Fiscally GRIM. That's what Our nvidia Message Board is. In fiscally grim shape, boys. Best just read the entire Yahoo! 10-K looking for a glimse into the relative significance of these Message Boards to Yahoo!. You know, the "unique" number of readers, revenues, margins etc. Conclusion: It's grim, grim, grim, boys. There is Not One Mention in the entire Yahoo! 10-K of our precious Yahoo Finance Message Board. None. Nada. Goose egg. Yahoo Finance gets a passing half-paragraph mention -- about how Yahoo sunk "between $10 million and $100 million into Yahoo Finance" like a decade ago -- and have 200 data providers -- but Nothing about revenues -- let alone those elusive profits. Looks a lot like that failed Tegra experiment. . . It appears boys, that the only way Our message board ever turns a nickel is from the "click-on" ad boxes -- for like E*TRADE or Scottrade. Maybe they get $10 bucks a click from the advertiser, right? Hardly enough to employee a fine Yahoo! Monitor. Part time. Which, by the way, might explain the long lag time between reporting a perpetrator, and their actual disappearance from Our fine board. . . So here's the Plan, boys. If the only visible sign of revenue to our poor impoverished board is the "click-on" ad boxes, we all need to click regularly and frequently on those. Click -- $10 bucks to the nvda MB cigar box. Click -- Another $10 bucks for a good Cause. Heck, the Bestville denizens could generate three grand for the Cause in an evening. Kind of like a "fund raising night", right boys? And then maybe open, say, 50 to 60 E*TRADE accounts each. Trade free for 60 days, right boys? Try a couple dozen Scottrade accounts too -- heck why not. If we ALL work together here, we might save our impoverished message board from the chopping block of Yahoo's new Interim CEO lady. . . .</Msg><Username>multifarious.best</Username><Timestamp>1346471650019</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 23:54:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>17</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
