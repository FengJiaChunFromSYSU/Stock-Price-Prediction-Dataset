An open Android gaming platform is exactly what serious gamers want. The disruption to tradtional console / market is significant and in a few month you'lll walk into a Gamestop and there she'll be; a high performance, android based , very cool device that serious gamers over 21 will embrace.

But none of their existing tablet customers will use it as Camera much less HDR is silly on Tablet. We have all chuckled at folks with Tablet taking pictures at events. It should land them some high end Smartphones. I was hoping for Sony which is usually very conscious of imaging to have them. But they just announced Xperia with QCOM. Maybe HTC will come out with T4. The larger point may be that HDR like features can yield stickiness with vendors. It uses T4 internals and requires tight integration with Nvidia drivers and can't be easily replicated by other vendors (e.g. Adreno, Imagination, Mali).</Msg><Username>o.investor</Username><Timestamp>1358353149267</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 11:19:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358353682042-19</Id><Topic><Title>what about nvda HDR camera in tegra 4</Title><Username>tomasco3777</Username><Timestamp>1358317180223</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 01:19:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>nonsense...</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1358353682042</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 11:28:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358355225776-20</Id><Title>Next stop 11.75</Title><Msg>charts are looking ugly</Msg><Username>o.investor</Username><Timestamp>1358355225776</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 11:53:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358355478236-21</Id><Topic><Title>Next stop 11.75</Title><Username>o.investor</Username><Timestamp>1358355225776</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 11:53:45 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>here we go - gun violence will be blamed on video games.

"The Sunnyvale, Calif.-based firm wants all documents to be returned immediately. The court has granted a temporary restraining order against the former employees not to use any confidential information from AMD and to make sure they preserve any AMD document copies, as well as any computers or storage devices they own. "AMD will always take action to aggressively protect its confidential, proprietary and trade secret information," a company spokesman told TheStreet, in an emailed statement. "We believe the facts are clearly outlined in our pleadings and are supported by forensic evidence. The pleadings are publicly available. Current and former AMD employees are contractually required to honor the ongoing confidentiality and non-solicitation obligations each agreed to while employed with us."

Unlike ASIC's that have much of the logic built into the silcon for a specific purpose or FPGA which is like a programmable IC , a software designed solution employs a software stack that would solve the same problem. The best example I can give, and i am taking liberties here, is like comparing a physical calculator to say the calculator application on your PC. Again that example isn't the best and certainly doesn't depict the true technical differences, but is a simple way to visual the difference from a 50k foot view. The later, like a SDR, can be changed easily and updated accordingly and sits atop of a general purpose machine (the computer) and prior is designed to do a set of specific tasks on very specific hardware. If you want to change the later it requires simply updating the software where as if you want to change the prior it would typically requiring rerunning the silicon.</Msg><Username>brokeagain73</Username><Timestamp>1358379587072</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 18:39:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>13</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358382837157-47</Id><Topic><Title>"Xbox 720 and PlayStation 4 Secrets Allegedly Leaked to Nvidia by Former AMD Executives"</Title><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1358370482000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 16:08:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why would any company employ someone that would walk off with the companies secret documents when they leave?

A complaint filed to the District Court of Massachusetts reveals that AMD's former VP of Strategic Development Robert Feldstein, who was instrumental in designing graphics chips for early Xbox 360 consoles and the Wii, is among the defendants. He's accused of playing a role in the electronic transfer over 100,000 files containing "trade secret materials relating to developing technology." AMD claims it has "forensically-recovered data" to show that external storage devices were used in the days prior Feldstein's departure, and also that he and another senior exec, Richard Hagen, actively recruited the two other defendants to join them at NVIDIA, in violation of agreements they had signed. Of course, this is just AMD's side of the story. The company told us in a statement that it intends to "aggressively protect" its trade secrets through this litigation, so the rest will just have to play out in court." source: engadget If true then who did they give them to at Nvidia?

So says AMD, which alleges that the former vice-president and three other former employees passed sensitive documents to its rival after leaving AMD. Chief among these files are highly sensitive licensing agreements and proposed licensing strategies, as ZDNet reports. “The volume of materials that these three defendants collectively transferred to storage devices, each of which is unaccounted for, as they left to work for AMD’s competitor, exceeds 100,000 electronic files,” AMD claims. But Feldstein didn’t just steal documents. AMD has also accused the former vice-president of violating a “no-solicitation of employees” promise when he actively sought to bring other AMD workers to Nvidia. Before departing AMD last July, Feldstein helped get AMD technology into game consoles like the Xbox 360, Playstation 3, and Nintendo Wii. As Nvidia confirmed last year, Feldstein will be doing largely the same job in his new gig. Seeing as how both Microsoft and Sony are preparing their next-generation consoles, it’s not particularly surprising to see the chipmakers trying to keep their secrets as locked down as possible." source: venturebeat</Msg><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1358389533941</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 21:25:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358390089134-58</Id><Topic><Title>"AMD claims that ex-employees gave Nvidia stolen documents"</Title><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1358389533941</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 21:25:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"AMD claims that ex-employees gave Nvidia stolen documents" Who at Nvidia did these ex-employees allegedly give stolen documents?
