"Bob Rango" Sounds like just the kind of guy that can deliver those LTE chips on time, as promised. At Broadcom's successful annual investor meeting. Or successfully herd cats. Or run a successful Chevrolet dealership. "Bob Rango Chevrolet" Why, I bet that guy could be successful at Anything. And Everything. Like GE's Jack Welch would say, "A good manager can successfully manage anything." Separately, HOW long ago was it that Jen bought wireless chip designer icera?

They also support LTE technology, better graphics, high network speed and increased battery life, which make them more popular among the top smartphone manufacturers." The Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 processor with on-board LTE is popular, boys. So POPULAR they're selling like hotcakes. Yes HOTCAKES, boys. Top high-end smartphone and tablet manufacturers were waiting in line 'cause they couldn't get enough of those Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 with on-board LTE chips. And your top customers shouldn't have to wait, right? Of course not. So Qualcomm's management wisely and astutely added Two (2) more chip fabbers, -- 1) Samsung Electronics Co. and 2) Globalfoundries Inc. -- to make More of them -- Faster. And now EVERYBODY can get as many Snapdragon S4 with on-board LTE chips as they need for all their high-end smartphone and tablets. No more waiting in line for them. Oh no no no. Customers just step right up and buy 'em. "I would like to buy two fork lift loads today, please." "Of your Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 with on-board LTE chips." This is Good customer service from Qualcomm, right? It sure is. And there's no longer any need for Qualcomm's top customers to order lesser, sub-par parts from the other guys either. Who don't have that popular, selling-like-hotcakes, on-board LTE. Smart management over there at Qualcomm. I'll bet that's how they became the Largest Mobile Chipset Manufacturer on the Planet.</Msg><Username>i_read_best</Username><Timestamp>1354985738064</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-08 11:55:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354990465679-6</Id><Title>Nvidia Is A $12 Stock Worth $18: A Sum Of The Parts Analysis</Title><Msg>seeking alpha article good summation</Msg><Username>nvda_4_ever</Username><Timestamp>1354990465679</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-08 13:14:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354990728480-7</Id><Topic><Title>Tegra 4 coming soon, HTC first in line (a few more details)</Title><Username>ibexx88</Username><Timestamp>1354887678906</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 08:41:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>burp bump</Msg><Username>best_the_turkey</Username><Timestamp>1354990728480</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-08 13:18:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354990850617-8</Id><Title>Nvidia Is A $12 Stock Worth $18: A Sum Of The Parts Analysis</Title><Msg>seeking alpha . read all about it!</Msg><Username>best_the_turkey</Username><Timestamp>1354990850617</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-08 13:20:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354990917730-9</Id><Title>Nvidia Is A 12 Stock Worth 18: A Sum Of The Parts Analysis</Title><Msg>oh yeah</Msg><Username>nvda_4_ever</Username><Timestamp>1354990917730</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-08 13:21:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354994155807-10</Id><Topic><Title>Tegra 4 coming soon, HTC first in line (a few more details)</Title><Username>ibexx88</Username><Timestamp>1354887678906</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 08:41:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I've read it a couple times now. ... Nvidia is likely to present... rumoured... Jen paid $1,500 bucks for the CES award... expected to be presented at the CES technology show in Las Vegas next month... unless of course the Samsung Exynos 5250 processor Wins the CES award for being the FIRST ever Cortex A15 chip... which is already ON the market don't u know... and powers the award winning Google Nexus 10... nvidia's new tegra #4 finally has twice the power of the turtle-like Tegra 3... The Samsung Exynos 5250, for example, can blow the doors off the Tegra 3 even though the probable CES award winning Samsung Exynos 5250 Cortex A15 chip has only two (2) cores versus the tegra's three... so two really speedy Samsung Cortex A15 cores handily beats nvidia's four (4) old legacy turtle-like Cortex A9 cores... The famous "Ninja core" seen in the Tegra 3 gets re-named too. For marketing purposes, don't u know. Yep, it's not called the "Ninja" anymore... Nope. That bad name has been changed to the "Companion Core" in the Tegra 4... same flawed engineering, just new marketing spin... So the "Ninja" name gets kicked to the curb in January... The Tegra 4 is also likely to gain in power efficiency thanks to TSMC finally getting their waaaaay late 28 nm process sort of working... Jen now pays for ALL the chips, the few good ones and ALL the bad ones too -- so look for nvidia's margins to continue to plunge since Jen is now paying for ALL of TSMC's scrap tegra #4's... mountains of scrap tegra #4's... HTC could be nvidia's first "launch partner" with the first Tegra 4 T40 phone... Amazing isn't it? It sure is... What those free 100k of Tegra #4 "engineering samples" can do... We'll be heading over to Las Vegas for CES 2013 to bring you all the news live from the show... Too bad Apple won't be there... Oh well, still free food and an open bar... Like for an entire week... Good roulette too... Come on seven!.... But I don't see any mention at all about the Tegra #4 having an on-board LTE modem. No mention of LTE at all. Like Qualcomm's ever-growing Family of 14 Snapdragon processors has. Did ibexx88 cut that part out of the story? Or did Jen forget to put a selling-like-hotcakes LTE modem in this version of the tegra too. If so -- The tegra #4 looks like a scratch, boys.</Msg><Username>i_read_best</Username><Timestamp>1354994155807</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-08 14:15:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>17</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354998096433-11</Id><Topic><Title>Tegra 4 coming soon, HTC first in line (a few more details)</Title><Username>ibexx88</Username><Timestamp>1354887678906</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 08:41:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You need the best professional help available - don't u know!</Msg><Username>chitownbarber20</Username><Timestamp>1354998096433</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-08 15:21:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354999661738-12</Id><Topic><Title>Tegra 4 coming soon, HTC first in line (a few more details)</Title><Username>ibexx88</Username><Timestamp>1354887678906</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 08:41:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So Mister Best? You'll be at the Consumers Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January, right? I thought so. Could I ask a wee little favor of you? Could you pick up like a half-dozen of those nvidia Tegra #4 mousepads? And have Jen autograph them. You know -- with that nice silver MagicMarker? I'm betting that when the Tegra #4 launches -- without an LTE on-board modem -- that it will, well, crater on launch. And that those Tegra #4 mousepads, autographed by current CEO Jen, might be Really Really Valuable. You know -- like on eBay. For museums of Failed Products.

Like the Wall Street Journal, or Bloomberg or Reuters or AppleInsider. Reputable news places like that. But this "news" posted by decepticon ibexx88 is not "news" at all. Oh no no no. First, look at the headline: "HTC to be the first with NVIDIA Tegra 4 phone?" That question mark (?) is a tell-tail sign that it's Not really news. But somebody's made-up "news". And then look at the lead-in sentence: "There seems to be a lot of HTC RUMORS lately... and the latest RUMOR suggests that HTC may try to do something or other with the LTE-less Tegra #4." The use of the word RUMOR twice (2X) in the same sentence is a slam-dunk clue that it's not really "news", right Master? And us clones Know what to do with ibbey's little made-up Rumors. Yes we do.
