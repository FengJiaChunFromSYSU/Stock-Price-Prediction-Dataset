Three of QC's largest customers - Apple, Blackberry, and Nokia - have all missed current quarter guidance, it's simply common sense that QC would bear the consequences of their bad news.

Dun u guys know how market works?! Even if news is baked in, it may and will likely gap down then rally off it. Its call sell the news buy the fact! This is big news and u expect share price to do nothing when it turns into a fact. So u expect Nvidia to always rally up and never have a 5% down day??? Even darn Apple and qcom have huge sell days during huge multi bagger rally up. And this, I am being optimistic. Recall when Nvidia won a spot in Surface Rt, and nexus 7, who would have thought this POS would be at only $13 after all these wins? Hence, being cautious and doubting it is the right thing to do . Not u blind faith followers thinking Nvidia is a religion!</Msg><Username>chrisssable</Username><Timestamp>1367043806022</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-27 02:23:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367045103187-3</Id><Title>Investing and Nvidia</Title><Msg>Heard of buy the rumors sell the fact, sell the rumors buy the fact? Hence, buy rumor that Nvidia won a spot in rt and nexus, then sell the fact, or let it continues to rally few days then sell it. So likely scenario, buy Nvidia after its announced they loses nexus 7 spot, or if it behaves poorly after opening, let it drop few days before buying. Most importantly, try to avoid supplier stocks, try to buy owner stocks. All semiconductor companies are supplier stocks. They supply to owners who sell directly to end consumers. Google, Msft, Apple, blackberry, ntes, bidu, lvs are all owner stocks. Owners only depend on end demand, suppliers have to depend on end demand and owners whims and fancies.

Its always a launch, a hype, then nothing. Worse of it all is Kai, here's why. Isn't Nvidia the first to launch quad core, then announced kai to bring low cost quad to the masses??!!! Why only works in theory but lost so much to mediatek??!!! This is clear evidence of mismanagement . They misread market. They fail to realize that fabless industry has made barriers to entry lower and this is a commoditized product. Hence their bs premium quad and premium price can't compete. They have to realize this. But I believe Jen has an ego that is bigger than the room and will still price tegra too expensive to compete. Hence qcom margin compression may mean more volume business for qcom and mediatek. Whether tegra will benefit is questionable. Given half year mark is coming yet they have little or no business for tegra 4, it looks like lousy Nvidia again.</Msg><Username>chrisssable</Username><Timestamp>1367046195232</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-27 03:03:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367047669397-5</Id><Title>If winning Nexus is super great, losing it?</Title><Msg>Losing it becomes no big deal???
