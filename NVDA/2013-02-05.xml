Might be a penny higher. Revenue will hit the midpoint of the range to a touch higher. Just the way they play it now. Earnings for 2013 will go up 4 to 5 cents from the Tax credit reinstatement alone. Guidance.....Jeez I hope they are aggressive but I don't know. They'll meet expectations though. I wish they had announced the Project Shield for 1Q shipment. I really want one. Stock buyback...they would be foolish not to have at least nibbled $50M or so after mentioning it. The real wild card is the dividend. I hope they are following in MCHP's shoes and just nudging a little each quarter.

It spending seems to have been strong as well (mostly infrastructure) so their professional segment should come inline or slightly better. Consumer products is hit or miss but a strong showing of the nexus 7 and Audis rollout (I think will show in q4) I am hoping their guidance is inline here.

The turning point had finally been reached, he said, with the firm’s 32-nm Medfield SoC. “You’ll see some pretty impressive SoC products coming next year on the 22nm generation,” he said.

A reason for Qualcomm‘s chief marketing officer Anand Chandrasekher to come out with some of his own “straight facts” to dispel the myth of Nvidia‘s graphics superiority. Snapdragon S4 Pro is better, faster than the commercially shipping Tegra 3… On benchmarks published by Anantech, S4 Pro is twice as fast than the fastest Tegra processor commercially available, said Chandresseker in an exclusive interview with TechPulse 360. Nvidia just launched their Tegra 4, not sure when those will be in the market on a commercial basis, but we believe our Snapdragon 600 outperforms Nvidia’s Tegra 4. And we believe our Snapdragon 800 completely outstrips it and puts a new benchmark in place. So, we clean Tegra 4′s clock. There’s nothing in Tegra 4 that we looked at and that looks interesting. Tegra 4 frankly, looks a lot like what we already have in S4 Pro. Qualcomm hopes for more tablet wins in 2013 Yes, they [Nvidia] had the perception [of superior graphics] help them for some time, and that helped them for some tablet wins. I think that would change. The world is increasingly becoming aware that what we have in CPUs and graphics is beyond what anybody has. So usually that technical awareness happens at the OEMs and that takes a while for products to emerge… Empirically, we completely beat them on graphics performance!

Everyone, that is, except Intel Corp. Beacon, developed by the National Institute for Computational Sciences (NICS) at the University of Tennessee, started out as a research project to port software code to small clusters of Intel Many Integrated Core (MIC3) chips. When the group started working with the MICs, now better known as the Xeon Phi processor line, it found some compelling energy-saving possibilities. The NICS group decided to use the technology to create a small HPC cluster. On Friday Eurotech and NVIDIA announced a new HPC system, called Eurora, that the companies say beats Beacon's energy efficiency by 26% – using NVIDIA GPUs instead of Intel Xeons, of course. With Eurora pumping out 315 gigaflops per watt versus Beacon's 299 gigaflops per watt, NVIDIA executives are happy that they can now claim the most energy-efficient HPC system uses their GPUs. ....

With all the mobile ARM manufacturers to choose from you would think a game console mfg. would choose the best in graphics. Apparently they did. According to the the latest press release they have opened up pre orders at Best Buy, Amazon, Gamestop, and Target. The original 68,000 backers will get their consoles in March and the first pre orders are due to ship in April/May with units hitting retail stores in June. According to the founder they already have more in pre orders than the original 68,000 to ship in March. Put it at 150K little Tegra 3 shipments already! Price is $100 with one controller and each additional controller is $50. Put's Nvidia's Project Shield in perspective and it's expected price in perpective but the lack of a 5 inch screen, rechargeble battery, Tegra 3 vs. Tegra 4, and streaming from your PC must be balanced. Not sure how Nvidia will price their unit, but it sure is good to see Tegra chips selling into a market that didn't exist a few months ago Hope Nvidia does pre-orders too.

By Adrian Kingsley-Hughes for Hardware 2.0 | February 4, 2013 -- 16:31 GMT (08:31 PST) It’s not just PCs and tablets that are going green, even supercomputers are having their power requirements slashed. A new supercomputer based in Italy now claims to be the greenest in the world. Called Eurora, it claims to be able to crunch its way through 3,150 megaflops per watt. Compare this to the Beacon supercomputer at the National Institute for Computational Sciences and University of Tennessee, is the current leader of the Green-500 list, which only manages 2,499.44 megaflops per watt. Europa was developed by Eurotech, and is controlled by the non-profit consortium CINECA, a group made up of 57 Italian universities and institutions. The project is based on Eurotech's Aurora node hardware. The supercomputer is made up of 64 nodes, with each node consisting of a pair of Intel Xeon E5-2687W processors, two Nvidia Tesla K20 GPU accelerator cards, an Altera Stratix V FPGA, 16GB DDR3 RAM, and a 160GB solid-state drive. Eurotech claims that each node, which is about the size of a notebook, is capable of 1,700 gigaflops per second. Each of the nodes is 30 times more powerful that a regular desktop PC, yet 15 times more power efficient. Eurotech uses a unique liquid cooling systems which allows for a more compact design, packing in 256 Tesla K20 accelerators and CPUs in a single rack while delivering 350 teraflops of peak performance. A single rack would be ranked among the top 100 supercomputers in the world, according to the latest Top500 list. With only nine racks, the system would deliver over 3.1 petaflops of performance, placing it in the top 10 of the most powerful supercomputers. Over the supercomputer’s five year lifespan, Eurotech estimates that Cineca will save 2.5 million kilowatt-hours in energy, which translates into a saving of $500,000, while also eliminating over 1,500 tons of CO2.</Msg><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1360112939532</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 20:08:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360113014898-90</Id><Topic><Title>Ouya Game Console - Tegra of Course</Title><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1360111355678</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 19:42:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Ouya gamer powered by Tegra 3 has been known for at least six months, pricing too for almost as long.

So you are put on ignore. 2-If in looking at the history of a poster's comments, the majority of those comments are either not the appropriate subject for the board, are crude, or political or all some combination of the these traits, you are put on ignore. 3- If you are clearly a paid basher or spammer. It is not worth describing ALL the examples, but one typical one includes titles that are promising one thing and then listing a site to a spam site of some kind, you are put on ignore (if it doesn't take too much of my time). 4-If you continually bait and switch with your comments and make boastful claims about what the charts say will happen today tomorrow or whenever and 'promise' this thing is doomed to crash to this set price, etc, you are put on ignore. (I actually do this for silly claims in the other direction too but that really doesn't come up nearly as much.) I think there may be a couple of other less common traits in a poster, but these are the main ones for me. So, I'm fine with posters that actually say something constructive (and critical) of the stock but that rarely happens because most of those negative posts show little thought and effort and are usually very transparent in their intentions as a paid basher.

But with said read what I posted again 150K Tegras sold into a market that didn't exist several months before is a good thing! As to Project Shield...sure superior in all respects and will sell very well to Gamers. probably priced like like a performance GPU card...i.e. priced $200 to $300. Now putting that in perspective. According to Jon Peddie in the first half of 2012 26% of all discrete consumer GPU cards were at the performance level(GTX 650 and GTX670) and 4.7%(GTX675 to GTX690) were enthusiast level. Considering Nvidia sold around 11 million discrete GPU cards in Q3 of 2012. The potential market for the Project Shield is around 3.5M a quarter...i.e. the performance and enthusiast Gamer guys. So the bottom line...if 10% of the Nvidia Hardcore gamers bite and buy the Project Shield we are looking at sales of 350K a quarter or 1.4 million a year. This is not chump change! Say $250 times 1.4M equals $350M in annual revenue and say $100 times 1.4M or $140M in yearly additional operating income. Anything else is gravy and should not be counted on. At least not this year.

By Adrian Kingsley-Hughes for Hardware 2.0 | October 29, 2012 -- 09:43 GMT (02:43 PDT) While there's a certain allure to using ARM processors for server applications because of their low power consumption, Nvidia believes the chips won't be ready for high performance applications for a couple of years. Sumit Gupta, general manager of Nvidia's Tesla accelerated computing unit, sees the x86 architecture as being the king of the server room, for the time being at any rate. "Performance of these ARM cores is still not where it needs to be for servers. It is getting there; the new ARM64 is going to get it part of the way," said Gupta, as reported by The Inquirer. "One day I think ARM will at least get to similar performance levels as X86 performance. The belief is that over the next one or two years these ARM SoCs will be good enough for cloud applications and web serving. I think it will take some more time to be good enough for accelerated computing"</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1360117953225</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 21:32:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360119951438-98</Id><Topic><Title>Nvidia: High performance ARM servers 'one or two years' away</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1360117953225</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 21:32:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"The belief is that over the next one or two years these ARM SoCs will be good enough for cloud applications and web serving.

If it helps, Nvidia specifically pointed out at a recent investor conference that product launch is at CES and partner product announcements are at MWC. Don't be so quick to count Nvidia out just yet.</Msg><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1360122048582</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 22:40:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360122738498-101</Id><Title>Gentlemen - Nvidia's Gone Back to It's Roots - Gaming!</Title><Msg>Tablets sure and a lot of them, A few world class phones OK, Project Denver----maybe someday! But right now it's all all about Gaming. Not sexy stuff...just makes money and builds cash. Sell side WS ain't gonna pick up on it so no double double this year. But if Nvidia returns cash to shareholders in the form of increased dividends, and buys back some shares each quarter we should see a 30% to 40% share price increase through the year. Very boring I know....but what can I say. Oh I know: NVIDIA's GOT' GAME!</Msg><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1360122738498</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 22:52:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360123042773-102</Id><Topic><Title>QCOM slams NVDA - again</Title><Username>o.investor</Username><Timestamp>1360121601343</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 22:33:21 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>spoken like a true believer :) color me naive but do you even remember Tegra 2 and 3 launches - there were dozens of benchmarks and tie-up announcements every day and then some... Something has obviously changed - don't tell me that Nvidia does not understand early mover advantage in Tablet launches. As it is - I didn't have much hope in the smartphone field as its more dependent on QCOM screwing up than Nvidia with a winning plan. I am hoping for Nvidia's sake that they are working with some important customer for first tablet launch and didn't want message muddled with little stuff.</Msg><Username>o.investor</Username><Timestamp>1360123042773</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 22:57:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360123922511-103</Id><Topic><Title>QCOM slams NVDA - again</Title><Username>o.investor</Username><Timestamp>1360121601343</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 22:33:21 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"I don't have a position in NVDA " then your relentless prophecy of doom is due to public service "very disappointing to have not seen anything come out on Tegra 4 or, i500 front.
