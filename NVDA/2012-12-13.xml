But I don't see your point. Neither will Broadcom or any other SoC vendor. (Actually there is a scenario where it would happen: if Samsung suddenly stops fabbing chips for Apple. It's faintly possible Apple would use an external SoC. But only faintly possible, since writing the device drivers would take almost as much time as revising the chip layout for a different fab line.) I also don't see your point with regard to a "complete" SoC. A T33 is a pretty complete SoC. It integrates most major features except for the memory chips, radios, and camera. Broadcom can integrate WiFi, but it still needs multiple external chips such as MEMS and RF chips for a complete system. Presumably both will integrate LTE modems onto the main die in the coming year, but will still use a discrete RF chip. BTW, thank you for a thoughtful and informed message.

But no more, the ARM cores now are such that anybody can do it. The differentiator will be what else you can integrate into the silicon. Hence brcm's view is it's down to them and qcom. And qcom, judging from their $3.1B for Athero's wifi and their road map, probably feels the same way.

Apple Looking to Build $10 Billion Chip Fab Plant in New York State?</Title><Msg>Whaaaat?! Apple Looking to Build $10 Billion Chip Fab Plant in New York State? Here's the industry-changing buzz, boys. Cuomo hints Apple behind NY development pitch As Apple plans to move some production to U.S., speculation rises about site By Larry Rulison Updated 11:38 am, Tuesday, December 11, 2012 ALBANY — Gov. Andrew Cuomo seemed to acknowledge Monday on a radio show that Apple is indeed behind a top-secret plan that has been pitched to state economic development officials for a 3.2 million-square-foot computer chip factory. Last week, the Times Union published a pair of stories which surmised that whichever company is behind the search for a site for the project is likely a major Apple supplier. Apple recently announced it intends to bring manufacturing back to the United States. And Apple has reportedly been seeking to dump Samsung as the supplier of its central processing chips for its iPhone and iPad devices. One of the likely winners of that business would be Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Just last week, a spokesman for the Empire State Development Corp., the state's economic development arm, declined to comment on the idea. "ESDC does not comment on any potential negotiations that may or may not be occurring related to its economic development efforts," Austin Shafran told the Times Union. But when he appeared on AM 1300 Monday morning, Cuomo was asked by host Fred Dicker point-blank whether the Apple speculation is true. The governor at least appeared to concede that Apple has been looking at the state for a manufacturing site. "Well, we're shopping a lot of different companies at any given time," Cuomo replied. "Apple has a lot of competition, obviously, for their location. I don't think that they're anywhere yet in the decision-making." The top-secret Apple customer that has been scouting sites in upstate New York has had its site consultants visit the Luther Forest Technology Campus in Malta and the Marcy NanoCenter in Oneida County. Luther Forest is already home to GlobalFoundries, which built a 2 million-square-foot chip factory on 223 acres it owns there. Samsung makes iPhone and iPad chips at its Austin, Texas, fab, but industry analysts have said that Apple is looking to make a switch and that TSMC could be the likely winner of the business, although Intel, too, has made a case. Apple recently won a $1 billion judgment against Samsung in federal court in California over allegations that the South Korean firm stole Apple's design for its own mobile devices. Apple has grown wary of having such a close relationship with Samsung over the dispute. Both TSMC and Intel declined to comment, saying they don't respond to speculation. Neither Apple nor Samsung responded to requests for comment. There are several reasons that make TSMC a likely candidate to be pushing for a new fab here in New York. TSMC does not have a sophisticated enough manufacturing base in the U.S. to make the high-end chips Apple requires and, overall, it would have to increase its capacity to serve Apple's needs. In the past 12 months, Apple sold nearly 200 million iPhones and iPads. Apple has such demanding supply needs that it has in the past subsidized expansions for its suppliers to guarantee it will get the chips and other components it needs in time to meet retail demands. There also has been speculation that Apple would want to own its own fab or fabs so it could have more control over its chips, which are known as the A Series. However, a less expensive route would be to underwrite a portion of the cost of a fab – which might have a sticker price of upward of $10 billion. Google the industry-changing news : Cuomo hints Apple behind NY development pitch It is entirely proper and fitting that Apple would select the Empire State for their own A-series processor chip fab plant, right boys? It sure is.</Msg><Username>i_read_best</Username><Timestamp>1355407684543</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 09:08:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355408284169-8</Id><Title>BIG BIG NEWS, boys, about Apple and the Empire State.</Title><Msg>BIG BIG NEWS, boys, about Apple and the Empire State.

P.S I don't think of Nvidia engineering as run of the mill...but it's not earth shattering either. I do think of Nvidia as a well run business which has survived pretty big shifts in the Tech world though. Imagine the possibilities. JMHO Long Live Moores law. We get our dividend tomorrow Getanid.

Do you have imac, are you going to buy one?

Going nowhere you say? Yes boys, a going-nowhere story about a going-nowhere project. Four million dollars a year of taxpayers money to be wasted on some otherwise out-of-work nvidia engineers, to determine if faster chips are better than slower chips. If you actually bother to read the link to the whole story you will learn that, "This PERFECT Project does not plan to build hardware, rather it seeks to develop a simulation capability to measure and demonstrate progress." No actual parts to be made. Oh no no no. Just simulated parts, boys. Which makes this whole government boondoggle absolutely Perfect for nvidia engineers. 'Cause all they need to do is write some simulated spec sheets for simulated parts. "This PERFECT Project does Not plan to build hardware." If they did, they would have picked Intel Corporation, right? The U.S. Military sure would have. It also explains why this project is going nowhere. Nor is the twice posted going-nowhere story about this going-nowhere project.</Msg><Username>i_read_best</Username><Timestamp>1355457679606</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 23:01:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355458872702-44</Id><Topic><Title>Try this again - NVIDIA DARPA Contract</Title><Username>brokeagain73</Username><Timestamp>1355422898865</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 13:21:38 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Seven (7) years from now, when nvidia's engineers complete that Five (5) year paper project, Intel will swoop-in and #$%$ the multi-billion dollar contract to actually Make the teeny-tiny parts.
