I have started seeing speculation pop up on various blogs that Tegra 4 is competing for design wins in upcoming Chrome OS devices. There is some evidence in the Chromium codebase that at least one Tegra 4-powered Chrome OS device is already being tested by some developers. The codename is "puppy". Yesterday rumors broke out that Google has been designing their own Chromebook--for the first time since the CR-48. It'll supposedly feature amazing resolution (2560x1700) and will include a touch screen in a laptop/notebook form factor. It may also dual-boot Android (again, based on the Chromium codebase and the inclusion of Android libraries therein). Based on the leaked specs/functionality, Tegra 4 should be more than capable of powering such a device device. That said, the leak from yesterday says the device will be called "Pixel" -- which could be a another name for the same device, or a different device altogether (assuming for now that both devices actually exist). Strategically, I think it's very valuable to Google to have Nvidia remain a competitive supplier in the SOC space, especially since TXN has pulled out and won't be investing in supporting Google's platforms. Mediatek has an office in San Jose, but the office is apparently hard to collaborate with, since all key decisions are still run through their HQ in Taiwan, and key product discussions are still held in Mandarin. Huawei is located in Shenzen and also seems to be a difficult/unlikely partner for Google's engineers to collaborate with on a deep level. Nvidia, on the other hand, has their HQ just about 20 minutes from Google's, has hundreds of engineers working on Tegra, and has invested literally billions of dollars in R&amp;D to support the Android market over the last few years. I think Google wants to keep them around. Putting the rumors and my own conjecture together, I think we may learn in the coming months that Google and Nvidia are currently working together on bringing the first real Google-branded Chromebook to the mainstream market. This would also jive well with the rumor that Google may have given the next Nexus 7 design win to Qualcomm... they can't give Nvidia too much love, otherwise QCOM could get hurt feelings :-) To be clear, I'm not suggesting anyone buy Nvidia on the basis that the Tegra 4 *might* be powering a Google-branded Chromebook. I am arguing, however, that it would make sense for Google strategically to nurture Nvidia's efforts in the SOC space, and that there seems to be at least some evidence (in the Chromium codebase) and a growing stream of rumors that the companies are collaborating on a Chrome OS device that sounds really enticing to me as a tech-loving early adopter. I welcome arguments as to why I'm wrong about Google wanting/needing to limit Qualcomm's supplier power, and/or why Tegra 4 wouldn't be a likely candidate for one or more upcoming flagship Chrome devices.</Msg><Username>joshpritchard</Username><Timestamp>1360309449564</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 02:44:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360309692839-2</Id><Topic><Title>Nvidia Has Twice The Cash per Share That Apple Has!</Title><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1360282938040</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-07 19:22:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Think much bigger.

ZoomIn addition to reports about Google's in-house Chromebook Pixel, another interesting hint about a new Chrome OS device actually appeared in the Chromium code base on Thursday. It's code-named "puppy" and may sport Nvidia's just-announced Tegra 4 SoC. Is "puppy" and "pixel" the same device? It's possible but unknown at this point. Chrome Story originally found the "puppy" reference housed in Google's Chromium code base, reading: puppy: Add bct ebuild; This includes cfg files for generating a bct that works with T114 dalmore. Searching for the T114 Dalmore reference led the site to an article published by Phoronix. It said that Nvidia released Linux kernel patches back on December 20, 2012, supporting the Tegra 4 SoC under Linux. According to the report, the patches referred to the Tegra 4 as "Tegra 114", and the development/evaluation boards are called "Dalmore" and "Pluto" for the Cortex-A15 MP platform. Thus the Tegra support in Linux allows for a single kernel image to handle Dalmore T114, Pluto T114, and Cardhu T30 (Tegra 3 reference board). Nvidia's Tegra 4 features four ARM Cortex-A15 processor cores and 72 GeForce graphics cores. It also includes a 4G LTE modem and a new camera functionality. That said, Nvidia's Tegra 4 may be what's powering the rumored ChromeBook Pixel laptop which sports a full touchscreen display with a 2560 x 1700 resolution. It definitely makes sense. Chrome Story also points out an interesting line in the Chromium code that seemingly backs another rumor that Chrome OS and Android may soon be merging. The line in question reads: CROS_WORKON_SUBDIR="android-files". Does this mean Chrome OS will have access to Android apps? It's possible that the eventual "merge" will give users the option of installing HTML5-based apps and full-blown, locally-installed apps like 1.5 GB+ games (NOVA 3, Bard's Tale, etc.). At this point, "puppy" could be a laptop, desktop or a set-top box. But right now it's all speculation until Google shows us the real goods this June at Google I/O.</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1360343062111</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 12:04:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360344319190-40</Id><Topic><Title>NAZ up 30 pts., Dow up almost 60 and S&amp;P up almost double digits</Title><Username>rounhouse_c</Username><Timestamp>1360343350562</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 12:09:10 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>We know you have sold.

I find that odd as well at first read of the CMO thrash talking - it speaks volumes of the culture and denigrates the name of the company they represent. And today another one of their "Senior" guy - this time from their R&amp;D poo pohing the Shield... Lets recap 1) QCOM R&amp;D had to BUY / License GPU technology from AMD &amp; PowerVR 2) So much marketing NOISE/FART W8/RT - and they are late by more than 6 months! As usual they are always comparing whats available today to something in the way future like what they are doing now T4 vs S800 :). Quad Cores late by more than 6 months and their initial response - NOBODY NEEDS IT! 2) QCOM is merely touting more dubious GHz as in 5GHz Wifi - #$%$ - my DSL is only going at 3MBPS on a good day and uploading at less than 1MBPS .... and when you are in the bathroom - the $@#$ flows faster. Same thing for the Class 4 LTE 150MBPS ... for practical purposes - there is no perceptible benefit to the end user esp with costly data provisioning to start with. 3. QCOM S800 Recording QHD capaility .... sure we all need that to display on our 720p &amp; 1080p screens - esp the 5" ones! Now on the other hand I would love to get my hands on 1) Shield so my son can play his Android stuff as well as his Steam games away from his desktop and stream it to the big screen to top it. Steam has ~ 56m members! Now if Moga were to do something like that - they would still be at S1 by the time S800 is out. MOGA is merely making a dumb controller - shows how much QCOM understands the ganme market beyond angry birds. 2) HDR - Real Time (almost) High Dynamic Range photography - goes miles beyond Mega pixels - You tout QHD and Mega Pixels when you are brain dead! This makes a difference to every picture you take. Their response - nothing here - sure - where's yours?? Apple has it, NVDA has it - high end cameras all have it - QCOM NO HAVE IT! SHAMEFUL MARKETING FART RESPONSE! 3) The MHz is more than adequate and I am optimistic that the power performance is at least as good or better than what's out there. 4) T4 will be in consumer hands sooner than S800! QCOM marketing is $#!^^!%@ in their pants so they will be FARTING a lot out there - I Love it that NVDA is always leading the way - T2, T3, S/RT, HDR, Shield (NO EQUIVALENT QCOM based product for 2 years at least :) ), Chrome (ahead of QCOM).</Msg><Username>mark1289b</Username><Timestamp>1360353625366</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 15:00:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360353645718-76</Id><Title>I'm out.

Marketing just goes about doing their thing. Who cares what some Bozo thinks? 2) What WS analysts say doesn't affect the stock price. Only earnings, stock buybacks, and dividend increases do. 3) Stock Message board activity just dries up. 4) Institutional ownership approaches 100%. Not much available to day trade or short. Everyone is happy and the traders just go away. Case in point look at Microchip Tech today....Once upon a time it was one of the premier day trading blogging semiconductor stocks, but along came the dividend and stock buybacks along with small but reasonable growth with investors being rewarded. I believe Nvidia has embarked on the same path....will see at earnings next week. Just think of the power of an earnings beat, of a guide of 1% to 4% up, stock buyback, and a tiny dividend increase. Then no one will care about Qualcomm's ad campaign are what someonein the "Tech Press" says.

Have you seen a S4 PRO DirectX W8/RT ... yet.</Msg><Username>mark1289b</Username><Timestamp>1360368372106</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 19:06:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360368485204-96</Id><Topic><Title>It's Gine Viral - QCOM to Replace Nvidia in The Shield</Title><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1360354206450</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 15:10:06 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>and Motley Fool :)</Msg><Username>mark1289b</Username><Timestamp>1360368485204</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 19:08:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360369086223-97</Id><Topic><Title>Qualcomm shows little interest in making Project SHIELD-like device</Title><Username>mark1289b</Username><Timestamp>1360368372106</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 19:06:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Project Shield will sell like a good Performance GPU Card. Around 250K to 350K a quarter but at BOM cost of under $150 and a price of say $299 the profits will have a much higher impact. I look at it as a very significant Gamer Add-ON. Of the course the Tech Press will say pooh it didn't sell 10M units a year. The Tie in with Nvidia Kepler cards only will be worth another 3 or 4 percentage points in the GPU Market Share over AMD. Note: This is running at $1B a quarter today. It also keeps the core of Nvidia from being affected by new console launches from Microsoft and Playstation. The neat things is it didn't hardly cost a thing to create and sell. Ad budget---Two YouTube videos a week. How much do those cost? And Already Qualcomm is attacking.

That number represents a healthy 100% growth spurt during the past 3 months. In January 2012 Florida was among the first school districts to move their curriculum to the web, and in turn adopt Chromebooks as a teaching tool. Last week during FETC 2013 — Florida’s annual Technology in Education Conference — educators explained that this shift had a positive impact with three important advantages: “enabling tech support internships, allowing homebound students to collaborate remotely, and teaching students to become digital leaders.” Why are Chromebooks penetrating school systems at this brisk pace? Price is one motivator. With 5 Chromebook models currently available including Acer’s bargain $199 C7, there are viable options for any budget. Google estimates that schools can save an average $4000 per deployed device over three years of ownership. This is partially attributed to lower IT department expenses, as Chrome OS is seamlessly and automatically updated. Web-based management consoles reduce the time it takes admins to deploy changes to users and apps across multiple classrooms. Perhaps the most appealing draw is the security of Chromebooks. When Chromebooks boot up they perform a self-check to ensure no tampering has occurred, and there’s no need for spyware or anti-virus tools. Google’s Chrome OS relies on the company’s existing suite of cloud-based services like Gmail and Google Docs, in addition to many educational apps in the Chrome Web Store. None of these need to be traditionally “installed” and since they don’t run locally, Chromebooks can boot up in under 10 seconds thanks to the lightweight OS. Add in 100GB of cloud storage on Google Drive, and the advantages begin to outweigh those of PCs and even iPads. Chromebooks aren’t just excelling in schools, either. Acer‘s CEO recently revealed that they’ve sold more Chromebooks than Windows 8 devices in the U.S., and now Lenovo is applying their durable ThinkPad branding to a new Chromebook model which gets deployed exclusively to institutions later this month. Are Chromebooks a threat in the consumer market? Not yet, but their budget pricing, growth in the education system, and ease of use will cause a notable uptick in mindshare and word of mouth in years to come. forbesDOTcom/sites/jasonevangelho/2013/02/02/google-in-education-chromebooks-now-embraced-by-more-than-2000-schools/</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1360374381518</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 20:46:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360374384161-103</Id><Topic><Title>Look for Nvidia to miss estimates and give poor guidance</Title><Username>swims48184</Username><Timestamp>1360369110610</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 19:18:30 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I don't think you have any clue.

Plus it will take a little more gamer GPU share from AMD. Remember Nvidia operates under the law of SMALL numbers.....Not Large Numbers as QCOM and Apple. 250K to 350K units sold per quarter to Nvidia gamers is big bucks in the land of Small Numbers. Say 10% of yearly profits. P.S. When you hear about Playstation 4 at launch streaming PS3 games to PS4 remember that the Gaming streaming service they bought Gaikai uses Nvidia Grid GPUs and it won't work without them so forget about AMD taking the slot. Anand C. of QCOM will probably do a video on it thought. LOL Oh I can hear it Now....."Nvidia the Netflex of Gamings".....CNBC fast money boys will be all over it.

The blunt truth is that: Qualcomm doesn't yet have what it takes to make a laptop or laptop-like (such as Chromebook) devices. The technical entry barriers for PC/tablets/chromebooks are higher for Qualcomm in comparison with the entry barriers for smartphones. NVIDIA has penetrated the smartphone space - it just needs to catch up to Qualcomm's 25 years lead in this arena.

Why push hard on Qualcomm in super phones right away...just poke them a little here or there setting up for 2014. If I was a betting man I would bet they are tracking Tegra 4 wins (20,000 units or 5M units each the same) just as they tracked Ivy Bridge notebook wins all being are equal. It worked last year in Ivy Bridge notebooks so why not in phones? It's what you do when you come from a PC background. Mucho small wins are better than a few big wins. Higher gross margin and operating profit when you consider that Nvidia is a NO LAYOFF company and has immense broad based talent in their employees. Put's them all to work.

With NVIDIA trading at $12.34, as of close 2/6/2013, a share and likely to go lower if the Google rumors prove to be true, this may be close to the ideal buying time. Remember buying low, selling high, is the name of the game. If you happen to already hold a significant stake in NVIDIA then I would be inclined to hold at this point, as the stock is not likely to break the $10 range. With an annual yield of 2.43% you can earn some interest while waiting for the stock to blossom, which it is likely to do within 5 years.</Msg><Username>jasonanname</Username><Timestamp>1360379656544</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 22:14:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360381873961-113</Id><Topic><Title>Fools say going to $10 before it blossoms in 5 #$%$ years!</Title><Username>jasonanname</Username><Timestamp>1360379656544</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 22:14:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wait for earnings report before making a decision.
