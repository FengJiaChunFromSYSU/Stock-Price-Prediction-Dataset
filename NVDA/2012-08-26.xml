First you mention Icera not Tegra. Since you can't back up your lies about Tegra you switch to Icera. Goodwill also has nothing to do with weather a division is profitable it is just the premium paid over net assets acquired. And all Nvidia has stated is that the goodwill from the acquisition of Icera should be allocated to their Consumer Products Business. Oh and Nvidia bought Icera at a bargain price of $367 million since the company was expecting an IPO in the $600 million to $1 billion range in 2010. Quote: Fortunately, companies with 550-plus patents in wireless technology do still have a decent market value, especially to ambitious mobile chip companies with no wireless to speak of and a bank account bulging from a recent legal knock-out against Intel. The $367 million shelled out by Nvidia seems a fair price, especially since they'll also get some good engineers, some decent designs and a bit more respect in the Far East. But it's a long way from a billion dollar payday. VCs don't normally aim for 'a fair price' when it comes to collect their winnings; a company that turns $260 million to $367 million over eight years, and that probably at gunpoint from the bankers, is not really what they sign up for. Especially given the state of the market: there simply aren't many Nvidias out there, and next year might have been too late. http://www.zdnet.com/nvidias-icera-deal-hides-bleak-outlook-for-eu-wireless-4010022411/</Msg><Username>salemthecat100</Username><Timestamp>1345992543000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 10:49:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345993785000-28</Id><Topic><Title>Why nvidia tegra line loses money</Title><Username>chrisssable</Username><Timestamp>1345825195000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 12:19:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>" Nvidia with its Gpu specialty is in great position" add 64-bit CPU specialty... 2014 but don't tell whosunw... it's a static world... and nothing can possibly grow or change...</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1345993785000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 11:09:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345994171000-29</Id><Topic><Title>Why nvidia tegra line loses money</Title><Username>chrisssable</Username><Timestamp>1345825195000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 12:19:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Don't blame whosunw, not her fault.

Now if you were on a tablet - you would be doing serious stuff like Microsoft Office, real MAN DX11 games etc. S4 Pro is way overpriced that's why no Tablet manufacturer would want to take the risk of launching an S4 Pro tablet besides DX11 issues for WnRT. A phone manufacturer can build and sell a T3 phone for 1999 Yuan and be profitable - an S4 Pro selling at Y1999 is below costs according to the manufacturer - so, not sure how that works without heavy subsidies by the telco. With tablets where there are no subsidies - the S4 is way overpriced. To be sure we understand this - the T3 is 5X better performance than the T2 but a T3 tablet is cheaper than the old T2 tablets - the QCOM S4 is not 5X the performance of the T3 but it probably cost almost 5X that of the T3.

Thirteen (13) to be exact. And all but one have those teeny-tiny integrated Qualcomm radios -- that nvidia has been incapable of making -- right there on the same tiny piece of silicon that the Qualcomm designed quad processors are on. Take a look at all the amazing Qualcomm S4s, boys. Scroll all the way down to long list that says "Snapdragon S4" at the bottom. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapdragon_(system_on_chip) "Compared to System on chips from many competitors [like nvidia], Snapdragon SoCs have been unique in that they have had the modem for cellular communication on-die. That is, they do not require a separate external modem on the PCB. Since Snapdragon S4, the majority of S4 SoCs also features on-die WiFi, GPS/GLONASS and Bluetooth. This integration reduces the complexity and cost of the final design for the OEM. It also has the advantage of benefiting from advancements made in the manufacturing process, for example 28 nm in most S4 SoCs, thus providing modems and other dedicated circuitry with lower power characteristics than external chips [like Icera's] manufactured with older [40nm] processes. Wow! And just look at this boys! The Snapdragon S4's work just fine with Windows 8 too. "The Adreno 225 GPU in Snapdragon S4 SoCs adds support for DirectX 9.3 which makes it compatible with Microsoft Windows 8." Too bad nvidia doesn't have any 28 Nanometer Tegras, right boys? Tegras processors all have those clunky old 40 nanometer pathways. That suck juice like an Elephant, don't u know. Nor does nvidia make any Tegras with integrated radios. Like those Swiss Army Knife S4 Snapdragons. Maybe two or three years, right boys. Maybe -- just maybe -- nvidia can get to where Qualcomm is in 2012. Of course, Qualcomm will be miles down the road by then in mobile chip designs. It kinda looks like the Wile E. Coyote and the Roadrunner, right boys? nvidia will never catch Qualcomm. Nope. Jen will just have a plate of uneaten ACME bird seed.
