Jacobs, Chairman of Qualcomm</Title><Msg>CES Preshow Keynote Address from Dr. Paul E. Jacobs, Qualcomm Inc.Chairman and CEO In The Venetian, Palazzo Ballroom , January 7, 2013, 6:30-7:30 p.m. Dr. Paul E. Jacobs, chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) of Qualcomm Incorporated, will deliver THE Preshow Keynote Address at the 2013 International CES. Dr Jacob's keynote will highlight Qualcomm’s “Born Mobile” theme that addresses mobile technology’s role in the world. Thanks to anywhere, anytime communication, mobile technology brings people together and is enabling a powerfully connected future, a future that is now. Mobile has become an integral part of consumers' daily lives, and it will continue to transform the way individuals and communities interact with one another and the world around them. “Dr. Jacobs heads a global company with transformative technologies connecting people not only to each other, but to the future,” said Gary Shapiro, president and CEO, CEA. “Qualcomm has mobile computing in its DNA, and we look forward to hearing Dr. Jacobs explore the promise of a world of complete interconnectivity – a world that exists today, and his vision of a connected future for both the generation born with a tablet in hand, and the rest of us who are becoming more mobile each day. This keynote demonstrates the crucial role that Qualcomm's mobile technologies have at the International CES and increasingly throughout the world.” As a key architect of Qualcomm’s strategic vision, Dr. Jacobs’ responsibilities include leadership and oversight of all the company’s initiatives and operations. Through his technology innovations and advocacy, Dr. Jacobs has spearheaded Qualcomm’s efforts to develop and commercialize mobile technology breakthroughs that have contributed significantly to the growth of the company and the industry. Important developments which began under Dr. Jacobs include: the first smartphone based on Palm OS®; inclusion of GPS capabilities in mobile phones; the Brew® system, which enables over-the-air downloading of applications and the world’s first mobile app store; and Snapdragon processors, which have seen extraordinary growth and innovation and powered hundreds of devices worldwide during his tenure. Following the completion of his Ph.D. in 1989 and a year as a post-doctoral researcher at a French government lab in Toulouse, Dr. Jacobs joined Qualcomm full time in 1990 as a development engineer leading the mobile phone digital signal processor software team. Five years later, Dr. Jacobs became vice president and general manager of the combined handset and integrated circuit division, which was subsequently divided into Qualcomm Consumer Products (QCP) and Qualcomm CDMA Technologies, respectively. Dr. Jacobs became CEO in July 2005 and was appointed Chairman in 2009. As an Innovativ Leader of a broad range of technical teams within Qualcomm, Dr. Jacobs has been granted more than 40 patents for his inventions in the areas of wireless technology and devices. Dr. Jacobs is chairman of the U.S.-Korea Business Council and chair of the Advisory Board of the University of California, Berkeley, College of Engineering; trustee of the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego; and a member of the US-India CEO Forum and the Young President’s Organization."

If you read many of the articles they have all the wrong companies buying NVIDIA for all the wrong reasons. If these guys were to be acquired it would make more business sense that it would be a company like MSFT or even GOOG. Their core competencies fill in a lot of the missing pieces of the puzzle and align well with their overall enterprise and consumer strategies. Not to mention MSFT is struggling with technical leadership and Ballmer is on thin ice so it wouldn't be too far gone to see Balmer booted and Jen offered the position .</Msg><Username>brokeagain73</Username><Timestamp>1356624061457</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 11:01:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356625032986-19</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft</Title><Username>johndeborah</Username><Timestamp>1356620612553</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 10:03:32 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Marketing hasn't been the problem, price has been the problem.

Hmm do you think the macro economic conditions have anything to do with that - a fabricated bearish scenario all levied by incompetents and the fiscal cliff? I just can't wait to hear how you spin the 180 that you'll undoubtedly be spewing on an up swing. Stocks down on weak volume mean almost nothing and typically fall far off the regression line. I will be adding to my position sub 12 and selling covered calls to ratchet down my cost basis some more. There is less risk and way more upside than trying to switch positions going long then going short which I still say is very risky.I just don't get the mentality of the short term trader, trying to compete HFT to determine price movement seems futile...</Msg><Username>brokeagain73</Username><Timestamp>1356629968398</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 12:39:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356630215270-23</Id><Topic><Title>Why weak stocks fade but never rally with market</Title><Username>o.investor</Username><Timestamp>1356628160051</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 12:09:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Oh... and BTW QCOMM along with most other tech is down by as much as well - am I to infer, by your standards, that QCOMM is a weak stock as well?</Msg><Username>brokeagain73</Username><Timestamp>1356630215270</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 12:43:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356631008965-24</Id><Topic><Title>Why weak stocks fade but never rally with market</Title><Username>o.investor</Username><Timestamp>1356628160051</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 12:09:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>QCOM is near 52-week high, NVDA is a buck away from new 52-week low so levels do matter.

But this is usually when Nvidia is near year highs in anticipation of CES, MWC etc. I think the market is sensing a shift or, maybe Nvidia management has lost credibility by over promising and under delivering one too many times. Forget about HFT - that is meaningless when you are looking at technicals. HFT doesn't take inventory but adds liquidity. In effect it accentuates direction when you look at 5-day or, 3-month chart. You can't honestly tell me that you are not nervous of further downside given the stock pattern. If I was new to Nvidia - I would say, wow look how underpriced the stock is. Great trailing growth, low PE, dividend, lots of cash. But I know better and I am skeptical. I am not putting a monster short bet against Nvidia. I am only playing it for short term till things are clearer and the stock shows some spine. Questions for longs to ponder: - How is the Icera acquisition working out? This was central to Nvidia master plan to counter Qualcomm and Mediatek. But we have not even seen i500 LTE yet. Grey will only be adopted by market after i500 has been validated in key markets as a standalone modem. This tells me that Grey is now a no-show (revenue wise) in 2013. So no smartphone's for Nvidia (yeah ok zte mimosa notwithstanding) in 2013. If Icera is a bust - would this doom the CPB business? - Why did Mike Rayfield leave for Micron when his Business Unit was growing 50% Y/Y? hmm... very unusual - Project Denver oh it was only 2 years ago when the drums were being beaten so loud about Nvidia taking over server, HPC, cloud, PC - you name it, uh oh - no show so far. - PC GPU segment, how bad will things get? this is still bread and butter for Nvidia Intel and AMD will eventually wipe Nvidia out in this segment.

Political and economic uncertainty will cause trends to be broken (temporarily). It's disingenious to apply a secular trend to one company or stock while putting blinders to the bigger picture. Mobile is growing at an astronomical rate and yet QCOM whom sits on top of that food chain right now is falling well off it's 52 week high and showing weakness into the same up cycle (CES). 2. I don't believe HFT accentuates direction but in effect disrupts it and adds noise, because you don't know all the variables in the algorithm so you can't predict how sensitive they will be in either direction - flash crash a good enough piece of evidence for my case? As I said over a longer term (30 -90 days) you can identify direction via regression but less than that is futile. 3. Am I nervous - I am a bit nervous about all my long positions but I try to take precautions to minimize them - covered calls and buying puts are one way during uncertainty. There is still more upside, I believe, using this strategy than going short then long than long again. It wasn't too long ago that you seemed to be delivering positive speak about NVIDIA, am I not correct? 4. Skeptical? Sure but you know better? Why? 5.". Grey will only be adopted by market after i500 has been validated in key markets as a standalone modem. " Says who? There is no protocol (unless I missed something) that dictates that. Even so it can be billed and sold as a package (which is important for product wins) and generate revenue and possibly add to the mobile margins. 6. If Icera is a bust? It would not be a positive but there would have to be some severe technical headwinds in order for that to happen IMO - I think the delay is in part to assure that is minimized. Could manufactures decide that it is too risk? Sure but in industry of the latest and greates, fastes and bestest trumps all risk - I just don't see that happening. This industry is filled with risk takers and is fueled by a contrarian subculture. Differentiation is a highly sought after commodity in an industry riddled with cut throat competition. 7. I can't speak to Mike's departure - but I can spin that one of 2 ways. A. he seen the writing on the wall. B. He wasn't growing tegra fastest enough, he was blamed for the delays to market and general disagreement other execs. 8. Project Denver? Again it's hard to really speak to this as much of this was cloaked in mystery and nebulous to begin with. I do know that they are still pushing forward with what ever it is and ARE AHEAD of all the other potential contenders in this arena - including INTEL. 9. I think your distortion of truth is a bit too apparent here. Intel hasn't taken market share yet and NVIDIA is eating AMD like a Great White feasts on seals. I don't know how you can dispute the market sure numbers and hence support this claim. NVIDIA is growing it's GPU business and AMD is on the verge of bankruptcy WITH no source of cash other than it's largest share holder...no risk there, huh? No upside to NVIDIA here when they finally exit in a fire sale, right? Finally - I do agree with some of your points as they pertain to risk but that comes with most investments especially when you invest in a company embattled in a secular decline. However, NVIDIA's management, for much of it's fault, has had some of the best technical leadership and execution in this industry as well as others for that matter. They were smart enough to see the writing on the wall in order to diversify out of win-tel/desktops. Started transitioning and overhauling the company to compete in the mobile space bolstering it's key competencies it has established and learned in the PC industry. Is visionary enough to see the potential for high powered focused hardware for the cloud as restrictive tablet hardware but increase consumer expectation to have all the productivity they had on their laptop be available on their mobile devices - so why not move the gap in computing power to the cloud, right? I think that is a decent track record for management, wouldn't you agree?

And as a Gamer I am always looking forward to the next power efficient discrete GPU architecture. I probably buy a new GPU every year or every second year. The previous GPU is used in the chain of older machines at home. Usually gamers who can afford it will not let the equipment be a reason for performing less well competing against others. For the professional market Quadro and Tesla simulations are required for an efficient work day. The higher ppi displays demand better designed visuals and end products are simulated for potential flaws and efficiency optimisations (air flow for cars ect.). The HPC market is almost a no-brainer and now Intel validates the accellerator philosophy of Nvidia's and help mature and expand the markets.

I have little experience in this arena so I can't speak to how cautious carries are. Again, this still doesn't preclude them from packaging the 500 or 450 modem, as I said before to gain product wins and publicity. 2. Where did you get those numbers tablets are projected to be close to 160 million? - a good portion of the increase going to non iOS tablets. As for smart phones the number is less relevant as any market share is positive for NVIDIA and if Icera+Wayne or Grey makes it to market this will only compound the growth. I see no reason thus far to believe Icera won't be making it's way into more smart phones in 2013. 3. Overachieved - why? Even so I can't think of any reason why, considering tablet growth, they couldn't repeat. 4. You can call it a novelty but even if that were true the perception is 4 is better than 2 and perception is reality. Also, comparing snapdragon and A6 to T3 is comparing apples to oranges architecturally. If it were a novelty so to speak why is QCOM both creating a 4 core version of snapdragon? I can tell you in part it is do to consumer demand and the belief that as software progresses that those 2 extra cores will be needed and nobody wants to be left behind - we saw the same trend in desktops. I also think the T4 is designed to allow NVIDIA to scale up so to speak and -they clearly have a vision of providing products up and down the entire tech pipeline, with similar technology. 5. Pun well taken. I have no way of knowing and unless you have insider info I simply can't agree with something that is essentially an opinion. I can spin the radio silence positively. 6. I agree in part. However, I think there is still a lot of confusion about NVIDIA and what markets they are in. I think for the most part they are being brushed off as a mobile player and nobody seems to realize the benefit or possible benefit their server market has to the bottom line.</Msg><Username>brokeagain73</Username><Timestamp>1356659106667</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 20:45:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356660394531-50</Id><Topic><Title>Easy short above 12.20</Title><Username>o.investor</Username><Timestamp>1356641311091</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 15:48:31 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>'8.

You cannot be uninformed of details on the one hand and then still be sure of the outcome on the other, this is a logically inconsistent position bordering on blind hope. The fact that Nvidia also has admitted that it will not be used for general purpose servers is a tacit admission that its integer performance will fall short of x86 Core processors just like all the other ARM chips. However ARM chips are generally much closer to x86 in floating point so the fact that Nvidia is going to concentrate on this is not a bad thing IMO as a few per cent of a 10% market is better than zilch of a 90% market.

To be fair - Windows RT does not exploit 4+1 architecture (ninja core is unused). Also, T4 will be 28nm as opposed to 40nm T3. Not sure about power consideration for new GPU in T4 though. To me its rather pathetic how Intel is now reduced to this. Going to bloggers to prove their superiority. Btw, T3 is $20 - how much for precious Atom? Anandtech is a pro Qualcomm shop and its a symbiotic relationship where they are leaked early products from QCOM also.

The Genuine Intel 32nm Atom/Clover Trail clearly trounces nvidia's best 40nm tegra 3. And Trounces it Badly. Let's take a look at a few excerpts from the AnandTech benchmarks, shall we? "To kick off what is bound to be an exciting year, Intel made a couple of stops around the country showing off that even its existing architectures are quite power efficient. Intel carried around a pair of Windows tablets, wired up to measure power consumption at both the device and component level, to demonstrate what many of you will find obvious at this point: that Intel's 32nm Clover Trail is more power efficient than NVIDIA's Tegra 3. We've demonstrated this in our battery life tests already. Samsung's ATIV Smart PC uses an Atom Z2760 and features a 30Wh battery with an 11.6-inch 1366x768 display. Microsoft's Surface RT uses NVIDIA's Tegra 3 powered by a 31Wh battery with a 10.6-inch, 1366x768 display. In our 2013 wireless web browsing battery life test we showed Samsung with a 17% battery life advantage, despite the 3% smaller battery. For us, the power advantage made a lot of sense. We've already proven that Intel's Atom core is faster than ARM's Cortex A9 (even four of them under Windows RT). Combine that with the fact that NVIDIA's Tegra 3 features four Cortex A9s on TSMC's 40nm G process and you get a recipe for worse battery life, all else being equal. First up is total platform power consumption: [The Tegra 3 powered] Surface RT has higher idle power, around 28% on average, compared to Acer's [Intel Atom/Clover Trail powered] W510. Here the Atom Z2760 cores average 36.4mW at idle compared to 70.2mW for Tegra 3. The power savings are around 47.8mW (average) for the W510 in airplane mode when fully idle. Advantages in idle power consumption are key to delivering good battery life overall. Peak power consumption for the entire [Intel Atom/Clover Trail powered] tablet tops out at just over 5W compared to 8W for [the nvidia Tegra 3] Surface RT. The difference in average CPU power consumption is significant. Tegra 3 pulls around 1.29W on average compared to 0.48W for Atom. Atom also finishes the boot process quicker, which helps it get to sleep quicker and also contributes to improved power consumption. GPU power is a big contributor as well with Tegra 3 averaging 0.80W and Atom pulling down 0.22W. Now the fun stuff. We already know that Intel completes SunSpider quicker, thanks to its improved memory subsystem over the Cortex A9, but it also does so with much better average power (3.70W vs. 4.77W). A big part of the average power savings comes courtesy of what happens at the very tail end of this graph where the W510 is able to race to sleep quicker, and thus saves a good deal of power. NVIDIA's GPU power consumption is more than double the PowerVR SGX 545's here, while its performance advantage isn't anywhere near double. I have heard that Imagination has been building the most power efficient GPUs on the market for quite a while now, this might be the first argument in favor of that heresay. Final Words Ultimately I don't know that this data really changes what we already knew about Clover Trail: it is a more power efficient platform than NVIDIA's Tegra 3. Across the board Intel manages a huge advantage over NVIDIA's Tegra 3. Again, this shouldn't be a surprise. Intel's 32nm SoC process offers a big advantage over TSMC's 40nm G used for NVIDIA's Cortex A9 cores (the rest of the SoC is built on LP, the whole chip uses TSMC's 40nm LPG), and there are also the architectural advantages that Atom offers over ARM's Cortex A9. Keeping in mind that this isn't Intel's best foot forward either, the coming years ahead should provide for some entertaining competition. In less than a year Intel will be shipping its first 22nm Atom in tablets. Clover Trail has the CPU performance I want from a tablet today, but I want Apple, Google or Microsoft to use it. Now Intel just needs an iPad and a Nexus win." Pretty much confirms what OEM's and Wall Street already knew, right? It sure does. That nvidia parts suck juice like an Elephant.</Msg><Username>bestonica</Username><Timestamp>1356669393536</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 23:36:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
