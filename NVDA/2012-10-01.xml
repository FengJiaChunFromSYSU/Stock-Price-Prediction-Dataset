Of course pricing will be key -- but I expect it'll be a positive catalyst for Nvidia if it turns out that Microsoft has a penetration pricing strategy with the Surface RT. Then there's Q3 earnings in expected to be reported in the second week of November. We'll see if management was accurate with their raised forecasts for Q3 and whether they also guide up for Q4. I believe FY2013 (the current calendar year) is on pace to a record year for Nvidia in terms of revenue, which is a strong attestation to the argument that their business is decoupled from the trends in the broader PC market.</Msg><Username>thetrade50</Username><Timestamp>1349139321509</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 20:55:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349139743871-54</Id><Topic><Title>this high PE is not justified</Title><Username>mystk7</Username><Timestamp>1349122756266</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 16:19:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"There's $5.29 in cash per share."

Both are members of the Snapdragon S4 Play processor tier, optimized specifically for smartphone users. Snapdragon S4 Play processors will now offer OEMs both dual-core and quad-core CPUs and performance for entry-level smartphones, with the more advanced version featuring higher bus bandwidth, larger screen resolution support, HD video and enhanced user experiences, according to the vendor. Both processors will be ready for customer sampling by end of 2012 and are expected to be shipping in commercial devices in the first quarter of 2013. The MSM8225Q and MSM8625Q processors incorporate quad-core CPUs and are the upgraded software compatible variants of the Snapdragon S4 Play MSM8225 and MSM8625 processors, which both feature dual-core CPUs and dual SIM support. The quad-core variants will support LPDDR2 memory, increasing the bus bandwidth for improved features such as 720p display and 720p video encode and decode. Snapdragon S4 Play MSM8625Q features Qualcomm's integrated multimode UMTS/CDMA modem, and the MSM8225Q has an integrated UMTS modem. Both processors enable Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.0 and FM connectivity using the Qualcomm Atheros AR6005 and WCN2243 chips, the company said. In addition, Qualcomm also announced a single platform, the Snapdragon S4 Plus MSM8930, that supports all China operators with UMTS, CDMA and TD-SCDMA. Furthermore, this single platform will support LTE -TDD and TD-SCDMA, targeting mid-tier smartphones for use in China. Announced in February 2011, this processor features dual-core CPUs and as a single-chip solution with an integrated LTE modem, it is designed to take LTE to high-volume smartphones. Snapdragon S4 Plus MSM8930 with LTE-TDD and TD-SCDMA support will be ready for customer sampling by the end of 2012 and is expected to be shipping in commercial devices by the first quarter of 2013, Qualcomm said. Qualcomm will also be releasing Qualcomm Reference Design (QRD) versions of all three processors. The QRD program includes handset development platforms and an ecosystem program providing access to third-party providers of tested and verified hardware and software components so customers can deliver differentiated smartphones to consumers, the firm said. The Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and FM connectivity technologies have been pre-validated and tested with the QRD platform to provide reduced time-to-market. There have been more than 50 public QRD-based product launches to date in collaboration with more than 40 OEMs, and there are 100 designs in progress, including QRD-based smartphones enabled by these new Snapdragon S4 Play and Plus processors, which are also expected to be available by the first quarter of 2013, it said. The new Snapdragon S4 Play and Plus processors are designed specifically for High-Volume smartphones, and they provide device manufacturers the ability to migrate their existing Snapdragon S1-based designs to S4 dual- and quad-core CPU-based designs." In separate news, phones powered by the icera/nvidia LTE integrated Grey chip might not even be available until the End of 2013.</Msg><Username>it_is_best</Username><Timestamp>1349144627478</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 22:23:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>30</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349145229776-60</Id><Topic><Title>Qualcomm introduces three (3) more quad-core Snapdragon S4's with integrated radios.</Title><Username>it_is_best</Username><Timestamp>1349144627478</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 22:23:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So Best?

That elusive question was, if the Qualcomm designed radio is good enough for the Genuine Apple iPhone 5 -- The Fastest Selling Electronic Device in the History of Mankind -- will it be good enough for mid-tier smartphones in China? THAT is the elusive question that I was trying to ask before. If so, why, it'll sell like hotcakes. Yes boys -- Hotcakes.</Msg><Username>ask.best</Username><Timestamp>1349147587268</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 23:13:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>11</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349149355621-64</Id><Topic><Title>Nexus 7 Sales Volume: Estimate Based on Supply Chain Data</Title><Username>lifesuckswhenstocksaredown</Username><Timestamp>1349142750015</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 21:52:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>More sales of Tegra 3 CPUs does not translate to better margins. As a matter of fact, Tegra margins are below average. Most of NVDA's profit seems to come from Intel royalty payments which will go away after three years. NVDA has a good chance to buy out AMD for less than $2.5B, and should do so to get more competitive against Intel.</Msg><Username>bhttsl</Username><Timestamp>1349149355621</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 23:42:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message></Date>
