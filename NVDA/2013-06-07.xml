(Some gimmicks, yes, but no substantial upgrade in substance). Samsung runs the danger of putting its products for the sheer purpose of making money - like Apple, a badaSS capitalist - and the Galaxy line of phones and tablets are getting less illuminating by generations. Samsung still sells by aggressive marketing and relies on its legacy, but things could change quickly in the competitive landscape - Samsung Galaxy Note 3 will run on S800, good luck there considering the competition of HP Slatebook x2, ASUS transformer pad infiinity etc....just one of the numerous examples. Note that Samsung's much touted Nexus 10 has been lack-luster in terms of consumer acceptance, as compared to the wildly populy N7.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1370632471126</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 15:14:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370633509809-12</Id><Title>Bloomberg: Samsung falls after JPMorgan cuts Galaxy S4 estimates</Title><Msg>Now the web chatter have been substantiated. bloombergDOTcom/news/2013-06-07/samsung-falls-after-jpmorgan-cuts-estimates-on-s4-seoul-mover.html</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1370633509809</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 15:31:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370634449278-13</Id><Topic><Title>Bloomberg: Samsung falls after JPMorgan cuts Galaxy S4 estimates</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1370633509809</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 15:31:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Another article: "Will chatter around Samsung S4 shipments #$%$ component suppliers" Answer: yes, it has. vestopediaDOTcom/stock-analysis/060713/will-chatter-around-samsung-shipments-#$%$-components-stocks-qcom-brcm-panl-swks-aapl.aspx?partner=YahooSA S4 25% reduced S3 50% reduced Good luck, holders of BRCM and QCOM</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1370634449278</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 15:47:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370634786194-14</Id><Title>option buyers get fffed again</Title><Msg>Don't try this at home.</Msg><Username>nvdarocks</Username><Timestamp>1370634786194</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 15:53:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370634973462-15</Id><Topic><Title>QCOM declined significantly on leaked information</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1370626713942</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 13:38:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Typo/omission: It should read "putting out its products..."</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1370634973462</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 15:56:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370636120625-16</Id><Topic><Title>Bloomberg: Samsung falls after JPMorgan cuts Galaxy S4 estimates</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1370633509809</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 15:31:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The whole point of posting Samsung S4 information is that, at some point in the future, if Samsung feels its products are vulnerable due to lack of innovation, Sammy will be smart enough to come back to NVIDIA as a customer and partner.

The sooner the better.' What unique innovation can Nvidia provide that others can't ? If Nvidia had bothered to update Tegra 3 on 28nm like it once said it would on slides it might have had a good chance of stopping the Samsung Galaxy Tab win of Clovertrail+ but now there is a long time gap until Tegra 4i can compete for low power low price slots. The Tegra team is not good at anticipating future competition and designing their skus accordingly which is probably why the heads of that dept keep getting fired.</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1370637148752</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 16:32:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370637976428-18</Id><Topic><Title>Bloomberg: Samsung falls after JPMorgan cuts Galaxy S4 estimates</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1370633509809</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 15:31:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Look up all the innovative features associated with Tegra 4, not Tegra 3.

Piper Jaffray analyst Auguste Gus Richard, who has been critical of Intel's business model and mobile prospects, cut his estimates, rating, and price target on the company's shares. The big problem: The PC market forecast as well as ARM, which will at the very least ensure Intel makes little money on the mobile front. Intel's Haswell and Silvermont platforms are promising, but only go so far. Richard said: We are lowering our PC forecast (down 6.9 percent in 2013 from down 2.9 percent) and believe current demand is channel fill. Tablets and smartphones, other components and capabilities (displays, cameras, apps etc.) are taking attention and dollars away from the CPU. Additionally, an army of ARM-based suppliers have come to market commoditizing the processor market. Leading smartphone and tablet vendors are also using internally-designed ARM-based CPUs and now low-end CPUs are available for as little as $4. Richard noted Intel's Silvermont platform, a new Atom architecture aimed at ARM, will hurt Haswell more than it does ARM. Overall, Intel will see lower profit margins. Richard noted: Richard noted Intel's Silvermont platform, a new Atom architecture aimed at ARM, will hurt Haswell more than it does ARM. Overall, Intel will see lower profit margins. Richard noted: Haswell will no doubt improve battery life and Windows Blue or 8.1 will be an improvement over Windows 8. We don't think it is enough though. These efforts are likely to be too late in the year to drive real growth in PCs in CY13 or 1H:14. We expect to continue to see tablets taking shares from notebooks with the desktop market remaining stagnate. While Intel will gain a toehold in the tablet market with Silvermont, it is likely at the expense of notebook sales.

Virtually all the so called PC decline recently though can be attributed to netbooks going out of fashion and as they really were a tablet form factor all along should not have been lumped in with the PC category in the first place. Silvermont will have no effect on Haswell as those who want high performing processors will continue to buy them and those who want high endurance processors will continue to buy them. There are 2 Haswells which have a 11.5W TDP and 6w SDP which will kill Tegra 4s as will quad-core Baytrails, users will be spoiled for choice which ARM-crushing x86 processor they can buy and each will equally add to Intel's bottom line as it is only the old 32nm Atoms which are being given away to get marketshare.</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1370644638334</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 18:37:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370644747903-23</Id><Topic><Title>Exhanged more NVDA into AGNC</Title><Username>followon</Username><Timestamp>1370569270425</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 21:41:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>but AGNC had a very ugly 1Q report.
