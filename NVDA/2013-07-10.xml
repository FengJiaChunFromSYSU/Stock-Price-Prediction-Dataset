(AAPL) and Samsung Electronics Co. in the world’s biggest market. The Beijing-based company will sell 15 million handsets this year, Chief Executive Officer Lei Jun told reporters yesterday in Chengdu, where he’s attending the Fortune Global Forum. Lei is a co-founder of Xiaomi and also chairman of software developer Kingsoft Corp. Xiaomi sold 7.2 million handsets last year, making it one of the fastest-growing makers in China, with smartphones selling for half the price of models from Apple and Samsung, the world’s largest vendors. Xiaomi’s smartphone share in China was 2.6 percent in the first quarter, compared with Samsung’s 17.7 percent and iPhone’s 9.7 percent, according to Gartner Inc.... _____ NVIDIA has found itself a top-tier handset partner in Xiaomi. Prior to this year, all Xiaomi phones deployed Qualcomm app SoCs, this is another piece of evidence that NV is beginning to eat QC's launch. Previous Xiaomi phones have seen quick sell-offs within days - almost without exception.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1373430963883</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-10 00:36:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373433875782-3</Id><Title>ZTE just received network license for U998S, launch is imminent</Title><Msg>SOURCE: GizChina, July 2013 "Chinese phone giant ZTE have just received its network license for the ZTE U988S, a phone rumoured to be powered by a 1.8Ghz Tegra 4 quad-core processor, pack a 5-inch 1080 display, 2GB RAM and cost just 1999 Yuan ($320)!" _____ Google "Tegra 4 powered ZTE U988S receives Network License, will rival Xiaomi Mi3!" to access original article.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1373433875782</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-10 01:24:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373440859651-4</Id><Title>Sero 7 Pro = Nexus 7 + microSD + 5MP rear camera for $150</Title><Msg>Source: tablet-news - Written by Radu Iorga This tablet packs 1 GB of RAM, a 7 inch 1280 x 800 pixel display, Android 4.2.1 Jelly Bean as the OS and a 1.2 GHz Nvidia Tegra 3 quad core CPU inside.

The graphics chip company, which traditionally has made its own chips, announced recently that it would begin to license its graphics technology to other companies. This is a dramatic change in the company's business model and could result in significant streams of high-margin revenue. What will be a game changer, however, is NVIDIA's decision to begin licensing its technology. This comes as the Tegra line has faced intense competition from Qualcomm, and the fact that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) designs its own chips and Samsung is increasingly doing so as well doesn't help. But Apple and Samsung license graphics technology from UK-based Imagination Technologies, and if NVIDIA can take some of that business it could be a boon for the company. NVIDIA can only benefit from licensing its technology. The company has a strong core business, and Tegra's slow roll out can be offset by a new stream of licensing revenue. If popular tablets like the iPad start having NVIDIA technology inside then the company could greatly broaden its reach into the mobile market. NVIDIA is the premier graphics company, and this decision to license its technology is a good move. Stock initially benefited from this news, however it later dropped more that a point in subsequent sessions.</Msg><Username>roundhouse_cc</Username><Timestamp>1373471852791</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-10 11:57:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373473377236-11</Id><Title>If Intel Misses next week then Expect Nvidia to Tank</Title><Msg>Any outfit scraping out a living selling GPUs for Intel PCs will be in a world of trouble if Intel misses.
