But for all those visual computing demos only one will yield meaningful additional revenue this year. That's Nvidia Grid. Cuda on arm is nice but where and when is the revenue coming from and how much. Processor road maps are nice though and truly impressive. Execution will be the key, but not affecting revenue this year. Continued push into autos is great and will lead to long term steady income and profits ala TI. But I must say I am beginning to have doubts on Tegra this year. Just a feeling reinforced from what was said at GTC and what was not said. What Nvidia's stock lacks is a good story. It had that story in Jan through March of 2011 when the stock doubled....Smartphones and tablets. It had that story in 2012....Tablets. For the life of me I cannot figure out what Nvidia's story is this year especially without Nvidia revealing Tegra sales goals for 2013. If they don't know who would and what WS analyst would rate Nvidia above a hold. It's very telling that only the two WS analysts with Buys and the one with a Sell have weighed in after GTC.

Appreciate many of your posts but I think you are mistaken about Tegra. It's not dead money as someone else has said this past week. It's been stated countless times that the Tegra wins would be apparent in the second half so any announcements wouldn't be coming until the month or two before the second half. If you can't wait for the other companies to make those announcements, that's your issue.

Ashraf GPU is the solid part of the business and what I always liked. Liked Tegra too up until Nvidia started to have doubts. Their doubts are my doubts. I'm not accustomed to Nvidia Management showing any doubts about anything! Just an aside - I read your article on Intel going to $48 in 4 years. Been hearing that for 12 years. You do realize that you are calling for DOW 30,000. Sorry I couldn't resist.

SA profile) and has been all this time. I speculate that he just sold or is about to flip anytime. The guy came into this stock (again! for the Nth time) around the dividend announcement time and stayed for 3 more months, hoping to ride on the high tides of CES/MWC/GTC triple crown and reap a windfall. But, sorry, it didn't happen. As usual (I've watched him do this for half a dozen times since I am in this stock) he would take the same piece of information and spin in "the other way" within 24 hours to cover his exit. I say LET HIM GO and I wouldn't try to talk him out of it. He has proven himself to be a reliable contrarian indicator - every time he left NVDA, the jinx would be removed and the stock quietly moved up. It is pitiful that the guy seems to have the attention span of a five year old, totally lacking in the necessary qualities that would sustain a long-term investor; namely, vision, temperament, knowledge, and (possibily) resources. However, he does have a skin thicker than most of us do.

Once held the stock for a year and it was down around $2 from where I bought it and then the miracle happened in Jan thru March of 2011 and it doubled so I sold somewhat below the top. Now if that's being a trader....then lord let all your children be traders. Then I bought again on the way down but it continued dropping so I sold at a stop loss around $2 loss. Last year I believe I bought it and sold sometime in the spring before it started to drop. Not much profit. Just watched it and then bought back after the dividend went ex near the low. So I'm in the money some but doubtful of this year's stock movement. I actually try and model stocks a year out. I can model the GPU easily but I can't get a handle on the Tegra processor division and was hoping or praying take your choice of adverbs on Jensen revealing this years Tegra revenue target for smartphones and tablets like he did last year. The other parts of the tegra processor division (car visual computer modules, PS3 Sony royalties, embedded mem. are easily derived. My wish was and is no different than every WS analyst. The Tegra 4 announcement was great but GTC financial presentation left some questions in my mind. Don't see the stock dropping much at all but you never know. 2013 is not looking all that bullish so I'm hesitant. Like to think I'm just being pessimistic but I'm not sure. Now as to your History Ibexx...You have been pumping Nvidia stock since before I was born....a joke...irregardless of the stock price. I can only assume that is because you use that respectable investment practice of hedging by writing calls or selling puts around your core investment. Would love to see you post up those trades....not really because it doesn't matter does it. Nothing wrong with that but I don't hedge although I must admit that I am considering writing calls for only the 2nd time in my life. Have a great weekend.

It's fine for anyone to trade, day or swing, as long as this individual doesn't go into extremes on both ends - super-inflating the outlook, misrepresenting facts, fabricating some numbers while being long, and trashing the stock a few hours later on the same set of fundamentals. As for my record, I do trade options on high beta stocks like BHP, but not on NVDA because the options premiums of NV do not interest me. I came into this stock on February 2009 (before your youngest grandchild was born, maybe?) at $7.5 for more than 50% of my overall position, and have added here or there at higher prices on pull-backs. Overall, I am just fine...watching closely for the evolution of NV's new markets and waiting in patience. For your information, I waited longer for Qualcomm to blossom (6 years altogether) in the years right before Y2K, held a big position at a small loss (then)....but finally QC received VZ validation of its CDMA technology and stocked zoomed. Qualcomm declared a stock split of 8 for 1 in 1999, and I walked away with a 10 bagger or bigger. I don't think you understand that for the genuine long term investors, you can't just take any particular "moment" to assess the correctness/wisdom of your strategy; it is the LONGITUDINAL results that count. J7, for your own sake, it's better that you forget about stocks like NVDA. It doesn't seem to suit you. Go find some thing that grow steadily because of epidemiology changes (like Verizon or big pharma) and pay a hefty divdend (VZ still pays around (4.5%)....I have enough shares of VZ to pay me quarterly monies that I don't expect disruptive companies like NV to sacrifice its arms (or legs) to pay me a pound of flesh.

(Coincidence that Azure is a shade of the color Blue?) And there’s been quite a buzz about it this week on the Web as the site MSFT Kitchen posted a video of a demo of some of the update’s touch capabilities. But there’s more going on here than just touch. In recent months there’s also been talk of the potential for Microsoft to release mini version of its Surface tablet, and there have also been reports of a Windows Blue server. What does it all mean, and are there any dots we can connect here? Here are some of the details we’ve seen reported: \That Microsoft will release a smaller Surface tablet at a lower price point than the existing versions of Surface (some recent reports say $249) and at a form factor comparable to the 7-inch Kindle Fire HD, Google Nexus and iPad Mini. (For comparison’s sake, prices for these 7-inch tablets are Kindle Fire HD: $199, Google Nexus: $199, iPad Mini: $329.) That the Microsoft Windows Blue operating system will be pitched as an update to Windows 8 rather than the next OS and that it will mark a change from a three-year OS cycle release to a yearly update release. (This dovetails with how software has shifted from a technology that resides on your computer into a something-as-a-service offering.) More powerful email features will come to Surface, for instance Outlook drag and drop. That Blue is about more than one operating system for one device. Instead it’s about many devices and services such as Windows Phone, Microsoft SkyDrive and Windows Server, too. It sounds as though Windows Blue is part of a greater transition of Microsoft technology from on-premise to cloud. Could a Microsoft Blue Server be the next step in the company’s onward march from on-premise to the cloud for small business — the one that may have led to the controversial decision to kill Windows Small Business Server last year</Msg><Username>chitownbarber20</Username><Timestamp>1364089285701</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-23 21:41:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364090131802-25</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft-buzz-surface-mini-and-windows-blue</Title><Username>chitownbarber20</Username><Timestamp>1364089285701</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-23 21:41:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"\That Microsoft will release a smaller Surface tablet at a lower price point than the existing versions of Surface (some recent reports say $249) and at a form factor comparable to the 7-inch Kindle Fire HD, Google Nexus and iPad Mini.

The whole conference was practically about Tegra related stuff...well at least over 50%. Everything but what the plan was for Tegra Processor Sales in 2013....analyst begging and all. The answer "Not trying to be coy here, but I truly don't know.?" Not even a range that you could drive a truck through. Nothing....Epic Fail after invited all the analysts to watch.

(All on Yahoo record). One of them even promised that NVIDIA would reveal all - PShield pricing, updates of CY 2013 financial results etc etc. If these clueless traders are disappointed because they got themselves into a wet dream. there is no one to blame but themselves. JH Huang was being responsible not to toss up any numbers just to please the crowd. There are always high levels of uncertainties associated with disruptive technologies and products. As to NV's T4 for this year, only a few end products have been formally announced. and they are likely still at the testing stage without a final commitment. Other unannounced vendors may also be in various stage of development, not ready for a contractual arrangement. How could JH give out a number under these conditions? Snapdragon 800 was announced at the same time as T4 in January, and what kind of sales forecast has QC given to analysts? Paul Jacobs claimed that S800 had secired 50 design wins, but why on earth no one demanded to know the details, or complained that no sales figures from S800 have been given? Why is the double standard being practiced here? - I will tell you why: because NV is a challenger, the new guy on the block. Analysts always feel more comfortable with the incumbent - who wouldn't? - and unfairly want more financial visibility from the smaller, newer challengers until the latter finally arrived. Much like women in the workplace - they have to work harder and achieved more to receive the same recognition. Folks, if you can't stand the heat in the kitchen, just leave....it is very easily done on one click of your finger. Don't let yourself torn up between greed and insecurity. _____ Sorry I had to start a thread, cua I couldn't activate the respond button.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1364094935180</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-23 23:15:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364095661457-29</Id><Topic><Title>I did warn some of the folks....</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1364094935180</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-23 23:15:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>QCOM gave full year revenue guide.</Msg><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1364095661457</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-23 23:27:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364096224219-30</Id><Topic><Title>I did warn some of the folks....</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1364094935180</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-23 23:15:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You missed my point.

At the time QC management simply guided down for the rest of the year and gave out a vague range of numbers, if any. That was being responsible too, and I gave credit to Paul Jacobs for doing that. This year, NV happens to be faced with two sets of uncertainties: the still declining PC market/discrete GPUs (which QC is not exposed to) and their new mobile products. JH could have risked a law suit if he had casually tossed up some optimistic numbers that couldn't be borne out later on. CEOs got to be in their positions because they have heads that think. Were you one of those who expected financial numbers on May 19? - well good for you! Just don't let SA and SA readers know about it.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1364097135859</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-23 23:52:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
