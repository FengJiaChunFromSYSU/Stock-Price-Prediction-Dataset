A15 and A57 do not have better performance/power than A9 which is quite a power efficient part (see Tegra 4i) so ARM is going to fail at general purpose servers. The only hope for these ARM servers is in HPC/render farms where say the potent floating point power of A15 might give it some competitive edge in say performance/watt/price although again that still has to be proven. After this review was released ARMH dropped 3% as anybody not biased can see all the ARM claims of great performance/watt superiority over x86 are overblown/non-existent like I stated earlier with previous examples.</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1363239248407</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 01:34:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363259557485-2</Id><Title>lol, pumper boyz foaming at the mouth at a mirage</Title><Msg>no design wins, no sales, that Tegra ramp is more like a Tegra cliff and the pumper boyz want the stock to do what???</Msg><Username>whosunw</Username><Timestamp>1363259557485</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 07:12:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363263532294-3</Id><Topic><Title>lol, pumper boyz foaming at the mouth at a mirage</Title><Username>whosunw</Username><Timestamp>1363259557485</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 07:12:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I see you extended your stupid streak today.

According to DigiTimes, industry sources say that TSMC is ready to "tape out" the new A7 chip on its 20nm process, with the processors scheduled to be implanted into Apple products in the first quarter of 2014. While the publication has a questionable track record, Thursday's report echoes recent accounts that said TSMC has started production of certain Apple chips as part of a long-rumored partnership. As noted by CNET, TSMC is expected to reach the "tape out" stage — which references the photomasking process that is one of the final steps in circuit design — for the A7 in March and move into early production in either May or June. The firm will reportedly expand operations at its "14-fab" located in Tainan Science Park, with investments in production facilities said to reach nearly $17 billion. TSMC set a capital expenditure budget of $9 billion for 2013, an increase of $700 million from 2012. The report claims that about 90 percent of this year's capex will be put toward bolstering output of chips based on company's 28nm process. The Taiwanese firm said in January that it forecasts a near 100 percent ownership of the 28nm chip market during 2013, a statement that sparked speculation of massive orders from Apple.""

Yes, my apologies since I was STUNNED when I thought YOU had turned away from the stock, but it WAS someone else. I've always thought of you as a tech expert, with real-life experience, so I was worried when the person I thought was you said they were giving up. I've just gotten back from running around all morning, and as I've tried to say, the ONLY time of the day that REALLY matters is the FINAL HOUR. The rest is NOISE. So, volume IS higher than this time, yesterday, and there have been a LOT of blocks, and the attempt to take the stock down and hold it there isn't working, so far. Perhaps, we'll get the OPPOSITE of yesterday, and finish at the highs of the day. For that to happen we'll likely need to see volume back over 12-15mm shares. The game is NOT over for this week until 4PM, Friday. As always, we'll know in the fullness of time.

For established and "in vogue" companies like Google or Qualcomm, the mere paper announcement of a new technology would be sufficient to cause a spike in stock price. However, for innovative companies like NVIDIA opening new territories with uncertainties, WS demands to see the top and bottom number for at least several quarters before lending its sustained support. Cramer effect or other upgrades by 2nd tier brokerages don't really count. One of my brokers once told me that while the tech stalwarts can be treated well when their performance is good, smaller innovative companies like nVIdia has to be GREAT in order to get a favorable treatment by the Street. That is just how it works - WS values "certainty" above a lot of other redeeming values. That said, I am confident NVDA will get there in a year or two, or perhaps sooner. GOOG and QC didn't achieve their current status overnight; both stocks went through their respective treacherous routes before just like nVIDIA has been. I know because I owned both GOOG and QCOM although I sold QC many years ago. PS: Frank is also my guiding light on this board. if (God forbid) he ever declares that he might be leaving this stock, I would seriously consider doing the same. Other posters serve as a contrarian indicator to me - no names to be mentioned here - despite their professed "long" standing. I would be more comfortable if they did not hold NVDA shares.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1363283997745</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 13:59:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363284282504-45</Id><Topic><Title>Why isn't Moving up with HP announcement?</Title><Username>covrcarney</Username><Timestamp>1363279753058</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 12:49:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well Ibexx...If you left I would go to 100% margin on Nvidia.

They are correct in that it is lower margin and perhaps correct that they didn't have enough engineers and there was an opportunity cost involved. But in reality when the game console industry decided to build consoles with essentially X86 off the shelf parts, Nvidia simply did not have anything to compete with. AMD did. If this was 2014 or certainly 2015 then a Tegra chipset running Android or some proprietary software might have been a consideration. I do believe that open Android platform gaming is here and will grow, but traditional game consoles will continue to sell. Surprised AMD's PPS has not benefited from it. Perhaps their financial situation is more dire than is let on. I do expect to hear March 19th where all that opportunity cost engineering went and what the favorable financial impact going forward in 2013 will be.

Jensen on his own scheduled a financial presentation following his keynote at the GTC conference. I'm sure the street along with most investors are eagerly awaiting what he has to say about 2013 financials. Note: As you know they never have presented anything related to financials at the GTC conference. Suspect the drumbeat was just getting too load to ignore or for the first time in 4 years Nvidia is exceedingly confident about the future or some combination of both. Besides having the VP of IR run around the country telling all the big investors to be sure watch only makes it that much more important on how it is presented and what is said. P.S. It's not really that hard to do for a company if they believe in their actions. All company's have yearly plans on which bonuses are driven off of so I'm sure they have it down in black or white already.

But take Projekt Shield and take Ouya and probably Wikipad. Those handheld game consoles will fully support the Android eco system and available games. Gamers can have games for free or for a very small amount of money. All purchased Android games are available on the new device and the Shield will soon support Grid gaming and can even stream games from the PC. Together with smartphones and Android Tablets they will reinforce the Android Eco system and still more Game developers will be drawn to Android and eventually the feature set and game complexity will grow. But perhabs an even more important point is the life-span of each model. There will be a new Shield model each year and now also a new Ouya model each year. Gamers only have to use 100 dollars for the Ouya and instantly have a backlog of games and next year they can buy a second game console with upgraded hardware and backwards compability, but perhabs with new enabled features ingame. I think this low threshold barrier will make the new consoles from Sony and Microsoft obsolete much faster if they still intend to maintain at least a five year life-span.

When the console comes out later this year, it will pack an AMD-designed APU with eight x86 processor cores and Radeon-derived graphics. That will be a stark departure from the Cell-and-GeForce combo of the PlayStation 3. So, why didn't Nvidia get the win this time? GameSpot broached the subject with Tony Tamasi, Nvidia's Senior VP of Content and Technology, who provided an interesting answer. By the sound of it, Nvidia may have turned down Sony and not the other way around. "We came to the conclusion that we didn't want to do the business at the price those guys were willing to pay," Tamasi told GameSpot. "We had to look at console business as an opportunity cost," he added. "If we . . . did a console, what other piece of our business would we put on hold to chase after that?" In the end, Nvidia apparently chose to prioritize its internal projects over a venture with Sony. Tamasi concludes, "We'll see how that plays out from a business perspective . . . It's clearly not a technology thing." Perhaps he's right, but there may be more of a technology gap than he lets on. AMD was able to give Sony some relatively powerful x86 CPU cores and a state-of-the-art GPU on a single chip, using proven technology. Nvidia, on the other hand, lacks an x86 license and still hasn't announced products based on Project Denver, its upcoming, ARMv8-powered 64-bit processor. Perhaps the firm could have cobbled together a chip with Tegra 4 processor cores and Kepler GPU logic, but the AMD solution does seem more befitting of a next-gen console, at least to my eyes.

Today I saw an article labeled: "Nvidia continues with their C**k tease of The Shield." The time frame from announcement 1/6/13 to today 3/14 is 2.5 months with no pricing, no pre-order date, and ship date. This is really starting to turn off potential buyers. Specifics are needed now if Nvidia expects to maintain any goodwill into launch. I also saw two other older articles suggesting that Nvidia launched The Shield because they couldn't get into the Playstation 4. If this continues for a few more weeks Nvidia's marketing may never recover. For factual data look at the view numbers on the Project Shield twice weekly videos on youtube. They are 1/5 of what the first few weeks were.

At least they only did one video this week. Smart move. Since GTC is almost all about gaming, Nvidia Grid, Project Shield, and Android game Developers, I think it would be a good place and time for Jensen to announce the price and start taking pre orders. What is curious is Digitimes is silent on who is producing the device. Makes me think they may doing the manufacture in a San Jose Contract manufacturer where they built the prototypes. Production should have already started, at least by the end of March to launch in Q2. Here's hoping Nvidia marketing doesn't do a big hoopla on it and then no product launch for 3 months. Note: The price is the price. Sony and Microsoft won't give prices until much later.

All Nvidia can do now is sit back and SUCK on sour grapes and spew BS all day about not wanting to make money in consoles. Nvifdia does not have a 64 bit CPU which the current PS3 and the PS4 REQUIRED so Nvidia had nothing to sell anyway. With no 64 bit CPU all Nvidia can do is whne about getting fired from their PlayStation job. The PlayStation 4 Job is AMDs now and the PlayStation PAY CHECK. Sony went with a single source for CPU and GPU. imho</Msg><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1363312443299</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 21:54:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363312884671-99</Id><Topic><Title>Who is Nvidia kidding, they don't have a 64 bit CPU to sell Sony or anyone else</Title><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1363288742769</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 15:19:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nvidia didn't have what Sony wanted. How could Nvidia supply Sony with a 64 bit CPU when Nbidia doesn't have a 64 bit CPU? lol Since current the PS3 is 64 bit why would Sony waste time evaluating a weak 32 bit Tegra 4? Intel didn't have the GPU muscle and Nvidia didn't have the CPU muscle.

We should be able to read the slides and the body language when Jensen presents Nvidia's Financial Presentation Tuesday March 19th at GTC. Strange but no leaks reported by Digitimes other than a May launch for a new Kindle Fire.

In 2009. Analysts pushed this issue then. NVDA's answer was they saw no future in x86. NVDA certainly didn't want to play Intel's game by Intel's rules, it's very clear how far that got AMD. The last few years confirmed NVDA's forecast. Jensen called it right. I'd certainly give up a few 10s of million units of low margin opportunity for a billion plus high margin one, as I say, no brainer.</Msg><Username>norcalnative_2</Username><Timestamp>1363316873287</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 23:07:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363318570867-102</Id><Topic><Title>Not Sure Nvidia's Marketing Is Correct In Their Posturing On the PS4, MS Consols</Title><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1363285440767</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 14:24:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>True, but then you have some marketing guy spinning like they could make an X86 CPU which the entire world knows they can't. This is where Nvidia's credibility issue comes from. The Spin of Their Marketing Guys! When spinning it's important to include the truth. A more appropriate quote would have been: "When Sony decided to go with a PC type CPU/GPU X86 we dropped out because as you know we do not have am X86 license. Besides the margins were low and we had plenty of opportunities elsewhere." Hopefully we will see the effect of those other opportunities during Jensen's March 19th financial presentation.</Msg><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1363318570867</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 23:36:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message></Date>
