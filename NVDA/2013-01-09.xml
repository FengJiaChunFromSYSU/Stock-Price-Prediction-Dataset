It's not clear that they can afford to design the next generation of high-end GPUs. Is this good in the long run for NVIDIA? It lets them gain market share, but likely not much pricing power. Gross margins will rise slightly and R&amp;D costs decrease slightly. But that will just stabilize net revenue in a market that isn't growing. What they need to do leverage their expertise and proven development team to a related area. And that exactly what they did with Tegra. It's a textbook growth strategy.</Msg><Username>watergatefive</Username><Timestamp>1357728713314</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 05:51:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357731094746-10</Id><Topic><Title>Project Shield Will Be Surprisingly Affordable</Title><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1357694292144</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 20:18:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The info I've seen states 80mm2 for Tegra 4 vs. 89mm2 for Tegra. Considering that the 28nm process is more expensive, we can't say much about the cost difference. I think that traders don't understand gamers, especially non-US games. Serious gamers aren't a saturated market -- they have multiple platforms, and will buy a hot new games or piece of hardware soon after release. A price under $200 isn't a major investment for hardware for this audience. I don't expect sales to reach the 150M+ count of the Nintendo DS, but 5M-10M per year for a few years is a reasonable expectation. The big unknown is emerging markets. If the price is under $120, it could be the game platform of choice of the rapidly growing Chinese market. Currently most gaming is done in gaming cafes, where Nvidia GPUs and branding dominate. A small, portable, flexible and affordable platform like this could become a huge seller. Perhaps. If it's not considered too wonky vs pairing a much thinner tablet with a gamepad. I would put this down as a potential game-changer, with a huge potential up-side and close to break-even downside.</Msg><Username>watergatefive</Username><Timestamp>1357731094746</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 06:31:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357734369212-11</Id><Title>Shield puts the hurt on high end ATI video card sales - immediately</Title><Msg>Put yourself in the shoes of a gamer who scrapped togther a few hundred bucks about to purchase a high end ATI Video card this month.

Tegra 4 isn't being talked about at all. Regardless of how you look at Project Shield, Tegra 4 takes NVDA above and beyond what the other chipmakers are doing currently. Assuming Tegra 4 is a bigger success than Tegra 3 is, which by all accounts it should be, and NVDA is a stronger company, without Project Shield. NVDA as you mentioned, is already supplying for Apple desktops. Once Apple sees what the Tegra 4 can do for photos, battery life, and video, I think it will end up in the Iphones as well. Anything Project Shield brings in terms of revenue is just a bonus. I bought more as well, but I don't expect much positive movement until earnings are announced. Short sellers are driving down the price currently, but the market works off of perception, not reality.

Barring earnings disappointment, NVDA should stay above 12. Here are the long term trends that I can see play out: 1. T4 keeps tablet market share, pick up a few high-end smartphones launches - nothing much there. 2. T5 (Grey) has made the smart choice of sticking with A9 (as opposed to more power hungry A15). I can respect this engineering choice. It should help in gaining some market share but I don't have any illusions of Nvidia challenging Qualcomm any more. They will remain a small player in smartphones. No here comes the interesting part that I think industry is missing by and large. T4 and support for UltraHD (4k). Theme at CES was all about UltraHD - tablet and smartphones are yesterday's news. UltraHD at $10K will certainly not be for watching regular TV. These will all be integrated with a Tegra-4 type device for internet connectivity. Apple will announce their much awaited TV. There will be a huge rush from Android imitators to cash in on Apple TV rush. I think Tegra 4 will find a suitable place in a number of these models. I think its a very outside chance that Apple uses anything other than home-grown silicon (probably with Rogue GPU) but that should not matter as Tegra 4 will as usual be preferred over Qualcomm/AMD etc. when it comes to Graphics.</Msg><Username>o.investor</Username><Timestamp>1357756281933</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 13:31:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357757486245-67</Id><Topic><Title>Bought some at 12.18</Title><Username>o.investor</Username><Timestamp>1357756281933</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 13:31:21 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm already sitting on a significant quanity of shares, but the recent drop is making me seriously consider buying more. Anyone who thinks this company isn't going to put forth strong earnings, based on their current market share of GPUs, and now Tegra 4, can't see the forest for the trees. Project Shield might not be a big seller, but it will do two things: 1) It will put extreme pressure on AMD and take even more market share away from them in the GPU field, simply because with a new Nvidia GPU, you can stream to a Project Shield should you want to purchase one. Why buy ATI when you can buy Nvidia and get the same, or better, product, plus the capability to pair with Shield? 2) It adds another revenue stream to Nvidia, aside from what it already has. I don't expect it to be extrememly popular, only mainly for hardcore gamers, and depending on price, popular around the holidays for youngsters, but it has the possibility to bolster revenue and earnings. Win/win. Tegra 4 is clearly the best chip on the market for what it does. Like you, I don't expect Nvidia to take a large marketshare in smartphones, at least not until "Grey" is released . Then, who knows. Qualcomm should be worried about "Grey", since Nvidia owns graphics. Graphics, power efficiency, with integrated LTE could be a game changer. Nvidia already has Apple conviced enough to use them for their desktops. Like you, I see a real possibility that they use them in future televisions as well. I'm not too concerned with the drop in price this week. If you look at all the tech stocks, the PPS was bolstered leading up to CES, and almost all have fallen after announcing at CES. I'm not a trader, I'm an investor. I like Nvidia's future.</Msg><Username>delano_00</Username><Timestamp>1357757486245</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 13:51:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357757553198-68</Id><Topic><Title>Bought some at 12.18</Title><Username>o.investor</Username><Timestamp>1357756281933</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 13:31:21 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You're killing me O...sell the short term calls and reduce your cost basis. :)</Msg><Username>brokeagain73</Username><Timestamp>1357757553198</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 13:52:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357757719443-69</Id><Topic><Title>Shield Pricing must be disclosed ASAP</Title><Username>streamingsodapop</Username><Timestamp>1357749645217</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 11:40:45 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes and I have.

The company says this new processor delivers twice the performance of its predecessor, Samsung's Exynos 4 Quad. This means new phones from Samsung are going to be noticeably faster. Announced by Dr. Stephen Woo, president of device solutions for Samsung, the processor includes two sets of four cores each. "It's also smart enough to save energy when running certain tasks, too," Woo said. Samsung said it is focusing on three areas: processing, memory and display technology. "There are more than 6 billion mobile devices in use and more than a half a billion smartphones sold. As users become more attached to devices, they become more sophisticated in their devices. They notice a difference in weight, size and form factor." What is driving these advancements? Their components," Woo said to a packed room. "As a consumer you don't think about components often, but that is okay ... if you want to see where the real action is and where the industry is going, you have to pull back that layer to where the magic happens. We believe the right component DNA drives innovation and discovery."</Msg><Username>livinlifeveryday</Username><Timestamp>1357759778792</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 14:29:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357760137041-76</Id><Topic><Title>New Boogy Man pops up: Samsung 8 Core - reason for hit</Title><Username>livinlifeveryday</Username><Timestamp>1357759778792</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 14:29:38 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Anything Samsung does is immaterial as no other OEM will touch their chips.

The Tegra 3 marketing was always clear that it was a 4+1 core design. They never called it a five core part. That was accurate because the A7 couldn't be used simultaneously with the four A9 cores. It's not cache coherent with them, and couldn't properly share the memory controller. That design carried forward with the Tegra 4. Although I have read a few places that suggest the fifth core is an A15, rather than an A7. Using the same processor core allows resuming tasks suspended on the other core complex. The fifth core was on the same die, but used a low power design. Presumably that means the design technique traded off speed for lower leakage and active power, since the process itself is the same over the die. I'm guessing that Samsung is doing the same thing, but with a design that actually allows suspending the high power cores, turning the off, and resuming the tasks on the low power cores. That's wasteful of die area, but perhaps were have changed to an era where that doesn't matter.</Msg><Username>watergatefive</Username><Timestamp>1357767944238</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 16:45:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357768675869-95</Id><Title>Bottom in</Title><Msg>No more profit left to take may reach 12.05 but not likely</Msg><Username>tomasco3777</Username><Timestamp>1357768675869</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 16:57:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357769188868-96</Id><Topic><Title>Bottom in</Title><Username>tomasco3777</Username><Timestamp>1357768675869</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 16:57:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The trend is officially broken, dude!</Msg><Username>guy_8619</Username><Timestamp>1357769188868</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 17:06:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357769555241-97</Id><Topic><Title>Bottom in</Title><Username>tomasco3777</Username><Timestamp>1357768675869</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 16:57:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>even in your own post you contradict yourself ;-)</Msg><Username>nvda_4_ever</Username><Timestamp>1357769555241</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 17:12:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357770166320-98</Id><Title>INTC way up.

According to the company, these are the key features on a Tegra 4: GeForce GPU with 72 custom cores Quad-core ARM Cortex-A15 CPU, plus a 2nd Generation Battery Saver Core Computational Photography Architecture LTE capability with optional Icera i500 chipset 4K ultra-high-def video support The Tegra 4 "Wayne" chip seems to be "Tegra 3 on Stereoids", with the 4-plus-1 CPU concept now upgraded from five Cortex-A9 to five Cortex-A15 cores, graphics subsystem beefed from 12 to 72 GPU cores etc. All of this is paired with an 8-core i500 Soft Radio chip (SDR), which supports all the modern radio bands (4G LTE on both data and voice) the company needed to compete for superphone, phablet and tablet design wins. The company takes a lot of pride in the fat that the i500 die size is around 40% the size of competing modems from Intel (ex-Infineon), Qualcomm, Broadcom and the like. Furthermore, one of most important aspects is the reduced power consumption. By moving from 40nm (Kal-El, Tegra 3) to 28nm process (Wayne), Nvidia reduced power consumption by as much as 45%, while achieving significant performance improvements. However, after all is said and done, Tegra 4 might have an Achilee's heel in the making. While the company representatives often stated that Tegra 3 competitiveness was stifled by the lack of 4G LTE supporting hardware (HTC One X+ 4G LTE smartphone combines Tegra 3 and Intel/ex-Infineon baseband chip), Tegra 4 might be suffering from another issue: lack of API support. Back in 2010, when Nvidia disclosed its roadmap for the future, it was stated that the desktop architectures will move inside Tegra as well, and that future parts such as Wayne (T40, Tegra 4) and Logan ("Wolverine", T50, Tegra 5) will offer computational capabilities. We asked Nvidia what APIs (Application Programming Interface) are supported, since their competition from Qualcomm (Adreno 300 Series), ARM (Mali-T600) now supports DirectX 11.0, OpenCL, latest OpenGL, latest OpenGL ES etc. The response we got from Nvidia's Tegra 4 team was underwhelming: "Kepler isn't in Tegra 4, but Tegra 4's GPU leverages multiple GeForce architectures and elements - including Kepler and others." "Tegra 4 uses our most advanced mobile GPU ever. It adds amazing features like true HDR rendering and supports ultra-efficient computation, like what is done for the computational photography architecture and the first "Always On" HDR camera. It is our fifth generation mobile GPU and 6x the power of Tegra 3's GPU - a major leap in capability (for reference Tegra 3 was 1.5x the horsepower compared to Tegra 2)." In order to understand this answer, you have to understand that original GeForce ULP used on Tegra 2 and Tegra 3 was based on the NV4X architecture (GeForce 6/7 Series), launched in 2004. This is the GPU architecture that powers all PlayStation 3 consoles (RSX is a 2005 GeForce 7800 GTX "NV47" chip with a 128-bit memory controller and continuously updated manufacturing process). "Tegra 4 has 6x the number of GPU shader cores in Tegra 3 (72 vs. 12), and includes various cache and pipeline optimizations. In actual game testing -- with other factors at play, such as game code efficiencies, driver stacks, CPU processing, memory subsystem operations - users should see about 3x - 4x delivered performance improvements for graphics-based benchmarks." While it is great to see HDR capabilities going from specialized hardware such as RED Epic and Scarlet cameras to commodity hardware such as Tegra 4 (naturally, capabilities widely differ, but the concept is the same), the troublesome part was lack of any color on API support, as it is obvious that Always On HDR was an Nvidia feature and not exactly exposed to 3rd party developers. The last part of answer brought an answer to our question: "Today's mobile apps do not take advantage of OCL (OpenCL), CUDA or Advanced OGL (OpenGL), nor are these APIs exposed in any OS. Tegra 4's GPU is very powerful and dedicates its resources toward improving real end user experiences." To put this answer in perspective, Nvidia - a company almost always known for innovation in the desktop and mobile computing space - does not consider that API's such as OpenCL and its own CUDA are important for ultra-efficient computing. This attitude already resulted in a substantial design win turn sour, as the company was thrown out of BMW Group, a year and a few quarters after it triumphantly pushed Intel out of BMW's structure. While the company is embedded with the Volkswagen AG group and will probably end up shipping Tegras in each of the VAG brands (Audi, Bentley, Bugatti, Ducati, Seat, Skoda, Volkswagen), it was Freescale than won the new-new BMW deal for next-gen hardware because of one small thing - Vivante's GPU featureset. Vivante is not a new player in the field, but the low profile firm has a GPU which supports OpenCL, which was listed on BMW's corporate "RFQ" (Request For Quote). According to our contacts close to heart of the matter, OpenCL was the reason why Nvidia "is out". Witnessing that the company does not believe in CUDA (currently), does not believe in OpenCL (currently) and furthermore, has an issue with believing in success of Windows RT / Windows 8 as it does not support DirectX higher than 9. This will probably end up being painfully exposed through next-generation cross-platform benchmarks from Futuremark (next-gen 3DMark is cross-platform: WinRT/8, Android, iOS) and Rightware (Basemark X), all coming out in the upcoming weeks. Will the company change the tune with Logan (T50, Tegra 5) or Stark (T60, Tegra 6), future chips based on Project Denver, a custom 64-bit ARM core in which the company invested lot of resources (and credibility) and a Maxwell GPU core, or are we going to see "a backup version" with 64-bit Cortex-A57 and 1xx-core GPU based on combination of architectures? Only time will tell. Too bad for Nvidia, as Tegra 4 could have been a 1-2-3 punch for its competitors, tired of Qualcomm's inability to deliver functional Windows RT drivers (just ask HP and others how they feel about their Qualcomm-based RT tablets and the R&amp;D money blown on getting that hardware/software to work). Furthermore, Intel failed to make their 2012 target in terms of smartphone Atom units shipped as Google-owned Motorola, the only Tier 1 that adopted the design - dropped off the Top 10 smartphone vendors ranking. From the looks of it, Tegra 4 looks to be a great design product for Google Android smartphones and tablets. Windows RT and automotive/embedded markets on the other hand... obviously the company will have to limit damage there. The "sweet-pill" is codenamed Gray, a Tegra 3 with integrated baseband (think of the part as a general trial run before T50 integrates LTE/SDR on a single die). Will that be enough, time will tell.</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1357771688102</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 17:48:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357771809190-108</Id><Title>Tegra 4 GPU Specs Disappoint, Nvidia in Defensive Mode</Title><Msg>brightsideofnewsDOTcom/news/2013/1/9/tegra-4-gpu-specs-disappoint2c-nvidia-in-defensive-mode.aspx 'However, after all is said and done, Tegra 4 might have an Achilee's heel in the making.

It's the one in Japan and now it has partnered with Nvidia. Nvidia has partnered with every Cloud Gaming Provider World Wide to use Nvidia's Grid except one. AMD put money into that one in Sept 2012....CiiNow. In return they agreed to buy only AMD GPus. So apparently Intel and AMD both think there is something to all this Cloud Gaming Ballyhoo. Interesting...for sure when your competitors see the same thing you do! Even Sony bought Gaikai for $320M in July. Yes that's right they too have partnered with Nvidia Grid too. Surely Sony will be coming from the cloud too in some fashion. But Nvidia sells them the hardware to make it happen.</Msg><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1357781039182</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 20:23:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357786216319-132</Id><Title>Will INTC buy NVDA in the near term?</Title><Msg>There are reports circulating claiming that INTC may be interested in acquiring NVDA and appointing NVDA's head as its new CEO or the head of mobile products.

Too bad because growth is certainly to continue to be key to NVDA's future. "Uncertainty" is the other key factor with Nvidia.There is nothing UNCERTAIN about the future of NVDA! What is so difficult for WS is that it can't fathom that the giant, INTL (Goliath) tolerates being in business with Nvidia (David). Wall Street still does not comprehend the breathtaking importance of Nvidia's patents and it's innovations. Wall Street is ignorant.

Message Board format, boys. Where ya gotta make your own "X's", Agreed, Best. This new Yahoo! Message Board format isn't as good as the old one. Nope. Before when Best would report an eggregious, deplorable, reprehensible and shockingly bad post from chitownbarberXXX, the fine Yahoo! Monitors would of course Remove the offensive post from public view -- and leave a little "X" to mark the spot of their deletion. Now, when Best reports an eggregious, deplorable, reprehensible and shockingly bad post from chitownbarberXXX -- the new Yahoo! system doesn't leave anything at all. Just a big gap in the middle of the thread. Screwing-up the readability of everything after it. But rest assured boys, the fine Yahoo! programmers are working on it. After Best pointed out their system snafu -- you know, when Yahoo! was asking for "user feedback to enhance the user experience". Best's suggestion was to show the name of the wicked peccant violator in red, as well as the name of the last reportee (in the event of multiple reportees) in green, to ease the recordkeeping end of things. And thereby Improve the user experience, don't u know.</Msg><Username>agreed.best</Username><Timestamp>1357793347878</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 23:49:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
