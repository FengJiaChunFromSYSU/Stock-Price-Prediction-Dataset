It is quite obvious that the HTC Windows Phone 8X is not suffering from low inventory. We’ve been told that HTC started shipping its new Windows Phone 8X, and third-party retailers and retailers are now shipping orders with 1-week shipping time. At one popular online retail store, the HTC Windows Phone 8X is available in two colors, the black and the blue model. With a cheaper price tag of $600 off-contract and with an unlocked micro-SIM card slot. Other colors such as the red and green (lime) are not yet available. For comparison, the Nokia Lumia 920 is still backordered or on-preorder with December 5 to 10 shipping debut. The Nokia Lumia 920 is also expensive at $750 off-contract price tag with unlocked micro-SIM card slot. A retailer said the Nokia Lumia 920 is more popular than the HTC Windows Phone 8X, but low inventory is affecting sales. We’ve been told that the Yellow Nokia Lumia 920 is the most popular variant to date. In United States, the largest carrier, Verizon Wireless, is selling the Windows Phone 8X with unlocked SIM card slot for $199.99 with 2-year contract or $549.99 at full price. Worth noting is the carrier logo on the HTC Windows Phone 8X which may not as cool for some customers. Verizon’s LTE coverage and popularity might help the HTC Windows Phone. Speaking of popularity, Nokia’s Lumia 920 is an exclusive device of AT&amp;T’s 4G LTE network. The device, according to Amazon Wireless chart, is the most popular smartphone of the carrier (excluding the iPhone) after outselling the quarter and a half old Samsung Galaxy S3 AT&amp;T LTE. For starters, the Windows Phone 8X of HTC is powered by Qualcomm MSM8960 Snapdragon dual-core Krait processor with Adreno 225 GPU, 1GB RAM and Windows Phone 8 operating system out of the box. The device features a 4.3-inch S-LCD2 display with 720 x 1280 pixels boasting 342 pixels per inch. The HTC 8X with Windows Phone 8 also includes an 8-megapixel primary camera and a front-facing 2.1-megapixel secondary camera with wide-angle shooting capability. For comparison, the Nokia Lumia 920 is sporting the same Qualcomm dual-core Krait processor, 1GB RAM and Windows Phone 8 operating system on board. The device features a 4.5-inch IPS TFT display with 768 x 1280 pixels and 332 pixels per inch. The best feature of the Nokia Lumia 920 is its 8.7-megapixel PureView camera and its stunning build quality.

Apple sold 27 million iPhones and 14 million iPads in the last quarter of 2012, swelling its revenue by 27 percent. Apple's net profit for the quarter, ended Sept. 29, was US$8.2 billion, or $8.67 per share, up sharply from $6.6 billion, or $7.05 per share, in the same quarter a year earlier, the company announced Thursday. Apple sold 58 percent more iPhones than in the same quarter last year, while iPad shipments were up 26 percent, it said. Mac sales weren't so strong, growing 1 percent to 4.9 million units, while iPod sales continued to decline, falling to 5.3 million, as more people relied on their smartphones to listen to music. "We're very proud to end a fantastic fiscal year with record September quarter results," CEO Tim Cook said in a statement.

AMD and Intel are too firmly associated with the Windows OS and low end PC market which, if you've been paying attention, is being eroded by that market segment choosing mobile devices. AMD doesn't have a footprint here and never will. As for Intel, despite having the capital to buy up patents or companies in this space they've clearly shown they don't understand the segment with the flop of the Atom not to mention being way late to the game. Something else to be said is that NVIDIA makes a lot of it's money on high end servers and gaming pc's which, consequently, is the only die hard PC market left and as Apple gets a stronger hold in the enterprise MS/Intel/AMD will further decline - let's face x86 is an antiquated technology and relatively expensive and the only way Intel can stay the same size without charging bucket loads more for its processors is for it to sell in large volumes. Volumes, which I want point out, simply just aren't there in the high end server market. NVIDIA is coming out with T3/T4 - (with Kepler DNA) SOC with SDR LTE modem which makes it's mobile package very attractive as it is only one of two SDR approved vendors for SDR on AT&amp;T. Finally, there is Kepler in the cloud (GeForce Grid) which has been adopted (again beating Intel to the game) Gaikai and gives NVIDIA another foothold in an emerging market not to mention giving them an edge in the mobile client to server graphics integration for mobile gaming and cloud based applications. NVIDIA is well diversified, well managed and is a leader or emerging competitor in several key markets. Neither of the companies you've mentioned can say that as they are all but one trick ponies - Qualcom is the only company you've mentioned that is positioned well, good company, but again they are pretty much isolated to the mobile market and honestly I think the Grey with the T4 will give it's crapdragon a run for it's money.</Msg><Username>brokeagain73</Username><Timestamp>1354580012973</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 19:13:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354581728799-54</Id><Title>Why Has Nvidia Gone Completely Silent?</Title><Msg>This is very uncharacteristic for the company.
