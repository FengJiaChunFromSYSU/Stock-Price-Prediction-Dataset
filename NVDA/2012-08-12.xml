Remeber the Kindle Fire? Hollywood? That "3rd high profile tablet win" doesn't look that secure now, does it. that's what the street sees and saying in the price action last friday ... last Q sales was good, this Q is good too, but history shows that is zero indication of things to come. Indeed, history on Tegra 2 and OMAP4 shows sales keels over after a Q or so, meaning that $70M/Q loss has more of a probability of going back up than down.

Sell of NVDA on Fri was primarily due to technical reasons, not fundamentals. The stock had been up and had 6 days of green candles before Friday's release. Looks like somebody had expected the good results and bot in earlier, and there would technically be profit taking on the seventh day with the stock gap up after the release, particularly with the help of a down Nasdaq at the opening. Those sellers may well be happy to see everyone sell out of scary so that they can buy it back at a lower price. I personally wouldn't worry about it at all. Fundamentals seems to be solid for the company with lots of new products to come and ship (CEO was excited when mentioning them during discussion). There is a good possibility that the stock may skyrocket after a scared sell off and never look back again.</Msg><Username>zhanyong_1</Username><Timestamp>1344787433000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 12:03:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344788763000-15</Id><Topic><Title>Big down day on Fri? make no fuss</Title><Username>zhanyong_1</Username><Timestamp>1344787433000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 12:03:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>To add a point here, if you look at the weekly chart of NVDA, the key Resistance level between 13.89 and 14.26 had been broken decisively with hi volume, Next major target would be 16.00 - 16.50</Msg><Username>zhanyong_1</Username><Timestamp>1344788763000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 12:26:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344791128000-16</Id><Topic><Title>NVIDA Q2 cc transcript is out..</Title><Username>moorelawyer</Username><Timestamp>1344782784000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 10:46:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>whosunw, if you go and see the discussion transcript, below is the cut-and-paste of the original conversation. I don't see your posted words from Jen-Hsun Huang on the transcript, please kindly explain where you get them? Below is the part of conversation on the transcript ----------------------------------------------- Raj Seth - Cowen &amp; Company Hi. Thank you. Jen-Hsun, in the context of the prior question about modem integration, etcetera, downstream, wondering about your view on connectivity technologies, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, etcetera. How important do you think that is or not important for you over time to own those technologies? Thanks. Jen-Hsun Huang Integration is always a good thing. Integrationâ€™s a good thing. If you look at connectivity a multi-function connectivity chip goes for something along the lines of about $3.00, $3.00 to $4.00, but an LTE modem is $20.00 to $25.00. And so the important thing is to focus on the important thing first and so weâ€™ve taken off a big bite and weâ€™re working on LTE integration and so Iâ€™m quite excited about the integrated version. There are very few companies in the world that have the ability to build an integrated platform based on a world-class application processor, a world-class software stack and a world-class modem and thatâ€™s â€“ they are three things that are very, very hard to do and I think weâ€™re one of those companies that can pull it together and when we get that done, weâ€™ll think about other things. But those are really by far way, way, way more important than everything else.

So Best? It's like the end of a 26 mile marathon, right? EVERYBODY gets congratulated -- just for finishing. Now, there are the best runners, moderately-good runners, and the plodders. The best runners come in with a two hour handle. Really good, right? 26.4 miles in two (2) hours. They get Congratulated and win cool stuff to take home. The moderately-good runners finish with a three hour handle. They get congratulated too, and get tee shirts and bananas. The plodders finally cross the tape with times ranging anywhere between four and six hours. Depending upon how many beers they had at Casey Moran's. But they get congratulated too, 'cause they Finished. That's what the analysts were doing on the conference call. Congratulating plodder Jen. Everybody knew that Jen's performance stunk. And stunk badly. What with YTD Net Income plunging 37%. But it's still polite to congratulate the finishers. No matter how bad the performance.

For those new to this game: the SoC market will be huge in a very few years. At the huge low end and probably mid-market, it will need a fully integrated solution to play, and that includes connectivity. It might be a $3 chip now, but for speed to market and low BOM costs, oems will demand integrated solutions, ala just solder and go. For Q4 2011, brcm moved ahead of nvda in app processor sales on the strength of their integrated solution on 2G! That is just a taste of how huge that integrated solution market will grow to be. That is why qcom went and payed $3.1B for Atherno's wifi. nvda is not making any move towards that. Indeed, up to may last year, Jen and the fanboyz here were bashing qcom's 'cheap radios'.

FBR notes that NVIDIA has opportunity in the second half of 2012 as Tegra sales accelerate, and that with over $5 per share in cash, valuations remain attractive. FBR raised its 2013 (fiscal) estimates substantially, to $1 in EPS on revenues of $4.42 billion, from a prior estimate of 65 cents in EPS on revenues of $3.98 billion. Merrill Lynch: The firm raised its price target to $16.50 from $14, but maintained its neutral rating. Merrill Lynch is a skeptic, and says that it remains on the sidelines until it can see more evidence of momentum in the non-iPad tablet market. In addition, the firm is worried about Tegra sales in the smartphone market until an LTE modem is integrated. Merrill Lynch notes that at 11.5x its 2013 estimates, NVIDIA is not expensive, but that now is not the time to be chasing the stock. Raymond James: The firm maintained its strong buy rating and raised its price target from $20 to $24. Raymond James was impressed by what it called "remarkable" momentum for NVIDIA's Kepler GPU line. The firm believes that investor sentiment (a key issue) will become more positive over the next several months, as NVIDIA shows strength across multiple segments, including Ivy Bridge, strength at Apple, and the launch of Windows RT. That, in the firm's view, will lead to an increase in confidence regarding NVIDIA's future earnings power. Estimates for 2013 (fiscal) were raised to 91 cents in EPS on revenues of $4.42 billion, up from 71 cents in EPS on revenues of $4.09 billion."</Msg><Username>stock_revealer</Username><Timestamp>1344804954000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 16:55:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344813836000-31</Id><Topic><Title>Another tegra 3 phone in china</Title><Username>chrisssable</Username><Timestamp>1344700639000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 11:57:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Great find</Msg><Username>bestrepellant</Username><Timestamp>1344813836000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 19:23:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>13</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344813867000-32</Id><Topic><Title>Positive Writeup in Barrons on NVIDIA</Title><Username>deputyhatchet</Username><Timestamp>1344705388000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 13:16:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Big news</Msg><Username>bestrepellant</Username><Timestamp>1344813867000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 19:24:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>12</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344813890000-33</Id><Topic><Title>New!
