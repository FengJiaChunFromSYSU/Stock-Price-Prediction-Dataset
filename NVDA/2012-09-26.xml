"NVIDIA's Colorado-based team ABANDONED the work on [the original Project Denver] x86 instruction set architecture and pushed through with "reinventing" the Project Denver core..." .

Charlie informed us OVER A YEAR AGO that "Project Denver" -- a desperate attempt by Jen to copycat a Genuine Intel x86 processor -- would Never see the light of day. "Never" said Charlie, presciently, Check it out for yourself, boys. Google for Charlie Demerjian's Masterpiece: What is Project Denver based on? . "SemiAccurate has it on very good authority that this [Project Denver] would not have succeeded, and based on what the sources showed us, the chip Never would have made it to market." -- Charlie Demerjian, Aug 5, 2011. . It is Absolutely Impossible to emulate the Intel x86 architectue without infringing on many of Intel's 5,000+ patents relating to the x86 processor. And since Jen failed -- and Failed Badly -- in his attempt to cross-license Intel's x86 patents, the end result of Jen's "Project Denver" folly was a massive waste of R&amp;D cash. . "Texas Instrumentsâ€˜s (TXN) today held a meeting with analysts to discuss its plans to shift R&amp;D investments...." Jen did the same thing -- he just skipped holding a meeting with the analysts discussing plans to "reinvent" the Project Denver fiasco. .</Msg><Username>jeepers.best</Username><Timestamp>1348664384129</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 08:59:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348667809045-5</Id><Title>Semi conductor is a sad sector to be in</Title><Msg>Look at AMD, txn etc. Headwind too strong.
