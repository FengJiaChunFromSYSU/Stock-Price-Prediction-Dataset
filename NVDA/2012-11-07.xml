This nvidia insider trading thing. It's a sign of bad nvidia management, right? If nvidia took better care of their hapless, downtrodded, likely underpaid and apparently malnourished Accounting folks, they wouldn't need to go selling nvidia insider information to the criminal trading cabal. And when nvidia is about to report their bad quarterly numbers, the Accounting folks don't go selling the information in advance. Who then short nvda stock, and make Obscene amounts of illicit trading profits. Did I mention? It looks like a case of bad nvidia management. They should pay their Accounting folks better. And Jen should buy 'em donuts and pizza from time to time.</Msg><Username>ask.best</Username><Timestamp>1352301831783</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 10:23:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352301864283-4</Id><Topic><Title>IHS/iSuppli tear down of Microsoft Surface RT</Title><Username>ibexx88</Username><Timestamp>1352232060974</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-06 15:01:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ibexx : 'I am glad Jen Hsun didn't accept the below-par price as it would've been a dangerous precedent to set - what would NVIDIA tell its others customers who paid the normal price of $25?

Monica Chen, Taipei; Steve Shen, DIGITIMES [Wednesday 7 November 2012] In excerpts. Asustek Computer has seen its brand image improve in the US and Japan recently thanks to the launch of dual-branded Nexus 7 in cooperation with Google. Asustek is proud of its product design with regard to the Nexus 7, and also aims to capture the top-vendor ranking in the Android tablet segment. But it remains to be seen whether Asustek will be able to continue to expand its brand image based on the charm of the Nexus 7, since Google has announced its Nexus 10 in conjunction with Samsung Electronics. [The new Nexus 10 tablet will apparently be powered by a 1.7GHz Samsung Exynos 5 processor using the newest ARM Cortex-A15 architecture -- instead of the old nvidia Cortex-A9 Tegra 3. Samsung handily beat nvidia to market with the second-ever ARM Cortex-A15 chip -- Apple of course, was the First on the planet to do so.]. Google has been backing Asustek in the development of the Nexus 7, offering the Taiwan-based hardware vendor the priority to design-in its latest Android OS and to penetrate into the US tablet market jointly. But the skepticism about the merits of the Google-Asustek tie-up still remains, since Google has showed its intention to control the development of the Android market, optimizing the production of the 7-inch Nexus 7 at Asustek and the 10-inch model at Samsung. Furthermore, the latest market rumors also indicate that Google may also team up with Lenovo for penetrating into the China market. Does Google treat Asustek as a brand partner or an OEM supplier? John Lagerling, director of business development for Android, seems to have an answer to the question. When approached by the New York Times during a recent interview seeking a confirmation of Asustek's remarks that current shipments of the Nexus 7 have reached as many as one million units a month, Lagerling replied, "We haven't announced numbers. We typically don't allow our partners to announce numbers." The message clearly indicates that Google treats Asustek as an OEM partner, but not a dual-brand partner. In the worst-case scenario, Google may tie up with other vendors such as HTC and Lenovo to develop its next-generation Nexus tablets, which will place Asustek under fire from rivals vying for the Android tablet market. Asustek has estimated its tablet shipments to reach 6.3 million units in 2012, of which the Nexus 7 will account for over four million. In other words, shipments of Asustek's own brand Transformer and Padfone tablets are limited. Asustek's competitive advantage will wane further if it fails to win the design-in priority for the next-generation Nexus tablets." Looks like that nvidia tegra-powered Nexus 7 tablet was a one-hit wonder, boys. And Google is moving on to other suppliers -- like Samsung.</Msg><Username>bestonica</Username><Timestamp>1352344016800</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 22:06:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>20</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352346811968-20</Id><Topic><Title>Jeepers Best, Everybody else pays a dividend.</Title><Username>jeepers.best</Username><Timestamp>1351349062429</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 10:44:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Maybe when the analysts ask Jen about when the heck 19-year old nvidia is going to finally pay their first cash dividend, Jen can tell 'em, "We'll take it under advisement."
