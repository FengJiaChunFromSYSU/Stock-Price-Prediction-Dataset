ARM/intc will have the bulk of the market all day long with nvda pushed to the very high end only. And ARM does not have the following in the high end/cost no objective that x86/intel has. as long as nvda is not out of linking up ARM cores, AND Tegra team laid off, sammie/aapl will just laugh at nvda's IP sales guy. They have zero reason to proliferate nvda tech and marginalize themselves. They are doing just fine on their own thank you. Ironically, brcm is a potential. brcm has their own graphics, but they will not feel threatened by using nvda graphics since nvda will never be able to assemble enough 'cheap' radios to compete in the space that brcm is aiming for. So if the price is right, brcm might bite. As for other non phone/tablet markets, there's not enough volume there for a Big Mac.</Msg><Username>whosunw</Username><Timestamp>1371812782480</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-21 07:06:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371813126500-2</Id><Topic><Title>Qualcomm just Took the Next Nexus 7 job from Nvidia without Nvidia GPU IP right?</Title><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1371699259425</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 23:34:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"And the outfit with Nvidia GPU IP lost out on the Next Nexus 7 business at Google" Guess what?

In INTC's case in PC their differentiator was CPU and graphics is/was an afterthought. In ARM's case mali follows Intc's model of covering the basics. Just good enough won't cut it with high res displays and gaming experiences getting better every day. "for other non phone/tablet markets, there's not enough volume there" Sounds like the world has stopped rotating on it's axis in your little world. Apple, while leader today, will watch their marketshare erode over time as is the case with closed vs open systems. Billions of units are projected to ship annually in a few years and the dramatic growth will be in android. Back to the original post. The moment AMD sees NVDA gaining traction in ARM core licensing is the moment AMD's management (as the other IP leadership company in graphics) knee jerks their place into the licensing game. It's a political answer for now, anything the other guy does is bad. A smidgen of success by NVDA will change that outlook, especially for a company with such a limited potential as AMD has.</Msg><Username>eir951</Username><Timestamp>1371831400712</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-21 12:16:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371831726529-24</Id><Topic><Title>Nvidia LOWER After that GPU IP sell off than Before, is it not? lol</Title><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1371822137362</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-21 09:42:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Only thing left for Jen to offer up is office furniture and office supplies.

But it seems a bit odd to ship a tablet with that processor now that AMD’s new Temash chips are available, offering better performance and lower power consumption. Still, the tablet I played with a CES in January seemed pretty responsive, so the Hondo chip might be all you really need for basic Windows 8 functionality. The tablet also features 64GB of storage, 2GB of RAM, 802.11n WiFi, Bluetooth 4.0, stereo speakers, a 2MP front-facing camera, and a 10-point capacitive multitouch touchscreen." source: liliputing</Msg><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1371834308892</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-21 13:05:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371837168553-35</Id><Topic><Title>"Vizio’s 11.6 inch, Windows 8 tablet with an AMD chip is now available for $600"</Title><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1371834308892</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-21 13:05:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What an overpriced POS!</Msg><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1371837168553</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-21 13:52:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371837621961-36</Id><Topic><Title>Nvidia is trying to Avoid Closing LOWER 4 Weeks in a Row.</Title><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1371832494333</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-21 12:34:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nvidia STRUGGLING to avoid closing in the RED 4 Weeks in a Row is a better way to phase it.

Just seems like a rather ironic post for someone who was so fond of calling the Tegra 4 "DOA" for taking a few months to generate design wins. liliputing describes the table this way: "On the other hand, instead it ships with an AMD Z-60 low power processor, a 2012 era chip which is starting to show its age." I really want to like AMD, but stuff like this makes me feel sad for them.

Now ppl are going to thinking; why should I buy one When they had to lower the price due to dismal sales? everyone wants a hot product - not a product that is lukewarm. You can't fault ppl for thinking like that. If 299 was the "real price" at the get-go, then they should have priced it as such. More ppl would have been interested in the shield if t was priced and marketed for 299.</Msg><Username>streamingsodapop</Username><Timestamp>1371844195194</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-21 15:49:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371844406381-42</Id><Title>WHY all topic hidden</Title><Msg>Topic hidden because you ignored this user GREAT, close at $14.45 above all support lines, no upside resistance</Msg><Username>new_day_high</Username><Timestamp>1371844406381</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-21 15:53:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371844472983-43</Id><Title>WSJ singing praises about Wikipad - Tegra 3 powered. Very unusual!</Title><Msg>YOU MAY HAVE bought a tablet to get more work done. But among all those office and productivity apps, you also have folder after folder filled with mobile games—the ones that you tell yourself you'll delete but end up playing for hours on end. The Wikipad is the first tablet to face facts: It makes the fun stuff the priority. Tthe Wikipad can transform into a handheld game console. It comes with a slide-on controller that adds physical thumb-sticks and an array of buttons, triggers and bumpers to let you jump, duck, fire and brake (and avoid your work email) with more precision. The Wikipad's controller is a huge improvement over the clumsy virtual controls used by most tablet games. Because the "buttons" on many touch-screen games are virtual, you often have to check that your thumbs haven't drifted off the mark when you mean to fire away. There's no fear of that with the Wikipad's controller. Better yet, you can rely on the muscle memory you developed playing "Super Mario Bros." as a kid. The controller makes the most difference with action games, like "Shadowgun" or "Grand Theft Auto: Vice City," but even simple run-and-jump titles, like "Sonic the Hedgehog," are more fun to play with real buttons and sticks. The Wikipad's wide handles also make the tablet easier to hold for extended periods of time—whether you're playing "Assassin's Creed" or watching an episode of "Game of Thrones." When it's time to get back to business, just slide off the controller and tuck it in a drawer; the Wikipad leads a double life as a mild-mannered tablet. It runs the same Android apps as two similarly sizes devices, Amazon's Kindle Fire HD and Google's GOOG Nexus 7. It has largely the same specs as the Nexus 7, too: 16GB of storage and an NVIDIA NVDA Tegra 3 quad-core processor. The Wikipad does cost about $50 more than comparable Android tablets. But that's a modest premium to pay for the hardest-playing tablet on the market. $249,</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1371844472983</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-21 15:54:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371845543307-44</Id><Topic><Title>"Vizio’s 11.6 inch, Windows 8 tablet with an AMD chip is now available for $600"</Title><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1371834308892</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-21 13:05:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Is this the same Hondo tablet chip that was announced in October?"
