They traded NVDA often, you can follow the size of its ownership on NaZ under "Institutional holding". As of September 2012, Blackrock ranked #7, way behind Fidelity and Vangard etc. Additionally, Blackrock owns dozens of small-cap and mid-cap stocks based on well publicized data - it doesn't necessarily mean that BR has the intention and ability to acquire all of them. One more point: before anyone gets its hands on NVDA, MSFT will have the first right to buy or to refuse. MS isn't gonna let NVDA fall into scavenger's hands. Keep dreaming if you wish. Acquisition of NIVIDIA by anyone isn't a likely event for the foreseeable future. These rumors have no effect on the trading of NVDA what-so-ever.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1359616112463</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 02:08:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359630649209-3</Id><Topic><Title>$11.11 on 2/22</Title><Username>arnab_chanda_huang</Username><Timestamp>1359607356262</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 23:42:36 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Please put me on ignore now.</Msg><Username>arnab_chanda_huang</Username><Timestamp>1359630649209</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 06:10:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359637687316-4</Id><Topic><Title>$11.11 on 2/22</Title><Username>arnab_chanda_huang</Username><Timestamp>1359607356262</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 23:42:36 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Just another drive by imbecile.

The agency has cut AMD's debt rating from a B to a CCC-. That's the last step above default, and it echoes the agency's skepticism over whether or not AMD can continue as a going concern. The agency writes: The ratings reflect Fitch's expectations that negative free cash flow (FCF) in 2013 will drive cash below AMD's target level and potentially approach the company's minimum operating level. Beyond the near-term, Fitch believes a strong end market recovery and adoption of AMD's new products will be required to preserve cash during the company's multi-year transformation... Fitch believes liquidity was sufficient as of Dec. 29, 2012, and consisted of $1.18 billion of cash and cash equivalents, including $181 million of long-term marketable securities. Fitch expects negative FCF of $250 million to $450 million for the current year, pressuring liquidity by the end 2013. The company has a stated target cash level of $1.1 billion and minimum operating cash level of $700 million." ___________________________________________________________________________________ Should Nvidia cut GPU pricesand kill off AMD?

In the past when Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo released new game consoles sales of PC GPUs typically stall out for a couple of quarters. The Tech Press goes nuts and says it's the end of PC gaming, etc. etc. So Nvidia put a couple of hundred of engineers who really did not have that much to do anyway because Nvidia was between upgrades and said let's build something that our loyal fan base will buy and keep the buzz. Yes 10's of thousands not millions, but it a start and each one will make money. But then the real money comes from the brand loyalty on GPUs. Look at the prices on Newegg. AMD has continually dropped the price on their top gamer cards 7970 from $549 to the high $300's with massive game bundling and they still aren't selling. Nvidia launched the GTX680 at $499 and now most partner cards are selling for around $550. Certainly we will see Project Shield Bundled with high end Nvidia cards...say the Geforce Titan at $899 and the shield for something slightly above cost. It's a marketing ploy which makes money but more importantly it rewards Nvidia's PC gamer fan base and keeps them loyal to the tune of 30% operating margin on $3B annual revenue. All from the minds of a bunch of middle aged Nvidia Manager Gamers.

Zoom Earlier we showed you the upcoming GeForce Titan, and explained that the performance would be at around 85 percent of that of the GeForce GTX 690. In light of new rumors, according to WCCF, this might not be the case, and the GeForce Titan might actually exceed the performance of the GTX 690. Nvidia's GeForce Titan will be based on the GK110 GPU, a GPU previously only found on Nvidia's Tesla cards, the K20 and K20X. The rumors haven't been verified since PCOnline has not named their source, but claim that it is a reliable source. Their source says that the GeForce Titan scores X7107 points in 3DMark11, in extreme mode, a massive jump above the GTX 690. The GTX 690 alone already scores just shy from X6000 points with the same benchmark under the same conditions. The most staggering part though is that the Titan, a single GPU part, outperforms the GTX 690, a dual-GPU part. Another leak indicates that the GeForce Titan's PCB is similar to that of the GTX 680, but will carry 6GB of 384-bit memory. Other reports suggest that the upcoming GeForce Titan will also not be called the GeForce GTX 780, nor will it take a GTX 600 series name. It will simply be called the GeForce Titan, likely inspired by the by the Cray Titan supercomputer, which houses nearly 19 thousand Nvidia Tesla K20X cards. Availability is rumored to be around the end of February with a hefty MSRP of $899.</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1359671634267</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 17:33:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359672076676-42</Id><Title>What does Nvidia have as a follow on to Kepler..

A real throwback to the 60's and 70's. There are design cycles and between design cycles. People are moved around where needed...not layed off! Everyone has a technical degree and worked in engineering once or twice even the marketing guys. Very old school! No need to engage contract design services or other such new age efficiencies. A lot of production savy people too from motherboards etc. So when a project is needed to be rushed, the in house people are available at no extra cost. Of course it helps that most are gamers so they don't need to be trained on what is wanted. Nvidia might be very close to the 'Holy Grail" of semiconductor and electronic manufacturing. Only other company I know of that made it was Apple.....drumroll please. Introduce a product make good money on it and never drop the price as the manufacturing cost goes down and introduce it's successor at the same price and repeat. Flies in the face of the Old semiconductor law "Price to learning Curve" I know...but with AMD tittering on the brink of bankruptcy who else is going to enter the market for discrete GPUs? The moat is very wide when you have to build a 3 to 4 million transistor device!</Msg><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1359672945124</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 17:55:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359674038982-46</Id><Title>Nvidia was $12.26 on Dec 31, 2012 and its still $12.26 on Jan 31, 2013</Title><Msg>"Dec 31, 2012 12.06 12.31 12.03 12.26 8,161,500 12.26" How do you like running in place Nvidi fans?

Note: this is his standard catch phrase for the very high end dual GPU gamer card. Also note they are making it in Silicon Valley at a contract manufacturer facility. Made in the USA! Setting expectations low. Possibly but it's clear to me why they brought it out. Besides doesn't cost anything extra and will make money on each one. Plus cement the brand with gamers and set up for Nvidia Grid. P.S. Go back and see with what happened with discrete GPU market share when AMD brought out Eyeinfinity - each GPU could drive 3 displays. It's the little things that drive the purchase of gamer GPU's. I suspect Shield 2 will have a much wider appeal, but I could be wrong and if it happens with Shield 1. Won't hurt me a bit.

How do you say 40% operating margins!</Msg><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1359685919993</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 21:31:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359685935896-67</Id><Topic><Title>Project SHIELD is another example of Nvidia playing games with YOUR money</Title><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1359656722583</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 13:25:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The market already pulled the chain on SHIELD.

The Wall Street Journal reports, citing "sources", Sony will unveil the next-generation console and ship it by Christmas 2013. Sony is said to have scheduled the early event to beat Microsoft to its introduction of the Xbox 720. This tactic has been previously rumoured. In its event teaser, Sony was light on details as to what we might see at the event. Given the Wall Street Journal's reputation and other rumours, their report seems very likely. After the February announcement, several reports have noted that Sony will use the E3 trade show to talk games and keep promoting the console up until Christmas where a bevy of sales are expected. The next-generation PlayStation, dubbed the Orbis, is said to feature a AMD x86 quad-core processor at 3.2GHz, 2GB of RAM, Blu-Ray, 1080p output, and 320GB HDD. It is said to be 10x more powerful than the PS3 currently available on the market. Pocket-lint will be keeping you updated on the latest." It looks like Sony and MS decided not to lay down for Nvidia and cede the gaming biz to some newbie hmm? lol</Msg><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1359691271756</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 23:01:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359692205381-71</Id><Topic><Title>Responding to Getanid's post</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1359685224916</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 21:20:24 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You don't seem to get the point.

It is a matter of - not having the needs of equipping the laptop with a high end graphic cards....so far. It will take a bit of matter to bridge the gap.
