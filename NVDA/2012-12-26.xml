Those other ARM processors are not A15 cores. They are more than competitive with the A9 but seem to be, on average, slower than the A15 at the same clock rate. They have different performance characteristics and it's easy to find a specific benchmark that shows a favorite one (or more likely, a specific compiler optimization) winning. Apple, Qualcomm, Samsung and Nvidia are leapfrogging each other in performance. I do expect the Tegra 4 to briefly have a supportable claim to top performance, but be matched in March or April by Samsung with a quad Exynos 5 with a slightly higher clock rate. Both to displaced soon after. The interesting competitive positioning will evolve late next year when the ARM v8 implementations hit the market. Within a few months the market will decide if the A15's PAE addressing is a good enough hack, or if everyone should just switch to 64 bits. My guess is the latter will happen. If so, the investment in in-house ARMv7 implementations will be mostly devalued.</Msg><Username>watergatefive</Username><Timestamp>1356502747613</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-26 01:19:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356503141686-3</Id><Topic><Title>whosunw - Project Denver</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1356450276367</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-25 10:44:36 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>AMCC just taped out its first 40nm ARMv8 based chip.

The mobile gaming destination is now available for Tegra 3-powered Windows RT devices like Microsoft‘s own Surface and the ASUS VivoTab RT. NVIDIA TegraZone Windows RT Why call it a “destination?” NVIDIA has done an excellent job with their Android version of Tegrazone by highlighting existing and upcoming Tegra 3-enhanced games, but keeping the shameless self-promotion balanced with general industry news and advice. For example, the Windows RT version of TegraZone advertises games like SoulCraft, Riptide GP, and Great Big War Game, but also contains starter guides and tips for new Windows RT users. If their history with Android is any indication, the app should evolve into an enjoyable portal for gaming news on multiple platforms, but tailored to Windows RT users. It’s widely acknowledged that Windows RT is still starving for apps, but it’s an ideal platform for high-quality mobile games. NVIDIA’s developer relations team is 100+ staff members strong, and they’re dedicated to working with developers as they create games tailored for the quad-core Tegra 3. After all, the more appealing a Tegra 3 platform becomes, the more opportunity for NVIDIA to profit. Hopefully the arrival of TegraZone in the Windows Store will usher in a wave of developer support and new titles. NVIDIA’s Tegra 3 chip allows game developers to deliver enhanced graphical effects like particles, realistic physics, and dynamic lighting. In most cases the differences are nuanced but noticeable, especially for gamers desiring the best version of a game. TegraZone is now available on all Windows RT devices. Just open your Charms bar and seek it out.</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1356567497817</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-26 19:18:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356568144863-31</Id><Title>Fudzilla</Title><Msg>Wayne, also known as Tegra 4 is coming out at CES 2013, or in some 10 days from now. Nvidia has an event planned days ahead of CES 2013 and the company will likely show some tablets and hybrids based on the new Tegra SoC. Let’s call Wayne Tegra 4 before it gets official. Nvidia had Wayne ready to launch in Q4 2012 but it had to wait for partners to release the designs based on it, and most of them wanted to do it at CES 2013. European phones based on Wayne are going to show up in February, at the Mobile World Congress. This is the first quad-core A15 design that will bring a significant performance increase over Tegra 3 and we are hearing that the four-plus-one core will deliver a bigger performance boost than Tegra 3 did over Tegra 2. Also, the fact that the new chip is 28nm and supports DDR3L also promises more efficiency. USB 3.0 support is something that is getting us excited as usually it is quite slow to transfer anything onto tablets, phones and hybrids. USB 3.0 on tablets will significantly increase the data transfer speed and Tegra 4 will be among the first chips to feature USB 3.0 support, and many consumers will appreciate faster data transfer rates. The other thing that got our attention is dual display support and you will be able to have two independent screens. On Tegra 3 based devices, you can only mirror the output, not display two independent screens. It could be a very interesting feature for dockable devices.
