"Windows RT is... under-functional (you cannot install a single app that's not available through the Windows RT app store, which offers a paltry selection). This is nothing more than Microsoft's tablet... whose "ecosystem" feels more like a tundra. There's no Twitter or Facebook app.. The Kindle app is completely unusable. There's no image editing software. A People app is supposed to give you all the social media access you'd ever need, but It's impossible to write on someone's Facebook wall through the People app, Surface's social hub; the only workaround is to load Internet Explorer. The app selection, overall, is worse than the already pathetic Windows Phone app fare, looking like the software equivalent to a barren Soviet grocery store. You can do work, yes. But productivity is limited to a "preview" (beta) version of Microsoft Office. It also hurts that Office requires plunging into Windows RT's Desktop mode, where users of actual Windows 8 are able to install a decade's worth of legacy software. Normally, this would compensate. But RT users can't install any of this older software. None of it. Desktop mode is entirely worthless in RT, a cruel tease of non-functionality. Windows RT can't join a domain, be a Remote Desktop host, or boot from VHDs, for example. It also has a few omissions of its own. In particular, it lacks Windows Media Player and Windows Media Center. Windows RT can't run third-party desktop applications. At all. Office is the only desktop application allowed. The only third-party applications allowed on Surface will be Metro-style applications bought from the Windows Store. In this way, Microsoft made the problem I alluded to much worseâ€”developers can't even port their applications to run on ARM. This all puts Windows RT in a very awkward spot. Windows RT devices are beholden to the Windows Store, and while that may one day be fully populated, right now it isn't. While I think it's likely that developers will produce Windows Store apps, I don't know how quickly they will do so, or how well: Google Play, the Android store, is still substantially bereft of high quality tablet applications." It is truly Ironic, is it not? It sure is. THE IRONY of all Ironies, actually. That Microsoft -- the very name stands for SOFTWARE development -- has brought a new mobile device OS to market -- Windows RT -- that is critically crippled and likely fatally handicapped by a lack of -- SOFTWARE apps to run on it. And what does Microsoft do again? Did I mention? This is an amazing Irony of our times.</Msg><Username>i_read_best</Username><Timestamp>1351224887854</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 00:14:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>11</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351226483624-6</Id><Topic><Title>Surface vs Clovertrail</Title><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1351061796264</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 02:56:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I believe that the only reason Windows RT exists is to fend-off future accusations of anti-trust and monopolistic practices against Win/Intel by the ARM camp. "Let 'em fail first, and they can't sue us later." Look, the Genuine Windows 8 devices will be a Huge success. Massively Huge. Why? Because they will be the first tablets to actually run the Hundreds of Millions of Genuine Windows x86 applications that have been written over the past quarter of a century. Applications that folks already own, use every day, and love. Windows RT for ARM has essentially zero functional apps. Nada. So Microsoft deliberately made two flavors of Windows 8. Genuine Windows 8 for x86 processors and Windows RT for ARM. They even deliberately gave the ARM's Windows RT a head-start in the market. Knowing full well that it would fail. And fail quickly. But the ARM camp can't be suing Win/Intel later for somehow being "precluded" from the market. Oh no no no. They were given a chance -- and lost fair and square. Too bad Jen's scheme to make a mobile x86 chip (Project Denver) failed, right boys?</Msg><Username>in_best_we_trust</Username><Timestamp>1351226483624</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 00:41:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351227827910-7</Id><Topic><Title>Break out the Purplesaurus Rex boys, she's up a penny.</Title><Username>best.here</Username><Timestamp>1351183212450</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 12:40:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>nvda_4_ever, You clearly have never actually used the Fed Wire system.

I just don't get it...at this level the stock is already pricing in a bad miss on earnings. I realize that AMD and INTC didn't have amazing earnings but AMD is in a death spiral and Intel missed out on the mobile sales which hurt their consumer business. Nexus 7 is selling like hotcakes, people are waiting in line for the surface and its back ordered like 3 weeks already..they got the apple deal...they are in many more phones this quarter than last quarter. Aparently amazon ordered 10,000 tesla cards. This all adds up to a very strong quarter and even better guidance. Oh and lets not forget the entire kepler lineup ramping with TSMC 28nm finally almost meeting demand and increasing yields to over 80%. So can someone tell me anything bad. I just don't get it. I hope when they report, they announce some initiatives to give the investors confidence and stabilize the stock in the short term. There is no way we should be trading at half the value in cash...that's just ridiculous.
