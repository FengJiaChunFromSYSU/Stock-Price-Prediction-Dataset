Share price. Its all that matters. You can only bring price to the bank. U cant bring fundamental news, u cant bring speculation to the bank. Some say price and volume. But no. U can't even bring volume to the bank. Only price pays. In this regard, Xc is more right recently. AMD doubled since its $1.8 low. Impressive. Yes bankruptcy risk it has. But we could all put some trading $ into it to enjoy it.</Msg><Username>chrisssable</Username><Timestamp>1367674784768</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 09:39:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367677124754-2</Id><Topic><Title>"AMD soars, analyst cites speculation on consoles"</Title><Username>xc3155</Username><Timestamp>1367603481352</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 13:51:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"AMD still faces a collapsing PC market, which has also hurt rival Intel Corp.(US:INTC) And although AMDâ€™s stock has jumped 50% since the beginning of the year, it is still down 50% for the last 12 months." I'm sorry, take what to the bank? seems to me they have gone nowhere in the last 12 months. But I'm sure since your all such fantastic professional traders here you bought in at 1.80 and will make tons of money right??</Msg><Username>manski14</Username><Timestamp>1367677124754</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 10:18:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367681453695-3</Id><Title>Nvidia Kai, Nvidia phoenix !</Title><Msg>What ever happened to Nvidia kai tablets? Fudzilla had an old article on this. Google search. It is proven til today. Said kai was supposed to offer vendors a cheap tegra 3 for cheap tablets. I was hopeful then it could sell tens of millions with Google then others jumping over it. Turns out as per the article, that with Google nexus 7, no other vendors will try it. 2 problems surfaced. One, nexus only sell ok amounts , and two, we are losing the spot to qcom. Hence, kai has failed. So, this was a sound good idea, but failed in a few months. Then Nvidia announced project Phoenix phones. The fact is, based on history, looks like this could turn out to be like kai again. I believe the problem is Nvidia likes big promising ideas. It is their culture. They always talk about promising future, hence once kai seems to meet roadblocks, they do not find ways to overcome it. In the end, mediatek quietly replaced kai. Acer and Nvidia used to work closely. But their latest 8 inch tablet , a cheap one will be using mediateks! Nvidia core business is fine. Hence it is unlikely to crash. But it lacks serious winning ideas that will propel earnings. My wish is that they go to their core competency. Hyping. Hype an idea that is like project Denver then push up share price big to $26, then crash it down when people realize its hype. Just give me a rally and that will be fun. However, even this they may run into problem. Cos recall insider trading case against it. I guess with that charge, stock operators dare not touch it. So .... In the end, could still end up no better than watching paints dry.</Msg><Username>chrisssable</Username><Timestamp>1367681453695</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 11:30:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367681545660-4</Id><Topic><Title>Nvidia Kai, Nvidia phoenix !</Title><Username>chrisssable</Username><Timestamp>1367681453695</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 11:30:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Kai = Nexus 7.</Msg><Username>ashraf.eassa</Username><Timestamp>1367681545660</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 11:32:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367682914857-5</Id><Topic><Title>Nvidia Kai, Nvidia phoenix !</Title><Username>chrisssable</Username><Timestamp>1367681453695</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 11:30:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Dude,, I know.
