And mentioning an event, Google IO. And How you should take at least some profits when there are lots of gains. If you say stuff like that in a more reasonable way, reasonable people will stop calling you a basher. As for Google IO, I'm assuming your saying none of the tegra based Google products will have nvidia inside causing the stock to drop with that reveal. Isn't Nvidia already expected to loose in the nexus refresh this round because of a late transition to Tegra4? Would that really be a surprise that really moves the stock at this point? What if Google announces some kind of gaming service with grid. What if Microsoft announces something along those lines in a few weeks. From what I remember of the last conference call, it sounded like there was something involving gaming would be talked about next time. Its speculation but I think it may be something big involving grid. Side note: I'm responding to two posts here the one higher up is the other one. Side note: I've decided to wait a little longer before putting you on ignore. I said id do it later. I'm just pushing it to a little later again for now.</Msg><Username>x1x4x1x13</Username><Timestamp>1368344639665</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-12 03:43:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368352397421-4</Id><Topic><Title>Google IO next week = Nvidia Nightmare</Title><Username>chrisssable</Username><Timestamp>1368342731490</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-12 03:12:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If all shorts are as "smart" as you, than no wonder they're all wrong</Msg><Username>sisula3</Username><Timestamp>1368352397421</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-12 05:53:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368355262667-5</Id><Topic><Title>Only in Nvidialand, is bad news baked in, good news not!</Title><Username>chrisssable</Username><Timestamp>1368328977438</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-11 23:22:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Stop stealing shopping carts from Wal Mart and get a real job!</Msg><Username>chitownbarber25</Username><Timestamp>1368355262667</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-12 06:41:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368368598160-6</Id><Topic><Title>Adobe Creative Cloud</Title><Username>findingnemoyes</Username><Timestamp>1368331186560</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-11 23:59:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I use CC in my business, it's great.</Msg><Username>norcalnative_2</Username><Timestamp>1368368598160</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-12 10:23:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368379703780-7</Id><Topic><Title>Only in Nvidialand, is bad news baked in, good news not!</Title><Username>chrisssable</Username><Timestamp>1368328977438</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-11 23:22:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>INSANE.</Msg><Username>agamemnus_0</Username><Timestamp>1368379703780</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-12 13:28:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368382677729-8</Id><Topic><Title>Only in Nvidialand, is bad news baked in, good news not!</Title><Username>chrisssable</Username><Timestamp>1368328977438</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-11 23:22:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well, I'm glad I didn't sell when you told us to a few weeks ago.

Lol I said Nvidia is pos bcos of its past. That rallies usually shouldn't be trusted much til it proves otherwise. Ie. Try to trade it. Haven't I said I traded bit of longs and made some money.Now that its fabric has changed, strategy could be different. But still, it ain't going straight up. In this initial leg, I expect a deep 50% pullback. Based on past rally. However, even with Friday's rally, it still pales in comparison to my mentioned stocks in my portfolio. Tsla, Ddd, bbry, ctrl, jcp. Will be putting some cash into Nvidia, but after its tank.</Msg><Username>chrisssable</Username><Timestamp>1368399433816</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-12 18:57:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368400002472-13</Id><Title>Only in Nvidialand, is 20% gain better than 30, 40, 50% gain.</Title><Msg>Share price rallied a bit and all seems cocky. I mentioned Tsla, Ddd, ctrl, bbry, jcp , last I checked performed better than Nvidia. I mentioned Nvidia is pos. Not to trust rally ie to trade it, til it proves itselfs otherwise. Well it seems to prove itself as a worthwhile candidate. But dun be cocky longs. Based on history, it will tank fast , I may long then, but I shall laugh at nvidiots when it tank before I turn long.</Msg><Username>chrisssable</Username><Timestamp>1368400002472</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-12 19:06:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368400238478-14</Id><Title>Nvidiots really think nexus loss is a none event</Title><Msg>Lets see a tank on the news.

Just take a look at his posting hours - usually from midnight on and throughout the night when USA is asleep.

We see no reason why it is going to stop. The reason for that is because we are making the GPU more useful over time. Four years ago no one spoke of using GPUs for general-purpose computing. Four years ago no one spoke of using GPUs to accelerate digital content creation applications. Four years ago no one spoke about putting GPUs in servers. […] We have expanded the reach of GPUs into non-PC devices,” said Rob Csongor, vice president of investor relations at Nvidia, during the quarterly conference call with financial analysts. Today, companies like Cisco, IBM, Dell, HP, all are shipping servers with GPUs inside. Those servers are aimed for high-performance technical computing, cloud computing, Big Data and many other purposes. In addition, graphics processing units (GPUs) these days also accelerate many consumer and professional applications, which means that if someone needs truly high performance, he or she will have to buy a discrete graphics card. But there are other factors that will drive adoption of standalone graphics adapters. Despite of the rise of smartphones and tablets, personal computers are back as a video game platform thanks to leading-edge titles like Crysis 3, FarCry 3, Grid 2, Metro Last Light as well as various Free to Play games.
