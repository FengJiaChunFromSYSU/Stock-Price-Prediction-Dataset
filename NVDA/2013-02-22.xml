There was an article saying that the Shield required a FAN underneath - this is indeed a potential issue IF true. IMO the fan probably is true FOR a different reason - when you have a T4 running full blast 100% of the time as in a gaming mode for hours at a time, when you have the WIFI Chip running FULL BLAST100% of the time - not at internet streaming speeds but at 50X to 100X internet speeds due to direct streaming at wifi N speeds AND potentially driving QUAD HDMI simultaneously - that is alot of bits and bytes flying all over the place at very high speeds - you better have a FAN. So Mr Analysts - there is no heat issues on the T4/T4i. Now - does Icera gets very HOT if you talk for 1 hour continuously? I don't know and I don't think NVDA is suicidal to march ahead if it's an issue.</Msg><Username>mark1289b</Username><Timestamp>1361517696948</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 02:21:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361531551977-5</Id><Title>ThererÂ´s also been rumblings over the past couple of days that Apple views Nvidia as a possible takeover target.</Title><Msg>Nvidia has long been a rumored for a takeover and buyout talk has recently resurfaced.

Yes, ZTE. And, to my surprise, a report earlier this month recognized ZTE as the world's fourth largest smartphone manufacturer just behind Samsung, Nokia, and Apple. ZTE is beating their Chinese competitors Huawei, and Lenovo as well. Pair that with the fact that China has surpassed the U.S. market as the largest smartphone market and you start to see how an Nvidia-ZTE partnership could be unsettling for the entire mobile market. Peter Farago, Vice President of Marketing at Flurry Analytics said in an interview with VentureBeat, "The U.S. is now No. 2 (in total smartphones) and will not recover." Flurry estimates the U.S. share in mobile will grow from 222 million to 230 million by the end of this month whereas China will grow from 221 million to 245 million." "China's research director Nicole Peng said "a combination of a TD-SCDMA device and a cheaper model would open the flood-gates (in China)."

Not only that, the Icera modem also provides global support with software modification of spectral requirements. Yesterday, Qualcomm made a big announcement that they have developed the so-called analog modem technology to more easily enable the "global" nature of the traditional hard-ware based LTE radios, as a result the share prices of companies like RFMD, Triquint etc fell like rocks. This shows how slow and unaware Wall Street is - Qualcomm basically is playing catch on in this very respect. Analog or digital, the issue with Qualcomm's traditional LTE modems isn't totally erased, because of the initial higher costs of such potentially widely applicable modems (in all geographical areas) and the compromised performance/speed. The software defined LTE modems have the inherent ability to do what Qualcomm and other companies are trying to do in the future - much cheaper and faster over the airwave.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1361543186193</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 09:26:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361543590679-16</Id><Topic><Title>NVDA may perhaps well prove to be the ticker to see this quarter.</Title><Username>evanssteve37</Username><Timestamp>1361534214094</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 06:56:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>they are fantastic</Msg><Username>rickybradford979</Username><Timestamp>1361543590679</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 09:33:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361545256727-17</Id><Topic><Title>NVDA may perhaps well prove to be the ticker to see this quarter.</Title><Username>evanssteve37</Username><Timestamp>1361534214094</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 06:56:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Looking at it as we speak.</Msg><Username>romerotimothy528</Username><Timestamp>1361545256727</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 10:00:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361545626710-18</Id><Topic><Title>Get ready for a move higher</Title><Username>kvimax1</Username><Timestamp>1361471605176</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 13:33:25 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This stock really tests one's patience.

Designed around a new Intel Atom chip known as Centerton, Project Moonshot is positioned as an alternative to traditional server designs based on x86 Xeon processors. And at a power-sipping six watts, it consumes a mere fraction of the power used by the latter. At the company's earnings call on Thursday, Whitman said: "We expect this to truly revolutionize the economics of the data center with an entirely new category of server that consumes up to 89 percent less energy, 94 percent less space and 63 percent less costs than our traditional x86 server environment." The reduced power consumption is expected to reap enormous dividends. According to Whitman: "To put in that perspective, if just 10 large web services providers switched their traditional x86 servers to Moonshot, they could save a combined $120 million in energy operating expense and nearly one million metric tons of CO2 per year." To be clear, Moonshot servers are not designed with traditional enterprise applications in mind, and will require applications that are specifically written for them. According to Computerworld, programs that fall into this category are expected to be web applications and big data software such as Hadoop.</Msg><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1361556905749</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 13:15:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361556988387-25</Id><Title>TXN Raises Dividend 33% and Increases Buyback by $5B - Hint Nvidia</Title><Msg>Not to shabby.

Sounds strange but I saw a live stream of Jensen answering questions at this year's CES. One of the questions that was asked was. "It's been 2 years Jensen since Project Denver was announced. Can you tell us when it will released." Jensen kinda giggled and said "In about 2 more years." And then went on to the next questioner. About 20 seconds later a PR guy handed him a note and he read it and grinned and then said. "I've been told to say that Project Denver is going well." And then continued on the answer to the question he was on. I was laughing so hard, I might not of heard it right, but it might just be that. A dodge to worry Intel into settling.

Intel had Nvidia by the short hairs with refusal of allowing other chipsets to work with their I forget what architecture. Told all their customers that Nvidia did not have the rights and killed a $1B business for Nvidia. While this was going on articles would appear about some mysterious hirings from former Transmeta engineers at intel. Vaugue references to Nvidia creating a x86 cpu. Intel countered with the Larabee and it was great theater for the Tech Press. Nvidia sued, Intele counter sued. Nvidia came out with a new chipset called Ion 2 but it was simply a discrete GPU not a chipset. And then all of a sudden Nvidia announced in full daylight Project Denver about an ARM 64 bit CPU. A week later Intel settled and paid Nvidia $1.5B. Perhaps they hired an Bristish MI6 operative to run a scam or they were really gonna do it. Who knows, they may still but many good research labs research things and then discard great ideas. Of course Jensen did say in December that Project Denver was going well and they had some "Secret Sauce". I'm sure you know the story of how Via got their x86 license from Intel. If not let me know I tell it.</Msg><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1361582339154</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 20:18:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361582806331-43</Id><Topic><Title>Meg says arm for servers</Title><Username>on2five</Username><Timestamp>1361543013796</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 09:23:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Don't know about Intel, but since your deep inside Intel i would take your word for it.

I have looked everywhere to find what type of package and what size package they put their new chips in. It's no where to be found on their website or by googling. At least not by me. Nvidia puts the package size right on their websites for Tegra 4, Tegra 4i, Tegra 3, and Tegra 2 as well as their stand alone modems. Do you know have Qualcomm's Snapdragon 600 and Snapdragon 800's package type and size.

Intel started making noises, so he went looking for protection and found a small SRAM semiconductor company called IDTI that was willing to buy them for about $15M. IDTI actually produced pretty decent X86 CPU in fabs 3 generational process nodes larger than Intel. Started selling product and was picking up quite a few contracts.....CPU in the failed Web TV etc. Well of course Intel sued or threatened, but as it turned out IDTI owned a key assembly patent that Intel used on all their latest CPU's at the time. Intel using the patented process because they needed it....you know the way the Semiconductor Industry worked back then. Intel thought like everyone else will just use it and then cross license later but we gotta do this now. A couple of phone calls between General Counsels and Intel said OK how much you want? IDTI got something like $50M and the right to sell a fully qualified paid up X86 license to Via. Via paid I think $50M and got the X86 license and Glen Henry's CPU team. Perhaps Jensen thought they would get an x86 license too in the same way. Perhaps he didn't want it and was just running a scam. Who knows? But he did $1.5B for an obsolete chipset business. I suppose if Nvidia wanted an X86 license they could have som how partnered with Via but apparently he thought it wasn't worth it to take on Intel in it's home turf. Project Denver who knows....perhaps it's now morphed into Project Boulder now that marijuana is legal in Colorado...couldn't resist. P.S Let's find those die sizes on Qualcom's integrated modem applicsation processors. I'm sure they are huge!</Msg><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1361584622518</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 20:57:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361585459332-46</Id><Topic><Title>Meg says arm for servers</Title><Username>on2five</Username><Timestamp>1361543013796</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 09:23:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>To complete the story...the start-up was Centaur Technology.</Msg><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1361585459332</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 21:10:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361591053555-47</Id><Topic><Title>Meg says arm for servers</Title><Username>on2five</Username><Timestamp>1361543013796</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 09:23:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I remember that.
