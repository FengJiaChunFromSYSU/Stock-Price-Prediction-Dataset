Given the reality of PC extinction followed by servers in just matter of few years I cannot see how Project Denver can be a profitable endeavour to Nvidia. The server markets are rapidly declining due to consolidations by being replaced by “cloud server architecture” where customers prefer to rent spaces rather than owning their own. By the time P. Denver goes into production there won’t be nearly enough customers left to recuperate Nvidia's R&amp;D costs. Besides, Intel is currently heading towards a highly energy efficient chip called Atom Gemini that is also targeting the server markets and is heavily favored by the industry such as HP, Dell, and IBM, so ARM based 64-bit processors will ended up being disadvantaged again. This is because most costs associated with the change of architecture (i.e. from x86 to ARM) is with their application migrations, re-coding, and porting. Unlike with consumer devices such as smartphones and tablets a long lasting battery will not be an issue with servers (wall plugged) but "computing power" will definitely be.</Msg><Username>cj_observer</Username><Timestamp>1352566132418</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-10 11:48:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352568009518-14</Id><Topic><Title>What does Jen's new dividend means to a typical holder of 100 nvidia shares?.</Title><Username>everyday_best</Username><Timestamp>1352479908826</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-09 11:51:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>getanid61, Stop posting your harassing, offensive, and Libelous crap, getanid61.

However, today Skycross has just announced a new generation of antenna called VersiTune-LTE that provides 12 bands MIMO simultaneously. “SkyCross has announced their device antenna technology and plans for world domination, which essentially shrinks the total space required for antennae in a device.

That ship has sailed long ago. Due to the scarcity of spectrum carriers will be required to support as many bands as possible now that the technology exists to amalgamate multiple bands into a single fat pipe through LTE-A Carrier Aggregation. Besides, supporting multiple bands also provide carriers with the ability for roaming both domestically and globally. The smartphones are also heading toward different application categories like using low frequency band for voice and mid-to-high frequency bands for data. The MDM9615 by Qualcomm is the most widely used modem in the world today (Galaxy III, Nokia 950, Iphone 5, etc.) because this Gobi chip inside provides multiple bands and multiple network protocols simultaneously. Under the LTE-Advanced Carrier Aggregation technology any discontiguous bands from a carrier’s own network can be combined even with other carriers (through dynamic spectrum leasing) to provide a single “fat pipe” used in delivering high speed data streaming such as HD videos. In terms of smartphone device makers like Samsung and Apple, they would much prefer to have modem (or through SoC) that can provide multiple bands with the option to activate dynamically by carriers when the need arises. Besides, building a smartphone that can target the entire world markets creates an enormous economy of scale in production costs. As you can see, having the most multiple bands is now a requirement with any smartphones. Nvidia will have to be step ahead to stay viable and to foresee the changing dynamics otherwise Nvidia is heading for obsolescence in just a matter of few years.</Msg><Username>cj_observer</Username><Timestamp>1352577878517</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-10 15:04:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352578087087-22</Id><Title>index Bonds or even REIT better for Devidends</Title><Msg>Average index bond is 4% with very low risk of losing capital, for higher devidends REIT just look at MTGE or AGCN, or anyother REIT, on Yahoo finance site, it pays 14%.</Msg><Username>followon</Username><Timestamp>1352578087087</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-10 15:08:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352578521981-23</Id><Topic><Title>"Project Denver going great!" says Jen Hsun Huang</Title><Username>ibexx88</Username><Timestamp>1352521041877</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-09 23:17:21 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>One of the more uninformed comments I've seen.

They aren't seeing Denver as an exclusive core to servers btw. Your comments focus on one segment of computing and Nvidia is focused on a much larger pallette (as are Apple, Samsung and others are . .). Between now and 2015, the computing landscape will be going through several changes and Nvidia has foothold in almost all segments. Also, all the concern about R&amp;D expenses should be taken in perspective with what all the competition is spending and with the knowledge that Nvidia essentially has no debt and continues to add cash, enough to provide a dividend and buyback extension now. Jen wouldn't have gone forward with the dividend and buyback at this stage without knowledge of what's ahead for his forthcoming launches.</Msg><Username>roundhouse_c</Username><Timestamp>1352582563826</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-10 16:22:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352584716959-30</Id><Topic><Title>S&amp;P 500 Stocks Biggest Weekly Changes in Target Price -- NVDA is the #3 Biggest Loser.</Title><Username>i_read_best</Username><Timestamp>1352582382016</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-10 16:19:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So Best? If current CEO Jen and his interim CFO could just learn to answer the analyst's fine questions -- openly, honestly, truthfully, painstakingly fully and completely -- maybe the analysts wouldn't treat Jen's stock so horribly badly. But instead Jen plays his little cat-and-mouse games with the analyst's questions. Basically not answering Any of them. So the analysts use their folding hatchets on the nvda estimates. 'Cause Jen failed to answer their simple questions about the business. Wack! Wack! Wack! Wack!

Look for the highly popular post entitled, "Jeepers Best, Everybody else pays a dividend." Best clearly pressured Jen to declare his First-Ever Cash Dividend.

Apple Inc. and HTC Corp.announced a broad ten-year licensing agreement that settles all of the lawsuits between the companies around the world. More specific terms of the deal were not disclosed. An HTC spokeswoman also declined to provide specifics of the deal but said the company does not expect the license agreement to have an Adverse Material Impact on the company. The broad patent deal comes after HTC suffered several legal setbacks, such as a decision in the U.S. International Trade Commission that said Apple's iPhone and iPad mobile devices had not infringed HTC's patents. In a separate case, the ITC found HTC's phones infringed Apple's patents. In striking the settlement, HTC joins Nokia Corp. as the latest handset maker to have settled litigation with Apple. The settlement comes as Apple has become an epicenter of a global patent war among industry titans, including Samsung Electronics Co. and Google Inc.'s Motorola MSI handset unit. Apple was asked several times to attempt a settlement with Samsung during its high-profile case in a California court several months ago. Heads of both firms held talks, but they were unable to strike a deal. Apple ultimately won the case, with a jury awarding it $1 billion in damages. Samsung said it will appeal that decision. Mr. Cook has expressed interest in settling those cases as well, on conference calls and in interviews, but so far neither Apple or its remaining courtroom opponents have been able to reach agreements. " Nokia Samsung And now HTC The patent infringers are lining up like cattle to pay their iTribute to Apple.</Msg><Username>i_read_best</Username><Timestamp>1352607250785</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-10 23:14:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
