Note: The IPOD Touch has a camera but weaker battery than the Shield. Add in a little for the game pad and distributors cut for selling on Gamer hardware websites or Google Play (free) and Nvidia should easily make $100 to $125 per device sold. I think that is a fair price and profit along with the immense publicity Nvidia has and will have for their Tegra 4 chip, GPUs and Nvidia Grid. It's a Gamer add on for sure and their are 35 million of them world wide.According to Jon Peddie 31% of all GPUs are Performance or Enthusiast Class. Nvidia sells between 3M to 4M of these high performance GPUs to gamers each quarter which is 12M to 16M high performance GPUs per year. It is not unimaginable that 10-15% will buy The Shield 1.2M to 2.4M in yearly sales for the Shield is reasonable. Nice revenue and profit pop from a hobby and marketing vehicle. Note: When you go to the GameStop website you will see that all the Tegra tablets are bundled with some low cost games from TegraZone for a sale event. As someone has already said the bundling with High End Nvidia GPUs having coupons for X off The Shield is going to happen for sure.

That won't make a difference unless the ARMs have some value proposition to offer over the already 64-bit Atoms to overcome the huge lack of legacy software for WinRT which allows Atom to exclusively double up as fully functional PCs. It's an uphill battle for WinRT. It only made sense originally if Atom had not got down to ARM levels of power with Clovertrail which might then have forced a lot more PC software vendors to port their software to ARM.</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1358012719046</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 12:45:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358013375505-16</Id><Topic><Title>Lenovo dumped tegra and Win RT in their yoga tablet.

We have confirmed that Nvidia has already sent out samples of the current revision of the chip and that the final version is on the way. Nvidia will probably have to wait for full blown production in order to set the final frequency. Nvidia partners are currently working on phones and tablets based on the chip, and Nvidia itself said that its Project Shield mini console is to be expected in Q2 2013. Tegra 4 ends up significantly faster than Tegra 3 and the new A15 28nm core should ensure lower power consumption as well. The competition, namely Qualcomm and Samsung are throwing their A15 solutions in the fight for the performance crown and the high-end ARM market will be very crowded in 2013. We are not sure why Nvidia didn’t talk about the fact that Tegra 4 comes with USB 3.0 support which we see as significant, as we did see it on leaked spec sheets late last year.</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1358029251684</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 17:20:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358029680444-24</Id><Topic><Title>Attention maravian/getanid - dell xps not yet shipping</Title><Username>apollinaire123</Username><Timestamp>1357939063642</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 16:17:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"at least marsavian respects the truth - and usually provide the pertinent links." then you should respect the truth... where did anyone claim it was shipping... and you never answered why you hide behind multiple aliases...</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1358029680444</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 17:28:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358033115490-25</Id><Title>NVDA missed the rally?

Probably the control section of input is one or two blocks of code that would need additions for new control elements. Like an hour for development and two hours testing. I will try to make an android game myself now for my kids. Gonna be nice to try with the Shield controllers too.</Msg><Username>frankduxbusborg</Username><Timestamp>1358043186033</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 21:13:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358044526616-32</Id><Topic><Title>NVDA missed the rally?

For the drawing to win a toy Shield. If giving away nonexistant products as prizes isn't illegal in Spain. Somebody call Legal on that, okay? That's it. Folding card table, cute Spanish girl, fish bowl to win a free toy Shield." Not so good news from Legal, Best. Legal says it lacks "mutuality" -- "la reciprocidad" is the Spanish legal word -- to require the winner to be present to win, if the contest prize isn't, -- and in fact, the contest prize might never be present. So the drawing for a vaporware toy Shield is out, boys. There's good news though. Legal suggests that nvidia go with the same fish bowl contest prize that everybody else at trade shows use.
