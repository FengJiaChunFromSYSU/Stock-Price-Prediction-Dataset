Third-quarter revenues of NT$70.2 billion met the company's low-end target of NT$70-80 billion set for the quarter and LOWER than market expectations of NT$75 billion. Net profits for the third quarter stood at NT$3.9 billion, DECREASING 47% from the previous quarter and 78% from a year earlier. Third-quarter EPS was NT$4.7, the LOWEST quarterly performance since the first quarter of 2005, according to company data. For the first nine months of 2012, revenues amounted to NT$229.01 billion, a DECLINE of 37.2% from a year earlier. The sales setback in September, which came after HTC launched two new models, the HTC J and HTC Desire X, in the month and the market is heading into a peak season, indicated that telecom carriers and channel operators were REDUCING their buying, particularly those in the US and Europe, commented industry watchers. HTC's recent trust to pushing sales of mid-range smartphones to China and other emerging markets could have affected the company's profitability for the third quarter, the sources added. Smartphones shipped to China are expected to account for 30% of HTC's total shipments in the second half of 2012, while contributing to 20% of HTC's total revenues, the sources estimated." My my my. The #1 largest android phone maker -- HTC -- is struggling, boys. And struggling Badly. "Net profits for the third quarter stood at NT$3.9 billion, DECREASING 47% from the previous quarter and [DECREASING] 78% from a year earlier.

It is NOT design wins that count. NOR the mere moving of volume. And it's certaintly NOT about trophies -- purchased by the egotistical recipient. Oh no no no. When the Captains of Industry compete -- it is about Profits. Yes OBSCENE PROFITS, panicaroo. The bottom line. The emoluments of capitalistic plunder. The lucre of the Laffer Curve. The remuneration for wisely taking risk. The winnings. The harvest. The bountiful surplus from profitable production. The skim. The very best part -- the Net -- in Net Income. Self-proclaimed Prophet Jen has achieved none of those things. With his woefully misguided tegra fiasco. Have you unfurled the latest 10-Q, panicaroo? And cast down your eyes upon it. Hummm? Scroll down to page 28 of the 10-Q inscriptions dated as of July 29, 2012 A.D. And Behold! You will witness the false prophesy of your thinking. $312.1 million __ CPB (tegra) Revenues for the 6 months ($191.6) million __ CPB (tegra) LOSSES recorded for the 6 months of 2012 A.D. Yes my son, it's hard to fathom at first. How the heck self-proclaimed Prophet Jen managed to Lose More than Total Revenues -- but your false prophet did it. He sure did. Making himself the laughing stock of the Real Prophets. Like Prophet Jacobs, and Prophet Otellini, and Prophet Rory. Do you see now panicaroo, how your thinking is woefully misguided? Yes Woefully. It is NOT design wins that count. NOR the mere shipping volume of anything. And it's certaintly NOT about trophies -- purchased by the egotistical recepient. Oh no no no. IT'S ALL ABOUT THE PROFITS. Or as is found in the hapless village of nvidia -- the lack of profits.

With the of two top mobiles out of reach, with #3 tablet acct/a a mzn out of reach, the market is just not big enough to support the size of the of program. And to add insult to injury, now they are even behind in new new product development, namely quad A15s. The minimum Jen needs to do is to admit to the investment community that there is a real problem and then lay out the plans to balance he books. But you know that is not going to come from that egomanics. The last thing that guy can admit to is that the whole problem was caused by him. As such, the stock has no bottom.</Msg><Username>whosunw</Username><Timestamp>1349835219272</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 22:13:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349835323421-38</Id><Topic><Title>Lennovo launched its Win RT tablet, Yoga II, today at a New York event</Title><Username>moorelawyer</Username><Timestamp>1349828429423</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 20:20:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>like I said, 3 winRT tablets = winRT DOA.
