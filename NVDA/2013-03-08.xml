We need MORE volume to break through 13, and as the chart to the right shows, from the last 2 days attempts, there just wasn't enough to do so. Again, I'm VERY surprised at the lack of volume, and can't quite figure out why none of the BIG shareholders hasn't simply done it by themselves, but it appears to still be a game of "chicken" and no one wants to go first. However, given that the Open Interest in the March 13 calls has GROWN this week, and is now 48k (representing almost 5mm shares), I still think that next week will see something that gets us through that level, and if there IS some decent volume, then the battle at 13-13 1/8 will be fierce and getting above that level will give a straight shot to 14 and then 15, IMHO. Given what was said at yesterday's presentation about everyone "mark your calendars for March 19th when we will have further announcements", I suspect that by expiration, people will be buying in anticipation of that date, which is the following Monday. Most of the semis are down, today....INTC down 1.2%, TXN and BRCM down .8% and NVDA is up a penny or two. The day is young. As always, we'll know in the fullness of time.

Just now able to reconnect with Yahoo boards. Anyway, IF I'm going to be right, we will see a sudden surge in volume and price out of the blue. I haven't seen a set up THIS compelling in quite some time, and I just bought some of the March 13 calls, myself, at 11 cents. Of course, the "cabal" that has been holding NVDA down with the ability to throw 10-20k shares at it as it tries to move higher, may have overstayed their welcome. Shorts usually do, and with the INCREASE in the OI in those calls, it just suggests to me that someone is going to make them pay in a big way for staying short with the kind of news coming out of the company. Perhaps they'll find a way to keep the stock below 13 through next week, but I'll be VERY surprised if the stock doesn't at least get through there for part of the week, and then the issue will be if the cabal is strong enough to knock it back down to the strike by Friday. I've seen NVDA go through 2-3 strikes in a week, just when people thought it could never happen. As always, we'll know in the fullness of time.

That would put Shield's price tag above the PlayStation Vita's $249, and the Nintendo 3DS' $170.

It WOULD be nice, AND fun, to see it on a quiet Friday, like today, but whenever it comes, watch for a move of 5-10 cents in a hurry, with BIG blocks changing hands, and furious attempts by the cabal to hit the bids with 10-20-30k share blocks, but THIS time it won't work. You might get a hint if you see the price of the 13s start to climb with volume, right beforehand. If not today, next week should still give us a shot since if we don't sell off hard, today, we'll have closed the week over the 200DMA for the first time in 5-6 months, if not more. That's a very positive sign, technically. Don't give up. Things ARE about to change. No one, except the BIG boys and girls, know when that will be, but I'm guessing it's soon.

Spotted by Japanese blog Macotakara, the China Times report cited an unnamed industry watcher as saying that Apple plans to use Taiwanese chipmaker TSMC's 28nm process to build the cheap iPhone's Snapdragon SoC. If true, the switch away from Samsung's foundries would be a first for the Cupertino company, which has pushed increasingly further into chip design with its latest A6 and A6X processors. Apple will supposedly continue to manufacture the A-series silicon used in the iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S, as well as the A6 chips from the iPhone 5 and fourth-generation iPad. While suspicious, the rumor is not without merit, as two 28nm-based classes of Snapdragon, specifically the 400 and 800 series, offer on-board communications including a cellular modem, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. If Apple is indeed planning to launch a cheap handset in developing markets, the use of an all-in-one platform could save on component costs. Some Snapdragon iterations also come with 4G LTE compatibility, though the publication claims that Apple will stick to 3G for its initial low-cost iPhone. Additionally, the Chinese publication said Renesas Electronics will produce the device's LCD drivers, while NAND flash memory will be sourced from Toshiba, Elpida, Micron Technology, SK Hynix and SanDisk. Rumors of a Snapdragon-based iPhone first arose in January, with the firm's dual-core and quad-core SoCs cited as possible candidates for the as-yet-unannounced handset. Most recently, well-connected analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted that Apple would introduce a low-cost iPhone boasting a hybrid fiberglass/plastic case this summer alongside the next-generation "iPhone 5S," though no mention was made of a platform switch.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1362778828992</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 16:40:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362778968744-34</Id><Topic><Title>Apple reportedly to use Qualcomm snapdragon for low-cost iPhone</Title><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1362778828992</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 16:40:28 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If the rumor is true, it would open a flood gate.

I had to check back at the posts. it's actually schmenkle who is grfxbstrd, in my opinion, not that it getanid couldn't be schmenkle also, but i can't prove that. i'm fairly sure i can prove grfxbstrd is schmenkle. one merely needs to go back a few posts in grfxbstrd's history and see he mistakenly replied a part 2 to schmenkle's part 1 . anyways, I truly appreciate the few brilliant ppl left on this board who still take the time to inform others. they include, in my opinion, ibexx, getanid, grfxbstrd, norcalnative, and several others. sorry if i leave some off. that's all i can think of at the moment. I've held this stock since 2004. I'm getting sick of the waiting and waiting. this board has been overrun by a couple idiots who apparently can't stop complaining about this company and haven't figured out they can invest in other companies if they want.</Msg><Username>hydroponic_tomatoes</Username><Timestamp>1362780664847</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 17:11:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362780821937-37</Id><Topic><Title>IN DEPTH NVDA Analyst Report.</Title><Username>sherrie.morris</Username><Timestamp>1362325153713</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-03 10:39:13 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>thanks for sharing</Msg><Username>sarahsimpson830</Username><Timestamp>1362780821937</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 17:13:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362781826634-38</Id><Topic><Title>ooops to getanid and schmenckle.</Title><Username>hydroponic_tomatoes</Username><Timestamp>1362780664847</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 17:11:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hydro, Glad you agree I'm not any of the other ids...

"NV's Tegra 4i SoC could certainly be in the running for Apple business...." eh... don't think so, T3i is missing a couple of 'cheap' radios. And pretty soon, T3i will be missing FOUR cheap radios, wifi, bluetooth, GPS, NFC. this is playing up to exactly what brcm has been predicting and setting themselves for for quite a few years now. Last guys standing will be the ones with enuogh IP to make fully integrated solutions for anything less than bleeding edge. Not even the Chinese can stay in this game. nvda... left with their windoz drivers and huge loses. Game over nvda. "though the publication claims that Apple will stick to 3G for its initial low-cost iPhone." like I was saying last weekend, T3i is only good if the 3G works.</Msg><Username>whosunw</Username><Timestamp>1362794049808</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 20:54:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362804413733-44</Id><Topic><Title>Project Sheild will destroy PS4 with its android games.</Title><Username>will_amd_yu</Username><Timestamp>1362793915548</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 20:51:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>irrelevant</Msg><Username>ltenow</Username><Timestamp>1362804413733</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 23:46:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362804724351-45</Id><Topic><Title>Project Shield will sell for $300-$400</Title><Username>norcalnative_2</Username><Timestamp>1362768059200</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 13:40:59 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Agreed.
