The canadian site canadacomputers does not have the usual half dozen varities of T3 tablets anymore, with the exception of the Nexus 7. My guess is Asus is trimming inventories to get ready for a refresh. But then, Asus ships nothing. It takes 30 Asus at 100k/quarter to make up for a 1M/month Nexus 7. Translated, watch Tegra sales fall off the cliff when Nexus 7 refresh comes out. Hopeless. No chance to get into aapl/samsung/amzn.

Of course these higher scores were on special ‘test’ equipment likely optimized for chip performance, and HP’s test was one a prototype device. These combined factors mean that the 23,000 still sounds like reasonable enough performance for the Tegra 4.</Msg><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1367253026393</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 12:30:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367254475492-26</Id><Topic><Title>HP Slate 21 and Tegra 4 benchmarks</Title><Username>justfine790</Username><Timestamp>1367253026393</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 12:30:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>21 inch all in one/tablet has a bunch more pixels than a 5 inch phone.</Msg><Username>j7777kxx</Username><Timestamp>1367254475492</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 12:54:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367254627864-27</Id><Title>Krissie</Title><Msg>Don't they take your pennies away on a day like today?

At the recent AMD earnings CC, analysts kept asking Rory Road for an estimated profit margin from the game consoles, but Read would not talk. Finally, an analyst asked him whether the gross margin from xbox/ps4 (as a group) would be LOWER than AMD's (already low) existing gross gross, Rory Read kinda sidetracked the question and quickly moved on to the next.... I think AMD wanted these high-profile deals at the expense of business fundamentals.....it could be setting itself up for a block sale.</Msg><Username>ibexx</Username><Timestamp>1367283997559</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 21:06:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367288029667-81</Id><Topic><Title>oO, goog no longer spreading the wealth to nvda</Title><Username>whosunw</Username><Timestamp>1367278689589</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 19:38:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Weak tegra priced in????
