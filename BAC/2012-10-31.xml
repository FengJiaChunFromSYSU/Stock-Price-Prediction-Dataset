Times and the tide are against them in this age of information revolution. Where can a liar hide now? Public opinion is becoming the strongest force in our times and thus military might is no more valid in these times. It is good to have military might when the unjust, the dictator, the fanatic, the ideologue, the religionists TRY to impose their brand of beliefs on others. But then PUBLIC OPINION against them COULD PEACEFULLY achieve what may be too destructive a means to achieve in our times of powerful wmds. The future appears bright for humans so long as we have the facts and the truth and be VIGILANT!

Look for another Mitt flip flop, or Mitt walk back. Just how would any one state be able to deal with and overcome the devastation wrecked upon New York and New Jersey?

Jeep NOT moving to China. LMAO!!</Title><Msg>zevoter is a colossal lying FOOL!! October 30, 2012, 12:45 pm Jeep Production Isn’t Moving to China, Chrysler Chief Says By JEREMY W. PETERS AND JIM RUTENBERG Chrysler’s chief executive on Tuesday strongly refuted claims that production of Jeeps would shift to China, an insistence that cast further doubt on the Romney campaign’s recent efforts to undercut President Obama’s support for the auto industry as it fights for Ohio’s 18 electoral votes. In an e-mail to employees, the chief executive, Sergio Marchionne, said that Jeep’s commitment to the United States was unequivocal. “I feel obliged to unambiguously restate our position: Jeep production will not be moved from the United States to China,” he wrote. “It is inaccurate to suggest anything different.” Mr. Marchionne’s response — an unusually forceful gesture from the chief executive of a major American corporation a week before Election Day — came as the politics of the auto bailout took center stage in the presidential campaign. The Romney campaign has come under considerable criticism in recent days for taking liberties with the facts in a new television commercial that suggests Jeep, a recipient of federal bailout money, will soon outsource American jobs to China. Chrysler, Jeep’s parent company, does not in fact have plans to cut its American work force but is considering opening a facility in China where it would produce Jeeps for sale locally. Mr. Marchionne said that those efforts would only bolster the strength of Chrysler in the United States, not undermine it. “Jeep is one of our truly global brands with uniquely American roots. This will never change,” he said.</Msg><Username>frankmangus</Username><Timestamp>1351682473026</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 07:21:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351682721982-72</Id><Topic><Title>Let's count.

The message was contained in a meme which demonstrated how Obama had relied on the SEALS when he was ready to let them get Osama bin Laden, and how he had turned around and denied them when they called for backup on Sept 11. I spoke with Larry Ward, president of Political Media, Inc -- the media company that handles SOS postings and media production. Ward was the one who personally put the Navy SEAL meme up, and the one who received the warning from Facebook and an eventual 24 hour suspension from Facebook because Ward put the meme back up after Facebook told him to take it down. Here's what Ward told me: We created and posted this meme on Saturday after news broke that Obama had known and denied SEALS the backup they requested. Once the meme was up it garnered 30,000 shares, approx. 24,000 likes, and was read by hundreds of thousands of people -- all within 24 hrs. On Sunday, I went into the SOS Facebook page to post something else and found a warning from Facebook that we had violated Facebook's Statement of Rights and Responsibilities with our meme. So I copied the warning, put it on the meme as as caption, and re-posted the meme to the Facebook page. Along with the re-posted meme, Ward put a link to the Facebook "feedback comment" inbox so visitors to the SOS page could send a message to Facebook if they were as outraged over the meme being jerked down as he was.</Msg><Username>whitest_white</Username><Timestamp>1351685608873</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 08:13:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351685963071-83</Id><Title>Trump Joins 47% Of Americans, Files For Government Help After Storm Hits His Assets</Title><Msg>Trump offer to President Obama turns into I-O-U, to be paid after government sends him a check.

He hasn't done one single thing for this country other than get rid of Bin Laden 2. Gas prices up 2x 3. Massive debt with not a single change in unemployment. 4. And all these comparisons to Bush is ludacrious. The stock market collapsed shortly after Bush took office because of Clinton's #$%$ policies and we had one of the worst terrorist attacks in history under Bush. Why not compare Romney to Reagan, same policies. Or maybe i should compare the similar democratic policies of Obama to Clinton.. Wow, that's right, they're just not working..He's an amateur. 5. His policies are supposed to help the lower and middle classes but are actually destroying them with higher gas and food prices. 6. He had his chance at tax reform so that people like Buffett and the hollywood idiots would actually pay more taxes but he did nothing. Why? Because he needed the campaign money.... 7. Cash for clunkers 8. Bailout for auto industry that could have been acheived through the normal bankrupcy proceedings just like other industries like airlines. 9. He never accepts blame for anything. 10. If the democratic policies were so great then Obama would have achieved something other than miserable failure. 11.

It will be like GWB in office when we had 911, two wars, and the financial system came very close to a crash. But Romney being in command of his mother tongue and versed in salesmanship... he will keep lying smoothly as if he is telling the truth with that glazed-smile eyes!

And, we don't know the universe of his thinking about foreign policy. We should look at terrorism but we didn't; I don't know what Barack Obama's world view is; we need to bring intellectual vigor into the process.) Well, unfortunately, the American people were not provided with all the information they needed about this character Barack Hussein Obama II. So, what could possibly go wrong if Barack Hussein Obama II got to be POTUS? Well, we've had over 45 months to find out and it's fugly!

Trillion$$$plus deficits to the horizon and beyond. QE3...$40 Billion per month to infinity. Over 100 million on some kind of welfare scheme. Record numbers on food stamps. Record numbers on the poverty roll. Record numbers not looking for work. Record numbers receiving disability assistance. Annual compliance costs now exceed $400 billion. record borrowing to prop up all of those Prog schemes. Obama unemployment rate above 8% longer than any other President since 1948 (adjusted down below 8% the other day since there are now even fewer looking for work). And, Barry's "Kill your Health" scheme which has already started with its looting and controlling and its meddling, tinkering, intruding and interfering in every aspect of our lives, our children, our families, our schools, our churches, our doctors, our hospitals, our faith, our farms, our energy sources, our communities, our private property, our health-care and our businesses; clearly the most evil Prog scheme to ever be jammed down the throats of the American people.

Ambassador Susan Rice says Terrorists caused Hurricane Sandy Looting &amp; Fights in South Brooklyn..Updated: 10/31/2012 12:01 pm EDT Ambassador Susan Rice stated today that water that had risen six feet high hadn't completely drained away from the streets of Coney Island in Brooklyn, N.Y., when Libyan terrorists had already rifled through the remains of vulnerable shops on Mermaid Avenue. Rice says the terrorists are attempting to blame the robberies on nice, well mannered, black Christian youth groups who support President Hussein Obama; all in an effort to influence the presidential election. Ambassador Rice has scheduled five Sunday talk shows this weekend to make sure the American public has all the facts regarding this assault on the dignity of the Obama Administration. “Transparency is our top priority” says Ambassador Rice.</Msg><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1351727650243</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 19:54:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351727654158-345</Id><Topic><Title>Former Seals Heroes Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods Ignored Obama's Stand Down Order</Title><Username>obama_sucksass</Username><Timestamp>1351664494587</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 02:21:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama is Guilty of High Treason and Murder</Msg><Username>obama_sucksass</Username><Timestamp>1351727654158</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 19:54:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351727715500-346</Id><Topic><Title>Does anybody know why Romney's grandfather moved to Mexico</Title><Username>lookfwd</Username><Timestamp>1350525106224</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 21:51:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Romney family like to stay on top of their women, Mexico allows they to do what they want.</Msg><Username>fireundersmoke</Username><Timestamp>1351727715500</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 19:55:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351727744031-347</Id><Title>Obama is a Liar and Murderer</Title><Msg>Should be Thrown in Prison</Msg><Username>obama_sucksass</Username><Timestamp>1351727744031</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 19:55:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351727880462-348</Id><Topic><Title>NJ CHRIS TO ROMNEY DON'T SHOW YOUR FACE HERE IN NJ.

Today's Pre- Announcement: NetSol Technologies Expects Record First Quarter Revenue - Total Preliminary Revenue Expected in the Range of $10 to $11 Million - To Hold Fiscal 2013 First Quarter Results Conference Call on November 14 CALABASAS, Calif., Oct. 31, 2012 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NetSol Technologies, Inc. (NTWK), a worldwide provider of global IT and enterprise application solutions, today provided preliminary revenue results for the first quarter ended September 30, 2012. Preliminary revenue results indicate the company's strongest first quarter ever, with revenue expected in the range of $10 million to $11 million. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Pre-earnings implications: - The $11 million expected Fiscal 1Q 2013 revenue will yield 20 -30c/share net income. In 1Q 2012 the company reported 6.2 million in revenues and 30c/share loss. - Strongest 1Q ever - 4th Quarter or significant Y/Y improvements in top and bottom lines - 1Q 2013 Revenues are in line with the $48 million revenue projection for fiscal 2013 or 40% higher than 2012. - Projected $1/share net income (current guidance) will probably be exceeded - Company will likely increase guidance for 2013 because 1Q is always the weakest quarter. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- An analyst covering the stock recently upped its earnings projections for NTWK based on significant increased global demand for all of its software products and services (legacy and cloud) Selected Analyst Comments: All business lines are very strong growth across the board. Significant demand for all legacy and cloud products. NTWK is entering FY13 with a $25 million backlog and approximately $100 million in qualified leads.

The new find sheds further light on the disaster in Benghazi and the administration's role in it and the subsequent cover up ... Libyans: Al-Qaida handled 'security' at Tripoli embassy Documents show assignment ran through at least spring of 2012 A secret document that has been obtained by former terrorist turned peace advocate Walid Shoebat suggests the Obama administration apparently approved assigning a member of al-Qaida to handle security at the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli. According to a report published today by Shoebat, the confirmation comes from a letter dated Aug. 30, 2011, that informs the al-Qaida member that he now has responsibility for security in Tripoli, “to include all international embassies.” The letter was to Abdel Hakim al-Khowailidi Belhaj and it was signed by Mustafa Muhammad Abdul Jalil on behalf of the National Transitional Council, with which the U.S. was working at the time after Moammar Gadhafi fell from power in Libya. Belhaj previously has been described by al-Qaida kingpin Ayman al-Zawahiri as “the amir of the mujahideen, the patient and steadfast [Belhaj].” Shoebat, who was joined by Ben Barrack in the investigation of the document, said the letter was from “a treasure trove of secret documents” that was obtained by a Libyan source. “It shows that in supporting the removal of Gadhafi, the Obama administration seemed to sign on to an arrangement that left forces loyal to al-Qaida in charge of security at the U.S. embassy in Tripoli from 2011 through at least the spring of 2012,” they wrote. Shoebat’s translation of the letter reveals it said, “We would like to inform you that you have been commissioned to the duties and responsibilities of the military committee of the city of Tripoli. These include taking all necessary procedures to secure the safety of the Capital and its citizens, its public and private property, and institutions, to include all international embassies. To coordinate with the local community of the city of Tripoli and the security assembly and defense on a national level.” Shoebat explained that al-Zawahiri’s endorsement of Belhaj came in a 2007 interview that was replayed by ABC. The report also said that Belhaj had been identified as “a Libyan rebel and a moderate person who commands wide respect,” but Shoebat noted the source of that statement was “a leader with the Libyan Muslim Brotherhood” – Ali Sulaiman Aujali. Aujali appeared at a convention for the Islamic Society of North America, considered by many to be a front group for the Muslim Brotherhood in America, just a few weeks before vouching for Belhaj, Shoebat reported. And the Libyan ambassador to the U.S. reported at one point that “[Belhaj] should be accept[ed] for the person that he is today and we should deal with him on that basis.” OBAMA IS NOT ONE OF U.S. !!!!!!
