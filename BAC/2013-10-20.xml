If the Republican party wishes to address healthcare other than to say if you can't pay huge premiums, you don't receive any...then I will listen to their ideas! I have been seriously ill in the previous system, in between employment with no healthcare insurance coverage and yes, I did receive life-saving care but I was charged 3x what the procedures cost if you would of had insurance do to the fact that I didn't have a negotiated rate? Plus, I was denied coverage because of the pre-existing loophole after recovering. Had I not had money squirreled away, it would have pushed me into personal bankruptcy and cost me everything I had worked for my whole life. That is just BS and the Republican party understands this and should stop BS-ing the public about free market theory when it comes to healthcare. For years, the efficient-market hypothesis did not work any better in healthcare than it did in the recent housing bubble. Healthcare is one area where a civil society just can't accept rapacious capitalism driven by Wall street plutocrats greed for every increasing profits.</Msg><Username>andym_30054</Username><Timestamp>1382264735576</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-10-20 06:25:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382265486491-17</Id><Topic><Title>Donna Ryan, President, CGI Federal...please see the POTUS for an #$%$ chewing!</Title><Username>andym_30054</Username><Timestamp>1382207809080</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-10-19 14:36:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Getting ready for a bike ride to hopefully put-off needing healthcare services...ha..

We have to get the money from the only people that have it, the wealthy, by raising the maximum tax rate to the same level that Republican Eisenhower raised it to in the 1950s. But Eisenhower's actions paid the national debt down to a reasonable level in less than 8 years. We are NOT going to pay off the national debt by stabbing the middle class worker in the heart by reducing Social security, medicare, and ObamaCare, and the poor by harming medicaid. Republicans will not be allowed to harm America. Whether Republicans lose control of the House and don't gain control of the Senate in 2014 or 2016, it is going to happen.

ROFLMFO. I keep telling you we needed ross perot. I don't like mandatory payments simply for existing but you can't judge the quality of the program by a few bad pieces that can be fixed but this is the nightmare scenario for health care payments. The news pieces show things like patients being treated when they should just show the people at the hospital cashier, that is all that has been attempted no new innovations in health care just money moving. Everyone was blaming republicans for gov shutdown how come dems aren't upset about BART making a mess of SF? Now of course as we adopt the Greek solution everyone finds a need for their angry dum aas to impeded someone else. I guess the BART employees don't expect home equity and social security to work out? It is always easier to get angry and impede someone else than analyze problems for stable solutions. The ego bubble will make people angry. Without the trade deficiet and the bailout trump caste that wormed its way to prominence along with everyone else who turned companies into social programs, the glory days of detroit could have been continued and everyone with just about any job could afford a decent home with a stable value. Now all those pensions loaded with mortgages and great boasts are just making people angry rather than secure. All praise the humans. You can complain about military hardware costs but that usually leads to innovations, note GPS. 85 billion a month in fast food would have done more to increase wages for productive amerucans that did not already work by an oil field. Perhaps the king could talk to people about somekind of food catapult or launcher. This would not work with burgers but maybe blocks of cheese? Until some one finds a way to automate that it will have value.</Msg><Username>spocklovesyou</Username><Timestamp>1382311707967</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-10-20 19:28:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382311779311-106</Id><Topic><Title>Tea bagger trash, GOP cronies, KKK, Rush-ling lemmings..., DO THE RIGHT THING!</Title><Username>lobotomize_republicans</Username><Timestamp>1377292446286</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-08-23 17:14:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Grover Norquist started this mess with an army of terrorists that were put in our House of Congress, if they think the pledge they made to terrorist Norquist is more important than the pledge they made to our flag, we need to burn one of them.</Msg><Username>fireundersmoke</Username><Timestamp>1382311779311</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-10-20 19:29:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1382312270309-107</Id><Title>$15.00 OR BUST THIS WEEK...................BANKS ARE GOING TO HV A GOOD WEEK THIS COMING WEEK</Title><Msg>We are at the start of the last qtr of the year 2013 and 2014 looks better for all banks around the world......., and this is always good for the banks for people ===spend-p.e.r.i.o.d.=== !!!!!!</Msg><Username>wildwestflash</Username><Timestamp>1382312270309</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-10-20 19:37:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382312573752-108</Id><Topic><Title>I am so embarrassed and ashamed that I was ever associated with the Tea Party jackasses</Title><Username>zevoter33</Username><Timestamp>1381921336134</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-16 07:02:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Or, those little crosses we use to burn on the lawns of all the coloreds.</Msg><Username>zevoter33</Username><Timestamp>1382312573752</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-10-20 19:42:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1382312738890-109</Id><Title>Other big U.S. banks are bracing for the fallout from J.P.

Money will of course determine who makes the cut, but less of it will be needed if you start by croaking millions with free burgers and fries to get the game rolling.

The “navigators” receiving the taxpayer dollars will help people shop for and enroll in plans that will eventually be available on the new federal government market places. The so-called navigators will perform their duties in a “culturally competent manner,” according to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the agency doling out the cash. The money will be divided between 105 mostly leftist groups (surprise, surprise) that will help the uninsured sign up for coverage and understand their options. Here are a few examples of the community organizations receiving navigator grants from the government; an Arizona nonprofit called “Campesinos Sin Fronteras” that provides services to farm workers and low-income Hispanics; a south Florida legal group that will provide navigators in “racially, ethnically, linguistically, culturally and socioeconomically diverse” communities; three Planned Parenthood branches—in Iowa, Montana and New Hampshire—got a combined $655,000 to serve as navigators. Here are a few other grant recipients worth mentioning; the Arab Community Center in Michigan is getting nearly $300,000 to reach out to and engage uninsured community members through “multicultural” media. A Black Chamber of Commerce in South Carolina is receiving north of $230,000 to “provide outreach around new coverage options” and a Hispanic aging group in Texas will receive over $646,000 help members that are “socially isolated due to cultural and linguistic differences.” t’s tough not to see that there is a huge racial component in the administration’s efforts. The government is spending big bucks targeting minorities in a seemingly desperate effort to salvage the president’s hostile takeover of the nation’ healthcare system.</Msg><Username>fdr_fdr_fdr_fdr</Username><Timestamp>1382320676792</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-10-20 21:57:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382321118326-156</Id><Topic><Title>Obamacare: Multi-Million Dollar Corruption Central</Title><Username>fdr_fdr_fdr_fdr</Username><Timestamp>1382320676792</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-10-20 21:57:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"the president’s hostile takeover of the nation’ healthcare system" Congress passed the ACA.

The New York Post reported today that an Obamacare grant recipient, Seedco, was sued by the federal government in 2012 for lying on government reports in order to receive additional bonus money. As reported by the New York Times last year, Seedco received more than $8 million in federal grants for operating job placement centers. According to federal prosecutors, Seedco falsely reported that it had successfully matched jobseekers with jobs by basing their claims on the positions jobseekers already had. “By reporting thousands of fake job placements, Seedco collected ‘performance payments’ totaling perhaps as much as $1.6 million over five years,” reported Michael Powell with the New York Times. The lawsuit did not stop the federal government from awarding Seedco another multi-million dollar contract, this time as a coordinator for the Obamacare Navigator program. The Navigator program provides millions of dollars to organizations such as Seedco to hire “navigators” who will advise Americans on their Obamacare health “options” based on the sensitive information provided, such as social security numbers, income levels, employment history and home addresses. In an article we broke last week, the very nature of the Navigator program will attract identity thieves who can literally go door-to-door to ask Americans for their personal information under the guise of Obamacare enrollment. “These navigators will have our consumers throughout the country’s most personal and private information: tax return information, Social Security information,” Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi said in an interview with Fox. “And our biggest fear, of course, is identity theft.</Msg><Username>fdr_fdr_fdr_fdr</Username><Timestamp>1382321294555</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-10-20 22:08:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382321325339-158</Id><Topic><Title>6 BILLIONDOLLARS, OUCH</Title><Username>gamblin09</Username><Timestamp>1382303196493</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-10-20 17:06:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>LOOKING to fine 6B..

With a server farm humming 24-7 powered by a series of short block chevy engines, AL-JO_BAHB launches their relentless assaults on healthcare.gov. I was lucky enough to be granted an exclusive interview with the leader: Al, who also goes by the codename Nutscratcher, says "Yeah me an JO and BAHB just stays up all naaaht drinkin and hackin and stuff.

Aaah need to keep maah creative juices flowin if yaah know what aaah mean." At that point the interview was cut short as BAHB had just diverted all the applications from New York to their server. AL and JO began feverishly replacing applicant information with Lyrics from Lynyrd Skynyrd songs. While I can't agree with their tactics I have to admire their, dare I say it, #$%$" ingenuity.
