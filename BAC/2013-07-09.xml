It is also important to remember that no mortgage player ever killed anyone due to human error execpt if you caount secondary problems from displacing people from homes due to bursting ego bubbles. Luckily everyone from the UAW to the AMA has been against automation and now you can see why, how many jobs and heroes have machines displaced? How much longer have people who know how to read and write communicated non-heroic messages and solved recurring problems that made heroes and made life worth living and luzing? ROFLMFO. It is easy to look at the burned out airplane and think about disrupted travel plans and human injuries, but remember all the heroes and economic growth it created and remember how much safer it is to trade tampons that try to lurn how to fly. If people were meant to wortk with dangerours equipment, financials would have no reason to exist and be cosntantly bailedout for making people feel good. And what about doctors? They end up killing people too. Did mozillo ever kill anyone due to his own negligence? If you are holding out for a hero, submit an abstract to the Al Bundy Kyle Dube economics conference. ROFLMFO. welcome to the human network. You will urn all of this at the la bundy kyle dube economic and social development workshop if you pay the admission fee and get microhipped to gain access to all the events. ROFLMFO.

LOL BAC's earning power is only now going to become visible as the margin expands and the strucural de-risking/reduced provisioning sinks in on the ridiculously ill-informed and sophomoric pm running managed money out there. BAC's CURRENT capital and earning power leaves them better than all set, and you can take a few months to figure it out or just ignore my comments -- see if I care. The FDIC proposal focuses on tangible common to risk-weighted assets... the Fed Reserve rule passed today is all about tangible common to tangible assets as defined.

The rule, launched by the country's three main banking regulators, would impose a so-called leverage ratio, a hard cap on how much banks can borrow to fund their business, requiring them to hold equity capital equal to 6 percent of total assets. The global capital accord known as Basel III, named after the Swiss city that is home to overseer Bank of International Settlements, sets a leverage ratio of 3 percent, which critics say is unambitious. "A three percent minimum supplementary leverage ratio would not have appreciably mitigated the growth in leverage ... in the years preceding the recent crisis," Martin Gruenberg, who heads the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, said at a public meeting on Tuesday. The banks would have until January 2018 to meet the new requirements. FDIC staffers said it should not be difficult for the megabanks to hit the targets, but bank groups warned that the heightened levels could harm the economic recovery.</Msg><Username>buffetmunger</Username><Timestamp>1373409696176</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 18:41:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373410054926-144</Id><Topic><Title>#$%$ Bove was on CNBC this morning</Title><Username>hk32111</Username><Timestamp>1373397994268</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 15:26:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Banks are going to have a "pretty tough" time logging a 15th-straight quarter of higher year-over-year earnings, banking analyst #$%$ Bove told CNBC on Tuesday.

Armchair Analyst Poll: Will JPMorgan Q2 earnings Friday meet, beat, or miss Wall Street expectations of $1.43 a share? Vote Now! Meet Beat Miss Vote to see results "This should be a sloppy quarter," Bove said in a "Squawk Box" interview. "The reason is pretty simple: Banks do pretty much what the economy does." (Vote Now on Facebook in the "Squawk Box" Armchair Analyst Poll) The final revision for first quarter economic growth was a more tepid 1.8 percent annual rate than previously estimated. And when the government releases its first look at second quarter growth later this month, the number won't be good, Bove said. "We did not have a great second quarter from an economic standpoint," he said. "So we're not going to have a great second quarter in terms of bank earnings." He ticked off the reasons: "Loan volume in the two big areas, commercial industrial and residential mortgage, have slowed down dramatically. Price competition has picked up to push margins lower." "You got this issue with long-term rates going up creating issues about capital," he added.
