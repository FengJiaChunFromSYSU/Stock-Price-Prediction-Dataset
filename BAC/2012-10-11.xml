It's true that there are stupid people and they may be indeed easily impressed by somebody with his shirt sleeves up as Romney regardless of his past of standing for nothing but taking everything from a profit angle only. But in today's times things are changing. Just in 2000 I voted for GWB... and now I'm disgusted by GOP politics of obstruction and winning elections by any means including lying and pretending. I believe it's hard to keep lying in our times as the facts are easily and promptly accessible to those who seek the facts behind the politicians statements and behavior. I believe that people also err but learn by trial. I learned and many are also learning faster than before because of our modern hi-tech progress and more awareness than just following the noise in mainstream media. Even though Obama may not be answer, but the discontent of many are not only against Romney alone, but against the GOP itself. I sincerely believe that Obama will be re-elected! This has now become a question of TRUST... and not a question of party affiliation. My 2 cents!</Msg><Username>johnmjay</Username><Timestamp>1349932132125</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 01:08:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349933406787-2</Id><Title>PBS Frontline's Good Coverage of Romney and Obama</Title><Msg>It was a nice program showing historically the rise of both Obama and Romney. Their trials and tribulations over the last decade. Very interesting indeed. Very objectively done. Two very opposites as to their early lives and growing up. I won't elaborate here. Try to watch this impartial historical revealing the two characters, their strengths and weaknesses. If I had to sum up in few words, it would be as follows. Obama the idealist and reliable. Romney, the businessman whose core values are unknown as he keeps changing them as suits the environment and the challenge facing him. Obama the idealist gets disappointed when lofty goals for the nation are stepped on by career politicians and the system. Romney, solving the business challenges for making profits... at whatever cost including changing his previous known positions on important issues. Obama steady and trust-able with a dream. Romney changing and changeable and unknown for what's inside him. I highly recommend to see it and make your own assessment. As an independent, I would vote against Romney... not that Obama may be perfect for the job. I happen to trust Obama more than I trust Romney.</Msg><Username>johnmjay</Username><Timestamp>1349933406787</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 01:30:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349934458150-3</Id><Title>Obama's administration is the most dysfunctional and corrupt of the last 100 years.

Disregarding his totally inept statements both in the USA and abroad, Ol' Mitt has flip-flopped on so many issues it's hard for an intelligent person to trust what he says. Looking beyond policy differences, when I vote for a US President, I look to see which candidate is the most rock solid - the one who can make the tough call regardless of politics. I don't see that in Romney.</Msg><Username>monty_karlow</Username><Timestamp>1349945097051</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 04:44:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349945952330-18</Id><Title>Foreclosures down, bank stocks will explode...!!!</Title><Msg>Foreclosures, nationally, at 5-year low IRVINE, Calif., Oct. 11 (UPI) -- The number of U.S. properties involved in foreclosure fell to a five-year low in September, an online real estate firm said Thursday.

Saefong, MarketWatch And while there are many factors that will influence oil in the months ahead, most of them point to the likelihood of prices falling to levels closer to $60 to $50 a barrel — or at least not making any sort of lasting impression at $100 in the fourth quarter. “Given the backdrop of slowing global demand and rising non-OPEC production, the odds are that Brent heads to below $100 as we get towards the end of the year, which will also pressure WTI to stay closer to $60 to $50,” said Kirk McDonald, senior research analyst at St. Louis-based Argent Capital Management. Overall, the selloff in West Texas crude oil has been “due to the converging bearish themes of lethargic economic data, lackluster oil demand and the continuing trend of rising domestic oil production,” said Smith. “Meanwhile, signs of slowing in China and a euro-debt crisis that rumbles on and on provide little reason to be bullish right now.” U.S. field production of oil has climbed to its highest level since 1996, according to Energy Information Administration data. Production is currently at more than 6.5 million barrels per day. See the EIA’s latest production data. “The renaissance in domestic production is real and can be attributed to improved exploration and production techniques as well as higher prices,” which enables the economic recovery of previously known reserves, said Michael Peterson, managing director of energy research at MLV &amp; Co. At the same time, “industry capital has rotated back to the U.S. en masse because there is no fear premium to operating,” with the U.S. and Canada the safest places to make large capital investments in projects, said Neal Ryan, managing partner at Ryan Oil &amp; Gas Partners LLC. The largest area of output growth among oil producers who are not part of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is North America, according to the EIA, which expects production there to increase by 1 million barrels per day in 2012. See the EIA’s Short-Term Energy Outlook Report from September. Oil should be “at the $60 to $50 level in the fourth quarter as long as Israel doesn’t employ a preemptive attack on Iran,” said Zahir. And, barring any specific supply-shock scenarios, Peterson said the likelihood of significantly higher WTI oil prices in 2012 is “limited” to less than 25%. When asked if $100 or $60 oil prices are more likely, Peterson replied: “$60 is more likely near-term,</Msg><Username>fairvalue23</Username><Timestamp>1349965082952</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 10:18:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349965128092-75</Id><Title>Oil $50: Pros analysts Oil at $50 Credit Suisse analysts Oil at $50</Title><Msg>Oil $50: Pros analysts Oil at $50 Credit Suisse analysts Oil at $50 - the analysis argues that demand would fall along with trading activity and that any recovery would be “halting fragile and painfully slow.” The report points to the fall in oil prices witnessed in 2008, when Brent prices plunged from a record high level in the space of a few months.

I will be watching the debate this afternoon. Let's see how it goes. I will catch that PBS program later. I'm sure they will replay that many times before the election, or I'll get it online. Well one could pretty much see the Romney character currently with his glaring and easy denials of what he has been selling for sometime. I note that anytime he speaks and denies any statement he has made before, he is dead sure of himself at the moment! Thus he comes across momentarily a 'decisive leader'. That kind of behavior mostly impresses those who are rather shallow in their knowledge and understanding of the real reasons of of our current situation and the realities. That is often one of main reasons of his getting a bump in the polls. Knowledgeable people with memory and an ability to see the larger context know that Romney is a good salesman and by career has to be enthusiastic and energetic in marketing whatever he is selling. He is not going to impress me and folks with ave. intelligence and above. Yet he can energize the GOP base. I don't think such a salesman succeeds when dealing with larger groups in the end as it is when he is dealing with each client separately. This race is not a sprint... but a marathon and not made for salesmen who do not have a good product to sell. From what comes across, Romney's salesmanship though smooth... his product is unknown and full of contradictions and mystery, denials and promises. I can't buy it just because he happens to be a smooth salesman!</Msg><Username>giovannijay</Username><Timestamp>1349970884256</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 11:54:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349971180549-126</Id><Topic><Title>BAC Breakout!</Title><Username>myrtlepeq357987</Username><Timestamp>1349964628890</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 10:10:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Just joined.

Something GOP trash posting at this board can not do. For they are of substandard intelligence and lack basic comprehension. In September alone, Obama/Biden received a total of 180 million dollars. We do know that the ave. contribution to Obama comes predominantly from MANY VOTERS who contributed like an average of $35-50 And, the big contributions are a tiny portion of that total. I do know this personally. For R-Money, the total contribution was about 160 million dollars. The contribution average is quite high coming from Wall Street, and very big donors like Koch brothers, Casino owners, and primarily from the 1% super rich for they will much gain from a R-Money presidency. That means much LESS VOTES and VOTERS for Mr. R-Money. However, the lowlife characters are LOUD and infest the media from FOX to WOLVES whereas their base has be dwindling GWB became president. Well to tell the truth, even I, as an independent voted for GWB in 2000! That was the last vote any GOP candidate will ever get from me in the future! THE TIMES ARE A CHANGING!

They are doing an awesome job at cutting costs by eliminating no performing assets! Doing so will allow them to negotiate better terms with the FED on how to go about with all the cash they have available When the time comes, don't be surprised to see Stock- Buy-Back and/or dividend increase to shareholders! WFC and JPM's earnings are the spark to set BAC on fire into their earnings and options expiration date. Conservatively, $10 is easy money for anyone who are savy enough to understand.

Ryan looked completely out of his league. Several 'deer in the headlights' moments; early on I thought Joe's condescending laughter and frequent interruptions were going to be his undoing, but the old guy held it together, kept the heat turned up, and kept his foot out of his mouth. Biden was also more direct in answering the questions he was asked, and Ryan more evasive as he attempted to answer the questions he wished he'd been asked. Biden won this one by a solid margin. The DNC needs to throw Kerry in a cell, and hand the Obama debate prep task over to Joe.</Msg><Username>fish2kill</Username><Timestamp>1350010793788</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 22:59:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350011271169-237</Id><Topic><Title>Signs that Tell Me President Obama Will be Re-Elected in a Landslide</Title><Username>giovannijay</Username><Timestamp>1349993647617</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 18:14:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Paris, we've been friends for a long time, so I'd like to ask a small favor.

On October 5, 2009, he wrote a letter to Chu on behalf of the nonprofit Energy Center of Wisconsin, which was applying for a grant under the Recovery Act’s Geothermal Technologies Program. Under the grant program the center received a total of $240,000, according to its president, Frank Greb. The same day Ryan sent another letter advocating for a grant application, in which the Energy Center partnered with Milwaukee Area Technical College, for training building technicians and operators in energy-saving techniques. For that program, the government provided $740,364, according to federal records. But the biggest payoff came for the Wisconsin Energy Conservation Corporation. Ryan predicted the $20 million grant would be able to “create or retain approximately 7,600 new jobs over the three-year grant period and the subsequent three years.” Chalk up another 7600 jobs for the stimulus.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1350012580188</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 23:29:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350012892234-248</Id><Topic><Title>The Vice President Crushed the Teenager Ryan</Title><Username>giovannijay</Username><Timestamp>1350009714683</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 22:41:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Not to mention he knew what he was talking about and Ryan didn't.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1350012892234</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 23:34:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350013278030-249</Id><Title>Tell us Ryan What would you do?</Title><Msg>short of going to war that hasn't already been done?
