Follows the life and activities of Frank Marshall Davis noted Marxist sympathizer, radical activist, Communist Party member, prolific writer, and above all Obama's principal Mentor.

If they paid their bill the way we pay our taxes, it would go something like this... The first four men (the poorest) would pay nothing. The fifth would pay $1. The sixth would pay $3. The seventh would pay $7.. The eighth would pay $12. The ninth would pay $18. The tenth man (the richest) would pay $59. So, that's what they decided to do. The ten men drank in the bar every day and seemed quite happy with the arrangement, until one day, the owner threw them a curve ball. "Since you are all such good customers," he said, "I'm going to reduce the cost of your daily beer by $20.". Drinks for the ten men would now cost just $80. The group still wanted to pay their bill the way we pay our taxes. So the first four men were unaffected. They would still drink for free. But what about the other six men? The paying customers? How could they divide the $20 windfall so that everyone would get his fair share? They realized that $20 divided by six is $3.33. But if they subtracted that from everybody's share, then the fifth man and the sixth man would each end up being paid to drink his beer. So, the bar owner suggested that it would be fair to reduce each man's bill by a higher percentage the poorer he was, to follow the principle of the tax system they had been using, and he proceeded to work out the amounts he suggested that each should now pay. And so the fifth man, like the first four, now paid nothing (100% saving). The sixth now paid $2 instead of $3 (33% saving). The seventh now paid $5 instead of $7 (28% saving). The eighth now paid $9 instead of $12 (25% saving). The ninth now paid $14 instead of $18 (22% saving). The tenth now paid $49 instead of $59 (16% saving). Each of the six was better off than before. And the first four continued to drink for free. But, once outside the bar, the men began to compare their savings. "I only got a dollar out of the $20 saving," declared the sixth man. He pointed to the tenth man,"but he got $10!" "Yeah, that's right," exclaimed the fifth man. "I only saved a dollar too. It's unfair that he got ten times more benefit than me!" "That's true!" shouted the seventh man. "Why should he get $10 back, when I got only $2? The wealthy get all the breaks!" "Wait a minute," yelled the first four men in unison, "we didn't get anything at all. This new tax system exploits the poor!" The nine men surrounded the tenth and beat him up. The next night the tenth man didn't show up for drinks, so the nine sat down and had their beers without him. But when it came time to pay the bill, they discovered something important. They didn't have enough money between all of them for even half of the bill! And that, boys and girls, journalists and government hacks, is how our tax system works. The people who already pay the highest taxes will naturally get the most benefit from a tax reduction. Tax them too much, attack them for being wealthy, and they just may not show up anymore. In fact, they might start drinking overseas, where the atmosphere is somewhat friendlier. David R.

Rand Paul, completing 2nd of six years in senate, lauds private side as good creators. Newark, NJ’s Cory booker scowls at presidential candidate (guess which one) whose platform and thrust cutting taxpayer deductions (maybe mortgage interest and charitable contributions) seems to be “trust me” GOP, Mr Will states, counts of votes of undecideds (but how many are there?) Sen Paul of course got his dig at Democrats “booing God”, as if that vote re their platform implied God was being booed. Mrs Roberts did state Democrats over mentioned the matter of abortion; Mayor Booker countered with statement that Ryan budget views include cuts to veteran assistance. Five, one from upstate N Y, others Texas, Virginia, Indiana, and Michigan, were in 20s. Sponsors, yes natural gas pressure group, this week not catheters but yes reverse mortages for the aged, plugged by an aged past senator. HP and Chevron, this time N Y Times, and three investment/financial firms. No BAC this time, but plenty re economy and finances, yes IMHO.</Msg><Username>one_tribute</Username><Timestamp>1347207388336</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 12:16:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347207796802-48</Id><Topic><Title>Obama widens lead over Romney</Title><Username>j.farragut</Username><Timestamp>1347153839150</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-08 21:23:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Online betting has Obama @ $2.15 to $1.00, Romney @ $1.00 to $1.75.

The Rep party cares very much for the poor and their upward mobility not to mention the development of an educated strong middle class. They demonstrate this not by giving free hand outs that encourage more dependency on the government, but by developing and creating opportunities for everyone to succeed. Please...everyone likes peace and prosperity. Does it really make sense to you that the party of filthy rich, greedy people is always looking to start a war to deplete the US Treasury and deplete their ability to make profits? I will agree with you that throughout its history the Rep party is often called on to tamp down the international flames created by years of misguided policies or decisions of its predecessors. And unfortunately, they often get blamed for defending the United States in wars often caused by those misguided policies.

Obama’s lead over Romney among registered voters grew to 49 percent-45 percent in Gallup’s tracking poll. The 49 percent for Obama was his highest point in the survey since late April. It represented an increase of 1 point since Friday and a 5-point swing from Romney’s 47 percent-46 percent lead in the Gallup survey just before the Republican convention began. The poll combines small samples taken each night to present a seven-day average. Since three of the nights of the survey period preceded the Democratic convention, Obama’s lead in the survey is likely to grow further. Gallup’s measure of job approval also continued to improve for Obama, with 52 percent of adults surveyed saying they approved of his performance in office, compared with 42 percent disapproving. That survey uses a three-day average. Two other tracking polls, the Rasmussen and Reuters/Ipsos surveys, also showed Obama with a lead. In the Rasmussen tracking poll, a three-day average which has tended to show better results for Romney, Obama led 46 percent-44 percent among likely voters surveyed, up from a 1-point deficit on Friday and a six-point swing from just after the Republican convention. In his account of the results, pollster Scott Rasmussen noted that for the first time in his survey, Democrats were now following the campaign as closely as Republican voters, a measure that often predicts turnout. In the Reuters/Ipsos poll Obama led Romney among likely voters by 47 percent-44 percent, up a point from Friday. So far, the polls indicate that Obama gained considerably more from his convention than did Romney, who got only a small bounce, from his. How much further Obama’s lead will grow and whether it proves lasting will be key questions over the next week. As the word implies, a “bounce” can be fickle. Candidates almost always benefit from a week of concentrated coverage of their message, but in some years, the advantage fades quickly. That’s not always the case, however. In 2004, George W. Bush got a substantial boost from his convention and established a lead over Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., that held up through Election Day. Obama’s aides have carefully studied Bush’s campaign as a model of how a president can win re-election in a sharply polarized electorate.</Msg><Username>urbansquall</Username><Timestamp>1347229744867</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 18:29:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347230042283-109</Id><Topic><Title>I'm not sure what I like best, tea bagging, taking a big bone up the chute, or lying about Obama</Title><Username>dumpobamle</Username><Timestamp>1347089956499</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-08 03:39:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>who's bone is it, tulsa turd, yours?

"There has been no shortage of oil in the market. Producers have been able to meet consumer needs," Abdullah al-Badri told an energy conference. "We also see this as being the case for the rest of 2012 and the foreseeable future." Oil prices surged in March to $128 a barrel, the highest level since 2008, because of concern about possible supply shortages. Prices have since fallen back and brent crude was trading around $118 on Thursday. "Today the price continues to be driven by excessive speculation," Badri said. OPEC at a meeting in December set a target to produce 30 million barrels per day, settling an argument which broke out in 2011 after Iran and other members opposed a Saudi-led plan to raise OPEC's production ceiling. Output has remained above the target all year as Libyan supply recovered after being virtually shut down during the 2011 uprising against Muammar Gaddafi's rule. The extra oil is filling gaps caused by an unusually large number of supply outages globally, which have also helped support prices. Supply breaks were running at nearly 1.3 million bpd as of early April. The additional supply has also offset a decline in exports from Iran, which is facing stiffening western sanctions over its disputed nuclear energy program. Iranian oil exports were running at between 200,000 and 300,000 barrels per day below last year's level, Maria van der Hoeven, head of the International Energy Agency, told Thursday's conference. Iranian officials have said the country exported an average of 2.2 million barrels a day last year. July supply from the 12-member Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ran at 31.75 million barrels per day (bpd), the high est since September 2008, which was shortly before it agreed to a series of supply curbs to combat recession and collapsing demand, based on Reuters surveys</Msg><Username>fairvalue23</Username><Timestamp>1347235957798</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 20:12:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347236011001-126</Id><Title>"There has been no shortage of oil in the market"</Title><Msg>"There has been no shortage of oil in the market" OPEC Says Supply Ample, Speculation Driving Price , | 28 August 2012 | 06:18 AM ET Oil supply will be more than sufficient to meet demand this year and beyond, OPEC's Secretary General said on Thursday, but added the price of fuel is being driven higher by speculation.

Looking at a worst-case scenario – namely, a repeat of the slowdown of 2008’s Great Recession precipitated by a crisis of confidence involving Europe - the analysis argues that demand would fall along with trading activity and that any recovery would be “halting fragile and painfully slow.” The report points to the fall in oil prices witnessed in 2008, when Brent prices plunged from a record high level in the space of a few months.

The average price for gasoline in the U.S.A would drop to $2.80 per gallon. Naimi Says Brent Oil Should Drop to $80.00 as Supply Tops Demand By Ben Sharples - June 03, 2012 Crude prices should fall because global supply is outweighing demand, according to Saudi Arabia’s oil minister, Ali al-Naimi. “We want a lower price than where it is now,” al-Naimi said in Adelaide today. “We need to get the price to a level of around $80” a barrel for London’s Brent crude, he said. Saudi Arabia is the world’s biggest oil exporter. Brent, a benchmark price for more than half the world’s crude, has dropped 6 percent this month amid concern Europe’s debt crisis will worsen and curb fuel demand. OPEC is working to bring prices down, the group’s Secretary-General, Abdalla el- Badri, said May 3. The producer group, scheduled to meet next month, is pumping 8.3 percent more crude than it considers necessary this quarter, figures from the Vienna-based group show. Brent crude for June settlement dropped 0.8 percent in the week to May 11 to $112.26 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. West Texas Intermediate oil for June delivery slid 2.4 percent to $96.13 a barrel. At $100 a barrel for London’s Brent crude, that equates to around $80.00 a barrel for West Texas Intermediate oil. The average price for gasoline in the U.S.A would drop to $2.80 per gallon. Oil supply outweighs demand by 1.3 million to 1.5 million barrels a day, al-Naimi said today. Saudi Arabia increased output last month to the highest in more than three decades, according to data it provided to OPEC.</Msg><Username>fairvalue23</Username><Timestamp>1347236171006</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 20:16:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347236211420-131</Id><Title>Equates to gasoline prices to average about $2.25 per gallon</Title><Msg>Equates to gasoline prices to average about $2.25 per gallon 28-August-12 08:42 am This eq...
