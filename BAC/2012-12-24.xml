Sometimes they want out of a stock and recommend it it, to create volume so they can get out easily. Other times they are taking a long term loss for their clients and want to raise the price so that when they report by the end of the year they will look better. Anyway, you'll never know what there motives are. Just watch the stocks that Needham, Goldman Sachs, and other investment banking houses pan or tout.

The Americans With No Abilities Act is being hailed as a major legislative goal by advocates of the millions of Americans who lack any real skills or ambition. "Roughly 50 percent of Americans do not possess the competence and drive necessary to carve out a meaningful role for themselves in society," said California Sen. Barbara Boxer. "We can no longer stand by and allow People of Inability (POI) to be ridiculed and passed over. With this legislation, employers will no longer be able to grant special favors to a small group of workers, simply because they have some idea of what they are doing." In a Capitol Hill press conference, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid pointed to the success of the U.S. Postal Service, which has a long-standing policy of providing opportunity without regard to performance. Approximately 74 percent of postal employees lack any job skills, making this agency the single largest U.S. employer of Persons With No Ability. Private-sector industries with good records of non-discrimination against the inept include retail sales (72 percent), the airline industry (68 percent), and home-improvement warehouse stores (65 percent). At the state government level, the Department of Motor Vehicles also has an excellent record of hiring Persons with No Ability (63 percent). Under the Americans With No Abilities Act, more than 25 million mid-level positions will be created, with important-sounding titles but little real responsibility, thus providing an illusory sense of purpose and performance. Mandatory non-performance-based raises and promotions will be given to guarantee upward mobility for even the most unremarkable employees. The legislation provides substantial tax breaks to corporations that promote a significant number of Persons of Inability (POI) into middle-management positions, and give a tax credit to small and medium-sized businesses that agree to hire one clueless worker for every two talented hires. Finally, the Americans With No Abilities Act contains tough new measures to make it more difficult to discriminate against the non-abled, banning, for example, discriminatory interview questions such as, "Do you have any skills or experience that relate to this job?" "As a non-abled person, I can't be expected to keep up with people who have something going for them," said Mary Lou Gertz, who lost her position as a lug-nut twister at the GM plant in Flint, Mich., due to her inability to remember righty tighty, lefty loosey. "This new law should be real good for people like me. I値l finally have job security." With the passage of this bill, Gertz and millions of other untalented citizens will finally see a light at the end of the tunnel. Said Sen. #$%$ Durbin: "As a senator with no abilities, I believe the same privileges that elected officials enjoy ought to be extended to every American with no abilities. It is our duty as lawmakers to provide each and every American citizen, regardless of his or her inadequacy, with some sort of space to take up in this great nation and a good salary for doing so."</Msg><Username>amazing.donut</Username><Timestamp>1356382063263</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-24 15:47:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356382425408-58</Id><Topic><Title>DEMS: NO BUDGET IN 4 YEARS AND NO PLAN THAT ADDRESSES THE DEBT CRISIS</Title><Username>carburetorkid</Username><Timestamp>1356366264947</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-24 11:24:24 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That is the American dream do nothing get free money and play the lottery.

This is not a single party issue. Our country needs policies that will encourage job growth and eliminiate waste throughout ALL of the federal government. States need to do the same. More jobs lead to growth in federal, state and local tax revenues which will solve the majority of our problems. More jobs will automatically cut the costs assocaited with assisting the needy that currently do not have jobs and get jobs. Americans of both parties should be disgusted with the inaction of both parties and not just one. Our country needs ALL Americans regardless of party affliation to tell our politicians to get to work solving our difficult fiscal issues. All of us that work, have worked, and want to work understand that if you are not part of the solution you are part of the problem. Don't most employee's work hard and strive to do a good job - I believe they do. Is it too much to ask our politicians to do the same, I don't think so. So Democrats, Republicans, Independents, etc. tell our politicians to get to work. Obama said it last week, both parties can't get everything they want so I say "give us (Americans) something now - a start - to resolving our fiscal woes. The President and the leaders - majority and minority - need to lock themselves in a room until the come up with a solution(s) to our problems.</Msg><Username>sammsjohn99</Username><Timestamp>1356387525685</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-24 17:18:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356387927593-68</Id><Topic><Title>The Americans with No Abilities Act</Title><Username>amazing.donut</Username><Timestamp>1356382063263</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-24 15:47:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hardee's introduces "shame curtain" so people won't be embarrased by eating at the restaurant.</Msg><Username>vieweroutrage</Username><Timestamp>1356387927593</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-24 17:25:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356388425370-69</Id><Topic><Title>Republiclowns Still in Denial</Title><Username>biggusdikkus12</Username><Timestamp>1356384674331</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-24 16:31:14 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Looks like another two years of just say no until the final clean out of tea baggers.</Msg><Username>sirifuture</Username><Timestamp>1356388425370</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-24 17:33:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356388813221-70</Id><Title>Merry Christmas everybody !!!</Title><Msg>May you guys be borned again.....Hee hee LOL just like Jesus keep on doing it every year !

Born 1930 - 1979 You definitely need to read the statement by Jay. Oh so true. Those of You Born 1930 - 1979 At the end of this Email is a quote of the month by Jay Leno.. If you don't read anything else, PleaseRead what he Said. Very well stated, Mr. Leno. TO ALL THE KIDS WHO SURVIVED THE 1930's, 40's, 50's, 60's and 70's! First, we survived being born to mothers Who smoked and/or drank while they were Pregnant. They took aspirin, ate blue cheese dressing, Tuna from a can and didn't get tested for diabetes. Then after that trauma, we were put to sleep on our tummies in baby cribs covered with bright colored lead-base paints. We had no childproof lids on medicine bottles, Locks on doors or cabinets and when we rode Our bikes, we had baseball caps not helmets on our heads. As infants &amp; children, We would ride in cars with no car seats, No booster seats, no seat belts, no air bags, bald tires and sometimes no brakes. Riding in the back of a pick-up truck on a warm day Was always a special treat. We drank water From the garden hose and not from a bottle. We shared one soft drink with four friends, From one bottle and no one actually died from this. We ate cupcakes, white bread, real butter and bacon.. We drank Kool-Aid made with real white sugar. And, we weren't overweight. WHY? Because we were Always outside playing...that's why! We would leave home in the morning and play all day, As long as we were back when the Streetlights came on. No one was able To reach us all day. And, we were O.K. We would spend hours building our go-carts out of scraps And then ride them down the hill, only to find out We forgot the brakes. After running into the bushes a few times, we learned to solve the problem. We did not have Playstations, Nintendo's and X-boxes. There were no video games, no 150 channels on cable, No video movies or DVD's, no surround-sound or CD's, No cell phones, No personal computers, no Internet and no chat rooms. WE HAD FRIENDS And we went outside and found them! We fell out of trees, got cut, broke bones and teeth And there were no lawsuits from these accidents. We ate worms and mud pies made from dirt, And the worms did not live in us Forever. We were given BB guns for our 10th birthdays, Made up games with sticks and tennis balls and, Although we were told it would happen, We did not put out very many eyes. We rode bikes or walked to a friend's house and Knocked on the door or rang the bell, or just Walked in and talked to them. Little League had tryouts and not everyone made the team. Those who didn't had to learn to deal With disappointment. Imagine that!! The idea of a parent bailing us out if we broke the law Was unheard of. They actually sided with the law! These generations have produced some of the best Risk-takers, problem solvers and inventors ever. The past 50 years Have been an explosion of innovation and new ideas. We had freedom, failure, success and responsibility, and we learned how to deal with it all. If YOU are one of them? CONGRATULATIONS! You might want to share this with others who have had the luck to grow up as kids, before the lawyers and the government regulated so much of our lives for our own good . While you are at it, forward it to your kids so they will know how brave and lucky their parents were. Kind of makes you want to run through the house with scissors, doesn't it ? The quote of the month is by Jay Leno: "With hurricanes, tornados, fires out of control, mud slides, flooding, severe thunderstorms tearing up the country from one end to another, and with the threat of swine flu and terrorist attacks. Are we sure this is a good time to take God out of the Pledge of Allegiance?' Father, God bless my friend in whatever it is that You know they may need this day! And may their life be full of your peace, prosperity, and power as he/she seeks to have a closer relationship with you.
