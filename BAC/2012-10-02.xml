The figure above shows they were 1¢. So what is Warren Buffett looking at here? Something had to attract him to this company. It was probably the cash flow that was, to say the least, pretty good for a company that's supposed to be in big trouble. Even though it didn't deliver earnings per share in 2011, Bank of America did generate a lot of cash, which attracts value investors like Uncle Warren.

At the time, we rated the promise In the Works, since Congress was in the midst of voting on a bill that would put the VA health care programs on a two-year budget cycle — an effort to make sure the government gets money to the program on time. Since then, two key developments have taken place. On Dec. 16, 2009, Obama signed a law to fully fund the VA for 2010. Congress ended up appropriating $109.6 billion, $15.3 billion more than in 2009. According to the conference summary, total discretionary funding was $5.4 billion above 2009. The president also signed the Veterans Health Care Budget Reform and Transparency Act on Oct. 22, 2009. The law mandates that appropriations for VA medical programs be approved one year ahead of time. Congress provided $48.2 billion in advance appropriations for veterans medical care programs for fiscal year 2011 in its 2010 budget (which was approved at the end of 2009). The 2011 budget, to be approved sometime in 2010, similarly requests $50.6 billion in appropriations for the year 2012. The 2011 budget would "build on the historic increase in funding for the VA with a 20 percent total increase since 2009," according to the Office of Management and Budget. So Obama's 2010 budget provided billions more in funding for the VA, and his 2011 budget proposal promises further increases. He also signed a law mandating that Congress appropriate money for veterans medical care programs one year in advance. We rate this Promise Kept.

But even though some beneficiaries may credit President Obama for providing the phones, Lifeline is an extension of a program that has existed since 1985. Still, critics including Rep. Tim Griffin, R-Ark., note the program has swelled from $772 million in 2008 to $1.6 billion. “It's a government-run, taxpayer-funded program that's running wild and costing more and more,” reads Griffin’s official House of Representatives website.</Msg><Username>tulsaturd</Username><Timestamp>1349178741105</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 07:52:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349179759927-43</Id><Title>Credit Suisse raises Bank Sector to Overweight.</Title><Msg>This came out at ~2:15AM.

You know the very first place every Marine Corps Officer goes through along with numerous schools and tenant organizations, not to mention the FBI, DEA, etc. when they are young and looking to start a banking relationship. What makes this even worse is that they are also closing (or closed) the other BAC branch in the town of Quantico, Virginia. That means any of the above customers will have to drive 10-15 miles to get to a BAC branch. I've only banked there from some 30 years - guess what......I can almost guarantee that there will be a bank were this branch is currently located - right in the Marine Corps Exchange complex....but it will have a different name on the door. It is amazing that some of these "executives" can't see the forest for the trees.

Yet they continue to spend like there's no tomorrow..couple of examples: 1."Valerie Jarrett has a Secret Service detail. A staff member in the White House who is a senior aide and has a full Secret Service detail, even while on vacation, and nobody in the press had asked why. That has become more poignant, as I said, last week, when we discovered that we had an American ambassador, on the anniversary of 9/11, who was without adequate security—while she still has a Secret Service detail assigned to her full-time, at a massive cost, and no one in the media has gone to ask why". 2."the estimated number of legal, noncitizens in the food stamp program is now roughly 1.63 million — more than double the number who participated in 2008." The Obama administration met with Mexican officials and held other events to discuss enrollment in food stamps and similar programs roughly 30 times since President Obama took office, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack revealed in a recent letter to Congress. Maybe you are right..just let Obama's electorate learn the hard way that they are fools for voting for a community organizing Socialist who will just increase their misery if they think the government can satisfy all their needs without some effort on their part.

( BONZ ) announces plans to initiate mining operations in the 4th quarter of this calendar year as a result of securing a $1.66M Financing Agreement with Tonaquint Inc., a Utah corporation. "We are extremely pleased as this financing agreement with Tonaquint will enable Bonanza to rapidly advance from exploration to gold mining production before year's end," said Michael Stojsavljevich, President and CEO of Bonanza Goldfields Corporation. Tests from Bonanza's gold fields conducted in August 2012 were very encouraging with promising results for gold and a number of rare earth metals. "Our aggressive production plan is structured to process our gold deposits as rapidly as possible beginning with our pre-1955 patented land. With gold pricing continuing to rise in response to our Country's monetary and fiscal policies, we are in a strong position to exploit our gold reserves to maximize shareholder value," added Michael Stojsavljevich. John Fife, Founder and President of Tonaquint, Inc., commented, "We are very impressed with the Bonanza team and their plans to move the company into gold production. Bonanza is unique because its surface mining approach allows it to enter production quickly and at a low cost relative to other junior mining companies." The financing will be available to Bonanza upon the effectiveness of an SEC S-1 Registration Statement, with a first tranche effective immediately and allocated towards equipment purchases. Subsequent tranches will be used to execute a three tiered strategic plan commencing with the mining and processing of Bonanza's gold deposits on its Tarantula Project.</Msg><Username>aunttizzy</Username><Timestamp>1349188662985</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 10:37:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349188772422-116</Id><Topic><Title>Romney's Wife must Succumb to Her Husband</Title><Username>oh_my_2012</Username><Timestamp>1349187689197</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 10:21:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>dang child you stupid .!!!!!!!!!!!</Msg><Username>da23533</Username><Timestamp>1349188772422</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 10:39:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349189135043-117</Id><Topic><Title>An Obama administration appointee has resigned in connection with another bombshell report detailing the waste of taxpayer money at feel-good conferences -- this time, at a pair of Veterans Affairs summits in Orlando that cost more than $6 million.</Title><Username>dumpobamie</Username><Timestamp>1349188297750</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 10:31:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>obama loves wasting taxpayer money</Msg><Username>tulsaturd</Username><Timestamp>1349189135043</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 10:45:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349189176880-118</Id><Title>Can anyone confirm a rumour that BAC has a settlement with Fanne Mae..what would happen to PPS if so</Title><Msg>please serious replies only</Msg><Username>samlinken216</Username><Timestamp>1349189176880</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 10:46:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349189205788-119</Id><Title>Waste of meat Tea Bags: All swing state except NC is now blue or leaning blue.

In West Virginia over the past decade, the cost was as low as $10. Last election, Democrats used $.50 half-pints of Thunderbird Wine to purchase Felix Fartaway Faraway and his mentally challenged son, Miles' votes. Thunderbird Wine also worked well in the large cities in Ohio said David Axelrod and Valarie Jarrett, Obama advisors. They have used taxpayer monies from a secret fund to buy these type misfit votes at the taxpayers' expense. As a matter of fact, "Fartaway acts as a Democrat shill, getting paid a half pint of wine each day for posting senile Romney garbage on various message boards" said Axelrod.</Msg><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1349199641231</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 13:40:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349200942293-196</Id><Title>OH OH here comes the PIMCO</Title><Msg>CNBC at it again!</Msg><Username>smythwrd</Username><Timestamp>1349200942293</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 14:02:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349201090959-197</Id><Title>Put A 5 Cent Tax On Every Stock Trade, High Frequency Stock Trade 7 Cent Tax, Short Trade 10 Cent Tax</Title><Msg>More than 100 Billion dollars per year ONLY to pay down DEBT would be the result of such a tax.

Right now the bid's being set up to drop below the .90 line. When/if that happens it'll probably be pushed to push the .80 line as that's the point it's bounced off of over the past 5 sessions. Basically it's back riding a shorter term (2 session) downtrend line drawn off the ~$9.12 area....and it's that line I'm using as a transition "tell" to gauge directional change... Errp....bid just broke .90 on ~400K shares being thrown at it..</Msg><Username>highlowsel</Username><Timestamp>1349202475780</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 14:27:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349202480435-205</Id><Topic><Title>Distorting an interview Ann Romney gave to a Nevada media outlet last week, MSNBC daytime anchor (and onetime co-anchor of ABC’s Nightline) Martin Bashir tried to impugn the mental health of GOP candidate Mitt Romney on his Monday program.</Title><Username>dumpobamie</Username><Timestamp>1349202190500</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 14:23:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>When all one does is lie, is it really that hard to stop?

At first glance, the United States government gets props for helping Chinese human rights activist Chen Guangcheng get out of China to take a university fellowship in the U.S. But the reason Chen and his family were forced to give up everything and start their lives over in the U.S. was because of Chen’s opposition to China’s brutal one-child policy, a policy the Obama Administration continues to support financially. On this issue, the Obama Administration has blood on its hands. Only 11 days into his presidency, Obama proposed giving $50 million of U.S. taxpayers’ money to the United Nations Population Fund (known as UNFPA). UNFPA is notorious for advising and helping fund China’s population-control program, the most brutal in the world. The centerpiece of that program is China’s dictate that most families are only allowed to have one child, and only after being issued a government birth license. Women pregnant with a second child–or even an unlicensed first child–are subjected to forced abortions, infanticide of their newborns, and compulsory sterilization. Chen incurred the wrath of Chinese officials when he exposed and documented those abuses, abuses aided and abetted, even if indirectly, by grants from U.S. taxpayers. Pro-life Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and George W. Bush ended the funding for UNFPA. Mitt Romney has promised to do the same. But pro-abortion Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton gave UNFPA hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars. Obama’s vice president, Joe Biden, even told an audience at a university in China “Your policy has been one which I fully understand – I’m not second-guessing – of one child per family.” Men and women throughout China have suffered so much to end this brutality. I humbly ask you to give three things, none of which will cost nearly as much as what brave activists like Chen Guangcheng have been forced to give: 1. Your vote. Vote for a pro-life President and Congress. 2. Your voice. Speak up for the unborn. 3. Your financial support. The NRL Victory Fund will use proven grassroots methods to get people out to vote for pro-life candidates, but will we have enough funds to reach everyone who needs to hear our message?</Msg><Username>be_cool_man_be_cool</Username><Timestamp>1349204674935</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 15:04:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349204778986-225</Id><Topic><Title>Lemming dumpobamie can't stop barking at the moon.

The LDS religion believes in the Book of Mormon. In the Book of Mormon one is taught Indians are descendants from Israelites. DNA testing hs proven Indians are definitely not descendants from Israelites. Nevertheless, Romney continues to believe in this fairy tale religion and donate to it. Therefore, Romney has great difficulty in telling fact from fiction. He would be a threat to the United States because he is so gullible he would buy into fiction and threaten the international security of the United States.</Msg><Username>oh_my_2012</Username><Timestamp>1349207245784</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 15:47:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349207268263-244</Id><Topic><Title>I threw a tantrum at Starbucks today</Title><Username>schuey9999</Username><Timestamp>1349149579024</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 23:46:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Anytime you give hell to workers, that's the right Republican behavior and attitude.

But I will know that BEFORE it happens through my own proprietary Indicator (LMP). My suggestion would be to accumulate BAC especially on price weakness for the intermediate term. As to me, I have greatly profited 3 times already this year alone, trading in addition of my present holdings. And, I will add more should the price go down. However, I will also sell on any quick price up-moves say 4-7% like in few sessions with part of my holdings. I bought on Sept 12 at $8.88 and will add more should price go lower again. Have in mind that price has moved in spurts for this stock and thus at this time it seems an ideal stock BOTH for st trading and lm/lt holding. I'm doing both.

Sergey Aleynikov, an ex-Goldman Sachs computer programmer, was arrested July 3 after arriving at Liberty International Airport in Newark, New Jersey, U.S. officials said. Aleynikov, 39, who has dual American and Russian citizenship, is charged in a criminal complaint with stealing the trading software. Teza Technologies LLC, a Chicago-based firm co-founded by a former Citadel Investment Group LLC trader, said it suspended Aleynikov, who started there on July 2. At a court appearance July 4 in Manhattan, Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Facciponti told a federal judge that Aleynikov’s alleged theft poses a risk to U.S. markets. Aleynikov transferred the code, which is worth millions of dollars, to a computer server in Germany, and others may have had access to it, Facciponti said, adding that New York-based Goldman Sachs may be harmed if the software is disseminated. “The bank has raised the possibility that there is a danger that somebody who knew how to use this program could use it to manipulate markets in unfair ways,” Facciponti said, according to a recording of the hearing made public today. “The copy in Germany is still out there, and we at this time do not know who else has access to it.” ‘Preposterous’ The prosecutor added, “Once it is out there, anybody will be able to use this, and their market share will be adversely affected.” The proprietary code lets the firm do “sophisticated, high- speed and high-volume trades on various stock and commodities markets,” prosecutors said in court papers. The trades generate “many millions of dollars” each year. Defense attorney Sabrina Shroff said in court that the government’s allegations are “preposterous.” The firm was aware that Aleynikov, who is the father of three young girls, was downloading programs to his personal computer to do work at home and that he hasn’t disseminated the code, the lawyer said. “If Goldman Sachs cannot possibly protect this kind of proprietary information that the government wants you to think is worth the entire United States market, one has to question how they plan to accommodate every other breach,” she said. Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs in New York, declined to comment. $750,000 Bail U.S. Magistrate Judge Mark Fox ordered Aleynikov, who earned $400,000 a year, to be held by on $750,000 bail, after prosecutors claimed he posed a threat to the community. Aleynikov planned to earn three times his salary by joining a startup company and engaging in high-volume automated trading, prosecutors said. Aleynikov posted bail today and was released. Aleynikov didn’t speak at the hearing, except to say that he understood the conditions of his bail. Teza, co-founded by former Citadel trader Misha Malyshev, said in an e-mailed statement that it first learned of the allegations on July 5 and suspended Aleynikov without pay following an investigation. The firm “was not aware of the alleged misconduct” and offered to cooperate with the government, according to the statement. Reverse Engineering “Someone stealing that code is basically stealing the way that Goldman Sachs makes money in the equity marketplace,” said Larry Tabb, founder of TABB Group, a financial-market research and advisory firm. “The more sophisticated market makers -- and Goldman is one of them -- spend significant amounts of money developing software that’s extremely fast and can analyze different execution strategies so they can be the first one to make a decision.” Someone could use the code “to implement the same strategies and maybe on certain stocks they can be faster and, in effect, take away money that would normally be Goldman’s,” Tabb said today in a phone interview. “The second thing that they can do is actually analyze the code so that they know what Goldman’s going to do before Goldman does it and kind of reverse engineer Goldman’s strategies and make money basically at the expense of Goldman.” ‘Wake-Up Call’ Harvey Pitt, former chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, said proprietary electronic data poses significant risks for all financial institutions. “This is a wake-up call to all financial institutions to review their security systems, not just with respect to trading codes, but with respect to all proprietary information,” said Pitt, now chief executive officer of Kalorama Partners LLC in Washington. Goldman appeared to have taken some steps to prevent the theft of its code, Pitt said. “The real question is whether, in light of this outrageous conduct on the part of one of its employees, it should have taken more steps,” Pitt said. Aleynikov spent four hours with a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent after his July 3 arrest, Shroff said. He told the agent that he’d done nothing wrong, authorized prosecutors to seize his personal computers, and said he hadn’t known the server he was using was in Germany, she said. 32 Megabits Only 32 of 1,024 megabits of the software code was transferred, Shroff said. “It is not disseminated,” she said of the code. Facciponti said at the hearing that Aleynikov could disseminate the code “in 10 minutes” using a cell phone. Once the government obtains access to the German server, prosecutors will see if Aleynikov transferred other confidential data as well, he said. It’s logical to conclude that Aleynikov planned to use the code at his new company, the prosecutor said. “This is the most substantial theft that the bank can remember ever happening to it, in the sense the entire platform has been taken from it,” Facciponti said. “There has been no breaches anywhere on this magnitude at the bank.” Aleynikov worked at Goldman from 2007 until June, the government said in the complaint. He was part of a team of workers responsible for improving the computer platform. His alleged transfer of computer codes ran from June 1 to June 5, according to prosecutors. Moscow, Rutgers Aleynikov studied applied mathematics at the Moscow Institute of Transportation Engineering before transferring to Rutgers University, where he received a bachelor’s degree in computer science in 1993 and a master’s of science degree, specializing in medical image processing and neural networks, in 1996, according to his profile on the social-networking site LinkedIn. Before joining Goldman Sachs, he worked for about eight years at IDT Corp., the U.S. vendor of prepaid calling cards, where he led the team responsible for developing routing systems, according to the profile. His profile on LinkedIn describes him as a vice president in equity strategy at Goldman Sachs and includes two recommendations from colleagues at the firm. Goldman Profit Goldman was the world’s biggest and most profitable securities firm until it converted to a bank in September following the bankruptcy of smaller rival Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. Goldman earned $2.3 billion last year, down from a record $11.6 billion in 2007, as market turmoil caused it to report a fourth-quarter loss, its first in a decade as a public company. Goldman’s equities business generated $2 billion of revenue in the first three months of 2009, down 20 percent from the first quarter of 2008, the company reported in April. Second-quarter results are due to be reported next week. Goldman rose $2.97, or 2.1 percent, to $146.46 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The case is U.S. v. Aleynikov, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

A number of crimes committed by organized groups are done so for the purposes of financial gain. This is called racketeering, which is a felony crime. Characteristics of Organized Crime Groups Organized crime offenses vary greatly, but, there are some generalizations that apply to the groups as a whole. They are all developed based on a hierarchy of power and importance associated with the individuals in the group. They are stable organizations that usually exist over very long periods of time. They may use violence to defend the interests of the group. They usually have political or social protection that keeps them safe from retaliation from the surrounding community, including law enforcement. Their purpose is to accumulate capital which is then reinvested into the operations and businesses run by the group. The majority of organized crime groups operate behind the mask of legitimate businesses. In some cases, their racketeering practices involve the bribery and manipulation of legitimate business owners or public officials. This prevents their racketeering practices from being detected.

Moscow, Rutgers Aleynikov studied applied mathematics at the Moscow Institute of Transportation Engineering before transferring to Rutgers University, where he received a bachelor’s degree in computer science in 1993 and a master’s of science degree, specializing in medical image processing and neural networks, in 1996, according to his profile on the social-networking site LinkedIn. Before joining Goldman Sachs, he worked for about eight years at IDT Corp., the U.S. vendor of prepaid calling cards, where he led the team responsible for developing routing systems, according to the profile. His profile on LinkedIn describes him as a vice president in equity strategy at Goldman Sachs and includes two recommendations from colleagues at the firm. Goldman Profit Goldman was the world’s biggest and most profitable securities firm until it converted to a bank in September following the bankruptcy of smaller rival Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. Goldman earned $2.3 billion last year, down from a record $11.6 billion in 2007, as market turmoil caused it to report a fourth-quarter loss, its first in a decade as a public company. Goldman’s equities business generated $2 billion of revenue in the first three months of 2009, down 20 percent from the first quarter of 2008, the company reported in April. Second-quarter results are due to be reported next week. Goldman rose $2.97, or 2.1 percent, to $146.46 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The case is U.S. v. Aleynikov, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

A number of crimes committed by organized groups are done so for the purposes of financial gain. This is called racketeering, which is a felony crime. Characteristics of Organized Crime Groups Organized crime offenses vary greatly, but, there are some generalizations that apply to the groups as a whole. They are all developed based on a hierarchy of power and importance associated with the individuals in the group. They are stable organizations that usually exist over very long periods of time. They may use violence to defend the interests of the group. They usually have political or social protection that keeps them safe from retaliation from the surrounding community, including law enforcement. Their purpose is to accumulate capital which is then reinvested into the operations and businesses run by the group. The majority of organized crime groups operate behind the mask of legitimate businesses. In some cases, their racketeering practices involve the bribery and manipulation of legitimate business owners or public officials. This prevents their racketeering practices from being detected.

The Netflix Price-Change Hangover [View article] Reed Hasting's is a carnival barker, a mountebank, a flim-flam man, a charlatan and a confidence man. The CFO left the company in January, because he was aware of the fake accounting at NFLX, the lies and the false hype. The Head of investor relations left 3 months ago, because she could no longer lie, about the companies activities and accounting. Both left before any investigation into accounting, or investigation into the manipulation of the stock by hedge funds begins. Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley. JP Morgan, Piper Jaffray and many other financial institutions have been colluding to manipulate this stock thru proprietary trading in their hedge funds. Goldman Sachs picked NFLX as their latest Ponzi Scheme, because Reed Hastings is just the perfect Machiavellian con-man. Lloyd Blankfein And Reed Hastings are as thick as thieves. It was Goldman Sachs that forced Facebook executives to add Reed Hasting to their Board of directors, to manipulate the stock price. Reed Hasting is a false Messiah, in league with Goldman Sachs, deceiving Americans, and The indolent regulators who have been paid off by Goldman Sachs. The SEC directors are bribed by Goldman not to do their job, with promises of $4 million a year jobs after they leave the SEC, at banks, the very banks they are supposed to regulate.

My wife and children just called me crying. Everyone in the hospital and everyone in Benghazi are angry with those people (the radical extremists) and we weep. Islam is peaceful. It is our duty to care for our guests.” He looked down and his shoulders dropped with obvious despair. “We work so hard for peace.” Radical Islamists, not global warming, is the cancer on this world and it must be forcibly removed. While American embassies in Libya, Syria, and many other Arab Muslim nations are under siege, leftist enablers want "dialogue". The 'leftist-that-blame-America' crowd' thinks that an American movie critical of Islam sparked the violence. Nothing could be further from the truth. These coordinated attacks on the eleventh anniversary of 9/11 were premeditated acts of war. An American diplomat was sodomized and dragged through the streets before being killed. The days of dialogue with radical Islamists and their leftist enablers has to end right now. No more "diversity." No more "multiculturalism." No more "understanding." No more "root causes." No more political correctness. No more "sensitivity." No more "appealing to their better nature." This does not work with Islamists, because like leftists, they do not have one. They hate for the sake of hate. Leftists blather about "coming together" and then refuse to come together with Republicans against a threat trying to kill us all.

An interesting consequence of the steep and sustained slide in volume (average daily volume is around half of what it was a year ago, even though there are an additional billion or two of outstanding shares now) is that the HFT's, algos and dark pools have roughly twice as much pull in the intraday as before, and they're certainly using it to jerk the bid/ask up and down like a yo-yo.
