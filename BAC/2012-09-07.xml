Do you think I am bashing. No I am forecasting the future. He nationalized GM and Chrysler and gave it away to his union supporters. How come he did not save Saturn, which was a non-union shop. Let us hope it will not be as bad as this. But things will not be any better for the nation and we perhaps will see an Iranian nuke blowing up Israel.

"There has been no shortage of oil in the market. Producers have been able to meet consumer needs," Abdullah al-Badri told an energy conference. "We also see this as being the case for the rest of 2012 and the foreseeable future." Oil prices surged in March to $128 a barrel, the highest level since 2008, because of concern about possible supply shortages. Prices have since fallen back and brent crude was trading around $118 on Thursday. "Today the price continues to be driven by excessive speculation," Badri said. OPEC at a meeting in December set a target to produce 30 million barrels per day, settling an argument which broke out in 2011 after Iran and other members opposed a Saudi-led plan to raise OPEC's production ceiling. Output has remained above the target all year as Libyan supply recovered after being virtually shut down during the 2011 uprising against Muammar Gaddafi's rule. The extra oil is filling gaps caused by an unusually large number of supply outages globally, which have also helped support prices. Supply breaks were running at nearly 1.3 million bpd as of early April. The additional supply has also offset a decline in exports from Iran, which is facing stiffening western sanctions over its disputed nuclear energy program. Iranian oil exports were running at between 200,000 and 300,000 barrels per day below last year's level, Maria van der Hoeven, head of the International Energy Agency, told Thursday's conference. Iranian officials have said the country exported an average of 2.2 million barrels a day last year. July supply from the 12-member Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ran at 31.75 million barrels per day (bpd), the high est since September 2008, which was shortly before it agreed to a series of supply curbs to combat recession and collapsing demand, based on Reuters surveys</Msg><Username>fairvalue23</Username><Timestamp>1347019221823</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 08:00:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347019256688-24</Id><Title>"There has been no shortage of oil in the market"</Title><Msg>"There has been no shortage of oil in the market" OPEC Says Supply Ample, Speculation Driving Price , | 28 August 2012 | 06:18 AM ET Oil supply will be more than sufficient to meet demand this year and beyond, OPEC's Secretary General said on Thursday, but added the price of fuel is being driven higher by speculation.

The average price for gasoline in the U.S.A would drop to $2.80 per gallon. Naimi Says Brent Oil Should Drop to $80.00 as Supply Tops Demand By Ben Sharples - June 03, 2012 Crude prices should fall because global supply is outweighing demand, according to Saudi Arabia’s oil minister, Ali al-Naimi. “We want a lower price than where it is now,” al-Naimi said in Adelaide today. “We need to get the price to a level of around $80” a barrel for London’s Brent crude, he said. Saudi Arabia is the world’s biggest oil exporter. Brent, a benchmark price for more than half the world’s crude, has dropped 6 percent this month amid concern Europe’s debt crisis will worsen and curb fuel demand. OPEC is working to bring prices down, the group’s Secretary-General, Abdalla el- Badri, said May 3. The producer group, scheduled to meet next month, is pumping 8.3 percent more crude than it considers necessary this quarter, figures from the Vienna-based group show. Brent crude for June settlement dropped 0.8 percent in the week to May 11 to $112.26 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. West Texas Intermediate oil for June delivery slid 2.4 percent to $96.13 a barrel. At $100 a barrel for London’s Brent crude, that equates to around $80.00 a barrel for West Texas Intermediate oil. The average price for gasoline in the U.S.A would drop to $2.80 per gallon. Oil supply outweighs demand by 1.3 million to 1.5 million barrels a day, al-Naimi said today. Saudi Arabia increased output last month to the highest in more than three decades, according to data it provided to OPEC.</Msg><Username>fairvalue23</Username><Timestamp>1347019417965</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 08:03:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347019471739-28</Id><Title>Equates to gasoline prices to average about $2.25 per gallon</Title><Msg>Equates to gasoline prices to average about $2.25 per gallon 28-August-12 08:42 am This eq...

We know every new president usually inherits headaches, but when President Obama came to office, he inherited an entire EMERGENCY room with a shattered economy and close to financial disaster. He has done a remarkable job stopping that disaster. What was wrecked in 8 years requires time and the continuation of the policies he initiated in his first term. Now, he is running into opposition from the same MISGUIDED GOP POLITICIANS who led America into DISASTER under President George W. Bush. In response to their LYING and OBSTRUCTION... the FACTS and the TRUTH should be made clear to the voters and the public! That is vitally important. The stock market is now reflecting the brighter future to come. It is always ahead by a year or two of the general public. As former President Bill Clinton described, people are not yet feeling good because of a known lagging indicator- employment. However, smarter investors are driving the stock market to new record highs. The housing and banking sectors are beginning to turn around and thus the future is indeed looking brighter... thanks to President Obama's wise and steady leadership.</Msg><Username>johnmjay</Username><Timestamp>1347047669969</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 15:54:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347047670354-228</Id><Title>Sell Off Before The Weekend?</Title><Msg>Avoiding any bad news over the weekend...</Msg><Username>gin44857</Username><Timestamp>1347047670354</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 15:54:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347047760329-229</Id><Topic><Title>Sell Off Before The Weekend?</Title><Username>gin44857</Username><Timestamp>1347047670354</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 15:54:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>hahahaha Wrong Dumb Short, are you losing your #$%$</Msg><Username>jamesn13</Username><Timestamp>1347047760329</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 15:56:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347047887966-230</Id><Title>The Already Anemic Ricovery is Stalling Out.

Obama knows the economic info and data in depth and in detail. Romney says he comes from business and he knows very little about the economy but uses only slogans and generalities. Even the crowds listening feel that. As to foreign relation, Romney still appears to live in the 50% by declaring Russia an enemy and the next economic world giant China as 'cheaters'. This kind of talk not only shows how ignorant and behind time he is... but it is also dangerous, indeed. He shows unpreparedness and seem incapable to have discernment and foresight for a candidate running for U.S. and world leadership.

If you like your news positive and grossly oversimplified stop reading now; the details on the report are hideous. Consider: Nonfarm Payroll Employment rose by 96k compared to estimates of 125k - 130k and a far cry from the average growth of 139k in 2012. Last year the average monthly gain was 153k. July's NFP number was revised lower from 163k to 141k. The greatest gains came from the food services and drinking sector. In other words, from waiting tables or bartending. These are some of the most brutal, lowest paying jobs extant. The labor force participation rate fell to 63.5%, the lowest read in over 30 years. When this number goes down so does the stated unemployment rate. To get to 8.1% unemployment, 368,000 Americans had to drop out of the labor force. No matter what you hear or read elsewhere, America's job picture is getting worse. Much, much worse. My Breakout co-host Matt Nesto and I discuss the report in the attached clip. Starting with the participation rate, Nesto notes that "almost 400,000 people dropped out, just gave up" looking for work in August. For each one-tenth of one percent improvement in the unemployment rate, 184,000 Americans had to become quitters. Quitting could mean going on disability, going into the grey market (read: getting paid cash for odd jobs), doing something illicit, or begging. Whatever they're doing instead of working or looking for legitimate jobs, 368,000 Americans gave up on participating in the economy in August alone. What would it take to make you just give up entirely? That's what hundreds of thousands of your fellow Americans went through last month. Think about that if anyone tries to tell you a drop in the headline rate is anything but more evidence of an ongoing national disgrace.</Msg><Username>spanktrison</Username><Timestamp>1347053129986</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 17:25:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347053445255-279</Id><Title>A vote for Obama = informed voters with knowledge understand a good work was started and will continue.</Title><Msg>The smearing and the lying by the right wing idiots has done nothing but prove how uninformed and stupid they are.</Msg><Username>frankmangus</Username><Timestamp>1347053445255</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 17:30:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347053731336-280</Id><Title>I think the right wing losers need to stop cutting and pasting from Fox.

A LAWYER WITH A BRIEFCASE CAN STEAL MORE THAN A THOUSAND MEN WITH GUNS.</Title><Msg>Barack Obama is a lawyer. Michelle Obama is a lawyer. Harry Reid is a lawyer. Nancy Pelosi is a lawyer. Hillary Clinton is a lawyer. Bill Clinton is a lawyer. Every Democrat nominee since 1984 went to law school (although Gore did not graduate). Every Democrat vice presidential nominee since 1976, except for Lloyd Bentsen, went to law school. The Democrat Party is made up of lawyers. Democrats mock and scorn men who create wealth. The Lawyers Party sees these sorts of people, who provide goods and services that people want, as the enemies of America . And, so we have seen the procession of official enemies, in the eyes of the Lawyers Party, grow. Against whom do the Democrat Party of Lawyers rail?....Pharmaceutical companies, oil companies, hospitals, manufacturers, fast food restaurant chains, large retail businesses, bankers, and anyone producing anything of value in our nation. This is the natural consequence of viewing everything through the eyes of lawyers. Lawyers seek to have new laws passed, they seek to win lawsuits, they press appellate courts to overturn precedent, and lawyers always parse language to favor their side. Today, we are drowning in laws; we are contorted by judicial decisions; we are driven to distraction by omnipresent lawyers in all parts of our once private lives. America has a place for laws and lawyers, but that place is modest and reasonable, not vast and unchecked. When the most important decision for our next president is whom he will appoint to the Supreme Court, the role of lawyers and the law in America is too big. Perhaps Americans will understand that change cannot be brought to our nation by those lawyers who already largely dictate American society and business. Perhaps Americans will see that hope does not come from the mouths of lawyers but from personal dreams nourished by hard work. Perhaps Americans will embrace the truth that more lawyers with more power will only make our problems worse. The United States has 5% of the world’s population and 66% of the world’s lawyers! Tort (Legal) reform legislation has been introduced in congress several times in the last several years to limit punitive damages in ridiculous lawsuits such as spilling hot coffee on yourself and suing the establishment that sold it to you and also to limit punitive damages in huge medical malpractice lawsuits. This legislation has continually been blocked from even being voted on by the Democrat Party. When you see that 97%of the political contributions from the American Trial Lawyers Association go to the Democrat Party, then you realize who is responsible for our medical and product costs being so high!</Msg><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1347061130858</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 19:38:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347061154635-299</Id><Title>What's the difference between the extremist fringe-right sack suckers that constantly pollute this board with stupidity and a pile of s*h*!*t*?</Title><Msg>The pile of s*h*!*t* smells better.</Msg><Username>lying_teabag_sakkk_sukkker</Username><Timestamp>1347061154635</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 19:39:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347061283009-300</Id><Topic><Title>What's the difference between the extremist fringe-right sack suckers that constantly pollute this board with stupidity and a pile of s*h*!*t*?</Title><Username>lying_teabag_sakkk_sukkker</Username><Timestamp>1347061154635</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 19:39:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>They really don't care what we think. they polute just about every board. really sick pups. i really think many americans are suffering some sort of borderline schizophrenia. maybe thats how our species dies off...we just dumb away.</Msg><Username>isit2012already</Username><Timestamp>1347061283009</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 19:41:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347061522646-301</Id><Title>Why did "dumpobamie" pick such a blatantly racist and negative ID?

"The other evening on my twitter, a person asked me why I didn't like the Obama's? Specifically I was asked: "I have to ask, why do you hate the Obama's? It seems personal, not policy related. You even dissed (disrespect) their Christmas family picture." The truth is I do not like the Obamas, what they represent, their ideology, and I certainly do not like his policies and legislation. I've made no secret of my contempt for the Obamas. As I responded to the person who asked me the aforementioned question, I don't like them because they are committed to the fundamental change of my/our country into what can only be regarded as a Communist state. I don't hate them per definition, but I condemn them because they are the worst kind of racialists, they are elitist Leninists with contempt for traditional America. They display disrespect for the sanctity of the office he holds, and for those who are willing to admit same, Michelle Obama's raw contempt for white America is transparent. I don't like them because they comport themselves as Emperor and Empress. I expect, no I demand respect, for the Office of President and a love of our country and her citizenry from the leader entrusted with the governance of same. President and Mrs. Reagan displayed an unparalleled love for the country and her people. The Reagan's made Americans feel good about themselves and about what we could accomplish. Obama's arrogance by appointing 32 leftist czars and constantly bypassing Congress is impeachable. Eric Holder is probably the MOST incompetent and arrogant DOJ head to ever hold the job. Could you envision President Reagan instructing his Justice Department to act like jack-booted thugs? Presidents are politicians and all politicians are known and pretty much expected to manipulate the truth, if not outright lie, but even using that low standard, the Obama's have taken lies, dishonesty, deceit, mendacity, subterfuge and obfuscation to new depths. They are verbally abusive to the citizenry, and they display an animus for civility. I do not like them, because they both display bigotry overtly, as in the case of Harvard "Professor" Louis Gates, when he accused the Cambridge Police of "acting stupidly," and Michelle's code speak pursuant to now being able to be proud of America. I view that statement and that mindset as an insult to those who died to provide a country where a Kenyan, his illegal alien relatives, and his alleged progeny, could come and not only live freely, but rise to the highest, most powerful, position in the world. Michelle Obama is free to hate and disparage whites because Americans of every description paid with their blood to ensure her right to do same. I have a saying, that "the only reason a person hides things, is because they have something to hide." No president in history has spent over a million dollars to keep his records and his past sealed. And what the two of them have shared has been proved to be lies. He lied about when and how they met, he lied about his mother's death and problems with insurance, Michelle lied to a crowd pursuant to nearly $500,000 bank stocks they inherited from his family. He has lied about his father's military service, about the civil rights movement, ad nausea. He lied to the world about the Supreme Court in a State of the Union address. He berated and publicly insulted a sitting Congressman. He has surrounded himself with the most rabidly, radical, socialist academicians today. He opposed rulings that protected women and children that even Planned Parenthood did not seek to support. He is openly hostile to business and aggressively hostile to Israel. Michelle treats being the First Lady as her personal American Express Black Card (arguably the most prestigious credit card in the world). I condemn them because, as people are suffering, losing their homes, their jobs, their retirements, he and his family are arrogantly showing off their life of entitlement - as he goes about creating and fomenting class warfare. I don't like them, and I neither apologize nor retreat from my public condemnation of them and of his policies. We should condemn them for the disrespect they show our people, for his willful and unconstitutional actions pursuant to obeying the Constitutional parameters he is bound by, and his willful disregard for Congressional authority. Dislike for them has nothing to do with the color of their skin; it has everything to do with their behavior, attitudes, and policies. And I have open scorn for their constantly playing the race card. It is my intention to do all within my ability to ensure their reign is one term. I could go on, but let me conclude with this. I condemn in the strongest possible terms the media for refusing to investigate them, as they did President Bush and President Clinton, and for refusing to label them for what they truly are. There is no scenario known to man, whereby a white president and his wife could ignore laws, flaunt their position, and lord over the people, as these two are permitted out of fear for their color. As I wrote in a syndicated column titled, "Nero In The White House" - "Never in my life, inside or outside of politics, have I witnessed such dishonesty in a political leader. He is the most mendacious political figure I have ever witnessed. Even by the low standards of his presidential predecessors, his narcissistic, contumacious arrogance is unequalled. Using Obama as the bar, Nero would have to be elevated to sainthood... Many in America wanted to be proud when the first person of color was elected president, but instead, they have been witness to a congenital liar, a woman who has been ashamed of America her entire life, failed policies, intimidation, and a commonality hitherto not witnessed in political leaders. He and his wife view their life at our expense as an entitlement - while America's people go homeless, hungry and unemployed."</Msg><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1347063125976</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 20:12:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347063755056-313</Id><Topic><Title>This pretty much says it all....and from a educated person of color...Mychal Massie is a respected writer and talk show host in Los Angeles.</Title><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1347063125976</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 20:12:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The fringe idiots are capable of cutting and pasting repugnant stupidity, but nothing else.

It's the ultimate distributed energy generation system and is here to stay - just like the transition from mainframes to PCs. You'll get to own your power generation system and only sip power off the grid when you need to. No more public and private utility monopolies and that means more money in your own pocket.

It is a question of how large will be the gap of the win. I think it will be a landslide win. Probably like Obama 54 for Rmoney's 47.

Should they continue on that path after Obama's re-election, this time he will not be a acting a 'nice-guy' anymore. Actually I was mad at him being soft and accepting.... to the DELIBERATE GOP BEHAVIOR and open HATRED as he represents AMERICA.
