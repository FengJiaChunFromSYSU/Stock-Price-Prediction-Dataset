(am I the only one that knows how F'ed up our government is?) I really like the last 2 points. I think the government would have no problem blaming it on the insurance companies. And, there's that promised transparency again :) The site launch was a "gargantuan failure," said health industry consultant Bob Laszewski of Health Policy and Strategy Associates. He estimated that during the federal website's first two weeks, only 10,000 Americans enrolled for insurance, with the websites in states handling their own exchanges getting mixed results. According to The Washington Post, about 185,000 people had signed up by Wednesday on the state-based exchanges. That's a far cry from the seven million Americans expected to enroll within the first year, according to estimates by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office. And more than 50 million Americans lack health care overall. "The health insurance industry is shocked and extremely concerned," Laszweski told AFP. "These people who are enrolling are their customers and (insurance companies) are very concerned that there will be service problems as we go forward and that they will be blamed for it... They are the ones that would have to lose the money." Amid all the criticism, the Obama administration has so far refused to reveal how many Americans have signed up for insurance on its website, promising monthly data starting next month.</Msg><Username>doncassel365</Username><Timestamp>1382190661405</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-10-19 09:51:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382190740551-42</Id><Topic><Title>woof woof woof</Title><Username>cayomarathon</Username><Timestamp>1382190016655</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-10-19 09:40:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>At least that's more intelligent that the political posts!

CMS officials are tight-lipped about why CGI was chosen or how it happened. They also refuse to say if other firms competed with CGI, or if there was ever a public solicitation for building Healthcare.gov, the backbone of Obamacare’s problem-plagued web portal. Instead, it appears they used what amounts to a federal procurement system loophole to award the work to the Canadian firm. [...] In awarding the Healthcare.gov contract, CMS relied on a little-known federal contracting system called ID/IQ, which is government jargon for “Indefinite Delivery and Indefinite Quantity.” CGI was a much smaller vendor when it was approved by HHS in 2007. With the approval, CGI became eligible for multiple awards without public notice and in circumvention of the normal competitive bidding procurement process. The multiple awards were in the form of “task orders” for projects of widely varying size. Over the life of the CGI contract — which expires in 2017 — the IT firm can receive awards worth anywhere from the “$1,000 to $4 billion,” according to a contracting document provided by CGI to the Washington Examiner. This is apparently the route chosen by CMS officials in awarding the Obamacare Healthcare.gov website design contract to CGI.</Msg><Username>dr_james391</Username><Timestamp>1382203289435</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-10-19 13:21:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382204074986-79</Id><Topic><Title>Did Microsoft contract to build-out the Healthcare.gov website?</Title><Username>andym_30054</Username><Timestamp>1382193983534</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-10-19 10:46:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Its a shame nespotism exists when it was touted as a solution for the uninsured, a noble objective that got corrupted</Msg><Username>dr_james391</Username><Timestamp>1382204074986</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-10-19 13:34:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382205658547-80</Id><Topic><Title>Did Microsoft contract to build-out the Healthcare.gov website?</Title><Username>andym_30054</Username><Timestamp>1382193983534</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-10-19 10:46:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I had ignored initial complaints as being normal gripes when a controversial system comes up, and in fact old technology may be a good choice as it tends to be more proven and usable by almost everyone.

And even among the well intended, the effort needed to "posture" or pose to make a risky but potentially win-win result acceptable can be a problem. And often early efforts by critics are wrong, they appear stupid and wasteful compared to the manipulators. However, eventually the sociophiles divorce from reality but the critics figure it out. All praise the humans. I am pretty sure that trying to make ameruca more normal is not a good idea. Would you like to give a presentation at the al bundy kyle dube economics and social development conference? Anyone able to talk to matt foley and get him to show up?

Among other positive highlights within the earnings report included: A consumer credit card loss rate of 3.47% that was the lowest since Q1 2006. Noninterest expense of $16.4B which was down from $17.5B a year ago as the company's cost cutting efforts bear fruit. Mobile banking customers also were up 26% to 14M which should help the bank cut costs in the future. Total revenue came in at $21.7B compared to $20.6B last year. Net interest margin of 2.44% was up 12 basis points from last year's Q3. One of the immediate results of the earnings report was that Evercore raised their earnings estimates and price target on BAC going forward. The analyst firm now sees 2013 EPS of $1 from $0.91, 2014 to $1.36 from $1.30, 2015 to $1.63 from $1.52. The price target was raised to $17 from $16. Buffett's Stake: The Oracle of Omaha has warrants to buy up 700mm shares until 2021 at just over $7 a share. Given the warrants have some 8 years to run and Buffett's long term focus, I think investors can count on the legendary value investor holding onto his stake. He will also, I am quite certain, note his holding in BAC often in myriad interviews over that time span. Both of which can be viewed as a positive. As business conditions improve, credit losses should continue to decline. In addition, JPMorgan seems to have become the Fed's favorite "whipping boy" since their CEO had the audacity to question publicly some of the rules of Dodd-Frank and other regulatory overreach. Bank of America had previously held this unfortunate post for a few years following the housing crisis. The stock sells for ~70% of book value. In addition, earnings are on a significant up ramp. The bank posted earnings per share of only a quarter in 2012 but is tracking to around 90 cents a share in profit this fiscal year. The consensus earnings estimate has BofA making over $1.30 a share in FY2014. Finally, although FY2014. Finally, although the shares pay only a .3% dividend yield currently, look for that to increase substantially in the coming years as the company puts its credit, regulatory and litigation problems behind it. Prior to the financial crisis, the bank was among the biggest dividend payers among major financial institutions. Long Term Buy Growth Estimate BAC Current Qtr Dec 2013 +800.00% Next Qtr. Mar 2014 +200.00% This Year +252.00%</Msg><Username>cchaker</Username><Timestamp>1382219272692</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-10-19 17:47:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382219443693-110</Id><Topic><Title>BAC departs bottom rail , headed for top rail at $16.50 by EOY</Title><Username>jedbs2</Username><Timestamp>1382216380806</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-10-19 16:59:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>At least 16.50</Msg><Username>cchaker</Username><Timestamp>1382219443693</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-10-19 17:50:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1382220313811-111</Id><Title>Massive Profit maid on MD</Title><Msg>ggggggggggg</Msg><Username>aea_101</Username><Timestamp>1382220313811</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-10-19 18:05:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1382220363526-112</Id><Title>Yahoo worth way more than Facebook</Title><Msg>Becuase Yahoo is more intelligent and not plain stupid like AOL or Facebook.

The only thing missing from the site is a counter, showing how many people are on the site at one time. I wanted to compare ObamaCare with Medicare site, so I went to Medicare and boy was I surprised, Signing up for ObamaCare is about 100 times better than signing up for Medicare. Medicare is very confusing and hard to understand just what you need, I can see why people pick Medicare Advantage, everything is rolled into one plan. The Gold plans of ObamaCare are the normal 80/20 PPO or HMO plans We get working for a good company. Healthcare is expensive, since 2000 Healthcare has gone up over 15% per year, ObamaCare will put the brakes on the profits those Healthcare companies make, if it don't, we are all in trouble.</Msg><Username>fireundersmoke</Username><Timestamp>1382229488637</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-10-19 20:38:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1382230622374-125</Id><Title>Arrest them</Title><Msg>Time for the Tea Party Congressmen to pay the piper: US Code (18 U.S.C. § 2384 ), seditious conspiracy is a crime under United States law.

They had bought a lot of gold and instead of the market dropping and gold shooting up, just the opposite happened. So they got their punishment and have paid for their foolishness and corruption by losing a lot of money.
