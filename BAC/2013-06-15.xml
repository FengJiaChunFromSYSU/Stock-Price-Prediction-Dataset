The bank allegedly used these tactics to shepherd homeowners into foreclosure, as well as in-house loan modifications. Both yielded the bank more profits than the government-sponsored Home Affordable Modification Program, according to documents recently filed as part of a lawsuit in Massachusetts federal court. The former employees, who worked at Bank of America centers throughout the United States, said the bank rewarded customer service representatives who foreclosed on homes with cash bonuses and gift cards to retail stores such as Target Corp (TGT.N) and Bed Bath &amp; Beyond Inc (BBBY.O). For example, an employee who placed 10 or more accounts into foreclosure a month could get a $500 bonus. At the same time, the bank punished those who did not make the numbers or objected to its tactics with discipline, including firing. About twice a month, the bank cleaned out its HAMP backlog in an operation called "blitz," where it declined thousands of loan modification requests just because the documents were more than 60 months old, the court documents say. The testimony from the former employees also alleges the bank falsified information it gave the government, saying it had given out HAMP loan modifications when it had not. Rick Simon, a Bank of America Home Loans spokesman, said the bank had successfully completed more modifications than any other servicer under HAMP. "We continue to demonstrate our commitment to assisting customers who are at risk of foreclosure and, at best, these attorneys are painting a false picture of the bank's practices and the dedication of our employees," Simon said in a email, adding the declarations were "rife with factual inaccuracies."

Service representatives were told to lie to homeowners, telling them their paperwork and payments had not been received, when in reality they had. "This is exactly what's been happening to homeowners for years," said Danielle Kelley, a foreclosure defense lawyer in Florida. "No matter how many times they send in their paperwork, or how often they make their payments, they simply can't get loan modifications. They wind up in foreclosure instead." The former employees said they were told to falsify electronic records and string homeowners along in foreclosure as long as possible. The problem was exacerbated because the bank did not have enough employees handling modifications, adding to the backlog of cases purged during the "blitz" operations. Once a HAMP application was delayed or rejected, Bank of America would offer an in-house alternative, charging as high #$%$ percent when the loan could have been modified for 2 percent under HAMP, according to an affidavit by William Wilson, who worked at the bank's Charlotte, North Carolina office. Wilson, who was a case management team manager, said he told his supervisors the practices were "ridiculous" and "immoral." He said he was fired in August 2012. Bank of America said it was not at liberty to discuss personnel matters.</Msg><Username>buffetmunger</Username><Timestamp>1371272133770</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 00:55:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371272464850-3</Id><Topic><Title>Syria kinda reminded me of Viet Nam</Title><Username>kingofvietnam</Username><Timestamp>1371267313169</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 23:35:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>True Orange gas cause millions of Vietnameses to suffer birth defect...cancer....skin burn.....even today years later.....Where is Dow Chemical on that...would you please pay $45B like BP to clean up your Macondo mess in Vietnam??? or Nagazaki...or Iroshima in Japan.....or Fukujima in Japan with poor Nuclear reactor from GE where 6 engineers resign for poor reactor conception???</Msg><Username>techanalyst_trader</Username><Timestamp>1371272464850</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 01:01:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371272745255-4</Id><Topic><Title>realistic range for the dow : 9000-10000 range</Title><Username>geoiguy1</Username><Timestamp>1371265103823</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 22:58:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Feds dope the SP500 &amp; Dow for 6 years......Now the Dope is getting expensive and the market starting to have side effects with visual hallucinations.....and risk of collapse soon if the client do not get proper treatments like cut $85B....bond purchase....rate hike....budget cuts.....pension funds cuts.....etc.....</Msg><Username>techanalyst_trader</Username><Timestamp>1371272745255</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 01:05:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371274614539-5</Id><Topic><Title>*FED has been DOPING Stock Market for 4 years....BEN: Let market run for itselt..</Title><Username>arcanos70</Username><Timestamp>1371184640300</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 00:37:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ever wonder where all the sub prime lending money ended up at.

I mean if you sold stock worth $500,000 every year with gains and losses matched (generating $0 of income) you qualify for the largest health care subsidy available under the program, because it is only income tested not means tested. It will probably never be means tested--could you imagine ferreting out and testing all the assets of every American? Income test is simple--you just go to the filed 1040 tax form held by the IRS. It's a loophole in the plan that will allow every wealthy American to either get the maximum subsidy, or pay a minor fine if they forego the insurance altogether--since the fine amount is also based on income level not asset level.</Msg><Username>roboklerk</Username><Timestamp>1371301469804</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 09:04:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371302126759-10</Id><Topic><Title>realistic range for the dow : 9000-10000 range</Title><Username>geoiguy1</Username><Timestamp>1371265103823</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 22:58:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>except that money in the system (and a lot of it has been printed) is like water and has to flow somewhere. Where is it going to go---- to the bond market at 2%, to CDs at 1%, to commodities falling faster than you can say "Bob's your uncle"?, to Emerging Market equities? to Europe equities? under the mattress? to illiquid intangibles like art and real-estate w/the latter now getting pinched by mortgage rates climbing above 4%? Will it remain on corporate Balance Sheets earning 0% w/huge pension obligations looming (and many companies still assuming annual internal rates of return at 7-8% to meet those obligations?) In a deflationary environment, I completely agree 1% or 2% annual return looks great (generating a real return of perhaps 5-6% annually depending on one's view of how deep the deflation goes). Short of that, U.S. equities would seem to be the only game in town. Europe is likely facing a decade-long workout solution, and China may be facing both a housing crisis and a decade-long rate of decline in their growth rate. Bottom line--where else do you go w/the money?</Msg><Username>roboklerk</Username><Timestamp>1371302126759</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 09:15:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371304316498-11</Id><Topic><Title>Syria kinda reminded me of Viet Nam</Title><Username>kingofvietnam</Username><Timestamp>1371267313169</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 23:35:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I can guarantee you millions more Syrians will die as the Americans and the Russians check out their weapons capacity.</Msg><Username>kingofvietnam</Username><Timestamp>1371304316498</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 09:51:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371310479608-12</Id><Topic><Title>Syria kinda reminded me of Viet Nam</Title><Username>kingofvietnam</Username><Timestamp>1371267313169</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 23:35:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well Troll.

The first USAID weenies and CIA spooks and senior military advisors sent to Saigon in the early 60s starting getting the best they'd ever had of both, and rather than face a quick return to boring wives and Budweiser, they began sending back reports full of 'concerns' aimed at deepening our involvement and extending their tours. I believe Playboy published an article on this subject back in the late 60s or early 70s with a title something like "The Genital Theory of War in SEAsia", although I can't be certain because I was high and only bought the magazine for the nice pictures. I thought Timothy Leary got credit for turning US students into freaks, or maybe it was the Grateful Dead or Frank Zappa or Laugh-In. It was the CIA all along? Man, they must be a whole lot cooler than I thought. As far as sex and drugs making everyone rich, however, they can, but only 'spiritually' rich. Freewheelin' Franklin's theory of commerce expressed this quite succinctly: "[Sex and] Drugs will get you through times of no Money better than Money will get you through times of no [Sex and] Drugs.

So in effect probably yes that is what happened. I find it hard to believe that in the '70's amerucans would leave the country for sex but then maybe I'm assuming amerucan women have some other expressions than disgust and incredulity that the SE asian #$%$ may express more often. However, once over there with no socker mom's on which to fixate they may start to wader from the domestic terroist threat in the minivan to the more overtly commercial equivalent. Recognizing that capitalism has something to do with money and that sex and drugs would be nice without the agent orange, it seems logical for the egalitarian to consider it to promote unity and wealth once back in the USA. The more I look into this, the more reasonable it is for the spies to take credit, just as the no-doc loners have to take some credit for the real estate bubble. In any case, this should not detract from the attitudes of the general culture, the accumulation of wealth that made making more seem silly when manipulation was less ricky and emotionally draining than production, and general patterns of culture lifecycle. But, their ability to do things in secret seems to have brought out more human nature than anyone cares to admit. And sure based on what we know I'm exaggerating a bit but they did enough larger scale tests and were recruiting at major universities during that time and the documented experiments were large enough that they may have more credit than they care to accept. Let's see who is laughing when the US gets a shah to stop of from badmouthing the altruists.
