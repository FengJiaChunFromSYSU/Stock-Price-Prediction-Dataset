I might add that a dog is far more valuable than a dangerous schizophrenic psychopath. Now if that dog had become rabid and embarked on a killing spree, it would have to be put down. I do not believe there is a comparison between a dog and a dangerous schizophrenic psychopath. What we should be asking ourselves is, did Travyon Martin have rabies? Was he susceptible the same symptoms of rabies as would be a rabid animal? Was Travyon Martin an animal? And More importantly, was a he a rabid animal? All very important questions that were overlooked in the trial.</Msg><Username>kerxftw</Username><Timestamp>1373877907365</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 04:45:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373878082152-10</Id><Topic><Title>Michael Vick spent 548 days in prison for fighting dogs.

Take the media and the way a defense can pick a jury out of the justice system. There should be no trial on TV, the media should keep far away from any trial, their opinion is only used to insight the public, this was a simple case. If you are being followed by the Zimmerman's of this world, the law allows you to take him out, the law works both ways. Don't be a victim, if you are being followed by anyone for no reason, deadly force is your only option. Make sure they are dead and you can lie all you want to be in the right. Arm up America, everyone should have a legal means of protection under the law. Where is that baby killer Casey Anthony? Another fixed jury with no brains, American failed justice system at work. "Vigilante justice" is still the best way for true justice, never count on this joke of a justice system for anything.</Msg><Username>fireundersmoke</Username><Timestamp>1373893963424</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 09:12:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373894113155-46</Id><Title>the msm using the trayvon case to distract from obama's failure to deal with Iran</Title><Msg>their nuclear program has been grinding away, each day closer , and obama is powerless to do anything.

Bonds fluctuate in value and I have no interest in selling. I have $1000 bonds I bought at $560 each getting 6.22% on the thousand. $13,000 bought me $24,000 of BAC bonds at a yeild of 11.48% on my $13,000. Those bonds are selling at $1080 each and if I sold today would get $12,920 profit on the sale not counting the $4478 interest I have received over the three years I've had them. I have over $800,000 in bonds that will pay over $42,000 in interest this year and more next year no matter what the selling value of the bonds are. When bonds are paid off, the values are $1000 each. Today I received $1000 in interest, over $7000 in accrued interest and looking for more bonds to buy.

In addition to these recent developments, DRAM will benefit from skyrocketing memory prices (it's main core business for the last several decades). DRAM was already on the verge of profitability even before the 2 factors mentioned above will have a significant positive effect on earnings in the current and future quarters, . The current 0.2 X sales compared to 1.5 sector average is ridiculous and will be corrected soon. DRAM’s current market cap is only $8 million. There only 1.4M tightly held shares on the float. 1) AMD and DRAM announced in May (5/8/2013 AMD Press Release and 5/12/2013 DRAMPress Release) that DRAM will begin manufacturing all new AMD Gamer Series memory modules and will provide it's RAMDisk software to drive all AMD Radeon products. The Gamer Series memory is compatible with AMD and Intel platforms, supporting both AMP and XMP memory profiles. Recent reviews rank AMD Gamer Series memory the fastest and more reliable for gaming and other applications requiring super-fast processing speeds. "AMD Radeon RG2133 Gamer Series Memory is armed with features designed to outperform the competition on any task," said Roman Kyrychynskyi, product director, Graphics Business Unit, AMD. "Designed with multi-platform compatibility in mind, the AMD Radeon RG2133 brings cutting-edge technology, as well as uncompromising quality and compatibility for PC gamers. "AMD and Dataram have worked together to significantly enhance the dynamic background load-and-save feature in order to create a seamless, non-volatile RAMDisk experience," said Jason Caulkins, CTO, Dataram. "This underscores AMD and Dataram's continued dedication to delivering the highest-performing memory products. 2) DRAM is also pursuing it's RAMDisk technology in the energy, banking, simulations, military, medical, and other sectors requiring super-fast processing speeds</Msg><Username>ntofive</Username><Timestamp>1373898834880</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 10:33:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373898872824-85</Id><Topic><Title>Have any Teabaggers noticed that the stock market is at all time highs under the great Obama !</Title><Username>dubbyaworstever</Username><Timestamp>1373898485148</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 10:28:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Awwwww-Men brooder !!</Msg><Username>dubbyaworstever</Username><Timestamp>1373898872824</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 10:34:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373898980103-86</Id><Topic><Title>Have any Teabaggers noticed that the stock market is at all time highs under the great Obama !</Title><Username>dubbyaworstever</Username><Timestamp>1373898485148</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 10:28:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No ..... but many people are starting to realize that it is a bubble pumped up by the Fed printing money !!</Msg><Username>starkdirt</Username><Timestamp>1373898980103</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 10:36:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373899056921-87</Id><Topic><Title>Have any Teabaggers noticed that the stock market is at all time highs under the great Obama !</Title><Username>dubbyaworstever</Username><Timestamp>1373898485148</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 10:28:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You mean like the G W Bush real estate Wall Street Bankster Bubble ??????</Msg><Username>dubbyaworstever</Username><Timestamp>1373899056921</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 10:37:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373899187023-88</Id><Topic><Title>Have any Teabaggers noticed that the stock market is at all time highs under the great Obama !</Title><Username>dubbyaworstever</Username><Timestamp>1373898485148</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 10:28:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Even Carter looks good compared to Bush, so the bar was pretty low !</Msg><Username>sirifuture</Username><Timestamp>1373899187023</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 10:39:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373899257406-89</Id><Topic><Title>Should anyone be concerned about the welfare of anyone else on here?</Title><Username>ghostwriteronthestorm</Username><Timestamp>1373671544054</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 19:25:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ROTF no, I didn't mention that, did I?

TARGET $30+..WHY?: 1) HUGE MEMORY MANUFACTURING DEAL WITH AMD, 2) MEMORY PRICES UP!, 3) DIVERSIFICATIO</Title><Msg>The two biggest reasons for DRAM’s incredible upside from today’s prices are discussed below. In addition to these recent developments, DRAM will benefit from skyrocketing memory prices (it's main core business for the last several decades). DRAM was already on the verge of profitability even before the 2 factors mentioned above will have a significant positive effect on earnings in the current and future quarters, . The current 0.2 X sales compared to 1.5 sector average is ridiculous and will be corrected soon. DRAM’s current market cap is only $8 million. There only 1.4M tightly held shares on the float. 1) AMD and DRAM announced in May (5/8/2013 AMD Press Release and 5/12/2013 DRAMPress Release) that DRAM will begin manufacturing all new AMD Gamer Series memory modules and will provide it's RAMDisk software to drive all AMD Radeon products. The Gamer Series memory is compatible with AMD and Intel platforms, supporting both AMP and XMP memory profiles. Recent reviews rank AMD Gamer Series memory the fastest and more reliable for gaming and other applications requiring super-fast processing speeds. "AMD Radeon RG2133 Gamer Series Memory is armed with features designed to outperform the competition on any task," said Roman Kyrychynskyi, product director, Graphics Business Unit, AMD. "Designed with multi-platform compatibility in mind, the AMD Radeon RG2133 brings cutting-edge technology, as well as uncompromising quality and compatibility for PC gamers. "AMD and Dataram have worked together to significantly enhance the dynamic background load-and-save feature in order to create a seamless, non-volatile RAMDisk experience," said Jason Caulkins, CTO, Dataram. "This underscores AMD and Dataram's continued dedication to delivering the highest-performing memory products. 2) DRAM is also pursuing it's RAMDisk technology in the energy, banking, simulations, military, medical, and other sectors requiring super-fast processing speeds</Msg><Username>ntofive</Username><Timestamp>1373915488136</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 15:11:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373915619408-171</Id><Topic><Title>How will bac react if AIG wins in court ???

I think her approval will mostly be a non event since this has been out there for a long time. A larger potential event that I think everyone has forgotten is the $10 billion lawsuit AIG has outstanding against BAC that is separate from this. That one has yet to play out, although AIG was successful in getting it transferred from federal court to NY state court. The wild card will be whether the Feds telling BAC they wouldn't be liable since this lawsuit involves the bonds the Feds took over from AIG becomes an overriding factor. AIG is working hard to prove that the Feds had no right to make that statement and that BAC is, therefore, liable.</Msg><Username>tigger.redux</Username><Timestamp>1373917142146</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 15:39:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373917344634-183</Id><Topic><Title>Remember when G W Bush bailed out all the big banks with a trillion borrowed US taxpayer dollars ?</Title><Username>dubbyaworstever</Username><Timestamp>1373914612515</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 14:56:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yes and obama printed more than $5000B false $ and the Yanks change it in real currencies and stealing money all over the world.

The only person who committed a crime was Trayvon. The logical failing is that his parents weren't charged by Angela Corey with child neglect and child endangerment since her "team" kept referring to the 17 year old juvenile delinquent as a "child" who was walking alone very late at night on a very dark night. TM committed a felony premeditated assault and battery as well as a federal violation of civil rights. His girlfriend testified to the premeditation and racial profiling, and the attack evidence lined up completely in favor of George Zimmerman having suffered an ambush. Every bit of evidence determined that Trayvon had the opportunity to leave and a working cell phone with which to call police if he was in fear. That he did neither of these and instead planned a racially motivated attack speaks volumes to your idiocy and that of his other "supporters", aka race baiting liberal self-immolating dunderheads. It's all in the books now. Humanity and civilization prevailed. Subhuman animal behavior was thwarted by justifiable use of superior firepower and immunity from future civil proceedings. The parents of TM suffered the loss of their problem child that they'd been shipping back &amp; forth as they increasingly couldn't handle him, and they walked scot-free, which is a real tragedy considering they raised a little wannabe monster who was still under their guardianship.</Msg><Username>obamalipsync</Username><Timestamp>1373920696002</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 16:38:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373920901745-197</Id><Topic><Title>$14.00 today</Title><Username>eliehanna72</Username><Timestamp>1373915822282</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 15:17:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm looking for closer to $15 by end of week after earnings get reported.

Speed is good, as Dr. Gonzo affirmed, but not when it hastens your arrival at an incorrect conclusion or a moral monday gathering, or when it runs you over a cliff. Again you chirp, and again your proclivity for making haste towards ill-considered destinations is evident. For example, did you think by replying to my thread but avoiding directly addressing your comments to me that you'd dropped the ace of rhetorical trump on my hand? Or that your feeble attempt to portray me as running with a fictional pack of straw-dogs that you invented, those 'losers', 'shorts', 'you guys', etc., was sly beyond measure? ROTFLMAO what a sorry ballsmuggler.....I try to be nice but in the end it always comes down to reaching for a board with a nail in the end of it......There, now that I have your undivided attention: once upon a time [2nd week of March 2011] I arrived at this board as a long-time Bank of America multiple account holder with a warning about protestors at BAC offices in Boston. The stock at that time was $14.30 or thereabouts, if I recall.....anyway, the more time I studied BAC, the curiouser I got, and what do you know? Within a year I'd closed all my BofA accounts, and set my sights on running this pig into the ground. I had it down to $5, but the FEDs have supplied the beast with a portable oxygen tank and auto-drip steroid injections, and although it's back to reeling drunkenly and churning up a lot of mud, it STILL hasn't gotten back to where it was when I started chewing on its hindquarters. ROTFLMAO to use your kind of logic, it's only a matter of time before I wear it down and kill it, right?.</Msg><Username>fish2kill</Username><Timestamp>1373924730155</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 17:45:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373925173153-212</Id><Topic><Title>Why Debate The Trial?</Title><Username>citamar</Username><Timestamp>1373914840058</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 15:00:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>tadpole killer - would YOU allow you 17 year kid - to go out at 3am in the morning - for supposedly to get Ice Tea - an snack - in a troubled area - knowing they are having break ins an robbery's - Treyvon's father was at fault -for failing to properly supervise - his SON - an permitting that child to go out at 3am - an now all would be ok - IF daddy gets 5 dollars .!!!!!!!! horse manure</Msg><Username>da23533</Username><Timestamp>1373925173153</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 17:52:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373925647287-213</Id><Topic><Title>today is a very good day for America - salut to George Zimmerman</Title><Username>big_triceratops</Username><Timestamp>1373778742965</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-14 01:12:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>View wants to move on.

The defense already has full immunity from any civil action. There is no other response possible from the court, except to award the defense any and all damages it claims resulting from the litigation, including legal fees, lost wages, reputational damage, etc. You are completely and totally wrong. There will be no civil matter. That's why the parents are remaining quiet, and it is why Mark O'Mara said that he would seek and would be granted immunity from any further civil matters. Anyone who opens their mouth the wrong way now, including NBC and Nancy Grace, will suffer financial settlements in the millions for their libel/slander of Zimmerman. As much as you want it to be the other way in favor of a juvenile delinquent who was guilty of racially profiling a Hispanic as a white male (or cracker, as described in court by his GF) and then premeditating and executing a felonious assault &amp; battery, it simply isn't happening in the real universe.

Like many others, he assumed the early hours of July 1st were going to be another regular day filled with the normal day-to-day activities of life in middle class America – a day that included stopping for gas at a Marbleton, GA gas station in the suburbs of Atlanta. Unfortunately for Joshua, filling up his tank meant he had to exit his vehicle. Joshua had the misfortune of the same condition that afflicted George Zimmerman that fateful and now infamous night of Feb 26th, 2012 – REWW. (*) Apparently that was sufficient enough for him to be “Trayvonned”. The media is silent on what compelled the attackers, but what is known is that Joshua was set upon and mercilessly beaten in a life-threatening attack by a group of four “unarmed” black males. In a desperate attempt at self-preservation, Joshua began backing away from his attackers – stumbling onto the parkway in front of the gas station where he was run over by a passing car. The driver of the vehicle stopped, rendered aid and called 9-11 but Joshua died of his injuries. Did any of you know about this attack? No. Because the media reported it as a “hit and run fatality” while deliberately refusing to discuss the events the preceded the fatal “hit and run”. This is where you need to sit up and pay attention. In addition to deliberately suppressing the full, true story of what happened to Joshua, the corporate media made a deliberate and coordinated editorial effort to spin the story: MABLETON, Ga. – Cobb County police hope to catch the hit-and-run driver who fatally struck 36-year-old Joshua Heath Chellew of Mableton as he walked along Mableton Parkway early Sunday. The sanitization of this egregious racially motivated hate crime by the corporate media commenced almost immediately. The national media refused to even entertain discussion about the Scheme Team fallout from the “Justice for Trayvon” rhetoric. Three of the four accused are 18 years of age – or in the venacular of John Guy, simply misguided youths a mere 24 mths past the tender age of 16.</Msg><Username>zevoter01</Username><Timestamp>1373944110004</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 23:08:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373945212101-269</Id><Title>Now we know beyond all doubt, libs/democraps are definitely low info people</Title><Msg>Sub-human at best...........</Msg><Username>drwstring</Username><Timestamp>1373945212101</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 23:26:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373945310777-270</Id><Title>Just look at the hateful lib troll on this board and his pathetic aka's...libs are losers</Title><Msg>No doubt about it.......just look at obama, pelosi and reid.</Msg><Username>drwstring</Username><Timestamp>1373945310777</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 23:28:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373946278328-271</Id><Title>DRAM $4.78 UP 11% TODAY ....

The sector average is 1.5 times sales. - DRAM’s market cap is $8 million. - 1.4M shares float. Major Catalysts for Explosive Profitable Growth relative to its current valuation: 1) DRAM is and will benefit from skyrocketing memory prices (it's main core business for the last several decades). DRAM was almost profitable last quarter when memory prices were still near a bottom. Since the start of the quarter to be reported next week DRAM prices have increased about 70% 2) AMD and DRAM announced in May (5/8/2013 AMD Press Release and 5/12/2013 DRAMPress Release) that DRAM will begin manufacturing all new AMD Gamer Series memory modules and will provide it's RAMDisk software to drive all AMD Radeon products. The Gamer Series memory is compatible with AMD and Intel platforms, supporting both AMP and XMP memory profiles. Recent reviews rank AMD Gamer Series memory as the fastest and more reliable for gaming and other applications. "AMD Radeon RG2133 Gamer Series Memory is armed with features designed to outperform the competition on any task," said Roman Kyrychynskyi, product director, Graphics Business Unit, AMD. "Designed with multi-platform compatibility in mind, the AMD Radeon RG2133 brings cutting-edge technology, as well as uncompromising quality and compatibility for PC gamers. "AMD and Dataram have worked together to significantly enhance the dynamic background load-and-save feature in order to create a seamless, non-volatile RAMDisk experience," said Jason Caulkins, CTO, Dataram. "This underscores AMD and Dataram's continued dedication to delivering the highest-performing memory products. 3) DRAM is looking into diversifying with its RAMDisk software technology into many verticals needing faster and faster computing processing speeds such as the energy, banking, military, defense, government, NASA, medical, etc..</Msg><Username>carmelitapolo</Username><Timestamp>1373946278328</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 23:44:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373947145099-272</Id><Title>DJIA under 10K by end of July and Bernanke is out!!!!!!</Title><Msg>Good luck to Yelen!
