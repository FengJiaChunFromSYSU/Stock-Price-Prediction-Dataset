GRO's 80.81% owned subsidiary Agria Asia owns 379.1mm PGW.NZ shares, which equals 50.22% of PGW.NZ's shares outstanding. PGW.NZ is currently NZ$0.39 per share, valuing Agria Asia's stake at NZ$147.85mm or USD$125.67mm. GRO's 80.81% interest in Agria Asia values GRO's stake at $101.56mm. GRO only has 55.38mm shares outstanding. If we divide $101.56mm by 55.38mm, GRO will likely rapidly rise by at least 25% to a minimum of $1.83 per share, so that its market cap equals the current market value of its stake in PGW.NZ. GRO also owns 100% of a China seeds business with $17mm in revenues and 98% revenue growth. Including GRO's China seeds business, GRO deserves to be trading well above $2. GRO's CEO Alan Lai was just yesterday appointed the Chairman of PGW.NZ, and he has previously expressed his interest in merging PGW.NZ's international seeds business into GRO's booming China seeds business, which could increase the value of GRO tremendously. The majority of GRO's debt listed on its balance sheet is actually debt of PGW.NZ, which currently has a very healthy debt level. GRO only has $75mm of its own debt, with $32mm of it not maturing until May 2018. GRO's $43mm in short-term debt is already backed by $26.8mm in pledged restricted cash deposits, leaving only $16.2mm in short-term debt that GRO will need to pay back from its current cash position of $42.7mm. GRO received $8.33mm in fiscal 2013 cash dividends from PGW.NZ and could receive much larger annual dividends from PGW.NZ moving forward. By the time GRO's $32mm loan matures in 2018, GRO's cash position could easily be $65-$85mm.</Msg><Username>sifj4583</Username><Timestamp>1382508859374</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-23 02:14:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1382515422073-20</Id><Title>The Tea Bagger Party: A Farce To Be Reckoned With.

The Flying/Raving Fish, his whiny travel companion, and the mighty Model 17 are all safe and uninjured after another daring sprint below the radar. It would be unwise to divulge our current location or circumstances, but we are fine, making slow but steady progress towards our final destination, and enjoying some of the blessings of civilization that have been missing from our daily routines such as hot food, cold beer and good internet access. It looks like relatively smooth sailing from here. I see the US ambassador to France was called in for a formal rump-bashing by the French Foreign Minister over the NSA's eavesdropping operations conducted from The City of Lights and other more bucolic cheese-eating locales. ROTFLMAO my companion sez if you think his disclosures about drones and domestic wiretapping caused a ruckus in some circles, wait until he unloads (or should I say "downloads"?) some of the juicier details those surrender monkeys phone taps revealed about the scale of US banking's CDO liabilities in the EU and beyond. Short-term, though, the future for the banks looks a little brighter.....thanks to the government shutdown very few US jobs were created last month, so the Fed can justify taking their taper act on the road (Street?) until a more robust recovery manifests itself. ROTFLMAO i.e. forever. As long as nothing else goes wrong, banking investors should be happy.

My use of the word noxious came from the low end of the caustic scale, but not the lowest. And, my use is correct in THIS context.

They should have had a bunch of pieces that were pretty much tested that they just had to change some artwork and some database details. If they used old technology, usually that means stable well tested with lots of people experienced at using it.. This could be a few simple to fix things or they may scrap the entire thing but in either case you would think somewhere in the gov, they have a template already. In the US, you have to suspect that a lot of IT companies are fronts for the CIA or NSA anyway. These people are probably writing widgets that employers never intend to use. Others are writing high speed trading code, the really bright people write video games. There are lots of people who can write webpages, but this sounds like they had a hard time keeping track of the shopping cart and account information. Hopefully someone will have a technical analysis at some point, not quite an IT Benghazi but it sure seems like a spectacular failure for a high profile project. There are people who know how to create code but don't have any idea how it actually works so they don't know if it is good when the system gets deployed.But all they really needed to do was test it and try to make it somewhat tolerant of overloads or hacking. They really should not have needed EDS or IBM or a mob of PhD's or was there something fancy they tried to do?</Msg><Username>spocklovesyou</Username><Timestamp>1382557933589</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-23 15:52:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1382557957960-127</Id><Title>BAC Before Chrismas</Title><Msg>when this beast wake up from the deep sleep before christmas, we will see 10% rise in a day straight up to $17 before chrismas and $21 early next year!</Msg><Username>henryhyw</Username><Timestamp>1382557957960</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-23 15:52:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1382558108167-128</Id><Title>CNBC REPORTING VERY BAD NEWS FOR BAC</Title><Msg>HUGE FINES BILLIONS</Msg><Username>cybercash2014</Username><Timestamp>1382558108167</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-23 15:55:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382558280799-129</Id><Topic><Title>CNBC REPORTING VERY BAD NEWS FOR BAC</Title><Username>cybercash2014</Username><Timestamp>1382558108167</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-23 15:55:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>50 billion potentially (the snowball effect)...and that's just for BAC...poor JPM and C too (but not really "poor"...what goes around comes around, eventually, I suppose)</Msg><Username>jmlregoog</Username><Timestamp>1382558280799</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-23 15:58:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382558296963-130</Id><Topic><Title>Jury Finds Countrywide Guilty of Fraud</Title><Username>jmlregoog</Username><Timestamp>1382557617226</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-23 15:46:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Penalty phase is Judge deciding how much to give the government. The government wants around $850 million. I really have to rethink my investment in BAC now. I did not realize how stupid the average person is who sits on a jury. I'll probably stick it out to see what the judge decides and if he offers a split between liability between government and BAC or whether he just slams BAC with everything. Really really discouraging. Let's see, these mortgages go through a system with many people working in it with no sign of collusion between employees. You have an incompetent higher up guy who complains about everything, and we know the type. Now he gets $1.7 million as a Whistle blower even though there was NO evidence of a scam. It simply was a system being utilized with all the bugs (I guess microsoft has never had a patch for its systems) of a new system. Then you have Credit Agencies stamping these as AAA. If there was anything wrong with them then why would they be stamped with AAA by an Independent company? Plus they may have become junk but that is due to the economy falling apart as happens every few years. People could not get jobs thus they defaulted on their mortgages. That is called RISK! I better start looking for a new stock since this is really bad not that BAC did anything wrong, again, it is that jurors are just incredibly stupid.</Msg><Username>nasa_rs</Username><Timestamp>1382558296963</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-23 15:58:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382558300222-131</Id><Topic><Title>Jury Finds Countrywide Guilty of Fraud</Title><Username>jmlregoog</Username><Timestamp>1382557617226</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-23 15:46:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This may be the time to put Countryside into bankruptcy</Msg><Username>jack_mlyn</Username><Timestamp>1382558300222</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-23 15:58:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1382558315992-132</Id><Title>DIVE, DIVE, DIVE</Title><Msg>bye bye BEACH of A!</Msg><Username>tradewindsiv</Username><Timestamp>1382558315992</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-23 15:58:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382558401339-133</Id><Topic><Title>CNBC REPORTING VERY BAD NEWS FOR BAC</Title><Username>cybercash2014</Username><Timestamp>1382558108167</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-23 15:55:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good news for taxpayers and the country.

Or as jesus said they gather advisors who tell them what they want to hear, the hard part was always soliciting and considering contrary or derogatory information. You never had to encourage brats to puff up each other for personal gain.

New York state Supreme Court Justice Barbara Kapnick, who must decide whether to approve the settlement, denied the motion by AIG and other groups of investors to turn the limited proceeding known as an Article 77 into a broader inquiry known as a plenary action. Kapnick said at a hearing on Tuesday that she could accomplish what was necessary under Article 77. "I really think I have a lot of discretion," she said. An Article 77 is a special proceeding, limited in scope, that generally is used in run-of-the-mill trust matters. Objectors to the settlement wanted to transform the case into a plenary action for a full hearing. The settlement would resolve claims from investors in mortgage bonds issued by Countrywide Financial Corp, which was purchased in 2008 by Bank of America. BlackRock Inc , MetLife Inc and Allianz SE's Pacific Investment Management Co are among 22 institutional investors who agreed to the accord. Other investors have complained the payout is too low. In a statement, AIG said it intervened "to ensure that it and other investors have adequate information to assess Bank of America's settlement." AIG said it looked forward "to the opportunity to examine the facts and to assess whether Bank of New York has endorsed a deal that unreasonably benefits Bank of America or whether it appropriately compensates investors who were harmed by Countrywide." 'POSITIVE STEP' Kathy Patrick, an attorney for the institutional investors, viewed the judge's decision as a positive step. "She confirmed the trustee was entitled to proceed under Article 77, which is a summary, expedited form of proceeding," Patrick said after the hearing.

"Whether it's an Article 77 or a plenary action," said Moon, "I view it as winning the battle because the judge implied there would be adequate disclosure of the facts surrounding the settlement." Kevin Heine, a spokesman for Bank of New York Mellon , declined comment. The judge asked the parties to work out proposals for providing documents. Objectors to the proposed settlement want wide discovery, while the trustee wants less. "Everybody's going to get part of what they want," Kapnick said. Kapnick also heard arguments on whether to allow the attorneys general of New York and Delaware to intervene in the case. She made no decision on that. AIG, which has said Bank of America is "drastically underpaying," is one of two big objectors to the settlement. Baupost Group, a Boston-based hedge fund run by Seth Klarman, operating under the name Walnut Place LLC, is the other. A handful of Federal Home Loan Banks are among those seeking broader scrutiny of the deal.
