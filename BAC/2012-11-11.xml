"The huge earnings this quarter for four of the companies follow the big five companies’ record profit of $137 billion in 2011—amounting to $375 million per day—thanks again to high oil and gasoline prices. ExxonMobil, Chevron, and ConocoPhillips were the first-, second-, and 13th-most profitable public U.S. companies in 2011, respectively. What are these companies doing with this treasure? Some of these funds provide their $72 billion in cash reserves. And these five companies used 31 percent of their 2012 profits to buy back their own stock, which enriches shareholders but doesn’t add to oil supplies or investments in alternative fuels or other new technologies. ExxonMobil spent 42 percent of their profits repurchasing their own stock. Even with these huge earnings and large cash reserves, however, these companies produced 6 percent less oil than one year ago. What’s more, the big five oil companies continue to spend millions of dollars on lobbying and political donations. They have spent a combined $25.7 million lobbying Congress so far this year, and more than $91 million over the last 18 months. ExxonMobil alone spent $17 million lobbying for the past 18 months, making it the top spender in the oil and gas industry. Collectively, the oil and gas industry, including the big five companies and Koch Industries, has spent nearly $70 million on lobbying this year."</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1352615058631</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-11 01:24:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352620087005-8</Id><Title>GOP Is DONE</Title><Msg>You lost for a reason, teabaggers.

California is saddled with a litany of problems, including a long-running budget crisis, massive, unfunded public pension obligations, tuition increases at California universities and growing demands for water, affordable housing and energy. A surge in immigrants has transformed the state and its voting patterns. The number of Hispanics, blacks and Asians combined has outnumbered whites since 1998 in California, and by 2020 the Hispanic population alone is expected to top that of whites. Similiar shifts are taking place across the nation. What is so unbelievably funny (and sad at the same time) is that amnesty for Hispanics is at the top of Obama’s socialist agenda and more importantly, California cannot dig its’ way out of its’ financial hole without raising taxes substantially while at the same time, severely cutting back on expenditures.</Msg><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1352639396701</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-11 08:09:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352639719682-24</Id><Topic><Title>Bank of America or the whiners posting site</Title><Username>casehw</Username><Timestamp>1352611585479</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-11 00:26:25 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It is not plural, IE. “whiners”.

We've been told the national debt is so large that we'll never be able to pay it back. We have experienced an economic crisis unlike any since the Great Depression. We have watched our environment head toward disaster and our government stand at an impasse. We have been told over and over that America is no longer the great country it once was. But our participation in the election and our overwhelming support for the president are indicative of our hope for the future and our compulsion to start tackling these problems now. Opinion: Women gain wider access to power We don't support the president just because he's "cool," plays basketball or listens to Jay-Z. Instead, we recognize that he, too, is ready to meet these great challenges. And we want to help him build a stronger, safer, more just America.

Apparently the shock of the Romney defeat rendered him silent. But there were thoughts galore about the CIA head’s resignation—the FBI investigation into the email trail undercovering ‘lots of human drama’ GOP Sen Saxby Chambless labelled him “a great leader, a great patriot” Dem Sen Patty Murray fels “we do have the ability to avoid going off the fiscal cliff”. ‘tis pity she is called “Patty”, for she shows much wisdom. Chambless, on the cliff, argues that we mUSt look at spending—and he does focus upon “entitlement” reductions. He spoke the Gop LINE OF “JOB creators’ BEING those threatened by a tax hike. Sen Murray speaks of the need for a “fair deal” as absolutely critical, yes dealing with “loopholes’ BUT Also the threat such closings could unfairly harm the middle class. Sen Chambless—“:my way or the highway” is unwise, yes he was pointing at the President, not the Gop. He stresses “entitlement reform” part of doing it “the right way” Nation magazine editor K Vandenheuvel called the election one of two views—“You are on your own’ vs “We are in this together” WSJ’s Paul Gigot feels Obama ‘destroyed’ Romney during spring and early summer months by Obama’s focus upon capital. Karl Rove would approve that thought. Young GOP REPR Aaron Schock urges GOP attention to Hispanics, AKA Latinos, one assumes. Donna Edwards, Dem Rep from Md, claims Obama approach of infrastructure attention plus tax raise for the one per cent is a wise approach. Brief mention of 2016 race—Hillary called favorite, Biden does exist, and then the GOP names surfaced—ryan, Christie, at least one Bush, the La governor, a man not skilled with dealing with a Democrat legislature. Funny, no mention Romney. Still no “in memoriam”, also no “what year did this happen”, and a sad listing of those in the military who made the ultimate sacrifice—three of four from upstate New York. A bit like Civil War reports, where military units came from one state or region (20th maine, Iron brigade). All four casualties were in 20s. Sponsors included, Dell, IBM, that petroleum group, NYS economic development, Chas Schwab, United Healthcare, Chevron.</Msg><Username>one_tribute</Username><Timestamp>1352656148758</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-11 12:49:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352656314967-101</Id><Topic><Title>LIERS</Title><Username>carolyne47</Username><Timestamp>1352655244947</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-11 12:34:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Get a life carolyn47!

The president had nothing to do with the loan, which the Export-Import Bank approved for Brazil to buy U.S.-made equipment and services. FULL ANSWER This claim stems from a "preliminary committment" made back on April 14 by the board of directors of the Export-Import Bank of the United States. The bank intends to loan up to $2 billion to finance exports to the Brazilian oil company Petróleo Brasileiro S.A., known as Petrobras, over the next several years. The e-mail is false on two counts. The message falsely says the decision was due to an "executive order" by the president. No presidential order was required. Furthermore, none of President Obama’s appointees had joined the Ex-Im board at the time of the vote, which was unanimous, and bipartisan. The Ex-Im Bank states: "In fact, at the time the Bank’s Board consisted of three Republicans and two Democrats, all of whom were appointed by George W. Bush." The message falsely claims that "we have absolutely no gain" from the loan. In fact, the loan is being made specifically to finance purchase by Petrobras of U.S.-made oilfield equipment and services. The mission of the Ex-Im Bank is to encourage exports by making such loans. The bank’s chairman and president, Fred P. Hochberg, underscored the purpose of the loan during a trip to Brazil at the end of July: Ex-Im Bank President Hochberg, July 29: I chose Brazil as my first international destination for good reason: Brazil is a powerhouse among South American economies and offers tremendous opportunities for U.S. exporters in many sectors. I want Brazilians to know that Ex-Im Bank has the will and the capacity to finance their purchases of U.S. equipment, products and services Obama appointed Hochberg to the Ex-Im Bank on April 20, nearly a week after the board voted to approve the loan. He was confirmed May 14 and sworn in May 21. The message claims that George Soros would "benefit most" from the loan, but that is also a baseless accusation. Soros is a favorite whipping boy of conservatives because of his early financial help to the liberal group MoveOn.org. And he is indeed a major investor in Petrobras, through his New York-based hedge-fund firm, Soros Fund Management LLC. But the hedge fund recently sold 22 million shares of common stock in the company (which carry voting rights) while buying 5.8 million shares of preferred stock (which is non-voting.) As reported by Bloomberg News, Soros reduced his stake in the company before any of the Ex-Im Bank’s promised loan has been dispensed.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1352683731393</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-11 20:28:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352683847042-188</Id><Topic><Title>will jugears obama be sending a dogie bag to mike vick ?</Title><Username>zevoter22</Username><Timestamp>1352680084823</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-11 19:28:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>FO SW don't go picking on little z with a mimic of my ID.
