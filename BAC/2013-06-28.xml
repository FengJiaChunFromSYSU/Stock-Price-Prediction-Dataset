"I don't want to be too cute about a serious matter, but to make an analogy, it seems to me [Bernanke] said we'll use the patch, and use it flexibly, and some in the markets reacted as if he said 'cold turkey'," Lockhart said in a speech to the Kiwanis Club in Marietta, Ga. Lockhart said he would be watching to see if there were any negative spillovers from the back up in long-term rates and the drop in equity prices into the real economy. Lockhart is not a voting member of the Fed's policy-setting committee this year but his views are seen as often close to the committee's consensus. Lockhart said he expects growth and inflation to pick up and unemployment to decline steadily, at a modest pace. If the economy evolves in this way, "I think the position that the economy does not need quite as much stimulus is fully supportable," he said. Bernanke said. "We could in the next few meetings take a step down in our pace of purchases." What does he think the market misheard?</Msg><Username>buffetmunger</Username><Timestamp>1372398919823</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-28 01:55:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372399020643-5</Id><Topic><Title>Fed's Lockhart says markets misheard Bernanke</Title><Username>buffetmunger</Username><Timestamp>1372398919823</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-28 01:55:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The corner these people are painting themselves into with all this backpedalling is that they cannot reduce the Fed purchases or even discuss it in the meeting minutes or the markets willl tank.

BAC won't be in the free and clear for some time yet.</Msg><Username>tigger.redux</Username><Timestamp>1372420131322</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-28 07:48:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372421027624-35</Id><Topic><Title>Fiscal meth addicts can't quit injecting liquid stimulus</Title><Username>longon2007</Username><Timestamp>1372415107242</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-28 06:25:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>hey zevoter....just because you are a broke loser doesn't mean the rest of are....stop your dribble and change your diaper!</Msg><Username>moron_alarm</Username><Timestamp>1372421027624</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-28 08:03:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372421383336-36</Id><Topic><Title>another good day for bac today, but the real change will be next week</Title><Username>stevens1958</Username><Timestamp>1372417947972</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-28 07:12:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>People like to sue banks that is natural,because people think banks are rich,banks have a lot of money.

A perfect example of this tenet is a new line of online products called Cash Management Essentials, something the bank developed by using direct feedback from the very customers it is now serving. Reaching out to small businesses While the retail side of the bank has a plethora of customer-service issues, the commercial side is the exact opposite. In fact, Bank of America Merrill Lynch was recently cited by J.D. Power for superior client service. So, when its clients said they wanted a suite of products tailored to their special needs, BAML listened. The result is a solution much like that of larger companies, but with the smaller business in mind. The beauty of this subscription-based offering is that it will make current customers happy by giving them the services they asked for -- as well as the tools they need to personalize the experience -- and it also has potential as an enticement to bring new customers on board.</Msg><Username>cchaker</Username><Timestamp>1372430768749</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-28 10:46:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372431003302-82</Id><Topic><Title>Just found out that President Obama will be elected to the Presidential Hall of Fame in Orlando!</Title><Username>sheilatastie</Username><Timestamp>1372430434707</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-28 10:40:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes I've been there.

According to the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan’s final reading, consumer sentiment in June came in at 84.1, a slight decrease from 84.5 in May. Last month’s reading was the best level for the index since July 2007. Although the index declined from the prior month, the final June reading was higher than the preliminary reading of 82.7. Economists polled by Reuters expected a final June reading of only 82.8. During the last recession, the index averaged slightly above 64. In the five years before the financial crisis, it averaged almost 90. Consumer sentiment is one of the most popular measures of how Americans rate financial conditions and attitudes about the economy. The University of Michigan’s Consumer Survey Center questions 500 households each month for the index.</Msg><Username>cchaker</Username><Timestamp>1372431367746</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-28 10:56:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372431510773-87</Id><Topic><Title>another good day for bac today, but the real change will be next week</Title><Username>stevens1958</Username><Timestamp>1372417947972</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-28 07:12:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Bought a 100 12.50 07/05/2012 Calls in my SEP for .44.

The insurer may have interpreted the recommendation to the parties by Judge Kapnick as a heads-up to the objectors that private negotiations might be the best way for them to resolve the matter -- and secure a higher payout, since she would rule only to approve or disapprove the settlement.

Tableau Software (DATA) had its IPO last month at $31, raising $254.2mm, and is now $56.41 up 82% from its IPO! DATA has a market cap of $3.24 billion with revenues of only $143mm! Splunk (SPLK) is now $47 up 176% from its IPO last year at $17! SPLK has a market cap of $4.88 billion with revenues of only $219mm! CCUR has the leading Big Data Analytics solution for pay-TV operators, with CCUR's Big Data techology already processing 15 billion media transactions for clients like Time Warner Cable (TWC), Cox, Charter, and Rogers. CCUR has the largest Big Data market share in the cable TV industry - currently tracking the viewing behavior across all screens and platforms of 35 million pay-TV subscribers! Shockingly, while DATA and SPLK are both trading for 22X sales despite having negative EPS - CCUR has positive, rapidly growing EPS - with revenues of $63.23mm - yet CCUR's enterprise value at $7.57 is only $43.9m or 0.69X sales! CCUR is also trading with an enterprise value of only 6X operating cash flow vs. DATA and SPLK having enterprise values of 224X and 77X operating cash flow, respectively! If CCUR had an enterprise value of just 2X sales and 18X operating cash flow, it would be $17 per share, up 125% from its current price of $7.57! A major article was recently published "How Big Data Keeps Cable TV Watchers Hooked" and it talks a lot about Time Warner Cable (TWC) and how they are using Big Data Analytics to determine the course of both their marketing efforts and their network infrastructure. TWC is using CCUR's Big Data Analytics solutions and almost nobody on Wall Street is aware of this yet!</Msg><Username>goodwe212</Username><Timestamp>1372442657475</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-28 14:04:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372443023893-130</Id><Title>Why is it...?</Title><Msg>when I see the Dow half it losses I never see BofA half its losses?

As a result, Wall Street is engaged in spirited debate about when the Fed will begin bringing the current era of permanent quantitative easing to an end (forgetting for now that both markets have shown their deep dependence on QE). Most agree that the QE will eventually create an economy able to stand on its own, but there is disagreement on how long it will take. The "bullish" end of the spectrum is predicting that the Fed may begin to take its foot off the accelerator by the fourth quarter of this year. The "bears" feel that sluggish data will compel the Fed to keep pouring the money on throughout 2014. They don't understand that QE is the economy, and that any attempt to exit will be met by difficulty. The rising home prices and stock gains over the last few years are likely to vanish if the punch bowl is removed." - an excerpt from the The Global Economic Realignment</Msg><Username>jam9011</Username><Timestamp>1372452446260</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-28 16:47:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372454278698-158</Id><Title>Obama to send 400 U.S. troops to Egypt to help control riots</Title><Msg>So now he's providing U.S. support for Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood president!

You can pick any one of his or Michelle's from the multitude and you will easily exceed all 8 years of Bush. And by the way, EVERY DAY is a vacation day for Obama. He hasn't done a lick of work (except maybe on Buddy) since he arrived. Bush did more work on the toilet than Obama does in a month. Fact. Obama is just campaigning, always campaigning, and the losers eat it up like it's all real. Back to the point, next time don't bury the lede. That's what you did this time. It just makes you a cowardly liar. And nobody likes a cowardly liar. You probably already know that. Obama's expenses on vacation have and will exceed those of all previous presidents combined, and very likely those of the few we will have in the increasingly destitute limited time this country has left as a result of his failures of policy and moral compass.</Msg><Username>anotherobamafailure</Username><Timestamp>1372466971980</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-28 20:49:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372466974257-180</Id><Topic><Title>jugears obama tells keynans he is in favor of voter ID</Title><Username>zevoter01</Username><Timestamp>1372431149978</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-28 10:52:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Where is the msm report on his comments?

You believe in nothing and know nothing, yet you seem to have an answer for everything. Unfortunately, your answers all end in the same epic fail. I'm trying to show you the same respect obama showed the SCOTUS during the SOTU after the CU ruling on that night when he went off script to chide people who were far superior to him in every respect. He's as illegitimate as they come, both literally and politically.

So who's got it overflowing, mister pottypants? No reason to shoot him? LOL. You are being incredibly obtuse and ignoring real fact entrees in favor of propaganda buffets. Sanford is a high crime town, hence the gated community. There were 402 police calls in the Retreat at Twin Lakes during 12 months preceding the shooting - the gated neighborhood had 260 townhomes, but many went into foreclosure (thanks chris &amp; barney) and many were rented to people the gates were supposed to keep out. At the time of the (justified) shooting, if you lived in that neighborhood you had a 7% chance of being a victim of a burglary, theft, or shooting. GZ was part of the solution. He identified thieves who were later charged with B&amp;E and theft (they had the goods in their possession), and their description matched the description he gave cops when he suspected the crime was about to be committed. If he was a profiler, he was pretty good at it. And the gun was advised by the cops as defense against a loose pit bull that had cornered his wife. The police told him that pepper spray didn't work against pit bulls. These are all facts. There's nothing to dispute in anything I've said. You may be a coward and unwilling to face facts, preferring the narrative that boils your blood with the iniquity of the world as it relates to poor losers. But facts they are, and facts they will remain. GZ is a guy trying to help his neighbors from becoming victims of rampant home invasions. If I had a son, he would probably look like GZ. This is the official position of Obamas Prompter.</Msg><Username>obamas_prompter</Username><Timestamp>1372478343909</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-28 23:59:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
