The problem is that they relied heavily on strategy and marketing and got used to winning elections by tricks. Over time, the GOP was spoiled by winning through clever gimmicks using psychology while not winning the minorities. The IT revolution did not help. Now demographics are against them as in another few decades, white/caucasians and the Anglo/Saxons all will become a minority. Unless they change, the future of the Republican party indeed looks bleak. However, not to worry, as change comes will come... even though humans keep fighting against it. Change or die is a Universal Law and the truth.</Msg><Username>giovannijay</Username><Timestamp>1351569606620</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 00:00:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351571163099-2</Id><Topic><Title>hurricane oboma</Title><Username>sammywong65</Username><Timestamp>1351513594305</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-29 08:26:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So shmart you are.

Director Joel Gilbert says unknown parties appear to have illegally acquired “private company bank information” and supplied it to journalist Seth Rosenfeld, who in turn has been using the information to ply answers from customers who purchased large quantities of his DVD, as well as a limited partner. “The only way our banking information could have been obtained would have been through illegal hacking into our private company bank accounts,” Gilbert claimed in a statement. “The information was not public.” Rosenfeld is a former reporter with the San Francisco Chronicle and is listed as a correspondent with the Center for Investigative Reporting, an organization funded in part by left-wing activist and billionaire George Soros. Gilbert asserts that Rosenfeld is using information from his bank’s online servers that can only be accessed with a confidential user ID and password. “Rosenfeld called me and referred to bank deposit amounts that he purported to be bank wire transfers received in my company bank account, and asked what they were used for,” Gilbert asserts. “I was so shocked that he claimed to have confidential bank information, I told him to send an email and hung up, but no email was received.” Gilbert claims Rosenfeld also called a company limited partner on a private number and fraudulently introduced himself as being with the Romney campaign. “When the partner said he wasn’t interested in discussing anything, Rosenfeld admitted to being a reporter and began citing the partner’s confidential bank wiring history,” Gilbert says. “The partner hung up.”</Msg><Username>obamistan</Username><Timestamp>1351573791300</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 01:09:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351575063018-5</Id><Title>Hey, remember up to Sep. 2008 when the market was falling 800 points per second?</Title><Msg>Truth is whether you like it or not is that Barack Obama who save your butts and 2 more seconds of the Republicans would have gotten the market to -1600 points.</Msg><Username>reggie.thoma</Username><Timestamp>1351575063018</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 01:31:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351577450941-6</Id><Title>President Barack Obama said in an interview that if the investigation into the Sept. 11 attack on the American compound</Title><Msg>in Libya finds that "there was a big breakdown, and somebody didn't do their job, they'll be held accountable."

'Tourists' were all over. Asian markets did not agree it was even legitimate. Even European crooks do not agree. In past 10 days, after the last debate, republican media has been trying hard to create global market tank. Yes. Dow lost 500 points. But, no participating overseas markets. Republicans know they had to pull Dow under 13K to initiate a 'misery economy" to win. This Sandy storm was thought to be a last straw for republicans. Mother nature is not supporting these evil force of republicans. Nice try. No disaster.

Even though I'm healing faster than Dr. Nick predicted, (and you know what an optimist he is) I believe those traumatic events grant me license to a little, shall we say, erratic behavior (though apparently not to stunt flying or crop dusting...the FAA has been as heavy-handed about that as Flo has been about my repeated efforts to contact her). Anyway, friends don't rub it in to friends when they're grounded, do they......? Wait.....what am I saying, of COURSE they do! Man, you're right, maybe I'm a little off my "A" game right now, but I must still be a real pilot, because real pilots don't take grounding well, and I certainly haven't. Hey, when you're used to having a phalanx of photon weapons at your disposal, tying tin cans to ball-smugglers DOES seem kinda lame. I remember all too well what it feels like to pilot a real starship, the problem is that real starships have gotten harder to find than staggerwing parts.

C. – The Obama Administration has asked the city of Dover, Delaware to erect a sign honoring hundreds of truck crash victims -- who were fish. About 1,600 pounds of saltwater bass died on Oct. 11 when a container truck hauling them to market got into a three-way crash. The Obama Administration seeking last minute votes from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, wrote the head of street maintenance requesting a sign at the intersection to honor the fish. United Nations Am{bass}ador Susan Rice’s letter notes that while roadside memorials traditionally honor human beings, she hopes an exception will be made to remind drivers that all animals -- in her words -- "value their lives and feel pain." She blamed the three way truck crash on a Muslim video all three truck drivers were watching on their mobile devices.</Msg><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1351633180957</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 17:39:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351634123998-163</Id><Title>How Many Times Were The Women On Fox Raped, Or Were They Willing Participants ??</Title><Msg>We should have to right to ask those questions, How many men have each of them slept with?

He also is apparently very different than the Karl Rove/Mitch McConnell GOP anti-American OBSTRUCTIONISM. He said any time he sees such a life threatening situation as they faced, politics has no place and he profusely thanked the President.

You are a black belt pathological liar Mitt Romney.</Msg><Username>reggie.thoma</Username><Timestamp>1351644409628</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 20:46:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351644824985-184</Id><Topic><Title>Gov Christi is loven socialism now !</Title><Username>sirifuture</Username><Timestamp>1351631748433</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 17:15:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Must be a trend .......... too bad the Radical RoBUTTS do not have the ability to define socialism, they just follow orders .............guess they forgit this is not a good defense when on trial</Msg><Username>carolyne47</Username><Timestamp>1351644824985</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 20:53:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351644969117-185</Id><Topic><Title>farawaylife IS A LIAR AND A WELFARE CHEAT</Title><Username>dumpobamie</Username><Timestamp>1351639892546</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 19:31:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If they had any common sense and decency they would.</Msg><Username>mrstan4089</Username><Timestamp>1351644969117</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 20:56:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351645055280-186</Id><Topic><Title>despite obama's blathering, Fiat has confirmed they are moving Jeep to China</Title><Username>zevoter22</Username><Timestamp>1351634172966</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 17:56:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Jeep, the all American vehicle, moving to China.

Sort of. Though official campaign efforts for both Barack Obama and Mitt Romney were on hold because of the disaster that affected nearly 20 percent of nation’s population, the presidential rivals behaved in very different ways. Obama acted presidential, visiting the American Red Cross Headquarters in Washington. “During the darkness of the storm I think we saw what is brightest about America,” Obama said at Red Cross headquarters. The president drew praise from area governors and mayors, including Romney surrogate and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie who thanked the president for helping coordinate relief efforts with the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Obama put his campaign efforts on hold yesterday, skipping a stop in Ohio, and Romney followed suite by clearing his campaign schedule as well. But the Republican nominee, during an impromptu storm-relief event in Ohio was dogged by his past support for de-funding FEMA. During one of the Republican primary debates in 2011, Romney said he would favor cutting federal funding for FEMA and instead have individual states handle emergency relief. Thus far he has not made a comment on this issue following Hurricane Sandy. Romney spokeswoman Amanda Henneberg said: ‘‘A Romney-Ryan administration will always ensure that disaster funding is there for those in need. Period,” according to the Associated Press. While Romney was playing political defense, Obama was the model of bipartisanship. He complemented local officials of both parties, saying without the steps taken by state and local officials, the death toll could have been much higher. He also went on to praise first responders and promised “no bureaucracy, no red tape” by the federal government in responding to this disaster. “The most important message I have for (those affected by the storm) is: American is with you,” he said. “We will stand behind you and do everything we can to get you back on your feet.” Though he might be at a disadvantage without the stage of the presidency, Romney is doing his best to look presidential, helping organize a relief effort in Ohio — one of the most sought-after swing states for next week’s election. At the rally-turned-relief-effort Romney addressed the crowd of several hundred people, asking for their support. ‘‘We have heavy hearts as you know with all the suffering going on in a major part of our country — a lot of people hurting this morning,’’ he said, according to the Associated Press. ‘‘We’re looking for all the help we can get for all the families that need.’’ While this disaster, which has caused more than 25 confirmed deaths thus far, also could prove to be treacherous for the candidates who could run the risk of politicizing the incident. Obama got out ahead of the issue yesterday when he said the election was the last thing he was concerned about, but that doesn’t mean his campaign team has totally shut down. This morning, the Obama campaign sent out an email requesting donations — but unlike most of the emails this election season, this request was to give money to the American Red Cross. “This is a serious storm, but we are going to do what it takes to keep people safe and secure, and make sure the communities affected get the assistance they need,” Obama said, via the email. “FEMA is working with state and local governments to respond effectively. We all owe a debt of thanks to the first responders who will be dealing with the immediate impact of the storm.”</Msg><Username>giovannijay</Username><Timestamp>1351651512947</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 22:45:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351651991300-208</Id><Title>Moody's Ready to "DOWNGRADE" Canadian BANKS!!!!!!!!!</Title><Msg>BANKING Crisis II "IS" Coming At you Goldilocks Types!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

R.R. The Final Days, the Biggest Issue, and the Clearest Choice As we go into the final days of a dismal presidential campaign where too many issues have been fudged or eluded — and the media only want to talk about is who’s up and who’s down — the biggest issue on which the candidates have given us the clearest choice is whether the rich should pay more in taxes. President Obama says emphatically yes. He proposes ending the Bush tax cut for people earning more than $250,000 a year, and requiring those with high incomes to pay in taxes at least 30 percent of any income over $1 million (the so-called “Buffett Rule”). Mitt Romney says emphatically no. He proposes cutting tax rates by 20 percent, which would reduce taxes on the rich far more than anyone else. He also wants to extend the Bush tax cut for the wealthy, and reduce or eliminate taxes on dividends and capital gains. Romney says he’ll close loopholes and eliminate deductions used by the rich so that their share of total taxes remains the same as it is now, although he refuses to specify what loopholes or deductions. But even if we take him at his word, under no circumstances would he increase the amount of taxes they pay. Obama is right. America faces a huge budget deficit. And just about everyone who’s looked at how to reduce it — the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, the bi-partisan Simpson-Bowles Commission, and almost all independent economists and analysts — have come up with some combination of spending cuts and tax increases that raise revenue. NationofChange is a 501(c)3 nonprofit funded directly by our readers. Please make a small donation to support our work. Just last Thursday, executives of more than eighty large American corporations called for tax reform that “raises revenues and reduces the deficit.” The practical question is who pays for those additional revenues. If Romney’s view prevails and the rich don’t pay more, everyone else has to. That’s nonsensical. The rich are far richer than they used to be, while most of the rest of us are poorer. The latest data show the top 1 percent garnering 93 percent of all the gains from the recovery so far. But median family income is 8 percent lower than it was in 2000, adjusted for inflation. The gap has been widening for three decades. Since 1980 the top 1 percent has doubled its share of the nation’s total income — from 10 percent to 20 percent. The share of the top one-tenth of 1 percent has tripled. The share of the top-most one-one hundredth of 1 percent — 16,000 families — has quadrupled. The richest 400 Americans now have more wealth than the bottom 150 million of us put together. Meanwhile, the tax rates paid by the wealthy have dropped precipitously. Before 1981 the top marginal tax rate was never lower than 70 percent. Under President Dwight Eisenhower it was 93 percent. Even after taking all the deductions and tax credits available to them, the rich paid around 54 percent. The top tax rate is now only 35 percent and the tax on capital gains (increases in the value of investments) is only 15 percent. Since so much of what they earn is from capital gains, many of the super-rich, like Mitt Romney himself, pay 14 percent or less. That’s a lower tax rate than many middle-class Americans pay. In fact, if you add up all the taxes paid — not just on income and capital gains but also payroll taxes (which don’t apply to income above incomes of $110,100), and sales taxes — most of us are paying a higher percent of our income in taxes than are those at the top. So how can anyone argue against raising taxes on the rich? Easy. They say it will slow the economy because the rich are “job creators.” In the immortal words of Joe Biden, that’s malarky. The economy did just fine during the three decades after World War II, when the top tax rate never fell below 70 percent. Average yearly economic growth was higher in those years than it’s been since, when taxes on the rich have been far lower. Bill Clinton raised taxes on the rich and the economy did wonderfully well. George W. Bush cut them and the economy slowed. The real job creators are America’s vast middle class, whose spending encourages businesses to expand and hire — and whose lack of spending has the opposite effect. That’s why the recovery has been painfully slow. So much income and wealth have gone to the top that the vast majority of Americans in the middle don’t have the purchasing power to get the economy moving again. The rich save most of what they earn, and their savings go anywhere around the world where they can get the highest return. It would be insane to compound the damage by raising taxes on the middle class and not on the rich. Logic, fairness, and common sense dictate that the rich pay more in taxes. It’s the key to avoiding January’s fiscal cliff and coming up with a “grand bargain” on taming the budget deficit. And it’s central to getting the economy back on track. " Note: Obama will win this election with a landslide. The choices couldn't be any clearer than in this election. Most decent Americans know about it.</Msg><Username>giovannijay</Username><Timestamp>1351654714321</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 23:38:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351654723566-215</Id><Topic><Title>Gov Christi is loven socialism now !</Title><Username>sirifuture</Username><Timestamp>1351631748433</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 17:15:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Get the fack outta here....what kind of lame claim is that.

PETERS AND JIM RUTENBERG Chrysler’s chief executive on Tuesday strongly refuted claims that production of Jeeps would shift to China, an insistence that cast further doubt on the Romney campaign’s recent efforts to undercut President Obama’s support for the auto industry as it fights for Ohio’s 18 electoral votes. In an e-mail to employees, the chief executive, Sergio Marchionne, said that Jeep’s commitment to the United States was unequivocal. “I feel obliged to unambiguously restate our position: Jeep production will not be moved from the United States to China,” he wrote. “It is inaccurate to suggest anything different.” Mr. Marchionne’s response — an unusually forceful gesture from the chief executive of a major American corporation a week before Election Day — came as the politics of the auto bailout took center stage in the presidential campaign. The Romney campaign has come under considerable criticism in recent days for taking liberties with the facts in a new television commercial that suggests Jeep, a recipient of federal bailout money, will soon outsource American jobs to China. Chrysler, Jeep’s parent company, does not in fact have plans to cut its American work force but is considering opening a facility in China where it would produce Jeeps for sale locally. Mr. Marchionne said that those efforts would only bolster the strength of Chrysler in the United States, not undermine it. “Jeep is one of our truly global brands with uniquely American roots. This will never change,” he said.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1351655493462</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 23:51:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351655979989-220</Id><Topic><Title>.★★★★★ Six days until the Re-Election of President Obama ★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★</Title><Username>ebonics4gfy</Username><Timestamp>1351655379030</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 23:49:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I will be there in the party and celebrating more than in 2008!
