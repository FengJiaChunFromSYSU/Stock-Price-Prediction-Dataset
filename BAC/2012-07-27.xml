Are you nuts??? Losing a customer who does not pay their bills is a GOOD thing! 100 million US households have a BAC account. Loss of a fraction of a percent of customers is a drop in the bucket, and actually benefits BAC for loss of deadbeat accounts. BAD for the credit unions who are now experiencing increased collection problems from the deadbeats who left major banks. My guess is those who left did so not for reasons you imply, but because credit unions have lower lending standards. That will come back to bite credit unions.

It is an increase in foreclosure processing. Vast majority of those properties have been in trouble for some time and have already been accounted for as deadbeats by the banks. They are just working off backlog... which is good actually. Sales are picking up and supply has shrunk in many markets. Good think that more of the existing foreclosures are being processed to bring more properties to market. Good to work off the backlog so that when it is all worked off, prices will more up.

This statement is not hyperbole. If Barack Obama is re-elected the United States will never be the same, nor will it be able to re-capture its once lofty status as the most dominant nation in the history of mankind. The overwhelming majority of Americans do not understand that Obama's first term was dedicated to putting in place executive power to enable him and the administration to fulfill the campaign promise of "transforming America " in his second term regardless of which political party controls Congress. That is why his re-election team is virtually ignoring the plight of incumbent or prospective Democratic Party office holders. The most significant accomplishment of Obama's first term is to make Congress irrelevant. Under the myopic and blindly loyal leadership of Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi, the Democrats have succeeded in creating an imperial and, in a second term, a potential dictatorial presidency. During the first two years of the Obama administration when the Democrats overwhelmingly controlled both Houses of Congress and the media was in an Obama worshipping stupor, a myriad of laws were passed and actions taken which transferred virtually unlimited power to the executive branch. The birth of multi-thousand page laws was not an aberration. This tactic was adopted so the bureaucracy controlled by Obama appointees would have sole discretion in interpreting vaguely written laws and enforcing thousands of pages of regulations they and not Congress would subsequently write. For example, in the 2,700 pages of ObamaCare there are more than 2,500 references to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. There are more than 700 instances when he or she is instructed that they "shall" do something and more than 200 times when they "may" take at their sole discretion some form of regulatory action. On 139 occasions, the law mentions that the "Secretary determines." In essence one person, appointed by and reporting to the president, will be in charge of the health care of 310 million Americans once ObamaCare is fully operational in 2014. The same is true in the 2,319 pages of the Dodd-Frank Financial Reform Act which confers nearly unlimited power on various agencies to control by fiat the nation's financial, banking and investment sectors. The bill also creates new agencies, such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, not subject to any oversight by Congress. This over-all-process was repeated numerous times with other legislation all with the intent of granting unfettered power to the executive branch controlled Barack Obama and his radical associates. Additionally, the Obama administration has, through its unilaterally determined rule making and regulatory powers, created laws out of whole cloth. The Environmental Protection Agency on a near daily basis issues new regulations clearly out of their purview in order to modify and change environmental laws previously passed and to impose a radical green agenda never approved by Congress. The same is true of the Energy and Interior Departments among many others. None of these extra-constitutional actions have been challenged by Congress. The left in America knows this usurpation of power is nearly impossible to reverse unless stopped in its early stages. It is clearly the mindset of this administration and its appointees that Congress is merely a nuisance and can be ignored after they were able to take full advantage of the useful idiots in the Democrat controlled House and Senate in 2009-2010 and the Democrat Senate in the current Congress.</Msg><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1343395488672</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 09:24:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343395762712-28</Id><Title>MONEY IS POWER YOU ARE ALL WEAK POOR MEN</Title><Msg>Nobodies</Msg><Username>kelly_tankor81</Username><Timestamp>1343395762712</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 09:29:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343395832732-29</Id><Title>If you like high unemployment and out of control debt and deficits than vote for Obama again</Title><Msg>We know what we get with that turd</Msg><Username>przyblinski</Username><Timestamp>1343395832732</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 09:30:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343396039088-30</Id><Title>stock worth 10 short term by forbes</Title><Msg>40 long term...

Thursday’s market was lifted not by a computer game hero like Super Mario, but a central banking character: Mario Draghi of the ECB. In a similar fashion to the Fed’s central manipulator, Mario Draghi waited until his markets to manipulate were on the precipice. The Euro currency was about to plummet below the 1.2100 handle with any more bad and Euro equities had been crushed lately, especially Spanish stocks. So Super Mario did his best impersonation of Bernanke and claimed “all will be well – trust me.” Of course, we have heard this before – through 19 Summits already – and nothing has come of it. Therefore, you should not expect much this time either. Let the PONZI GAMES CONTINUE; HEY Should this be put into the Olympics?

All the PONZI SMOKE SCREEN IN THE WORLD CAN NOT HIDE IT</Title><Msg>US economic growth slowed to 1.5 pct. annual rate in Q2 as consumer spending weakened TARP Was Even Worse Than You Think While the big banks have paid back their loans, the overall program is now projected to lose somewhere between $32 billion to $70 billion, with $109.1 billion owed as of June 30, according to SIGTARP. Most of those losses are tied to AIG -- Treasury still own 61% of the company -- but more than half of the 325 banks that received TARP aid have missed dividend or interest payments. "The bottom line is [the government] still expects tens of millions of losses on TARP," Barofsky says. "The losses are a lot less than originally anticipated but this resorting to trickery really shows you they're trying to cover up how badly TARP has failed in its other goals of helping homeowners and increasing lending to the economy."

I'm just regular ol' person like yourself. I have no ability to push or pull stock prices. I can only offer opinions like yourself. Most of the time, my opinions have nothing to do with stock price. Most of the time, what I feel the stock price should be at any given time never ends up that way and that's how it is for most of us common folks. That's part of how wallstreet works and most of the reason retail home investors are absent from the market. They and myself alike feel the playing field is not level and more than likely, it never will be. In the meantime, the best we can do is guess and hope for the best because logic isn't high on the totem pole at wallstreet in my opinion. There are far too many macros that dictate stock movement anymore and even those don't seem to apply as they become more closely examined. One minute they mean something, the next they don't. My advice: Get out a dart board and don't pay much credence to message board posters like myself or any others.

Market is almost where it was in April, but BAC is not. Banks need to: 1. Reduce headcount, cut salaries/bonuses for investment banking staff more aggressively. The old business model is not coming back, so why wait for bringing down cost structure - way too slow given the reality. 2. Change the culture - too much manipualtion, insider trading, and fraud. People at banks behave like they can do anything and would not be caught. CEO and unit heads owe it to shareholders to vigorously enforce procedures to prevent illegal activities and excessive risk taking.
