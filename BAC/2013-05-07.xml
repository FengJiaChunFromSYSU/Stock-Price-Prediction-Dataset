Banks make money on your purchases in credit. Cutting your credit means less money coming in to them. 50000+ networth is peanuts. You need to get off the credit cards anyway - this bank is doing you a favor. I have a home worth 6 times your networth and credit cards that function in my favor which is paid off when the bill comes in.

Pelosi also won't allow her to do any debates or interviews. Strange, but not unheard of for secretive Pelosi, who wanted to nationalize 1/6th of the nations economy quietly, telling us that "we have to pass this bill so we can find out what's in it." Of course, a criminal record for a democrat is a resume enhancement, so I'm not sure why Pelosi wants to hide it. I guess she thinks they have to elect her so they can find out what she believes.</Msg><Username>obamalipsync</Username><Timestamp>1367935246796</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 10:00:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367935334344-56</Id><Topic><Title>was bac suppose to get paid by MBIA??</Title><Username>debedus1345</Username><Timestamp>1367934955063</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 09:55:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>well said, they paid half but at the same time MBI dont have much cash to pay BAC just incase of future defaults. bac paying mbi to live another day..what a joke!!</Msg><Username>debedus1345</Username><Timestamp>1367935334344</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 10:02:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367935400380-57</Id><Topic><Title>reverse split</Title><Username>jesusisntcoming</Username><Timestamp>1367931359156</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 08:55:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>BAC wil not reverse split but could spin off Merril Lynch in a year or 2.Buy BAC now and collect big divi in 5years and maybe 2 divis if spin off M.Lynch .</Msg><Username>felizhora99</Username><Timestamp>1367935400380</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 10:03:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367935534513-58</Id><Title>LOAD UP FOR THE DOUBLE!!</Title><Msg>ALL SYSTEMS ARE GO!!</Msg><Username>monett4</Username><Timestamp>1367935534513</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 10:05:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367935559294-59</Id><Topic><Title>BAC upgrade by Morgan</Title><Username>jayarcher9</Username><Timestamp>1367928903114</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 08:15:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Can we firts hold $13?</Msg><Username>inbounds7</Username><Timestamp>1367935559294</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 10:05:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367935560533-60</Id><Topic><Title>LOAD UP FOR THE DOUBLE!!</Title><Username>monett4</Username><Timestamp>1367935534513</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 10:05:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>double?</Msg><Username>tinobor</Username><Timestamp>1367935560533</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 10:06:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367935567122-61</Id><Title>BAC is still so undervalued.</Title><Msg>What an opportunity to buy now and make some serious gains for the rest of this year and into the next couple of years.</Msg><Username>sail651</Username><Timestamp>1367935567122</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 10:06:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367935595931-62</Id><Topic><Title>any longs concerned about</Title><Username>jimtorpet</Username><Timestamp>1367890744639</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 21:39:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>why would 2 people not like my comment?

After all, it has gotten to the point where the buyside bets how long it takes until the latest vintage of said "great" call blows up in his face. These are, after all, "strategic" call, and as everyone knows, when the sellside says one thing strategically, it is time to do the other. However, not even the most jaded and cynical of market observers had any clue just how spectacular Mikkelsen's "tactical" call implosion would be. Apparently, neither did he. And judging by his language, his clients - if there are any left of course - most certainly did not either.

BAC has 10 billion shares outstanding. They were approved for a 5 Billion dollar buyback. If you do the math it will only reduce it approx 350 million shrs. Thats a drop in the bucket. Citi has 3 billion shrs outstanding, They had the 10 to 1 reverse split. If BAC does a 3 for 1 split, the outstanding shrs with a buyback of 5 billion dollars makes an impact on share size. It also reduces the dividend the bank will have to pay per shr. So, I think I favor a 3 for 1 shr reverse split. Its an interesting and good question.

IMO, we should be easily surpassing the range $15-$18.50, which we already saw three years back. Now DOW is 15000+.

The first is you probably saw, I believe on April 1, we actually went ahead and issued the redemption notices for the $5.5 billion of preferreds that are outstanding. Just under $500 million of preferred dividend savings that we’ll have on that. And there was no requirement to issue to replace that, so as you look at that redemption, that’s a good redemption, where you can look at those savings. As it relates to the common, we’d expect to be balanced and work through the share repurchase throughout the year, and really don’t have much more to comment on no.</Msg><Username>gamblin09</Username><Timestamp>1367965147235</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 18:19:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367965243216-190</Id><Topic><Title>Anyone who shorted this puppy deserves what they got.

Worse yet, he lies to this day about it, denying he had a role. Worse yet, Huckabee ignored the desperate pleas of the rape victim, a 17-year-old high school student, and several other women who wrote him to say that Dumond also raped them and should not be released. The victim went to the governor's office, got right in his face, and said "This is how close I was to Wayne Dumond. I will never forget his face. And now I don't want you ever to forget my face." Incredibly, Huckabee was unmoved, and argued that the rapist was innocent, or at least got a "raw deal... He'd been born on the wrong side of the tracks and hadn't been treated all that fairly." He even wrote a letter to the rapist saying "My desire is that you be released from prison. I feel that parole is the best way for our reintroduction to society to take place." Huckabee had a lot of other reasons to keep Dumond in prison, too. Another woman wrote him that Dumond had raped her mother, when she was 3 years old and sleeping in bed with her -- and threatened the mother that he would rape and kill the 3 year old if the mom did not cooperate. A third woman wrote Huckabee that Dumond raped her at knifepoint, and added "I feel that if he is released it is only a matter of time before he commmits another crime and fear that he will not leave a witness to testify against him the next time." One of Huckabee's chief former aides has confirmed that the the then-governor read that letter and spoke with the victim in a follow-up phone call. He also heard about Dumond's alleged role in a murder while serving in the army. So why was he so determined that Dumond be released? How could he ignore all of these heartfelt pleas? Well, a preacher friend of his ministered to Dumond in prison, and believed his claim that he was born-again.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1367969611261</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 19:33:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367969782135-212</Id><Title>Obama ..... we need background checks to stop gun violence</Title><Msg>even though the background information we already had on the Boston bombers did NOTHING to stop them ! ! !</Msg><Username>dump.obamie</Username><Timestamp>1367969782135</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 19:36:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367969821726-213</Id><Title>Obama: "Most of the guns used to commit violence here in Mexico come from the United States"</Title><Msg>Got that right ...... especially the ones from Fast &amp; Furious ! ! !</Msg><Username>dump.obamie</Username><Timestamp>1367969821726</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 19:37:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367969894927-214</Id><Title>SERIOUS DISCUSSION FOR BAC ONLY - NEW LAWSUITS</Title><Msg>Its regarding the new lawsuits from the ny attorney, aig and bank of america cooperation that have been released today.

The headline on the story said “Lawmakers, aides may get Obamacare exemption.” After the story was published, a spokesman for Sen. Harry Reid said there hadn’t been any discussions to exempt Congress from “provisions that apply to any employees of any other public or private employer offering health care.” And Democratic Rep. Henry Waxman of California told Politico that lawmakers and their staffs will indeed get insurance through the exchanges. “[T]he federal government will offer them health insurance coverage that they obtained through the exchanges because we want to get the same health care coverage everybody else has available to them,” he said. We contacted the Office of Personnel Management and received this statement from an administration official: “Members of Congress will not receive anything that is not available to the public. The law doesn’t allow them to get insurance from FEHB, they are going to get insurance on the market place, just like uninsured individuals and small businesses.” We can’t say what did or didn’t happen in any secret meetings. But we can say that no bill has been introduced to exempt members of Congress from the Affordable Care Act — and they were never exempt in the first place. Even if, hypothetically, Congress were to nullify the provision requiring members and their staffs to get insurance on the exchanges, it still wouldn’t amount to an exemption from the law. Lawmakers and staffers would be subject to the mandate to have health insurance or pay a fine, just as everyone else is."</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1367971166137</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 19:59:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367971316594-224</Id><Topic><Title>Tomorrow gap up to $13.50+</Title><Username>dell_stk</Username><Timestamp>1367956680710</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 15:58:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why Friday?</Msg><Username>dell_stk</Username><Timestamp>1367971316594</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 20:01:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367971464847-225</Id><Topic><Title>Tomorrow gap up to $13.50+</Title><Username>dell_stk</Username><Timestamp>1367956680710</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 15:58:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>They gotta fleece a few more long dreamers in and op. exp.</Msg><Username>traderdaver</Username><Timestamp>1367971464847</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 20:04:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367971922276-226</Id><Topic><Title>BAC</Title><Username>penystoc</Username><Timestamp>1367965123697</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 18:18:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I saw many idiots like you on this bored,,,, but you are the number 1 you are the leader:)</Msg><Username>stevens1958</Username><Timestamp>1367971922276</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 20:12:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367971985541-227</Id><Topic><Title>John Bolton: Benghazi could bring down Obama administration</Title><Username>purebred_red</Username><Timestamp>1367965431949</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 18:23:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm so sick of the press covering for this POS president!</Msg><Username>carburetorkid</Username><Timestamp>1367971985541</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 20:13:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367972039874-228</Id><Topic><Title>Fat , Drunk and Republican is no way to go through life , son.</Title><Username>sirifuture</Username><Timestamp>1367779353017</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-05 14:42:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Bump</Msg><Username>sirifuture</Username><Timestamp>1367972039874</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 20:13:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367972053553-229</Id><Title>★★★★HEY BERNANKE..Your "experiment" should have stopped 8 months ago !</Title><Msg>set-up for DISASTER......</Msg><Username>zip_i_t_do_da</Username><Timestamp>1367972053553</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 20:14:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367972203537-230</Id><Topic><Title>John Bolton: Benghazi could bring down Obama administration</Title><Username>purebred_red</Username><Timestamp>1367965431949</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 18:23:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Honestly KNOW that they did this for political reasons.

And he'll cuss you the whole time he's doing it. Like monkeys, they just have to grab every shiny object for their personal stash, which they then steal from each other because they've all disarmed themselves believing that they are invincible and always right. Just stay back, they are emotional train wrecks and will throw themselves off buildings that they have set on fire with molotov cocktails while rioting in their own neighborhoods. This usually happens after all of your money and credit runs out and there are no more shiny objects for them to pilfer from you or from each other. They are characterized by their inability to tell fact from fiction and, on the darker side, by their occasional mental illness-inspired killing rampages in movie theaters, elementary schools, Jewish museums, and political rallies in places like Arizona. Like the boogie man, they live in a fictitious universe and you can simply ignore them when they pretend to act like grownups. The moment passes quickly. In the manner of marsupials, they live in their moms' basements and play video games all day, praying to a non-existent government "angel" to deliver them from their hellish existence, even though they nurtured that existence. Not to worry though, in liberal parlance, Darwin always declutters when a disastrous combination of double helix strands can no longer support its own weight. In the meantime, keep your doors locked and keep a close eye on your stuff. And remember: it's never paranoia when they are really out to get you.

Licensed dealer Mike Detty of Mad Dawg Global informed the ATF of a suspicious gun purchase that took place in February 2006 in Tucson, Arizona. In March he was hired as a confidential informant working with the ATF's Tucson office. With the use of surveillance equipment, ATF agents monitored additional sales by Detty to straw purchasers with assurance from ATF "that Mexican officials would be conducting surveillance or interdictions when guns got to the other side of the border", Detty would sell a total of about 450 guns during the operation. These included AR-15s, semi-automatic AK-pattern rifles, and Colt .38s. The majority of the guns were eventually lost as they moved into Mexico. Under Wide Receiver coordination of ATF Tucson with the ATF Mexico City Office (MCO) and with Mexican law enforcement had been haphazard. ATF field agents and the cooperating gun dealer had been told by ATF supervisors that the guns were being interdicted before they could reach Mexico, but only 64 of the 474 guns had actually been seized. The kingpin sought by walking the guns, Israel Egurrola-Leon, turned out to be the target of a larger drug case Operation Iron River run by OCDETF. After Operation Wide Receiver was ended, several attorneys at the Phoenix USAO who reviewed the Wide Receiver cases for prosecution found the cases had been so poorly managed that they were reluctant to bring any of them to trial. At the time, under the Bush administration Department of Justice (DOJ), no arrests or indictments were made. After President Barack Obama took office in 2009, the DOJ reviewed Wide Receiver and found that guns had been allowed into the hands of suspected gun traffickers. Indictments began in 2010, over three years after Wide Receiver concluded. As of October 4, 2011, nine people had been charged with making false statements in acquisition of firearms and illicit transfers.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1367982354927</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 23:05:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367982834111-270</Id><Topic><Title>Tomorrow gap up to $13.50+</Title><Username>dell_stk</Username><Timestamp>1367956680710</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 15:58:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>next stop 15$!</Msg><Username>lovemayercooch</Username><Timestamp>1367982834111</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 23:13:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367983249919-271</Id><Topic><Title>Tomorrows Opening Predictions</Title><Username>tinobor</Username><Timestamp>1367980210677</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 22:30:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Very.
