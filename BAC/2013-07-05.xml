(NASDAQ: DRAM) separately announced their deal with each other for DRAM to manufacture the new super fast AMD Radeon Gamer Series RG2133 memory modules for the fast growing global gaming business. Additionally, AMD is using DRAM's RAMDisk technology to drive all of its Radeon products. Even without this huge AMD deal, DRAM was on the verge of returning to profitability because of improving fundamentals in the memory industry (DRAM's bread and butter up to now). Since the end of last quarter ended January 31, 2013, memory prices have jumped an additional 50%. Together with improving memory bsuiness and the new AMD windfall which started in May 2013, DRAM is poised to explode because it's current market cap is only $7 million and it's trading below 0.2 X sales compared to a 1.5 sector average. Here are a couple of customer reviews of the DRAM-manufactured RG2133 memory modules (Newegg website): Customer Reviews of the AMD Radeon RG2133 Gamer Series 16GB (4 x 4GB) – Newegg @ $154 A - 5 Star Review Easily overclocked/superfast Pros: fast and reliable top of the line ram. Thinking of getting more for the second PC i'm building. Cons: N/A Other Thoughts: Really fast. A definite increase in browser speed and minuscule fps gain. If you're in the department for some new ram, this AMD ram takes the cake IMO 3 out of 3 people found this review helpful. Did you? B - 5 Star Review Great Memory from AMD Pros: AMP support for AMD systems.Low profile head spreader and legit design, detected running at 30C in my case. Memory testing yields 100% solid performance, no errors in 2133 with advertised timings. Cons: Expensive? You can find significantly cheaper but I'm a sucker for AMD products NOTE... DRAM was $30+ two years ago with less earnings potential and diversification..</Msg><Username>jonny.deener</Username><Timestamp>1373010584083</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-05 03:49:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373010807327-5</Id><Topic><Title>REVIEWS - CUSTOMERS LOVE NEW DRAM-MANUFACTURED AMD RADEON RG2133 GAMER SERIES - DRAM $3.9 WILL BE A $30+ SCOCK SOON - MARK THIS POST</Title><Username>jonny.deener</Username><Timestamp>1373010584083</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-05 03:49:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Another great gaming stock with huge upside is MCZ currently trading at $0.47.

It is estimated that this shadow economy my be as large as $2 trillion, which partly explains why analysts are always underestimating retail strength, etc. And, as the report states, we're not talking about illegal activity such as drug dealing and such. These are jobs that go unnoticed since they aren't recorded. Even the IRS estimates they lose about $500 billion annually in uncollected taxes due to unreported income.</Msg><Username>tigger.redux</Username><Timestamp>1373031066846</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-05 09:31:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373031634931-18</Id><Topic><Title>BAC always lagging...</Title><Username>roccofelardi</Username><Timestamp>1373029742809</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-05 09:09:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

Obama whole heartedly endorsed Morsi's election a year ago, yet failed to recogninze this guy's agenda was the militant Islamist Brotherhood's agenda and his repression of secular/liberal voices started almost imediately after his election in June. In Sept. after further supporting the regime rioters attacked the US embassy in Cairo. In May of this year he ignored Congress' request to put human rights sanctions on the foreign aid bill to Egypt, and by executive order sent Morsi $1.6 billion and that was followed by F-16's, tanks and tear gas canisters. Is it any wonder that a couple days ago the gigantic protest mob carried pics of Obama's mug with a big red X over it? Even now his remarks are tepid, bland and naive.

I thought it was something like that. Representing less than 1/2 of 1% of the world's population they produced over 1/2 the Nobel laureates in Physics and 1/3 of the laureates in medicine. They have benefited mankind enormously. It is your twisted mindset that should have been baked in the ovens instead of 6 milion Jews. PS: on your fatuous rewrite of Russian history, Stalin was baptized into the Russian Orthdox church. His old man was in the clergy. He, like Lenin, followed Marx and becaame an atheist, Bolsheviks were equal opportunity exterminators. The fact that you were Chrstian, Jewish or Muslim was incidental. If you opposed Bolshevism or communism it was either lights out or off to a Gulag during the purges.</Msg><Username>jhitcher2011</Username><Timestamp>1373055796306</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-05 16:23:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373056024197-87</Id><Topic><Title>LOAD UP MORE BAC, PREPARE FOR AFTER SETTLEMENT</Title><Username>albertliu38</Username><Timestamp>1373051642325</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-05 15:14:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes.

Reality: The pounds-per-square-inch figure on the side of the tire is the maximum pressure that the tire can safely hold, not the automaker's recommended pressure, which provides the best balance of braking, handling, gas mileage, and ride comfort. That figure is usually found on a doorjamb sticker, in the glove box, or on the fuel-filler door. If the tire pressure is down 10 psi, our testing has shown that it can make a 1 mpg difference in fuel economy. But far more significant is the impact on handling, braking, and wear--all of which can cost you one way or another.

His $7MM yacht is still moored in RI. It saved him almost $500K in sales tax in MA, and about $70K/yr in MA excise taxes. That's not why he said he put it there, but it's reasonable to a sane human (i.e., not a Demcong loser). Taxes drive away productivity. Everybody except the Demcong seems to know that. But, pretending to be like a representative of the calibre of his mindless minions (aka, useful idiots like you), he said he would voluntarily pay the same taxes that Demcong imaginary self-proclaimed "elitist" hypocrites always demand of others "when he took possession of the boat", but he never paid the bill and the state revenue folks confirmed that right before the election. So yes, please post the link for his paid tax bill. You won't be able to because it doesn't exist. And the $500 tax bill from RI does not count, comrade. Like you, he's just... Another. Obama.

Usually you think of making more while working less is a good thing but with the fixation on job numbers it is hard to tell if qualify of life will go up or down. Most of the growth areas have not traditionally paid a lot and in any case facilitiating consumption requires either related production of redistribution. Home health care- is that really a good thing if it grows? Stability requires some balance, if everyone has to pick weeds just to eat, there will be lots of jobs but you have to quetion if that is a good result and if you can invest in that society or even live in it after what we are all used to.
