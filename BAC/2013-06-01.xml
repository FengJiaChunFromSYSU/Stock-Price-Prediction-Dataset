What is happening is stagnation in the major indices. This happens when the large derivative players are shifting their positions. They are now moving money and are going to bet against both markets. In the past this is when large corrections take place (over 10 percent). The large derivative players are the ones that run the indices. For example look at Warren Buffet; he is a heavy derivative player that has, over the last five years, substantially decreased his position in stocks and gone the derivative route. Smart, rich player. Derivative are an easy way to hide money.......so large losses can be covered up. The SEC does not understand this and they cannot track this. The result is no regulation. It will only take one major, dishonest derivative player to send our financial systems into ruin.</Msg><Username>geraldmcginty</Username><Timestamp>1370077995262</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-01 05:13:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370078032263-9</Id><Topic><Title>Derivatives Shifting</Title><Username>geraldmcginty</Username><Timestamp>1370077995262</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-01 05:13:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Be interesting to see what happens!</Msg><Username>geraldmcginty</Username><Timestamp>1370078032263</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-01 05:13:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370085547849-10</Id><Topic><Title>Here's a Thought.</Title><Username>bondholder44</Username><Timestamp>1370017742474</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-31 12:29:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There was a time when people wanted homes for the tax deduction.

This was sold to make the US more like everyone else, along with some good intentions. While the trumps were demanding tampon praise, the AMA was finding ways to reduce the numbers of doctors. The better way to turn good intentions into good results was send the smartest people in the room to medicine or automation that accomplishes the same results for your fellow humans. Not everyone deals well with blood and patients, not everyone wants to automate, but brat puffing wins the Kyle Dube award for social and economic stabilization. Real estate, like medicine and agriculcutre, is a business that can help a lot of people by rewarding those who can have homes already built in north dakota allowing the part time worker to live in mcmansion as oil exports from the community bring in money. However, everyone chose the tampon praise route. Doctors could become more highly regarded by decreasing their numbers and avoiding automation. You may as well have listened to Kyle Dube for economic advice. ROFLMFO. You will find the zero sum game has no appeal when the production needed to keep it going is demonized to support universal access to tampon praise. all praise the tampons.

McCain calls Tea Party "Whacko Birds"</Title><Msg>From today's Wall Street Journal: A feud between Sen. John McCain (R., Ariz.) and the Senate’s tea-party faction turned bitter and personal Thursday, as Republican divisions over budget strategy erupted on the Senate floor. Mr. McCain, for the third time in as many days, supported Democrats’ effort to open formal negotiations on the annual budget resolution and he criticized fellow Republicans who were trying to block the process. “We’re here to vote, we’re not here to block things,’’ Mr. McCain said, lashing out at GOP Sens. Mike Lee of Utah, Ted Cruz of Texas and other conservatives with close tea party ties who were objecting to the appointment of a House-Senate conference committee to bridge the vast gap between the two chambers’ versions of the budget. Mr. McCain has previously criticized tea party tactics on other issues — including efforts to block votes on cabinet nominations and gun-control legislation. He called them “whacko birds’’ after they filibustered President Barack Obama’s nominee to head the CIA.</Msg><Username>ariad_lnvestor</Username><Timestamp>1370090004950</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-01 08:33:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370090987688-20</Id><Topic><Title>Sen.

Sketching out a three- to five-year investment outlook this week, managers at the $2 trillion fund firm said they believed the European Central Bank was reviewing its Fairy Godmother role in money markets after months of stubborn recession, a switch PIMCO says could herald painful losses for complacent investors. "Investors and financial markets are very confident that the ECB, in extremis, will be the lender of last resort, that they won't let things fall apart. We are less so," Andrew Balls, head of the firm's European portfolio management said. "We think the ECB is likely to swing between periods of 'whatever it takes' activism and periods of refusal to act." Reflecting this caution, PIMCO has steadily reversed small overweight positions on Spanish and Italian government debt in most of its accounts since March. The firm is now broadly underweight on euro zone sovereigns, euro zone credit and the European banking sector and is recommending gradual movement into assets with 'real' returns, including inflation-linked bonds, commodities, real estate and emerging market currencies. While it sees little chance of a big bond market exodus in the near term, PIMCO said this strategic change should help to protect portfolios against the feeble 0.5 percent annual economic growth it expects in the euro zone over the next three to five years. Investors have gorged on euro zone risk assets ever since ECB Chief Mario Draghi made his vow last summer to defend the euro concept.</Msg><Username>buffetmunger</Username><Timestamp>1370114254400</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-01 15:17:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370115726883-68</Id><Title>Obama is selling America to the Chinese!</Title><Msg>The Pacific is gone.

Each asset bubble requires money to go in and temporarily creates jobs and allows people to consume without even attempting to produce. You say ok fine once one pointless fake job decreases in value, go on to the next bubble. Say create a bubble in oil prices, that would raise some asset prices making people feel rich who own oil related stocks. So what? There is still no realization that all transactions have counterparties and you can't get out more than what goes in. Wealth is not created with home prices bubbles any more than with oil, even if it is US oil that just means north dakota gets richers while people in other part of the country have to spend more on gas.

Nevertheless, it should be remembered that 30 of the 50 governorships are in GOP hands and gerrymandering has no impact on these races. Throughout history and particularly recent history (2008 and 2010 especially) there have been significant shifts in the composition of the HOR.

Low- and middle-income Americans may qualify for a tax credit to cover a portion of their premiums. Seventeen states are running their own health insurance exchanges. The federal government has a role in administering the rest, either in partnership with a state or overseeing the task completely. The White House analyzed data from the 19 states where the federal government is administering the health insurance exchange. It also included information from states running their own marketplaces that have made public data on the level of competition that they expect, such as California, Maryland and Washington. Using that information, the White House estimated that “90 percent of target enrollees will have five or more different insurance company choices.” “The marketplace is attracting new insurance choices and increasing competition for consumers, especially in states where it is really needed,” administration officials wrote. The federal government is also in the process of reviewing health insurers’ applications to run multi-state plans that would, in 2014, sell insurance plans in at least 31 states. By 2017, those insurers would need to offer coverage in all 50 states. Whether these new options will drive down premium costs remains to be seen. The White House readily admits that what matters isn’t just how many plans there are in a state, but how effectively they compete with each other to bring down costs and increase quality."</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1370141945544</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-01 22:59:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370142018217-121</Id><Topic><Title>Moonbeam and the Democrats save California</Title><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1369567765970</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-26 07:29:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Public unions are a little out of control, private unions are dead.
