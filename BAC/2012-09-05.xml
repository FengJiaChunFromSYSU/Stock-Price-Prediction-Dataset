The financial downturn has not been kind to mortgage lenders who specialized in loans to high-risk borrowers. Many landed in bankruptcy and have been forced to engineer quick sales of their assets. But ResCap, a unit of auto lender Ally Financial [ALFI 0.00 --- UNCH (0) ], has had a comparatively smooth march through bankruptcy since filing in May. Instead of being forced to hold a fire sale, ResCap has lined up high-profile bidders, including Fortress Investment Group's Nationstar Holdings [NSM 28.76 1.64 (+6.05%) ] and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway [BRK.A 126279.00 -280.8984 (-0.22%) ], for an October 23 auction that could raise the money it needs to repay creditors. The key asset on the block is ResCap's mortgage loan servicing and loan origination business. The sale is expected to raise at least $4 billion, which will then become part of a pool of money used to pay back Ally and other investors, including those who bought mortgage-backed securities (CNBC Explains) tied to ResCap home loans that went bad. The business is seen as attractive as the housing market has slowly started to recover, and few similar businesses are up for sale. Another plus for buyers is the opportunity to buy the business without its accompanying liabilities, thanks to bankruptcy laws that leave those liabilities behind in a trust. "We've been fortunate in that the market is stabilizing and that the private sector views the mortgage origination and servicing business as an attractive business," ResCap Chief Executive Tom Marano said in an interview. "A few years ago we could barely get anybody to show up," he said, referring to the company's previous efforts to sell ResCap. It had also previously considered putting it into bankruptcy. The ultimate decision to file for Chapter 11 came as Ally, the former in-house financing arm for General Motors [GM 21.31 -0.04 (-0.19%) ], sought to sever itself from billions of dollars of ResCap's mortgage liabilities. ResCap's mortgages are sold under the name GMAC, for General Motors Acceptance Corp. The New York-based mortgage lender stayed in business through the housing crisis because it was part of Ally, which was previously known as GMAC Financial Services and offered auto loans and home and commercial mortgages. When Ally received $17 billion in government bailout money, billions went to shoring up mortgage losses. Other subprime lenders, in contrast, did not have financial backing to carry them through the sharp downturn. New Century Financial Corp, for instance, filed for bankruptcy in April 2007, let go 3,200 employees, and stopped issuing new loans. The next month, it shut down its lending operation, laid off another 2,000 people, and sold its remaining servicing business for $188 million. American Home Mortgage Investment Corp, once one of the top 10 U.S. mortgage providers, could not meet lender margin calls and went bankrupt in August 2007. It sold its servicing business for about $500 million and then liquidated.</Msg><Username>low_mac</Username><Timestamp>1346849279697</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 08:47:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346849347270-35</Id><Title>4Yrs is Enough Already Obama Needs to Go.

"There has been no shortage of oil in the market. Producers have been able to meet consumer needs," Abdullah al-Badri told an energy conference. "We also see this as being the case for the rest of 2012 and the foreseeable future." Oil prices surged in March to $128 a barrel, the highest level since 2008, because of concern about possible supply shortages. Prices have since fallen back and brent crude was trading around $118 on Thursday. "Today the price continues to be driven by excessive speculation," Badri said. OPEC at a meeting in December set a target to produce 30 million barrels per day, settling an argument which broke out in 2011 after Iran and other members opposed a Saudi-led plan to raise OPEC's production ceiling. Output has remained above the target all year as Libyan supply recovered after being virtually shut down during the 2011 uprising against Muammar Gaddafi's rule. The extra oil is filling gaps caused by an unusually large number of supply outages globally, which have also helped support prices. Supply breaks were running at nearly 1.3 million bpd as of early April. The additional supply has also offset a decline in exports from Iran, which is facing stiffening western sanctions over its disputed nuclear energy program. Iranian oil exports were running at between 200,000 and 300,000 barrels per day below last year's level, Maria van der Hoeven, head of the International Energy Agency, told Thursday's conference. Iranian officials have said the country exported an average of 2.2 million barrels a day last year. July supply from the 12-member Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ran at 31.75 million barrels per day (bpd), the high est since September 2008, which was shortly before it agreed to a series of supply curbs to combat recession and collapsing demand, based on Reuters surveys</Msg><Username>fairvalue23</Username><Timestamp>1346854835208</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 10:20:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346854848114-58</Id><Title>46 million on food stamps people</Title><Msg>He's a Welfare president and wifey said he's living the American dream.

The average price for gasoline in the U.S.A would drop to $2.80 per gallon. Naimi Says Brent Oil Should Drop to $80.00 as Supply Tops Demand By Ben Sharples - June 03, 2012 Crude prices should fall because global supply is outweighing demand, according to Saudi Arabia’s oil minister, Ali al-Naimi. “We want a lower price than where it is now,” al-Naimi said in Adelaide today. “We need to get the price to a level of around $80” a barrel for London’s Brent crude, he said. Saudi Arabia is the world’s biggest oil exporter. Brent, a benchmark price for more than half the world’s crude, has dropped 6 percent this month amid concern Europe’s debt crisis will worsen and curb fuel demand. OPEC is working to bring prices down, the group’s Secretary-General, Abdalla el- Badri, said May 3. The producer group, scheduled to meet next month, is pumping 8.3 percent more crude than it considers necessary this quarter, figures from the Vienna-based group show. Brent crude for June settlement dropped 0.8 percent in the week to May 11 to $112.26 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. West Texas Intermediate oil for June delivery slid 2.4 percent to $96.13 a barrel. At $100 a barrel for London’s Brent crude, that equates to around $80.00 a barrel for West Texas Intermediate oil. The average price for gasoline in the U.S.A would drop to $2.80 per gallon. Oil supply outweighs demand by 1.3 million to 1.5 million barrels a day, al-Naimi said today. Saudi Arabia increased output last month to the highest in more than three decades, according to data it provided to OPEC.</Msg><Username>fairvalue23</Username><Timestamp>1346854987123</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 10:23:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346855026773-63</Id><Topic><Title>Oil prices aren't right due to too much oil in the market</Title><Username>fairvalue23</Username><Timestamp>1346854785879</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 10:19:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nationalize the oil.....oil companies are ripping us off.</Msg><Username>acerdaprod</Username><Timestamp>1346855026773</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 10:23:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346855028036-64</Id><Title>Equates to gasoline prices to average about $2.25 per gallon</Title><Msg>Equates to gasoline prices to average about $2.25 per gallon 28-August-12 08:42 am This equates to gasoline prices to average about $2.25 per gallon 28-August-12 This equates to gasoline prices to average about $2.00 per gallon</Msg><Username>fairvalue23</Username><Timestamp>1346855028036</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 10:23:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346855070070-65</Id><Title>Sanford Bernstein Oil Value should be $60.00 to $50.00 a barrel</Title><Msg>Sanford Bernstein Oil Value should be $60.00 to $50.00 a barrel Based on Sanford C.

While all around us we see high unemployment, stagnant job growth, and rising debt, the Convention actually believes that we can be persuaded that things are better than they were four years ago. LOL Lots of luck. The facts of our economy are stubborn things. And the Democrats are doing all they can to distract us from them and entice us to believe in something that is not there. Each speaker came up and stumbled around trying to convince us of the improbable contention on which the convention is based.</Msg><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1346857447611</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 11:04:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346857637446-73</Id><Title>MICHELLE OBAMA, THE MOST SHALLOW FIRST LADY IN MODERN TIMES</Title><Msg>Kick her and her husband, A COMPLETE FRAUD out of the White House in Nov.</Msg><Username>valueplay_2000</Username><Timestamp>1346857637446</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 11:07:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346858084160-74</Id><Topic><Title>MICHELLE OBAMA, THE MOST SHALLOW FIRST LADY IN MODERN TIMES</Title><Username>valueplay_2000</Username><Timestamp>1346857637446</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 11:07:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Queen MOOCHELLE is more interested in her biceps, than in the American people.</Msg><Username>alwaysreadyinnyc</Username><Timestamp>1346858084160</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 11:14:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346858306083-75</Id><Title>Ironic the DNC convention starts and US National Debt JUST BLEW PAST $16 TRILION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</Title><Msg>Past the subject debt limit, THE US JUST FELL OFF THE FISCAL CLIFF!!! usedbtclock.....org USOFBANKRUPT_A Don't forget to add the $120.4 TRILLION IN UNFUNDED LIABILITIES!!!!!!!!</Msg><Username>rhinoinchgo</Username><Timestamp>1346858306083</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 11:18:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346858377146-76</Id><Title>Ironic the DNC convention starts and US National Debt JUST BLEW PAST $16 TRILION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</Title><Msg>Past the subject debt limit, THE US JUST FELL OFF THE FISCAL CLIFF!!! usedbtclock(search) USOFBANKRUPT_A Don't forget to add the $120.4 TRILLION IN UNFUNDED LIABILITIES!!!!!!!!</Msg><Username>rhinoinchgo</Username><Timestamp>1346858377146</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 11:19:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346858453937-77</Id><Title>Ironic the DNC starts and US National Debt JUST BLEW PAST $16 TRILLION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</Title><Msg>Past the subject debt limit; THE US JUST FELL OFF THE FISCAL CLIFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!............................

He knows the flushed this country down the toilet with his greed and handed the worst mess since the great depression to Obama, so of course you don't hear one peep out of the fool. Now Republicans want to twist the bend and out right lie about the truth. They would have you return to the good old days of big bucks for the rich and stealing as many pensions as they could get their greedy little hands on. No jobs bill can get past the House Republicans, they are sabotaging everything that would help this country and then blaming it on Obama. Vote out every Republican you see and then you will see real progress in this nation. A vote any other way is a vote of the 1%. Ask any Republicans about taxes on the rich, you will see nothing but their back ends running away as fast as they can go. Vote all of them out ASAP!

Look up PPACA section 1411 Though it states certain income criteria are involved, it has some grey areas, as in: the tax "may" or "may not" be imposed.

FB is still working on their model, but you can rest assured that it will be testing $15 pretty soon and $10 not long after that. I suppose you could look at LNKD with their P/E of 937 and say that's where FB should be. Question is, when will investors get tired of waiting for the revenue at LNKD to grow by 52x its current levels to achieve a sustainable P/E? And when that dream is not achieved, or when selling/admin costs exceed current margins to accomplish that, how will it look when LNKD drops from its sky-high $114/shr to GOOG valuation level, reflecting a price of $2.16/shr? I don't have any position in FB and wouldn't take one. But if I did, it would be for day trading only. The notion that Zuckerman's "promise" not to sell his stock for a year is somehow going to appease the markets is ludicrous. Why didn't he say "I'm NEVER going to sell my stock"? I'd say get in and get out and be happy with what little you can take. Beyond that, take some put positions for '13 and '14 and just wait.

As Heritage has warned before, Obamacare is on track to makes things a lot worse. The President’s health law will be partially paid for by tax increases and the creation of new taxes. When Obamacare first passed, the Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that its tax hikes would total $502 billion over the next 10 years. But most of the new, higher taxes don’t kick in until later in the decade, which means that once all of the law is fully implemented, the taxpayers’ tab will be much bigger than originally estimated. A new study by the Joint Economic Committee (JEC) revealed today that Obamacare will impose higher taxes totaling $4 trillion between now and 2035, with substantial hits on working Americans. That works out to more than $1.7 trillion over a decade—more than triple the original 10-year score. Below is a list of 10 of Obamacare’s most costly taxes and fees, drawn from research by Heritage tax policy expert Curtis Dubay: 1. Hospital Insurance Tax. Beginning in 2013, Obamacare increases the Hospital Insurance (HI) portion of the payroll tax from 2.9 percent to 3.8 percent for families earning more than $250,000 a year and for single filers earning more than $200,000 annually. The increased HI tax is also applied to investment income for the first time. The 3.8 percent surtax on investment income is the most economically damaging tax in Obamacare. And these tax increases won’t remain just on families making more than $250,000 a year for long. As the JEC explains, this tax is not indexed to inflation: “This means that in just 10 years from now, the so-called ‘high-income’ thresholds will have effectively ratcheted down to $152,000 and $190,000 in today’s dollars.” This tax increase amounts to $210 billion between 2013 and 2019. 2. Mandate Penalties. In 2014, Obamacare’s individual and employer mandates go into effect, forcing individuals to purchase coverage and employers to offer coverage to their workers. The penalties paid in association with these mandates are an estimated $65 billion between 2014 and 2019. 3. Health Insurance Provider Fee. Starting in 2014, Obamacare imposes an annual fee on health insurance providers based on each company’s share of the total market. This totals a $60 billion tax hike between 2014 and 2019. 4. “Cadillac” Tax. In 2018, Obamacare puts a new 40 percent excise tax on “Cadillac” health plans, meaning plans that cost more than $10,200 for an individual and $27,500 for families. However, this tax is not indexed to medical inflation, causing it to eventually tax “Honda” plans at this rate as well. The JEC points out that “[t]he bulk of revenues from the ‘Cadillac’ tax would not be paid by platinum health insurance plans, but rather by employees who are forced to exchange tax-free health insurance benefits for taxable wages after employers reduce or eliminate health insurance.” This tax amounts to $32 billion in higher taxes in the first two years of its implementation. 5. Prescription Drug Fees. Since 2011, Obamacare has put an annual fee on manufacturers and importers of branded drugs based on each individual company’s share of the total market. Between 2011 and 2019, this will amount to a $27 billion tax increase. 6. Ethanol Tax. In 2010, Obamacare excluded ethanol from the existing cellulosic biofuel producer tax credit. This will hike taxes $24 billion from 2010–2019. 7. Medical Device Tax. Beginning in 2013, Obamacare imposes a 2.3 percent excise tax on medical device manufacturers. This will raise taxes on patients needing medical devices, who will ultimately pay the tax through higher prices, by $20 billion from 2013 to 2019. 8. Business Regulation Costs. Beginning in 2012, Obamacare raises corporate taxes through stricter enforcement, because businesses will be required to report more information on their business activities. This will raise taxes $17 billion from 2012 to 2019. 9. Reducing Medical Deductions. In 2013, Obamacare raises the floor on itemized medical deductions from 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income to 10 percent, meaning Americans must spend 2.5 percent more of their income before they get a medical deduction, costing $15 billion from 2013 to 2019. 10. FSA Limits. Starting in 2014, Obamacare limits the amount of pre-tax dollars that taxpayers can deposit in flexible savings accounts (FSAs) to $2,500 a year. This results in an extra $13 billion in taxes from 2014 to 2019 v</Msg><Username>lfyoung59</Username><Timestamp>1346872796563</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 15:19:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346872804669-133</Id><Title>Europe's FISCAL CLIFF started 2 year's ago</Title><Msg>Greece has fallen, Ireland, Spain, Italy next; Portugal</Msg><Username>rhinoinchgo</Username><Timestamp>1346872804669</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 15:20:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346873192855-134</Id><Topic><Title>WMD- WEAPONS OF MASS DISTRACTION- TIME TO BUY!!!!!!!!!!!</Title><Username>franklincarter95</Username><Timestamp>1346848486902</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 08:34:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Keep it going!!!!!</Msg><Username>franklincarter95</Username><Timestamp>1346873192855</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 15:26:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346873237113-135</Id><Topic><Title>END OF WORLD????

Per CNBC The United States has slipped further down a global ranking of the world's most competitive economies, according to a World Economic Forum (WEF) survey released on Wednesday. The world's largest economy, which was placed 5th last year, fell two positions to the 7th spot - marking its fourth year of decline. A lack of macroeconomic stability, the business community's continued mistrust of the government and concerns over its fiscal health were some of the reasons for the downgrade, according to the annual survey. "A number of weaknesses are chipping away at its competitiveness...the U.S. fiscal imbalances and continued political deadlock over resolving these challenges," said Jennifer Blanke, Economist at the Geneva-based WEF. Political deadlock over reducing the unsustainable federal government budget deficit - projected to hit $1.1 trillion this year - prompted Standard &amp; Poor's to downgrade the country's credit rating by one notch to AA+ from AAA last August. A mix of U.S. tax hikes and spending cuts - referred to as the "fiscal cliff" - are set to come into force in January unless lawmakers reach a compromise for avoiding them. The survey, which has been conducted annually for over three decades, ranks the competitiveness of 144 countries based on 12 key indicators including infrastructure, macroeconomic environment, labor market efficiency and innovation. Despite declining in the overall ranking, the forum highlighted that the U.S. remains one of the world's top innovators - supported by an "excellent" university system - and continues to offer vast opportunities because of the sheer size of its domestic economy. Switzerland and Singapore retained their positions as the most competitive economies, coming in 1st and 2nd, respectively. Switzerland's top spot was achieved as a result of its strong performance across the board, according to WEF, with notable labor market efficiency, sophistication of its business sector and its innovative capacity. The country has among the highest rates of patents per capita globally. "Switzerland's productivity is further enhanced by a business sector that offers excellent on-the-job-training opportunities and labor markets that balance employee protection with the interests of employers," the report said. China Tops the BRICs Among the large emerging economies, China was ranked highest at 26, thanks to favorable macroeconomic conditions. This was significantly higher than Brazil, India and Russia which came in at 53, 56 and 66, respectively. China runs a moderate budget deficit, boasts a low government debt-to-GDP ratio of 26 percent and its gross savings rate remains above 50 percent of GDP, the forum said. In addition, the rating of its sovereign debt (AA-) is significantly better than that of the other BRICs and of many advanced economies. However, the world's second largest economy has slipped two notches from last year's ranking, owing to a deterioration in the development of its financial markets and technological readiness. "Insufficient domestic and foreign competition is of particular concern, as the various barriers to entry appear to be more prevalent and more important than in previous years," WEF report said.</Msg><Username>rhinoinchgo</Username><Timestamp>1346875604668</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 16:06:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346875663585-145</Id><Topic><Title>END OF WORLD????

Yet you stand on their backs and tout your transparent bull and lies. Take hubby back to the "Windy City" and just blow away into history. " During her speech at the Democratic National Convention Tuesday night, first lady Michelle Obama painted her husband as a president who has created jobs like those held by her father and his grandmother, jobs they used to give their families greater opportunities. “He brought our economy from the brink of collapse to creating jobs again -- jobs you can raise a family on, good jobs right here in the United States of America,” Obama said Tuesday night. The only problem: that’s not exactly true. The unfortunate reality is that most of the jobs created under President Barack Obama’s administration pay low wages. About three-fifths of the jobs created during the economic recovery are low-wage, while most of the jobs lost during the recession paid middle-wages, according to a recent study from the National Employment Law Project. More than 40 percent of the jobs created during the economic recovery have been in low-paying sectors like retail, food and employment services."</Msg><Username>lfyoung59</Username><Timestamp>1346877855982</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 16:44:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346878244517-155</Id><Topic><Title>Buy, buy, buy!</Title><Username>muchomacho42</Username><Timestamp>1346876981159</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 16:29:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Bye, Bye, Bye!

When Obama became a senator in 2005, her 'salary' leapfrogged to $$316,962 for the same job...and one of Senator Obama's first acts in office was to see to it that the hospital received over a million dollars of your tax dollars as an earmark. Well, Michelle has moved on,and guess what...that vital job of hers,worth a salary of over $300 K has been quietly eliminated. It's the Chicago Way, cushy no-show jobs in exchange for political patronage...fist bump. Of course, she had to work twice as hard to get half as far. She said so, so it must be true.

It's quite likely. The market can do anything! The banks are dependent on improvement in the economy and their earnings will improve over that time. In 2 years the economy should be doing better than now. Housing appears to have bottomed and gradually beginning to rise. Demand is increasing and naturally there will be an improvement. I am a swing trader and since the bottom of the current market cycle in March 2009, I bought BAC at about $4 and sold at $9 several months later. Since then I have done the same at least 3 times profitably. I'm out again at this time. Sold on last Friday at $7.98, but will re-enter when price goes down to mid or lower $7. My circumstances and experience have made me choose to swing trade... but I do my own tracking of the larger market and the specific stocks that I buy. This may not be suitable for others. And I also do have stock for LT. Making money in the stock market is no easy task because unless one is intent on learning a lot and is good at managing risk and money with great self-discipline the challenge is just too great for the average person. It's no different than running your own successful business as an owner. It requires not only knowledge, but committment and needed suitable personal traits and attributes.

Did you know that Ann Romney was/is performing services for Bain, oops I guess she forgot to show up for work. What you are accusing Michelle Obama of is chump change next to what Ann Romney is getting for not showing up. Wonder what services Ann is performing for the fund? "In his 2010 tax return, Romney said the Ann Romney blind trust could receive carried-interest profits from a Bain fund based in the Cayman Islands called Bain Capital Partners (AM) X LP. To request the carried-interest tax deduction, which is typically taken by active fund managers, Romney's attorney filed a tax form telling the IRS that Ann's trust was "performing services" for the fund". "Tax experts say Romney can legally share in the carried-interest profits and take the deduction if Bain has agreed to the arrangement. Critics of the carried-interest deduction say this example highlights how the tax break can be abused." "Carried interest was intended to motivate managers going forward," said Victor Fleischer, an expert in carried interest at the University of Colorado law school. "In cases like the Romney’s, it just shows it is really all about fancy tax planning. It's not motivating managers going forward. Not only is Mitt not providing any future services, Ann never did."</Msg><Username>imadtchdgr</Username><Timestamp>1346889226217</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 19:53:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346889344138-187</Id><Title>Mitt Romney is a Nice Man</Title><Msg>It's his business record (other than his being a former governor) is what bothers me.

Her intelligence and common sense at such a young age is truly heartening. I hope their are many of her generation that reflect and share her principles. Their may be hope yet for this great country. Good Job Abby!! In her words: "In between the mirror and the picture of me and my family held up by a pink magnet in my high school locker was a sign that read, "Romney Believe in America." When teachers and students passed my open locker each day, I anticipated that they were thinking something along the lines of: 1. Someone actually supports Mitt Romney?! 2. Republicans exist in New York?! or 3. Someone under the age of 45 isn't voting for Obama?! Okay, maybe I can't vote (I'm only 17), but you get the point. I will admit that at first I was quite skeptical about putting a Romney bumper sticker up in my locker, where people could actually see it, and would make assumptions about me. Being a republican in a very blue state such as New York is strenuous enough, but even more so for a high school student. People my age are, more often than not, liberals. In fact, people my age are expected to be. I officially "came out" as a conservative last year, when Romney won the Republican primary, and I don't regret a thing. Sure, I got the ever-popular "You're a Republican?" question when friends came to my locker, and for the first time in my life, I responded without the least bit of hesitation, "Yes, yes I am." Of course, this meant that I was a ruthless teenager with a tar-black soul; a greedy monster that found pleasure in strapping dogs to the roof of her car. But I know I'm just a girl, although different from most of my peers and teachers in my views. Most of my friends couldn't understand how I could support a man who was pro-traditional marriage and pro-life, but that's not why I like Governor Romney. I'll admit, I consider myself somewhat liberal on social issues, as most young conservatives are becoming today, but I support Romney because I want what's best for my generation, and I refuse to stand by the "cool" candidate. I know my parents can't afford another four years wondering how they're going to send me to college, and I know I can't spend another four years thinking how I'm ever going to get a job after I graduate. We all know, the economy our president inherited wasn't the best, but I want a leader that will stop putting the blame on others, that will stop making promises he can't keep, and start taking responsibility for the unemployment rate that's three percentage points higher than it was supposed to be. I want a president who will spend his time trying to figure out how to get Americans working again rather than spending time trying to figure out how to demonize his opponent. I have full faith in Romney and Ryan, not just because they're not Obama and Biden, but also because I want leaders who can give me the opportunity to build whatever I choose, all on my own. I first discovered these feelings and learned that I was a Republican in the fourth grade, in the midst of the Bush-Kerry election year, when my teacher handed out a quiz to the class that was supposed to tell us which candidate we matched up best with. The quiz was meant to be suitable for the nine-year-old mind, but nonetheless helped me realize that I believe in a strong military, tax cuts, and revealed to me how interested I was in politics, even at the rudimentary level. I matched up with George W. Bush, according to the simple multiple-choice quiz, and I never looked back. I followed every election since 2004, and learned not only about the crazy, egocentric world of politics, but also about myself as a person. I now understand that it doesn't matter if you're a democrat or a G.O.P. freak like myself; we're all Americans, and we're just trying to make our country the best it can be. Sure, our opinions differ about just how to make our country great, but that's not the point. No one deserves to feel like an outsider in their own country, no one needs to feel like they shouldn't think a certain way, and that's why I don't regret admitting to people that I'm conservative. If this country was built on one thing, it's freedom. And this country has given me the freedom to say what I feel, the opportunity to write, and to tell everyone in my school that yes... I'm a Republican! I'm a Reagan lover, independence over dependence, peace through strength, kind of girl, and I'm not scared to say it. So I'll return to school this September as a senior, with a new sign in my locker that reads "Romney-Ryan 2012," and I won't be afraid of what people will think."</Msg><Username>lfyoung59</Username><Timestamp>1346890101877</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 20:08:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346890613821-191</Id><Topic><Title>Any Chance This Will Hit 18 within two years?</Title><Username>intell1sync</Username><Timestamp>1346885555442</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 18:52:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If they can fire all these mess-up people in the REO department or the mortgage department and only keep their retail banking.

A lie str8 out of Hell... Pastor who endorsed Perry on Friday says Romney is a cultist By Chris Moody | Dr. Robert Jeffress, the influential pastor of a Dallas-based megachurch, offered his formal endorsement of Texas Gov. Rick Perry Friday at the Values Voter Summit in Washington, D.C. Friday, shortly before he explained why Perry's opponent atop the GOP field, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, is a cultist. Jeffress introduced Perry before he addressed the annual gathering for social conservatives, making a special point to emphasize Perry's Christian faith--as opposed to Romney's, who a Mormon, which Jeffress said was a "cult." "We understand Mormonism is not Christianity and thus the difference between somebody who's moral and good like Mitt Romney and a true born-again follower of Christ," Jeffress said after Perry's speech, adding that Perry had welcomed his endorsement. "I really think the decision for conservative evangelical Christians right now is going to be, do we prefer somebody who is truly a believer in Jesus Christ, or somebody who is a good moral person but he's a part of a cult." "It's not politically correct to say, but it's true. Mormonism is a cult. And for those reasons, besides Governor Romney's lack of consistency on social issues, I think Rick Perry is the most electable choice among Christian conservatives," he went on. Jeffress' views, however, do not reflect Perry's, his campaign spokesman told The Ticket. "The governor does not believe Mormonism is a cult," Perry Communication Director Mark Miner said in an email. Labeling Mormonism as a cult does not put Jeffress outside of the Southern Baptist mainstream. The denomination officially recognizes Romney's church as a cult, and has done so for years. Jeffress's views also should not come as a surprise to Perry's camp, since the preacher has publicly called Mormonism a cult in the past. "The Southern Baptist Convention has officially labeled Mormonism as a cult, so this is not some right-wing extremist view. It's a view of the largest Protestant denomination in the world," he said. "I think there are a lot of people who will not publicly say that's an issue because they don't want to appear to be bigoted, but for a lot of evangelical Christians, that is a huge issue, even if it's unspoken.</Msg><Username>jbhdallas2000</Username><Timestamp>1346898687735</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 22:31:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346898822176-216</Id><Title>Here come Bill</Title><Msg>BALANCED BUDGET!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</Msg><Username>franklincarter95</Username><Timestamp>1346898822176</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 22:33:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346899808390-217</Id><Topic><Title>MITT BAIN CAPITAL</Title><Username>franklincarter95</Username><Timestamp>1346896624141</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 21:57:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>4 MORE YEAR!!!!

From now on, the polls are going to gradually reflect the gap between Obama and Romney steadily growing to end up in a LANDSLIDE! It will a double victory because with all the power of money and negative saturation of the media with LIES against Obama, Mr. Romney will smilingly accept his defeat.
