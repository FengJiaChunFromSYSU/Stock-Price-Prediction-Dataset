In this age when Islamists have made it a matter of policy to cite any unflattering mention of Islam as an excuse to kill as many non-Muslims as possible, the administration's initial apologies for the alleged insult to Islam delivered by an unknown movie were a de facto invitation to violence. To follow that up, once the murders had begun, by prefacing Hillary Clinton's "strongest possible" objection to the U.S. Embassy attack with yet another apology revealed either a clinical case of battered wife syndrome on a national scale, or something more sinister. President Obama, using almost identical language, said: Since our founding, the United States has been a nation that respects all faiths. We reject all efforts to denigrate the religious beliefs of others, but there is absolutely no justification to [sic] this kind of senseless violence. Romney, who has frustrated conservatives with his recent comments on other issues, finally got one right: the administration's response is indeed "disgraceful."..................

Therefore, prices on most items will rise. Most importantly, prices of BAC will also rise and eventually double in 6 to 12 months! Hence, I find that a very good thing because I will be very rich and care less about looking for a higher paying job. For those who don't have money in the market, they should use their credit cards at 0% APR and buy some BAC before it goes much higher; and not be affordable anymore! Everything will be more expensive in 2013 and those who own BAC now will be more well off then. By then, not only will most of us who own a lot of BAC stock be retired, but be more than able to financially take care of our grand parents and loved ones. In summary, the time to own stocks, especially BAC is now. With that said, don't be caught chasing BAC when it is still not too late.</Msg><Username>fbi4hire</Username><Timestamp>1347706984170</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 07:03:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347707605592-38</Id><Title>Moral Hazard is right out the window..FEDs and any in power administration will do anything to prop up the economy during an election cycle.

They bought houses with no money down and free money for closing costs. In retrospect, they continuously refinanced and bought more houses and fancy cars they knew they could not afford. With that said, the majority of those people were poor from the start because they never had the education in managing their finance nor saved to get rich the way the rich did. QE3 will be last opportunity for everyone learn from history and TO SAVE. It will allow the people with good judgements and financial reponsibility, the opportunity use what they saved to "easingly" open a business and "create jobs". Whether you like to hear it or not, QE3 is the only answer under the current circumstances! Those who worked hard and saved deserve to get richer. And those who who are poor should learn to work hard, save and aim to get rich. If you get back to the basics, it is the traditional way.</Msg><Username>fbi4hire</Username><Timestamp>1347710863940</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 08:07:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347711443946-45</Id><Topic><Title>S*h*i*t* eating right wing stooges on this board won't post anything about Romney because he is more liberal than Obama.</Title><Username>j.farragut</Username><Timestamp>1347675335268</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 22:15:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>most of us - have " afrgut " on ignore its nothing but childish mindless dribble</Msg><Username>da23533</Username><Timestamp>1347711443946</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 08:17:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347711711928-46</Id><Topic><Title>Questions for Options Traders</Title><Username>fbi4hire</Username><Timestamp>1347703704304</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 06:08:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's a gamble.

More like a Texas two-step "two steps forward one step back." This is fine with me. Interestingly enough if you take a look at a 6month daily chart you can see it's running up to a possible double top in the ~$9.75 to ~$10 zone. TA shows it overbought here, hence my Texas two-step commentary. $10 should prove a strong resistance line simply because it's a level above which it has not conclusively been in well over 1 year. In fact, more like over a year and a half (how time flies, eh? Heh!). In any case will domestic and global issues giving the appearance of fading away in the rear-view mirror I'd say over the next year BAC should punch thru that line and head for the mid-teen's. This is so long as there aren't any surprises out of the company or the US/Global economy. I'm looking forward to it for having a big basket of ~$5.60 BAC as well as an equally big basket of C in the $25 area. So I'm set and watching the "movie." ;-) On an unrelated note I have to say I like one aspect of Yahoo's new thread. When you ignore one poster and their initial thread commentary you do not see ANY of the responses that may occur back to them. This is a plus. I went thru this morning and did the usual ignore sweep and, after doing so, found that out of the last 25 (or so) postings only THREE could be deemed on-topic. So it goes. G/L to all with BAC!

You should never put more then 10% of your account in a risk trade like that. Options are buying time and volity when out of the money. We close 9.98 a share that $7,500 went bye bye or a 100% loss in a week. The smart money like the house in vegas sells puts and calls and in small lots. 85 % of puts and calls people lose money on. If you are asking this question here on a yahoo board YOU SHOULD NOT BE DOING A TRADE like that. I rarely go over 40 contacts. My sweet spot is 15-30 days out calls on BAC and not paying more then .15 per contract for slightly out of the money contracts. The run up has been so sharp that you are paying .05 cent that was just .01 maybe two weeks ago. That is up 500% allready.</Msg><Username>tax1099nc</Username><Timestamp>1347721941399</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 11:12:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347721997622-78</Id><Title>Confucius says:</Title><Msg>“The only thing better than one departed Middle Easterner is all departed Middle Easterners”</Msg><Username>speedtheirwaytoheaven</Username><Timestamp>1347721997622</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 11:13:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347722906578-79</Id><Title>Quantitative easing is inflationary, pure and simple!</Title><Msg>TARP may have been necessary because of the mess created on Wall St. but each QE move just adds another inflationary jump in everything I purchase!

If you buy deeper "in the money" calls, although still risky, it wouldn't be nearly as risky as what you're proposing. You could buy 50 contracts of the Sept. $9 calls for about the same price with less risk. Even if it took all next week to get to $10, you still double your money.

If I buy a call option (buy to open going long) for September of 2012 at $10 at $.05. and it does not hit $10 by options expiration date, is my loss not limited to $2,500 plus commission only? Sorry if I misunderstood you, but can you please explain how you came up with a loss of $7,500 if it does not hit my strike price of $10? Are you saying I can only make money if it goes above $10? I though I would make money as the premium goes above my purchased cost ($.05) as the price approaches $10 strike price. Again, thanks everyone for participating and sharing your personal experiences.

When Obama came in, median middle class net worth was down around 40%, job losses were running around 800m/month, major banks and the U.S. auto industry were failing and there was serious talk of another Great Depression. The bleeding was stopped and a lackluster recovery seems to be underway. The stock market has come back, but, as some have pointed out, not enough to give investors the 7% return that was predicted before the crash. Obama has failed to quickly recoup the losses, take away the pain and make it like the fiasco in '07 &amp; '08 never happened.* Considering that failure, it just makes sense to return to sound Republican policies. *Actually, the folks in Tampa seemed to have already forgotten that happened.</Msg><Username>jefatkinson</Username><Timestamp>1347730038921</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 13:27:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347730167696-100</Id><Topic><Title>The thinking man's reasoning for restoring a Republican administration:</Title><Username>jefatkinson</Username><Timestamp>1347730038921</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 13:27:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>LOL!

I prefer puts to shorting a stock. and calls to margin. Now if BAC went to 10.50 and you dont close out your position they will deliver all the shares to you. Expect a call the day prior from your broker asking to either close out the position in the AM or fund the incall positions. puts and calls can wipe you out very fast. Look at the daily range of the 9.00 and 10.00 swings the next week. Some buy and sell options daily. To rich for me. Good luck. I do feel we will top 10.00 before the end of the year. 12.50 this time next year and 15.00 IF THEY RAISE the DIV. There is a wall around 12-15.00 a share until they raise the div.</Msg><Username>tax1099nc</Username><Timestamp>1347731980519</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 13:59:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347732206859-113</Id><Topic><Title>Radical muslims are funded by US taxpayers, thank you Obama</Title><Username>dwacorn</Username><Timestamp>1347710567851</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 08:02:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Osaama Bin Ladin was trained and armed by the Bush family</Msg><Username>buddhazenpeace</Username><Timestamp>1347732206859</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 14:03:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347732284573-114</Id><Title>Osama Bin Ladin was a Bush Family Friend</Title><Msg>It was the Bush family that Trained and armed Bin Ladin....Bush armed afghan and they totally rebuilt IRAQ</Msg><Username>buddhazenpeace</Username><Timestamp>1347732284573</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 14:04:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347732361590-115</Id><Topic><Title>6 murders last night in Chicago so my guess of 8 to 9 looks like it will be too low</Title><Username>zevoter22</Username><Timestamp>1347720844776</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 10:54:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Americans love Killing...they ship Guns everywhere,,,USA is the Merchant of Death</Msg><Username>buddhazenpeace</Username><Timestamp>1347732361590</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 14:06:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347732463993-116</Id><Topic><Title>REPUBLICANS ARE THE TREASON PARTY</Title><Username>farawaylife</Username><Timestamp>1347714336080</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 09:05:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>GW Bush,,,Sara Palin....Romney....Retards,,,,</Msg><Username>buddhazenpeace</Username><Timestamp>1347732463993</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 14:07:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347732566228-117</Id><Topic><Title>Confucius says:</Title><Username>speedtheirwaytoheaven</Username><Timestamp>1347721997622</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 11:13:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You already Killed Jesus.....You Pray for Salvation to a Middle Easterner,,,,after you killed him.</Msg><Username>buddhazenpeace</Username><Timestamp>1347732566228</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 14:09:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347732727447-118</Id><Topic><Title>Questions for Options Traders</Title><Username>fbi4hire</Username><Timestamp>1347703704304</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 06:08:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You are correct, the options price can increase as the stock price increases and you can sell it before the expiration date.

September $9 calls sounds interesting. The premium is currently at $.56. 500 contracts would cost me $28,000 plus commission. If I go with September $10 calls, the premium of $.05 would only cost me $2,500 plus commission. Because I am dealing with really high risks, the 5 to 10 cents( or more, hopefully) upward move is more obtainable (I hope), I can not be wishy-washy and be ready to close my position quickly when the time come. If the premium goes from $.05 to $.10, I would be making $2,500 minus commission. Unless I am not understanding buying a call (buy to open) correctly, the stock does not have to hit $10 strike price for me to make money. I just need the premium to go above my costs ($.05) to make money, right? Again, thank you for very useful information and ideas. Now that I know my maximum loss will not be more than $2,500 plus commission, I will have to think, hopefully get more ideas and make my decision.

But he's not an underdog in the polls. This past week demonstrated what the media is capable of, not from an influence perspective but from a corruption and propaganda perspective. It also showed what they are not capable of -- they are not even a minuscule force in the blogosphere, and that is where more and more people are getting their info -- and the MSM clearly did not influence public opinion despite all their self-congratulatory pats on the back thinking they had saved Obama's worthless hide again. Nobody watches them anymore, so the only thing they are doing is fanning the flames of opposition to their propaganda. And the blogosphere was on fire about the corrupt MSM propaganda machine, about Obama using a communist Chinese apparatus to assault Romney, about the fact that these embassy riots are a direct result of Obama's policies and his weakness, timed to coincide with 9/11. As for polls, most of the pollsters are only fooling themselves. Rasmussen doesn't game the system, which is why his polls are always the most accurate (consistently rated at #1), and he has Romney ahead. The others don't matter, really, because why would you spend even a minute thinking about the results of a pollster who is always way off? Those polls are more propaganda, and they are irrelevant.</Msg><Username>flippant_1</Username><Timestamp>1347737578303</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 15:32:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347737754712-130</Id><Topic><Title>The thinking man's reasoning for restoring a Republican administration:</Title><Username>jefatkinson</Username><Timestamp>1347730038921</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 13:27:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Republicans aren't responsible for the huge crash that occurred on their watch, but the Dems are responsible for preventing a very strong recovery from occurring on theirs?</Msg><Username>jefatkinson</Username><Timestamp>1347737754712</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 15:35:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347737774122-131</Id><Topic><Title>The thinking man's reasoning for restoring a Republican administration:</Title><Username>jefatkinson</Username><Timestamp>1347730038921</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 13:27:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You know, you really come across as a raging idiot.

One brother is poor and lives in Africa. The other is rich and lives in America. One lives in a shanty in a slum in Nairobi on dollars a month. The other lives at the most exclusive address in the world — 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Sound like a fictional Hollywood screenplay, one the Left would eat up? But it gets better. It turns out that the rich American brother made his fortune writing about his own life, and about the father from Kenya he didn’t really know. The poor African brother wrote a book about his own life, too, and about his father he didn’t know. The rich brother is a man the world knows: President Barack Obama. The poor brother is a man the world doesn’t know — George Obama. To make this story even richer, it turns out that the wealthy American brother has not bothered to help his poor African brother. Not a bit. Indeed, President Obama has not even bothered to get to know, let alone help, his struggling brother George. The two met briefly when they were younger, back when Barack Obama was searching for his identity and selling what he discovered to an American publisher. At the National Prayer Breakfast this past February, President Obama gave an eloquent speech explaining why his faith informs his desire to serve the public, and why government should play a role in helping the less fortunate among us. This is what he said in front of some of the nation’s most distinguished religious leaders: “But part of that belief comes from my faith in the idea that I am my brother’s keeper and I am my sister’s keeper; that as a country, we rise and fall together.” I guess he was talking about his metaphorical brother. He certainly wasn’t talking about his real-life half brother, George. So why do we know so little about this brother and President Obama’s refusal to help him? Why hasn’t the media covered the story more fully? Can you imagine what fun they’d be having if the poor, estranged brother was Mitt Romney’s? But much more important than the media’s silence is the question why President Obama hasn’t bothered to help his brother George. Even the president’s harshest critics give him credit for being a solid family man and a great father, husband, and role model to his two beautiful daughters. Why doesn’t he want Malia and Sasha to know their uncle? There are several possible explanations. One possible motivation is sheer shame. It is certainly true that George Obama made some bad decisions in his life, decisions that led him to the life he now leads in the slums of Nairobi. He admits to grave mistakes in his youth, to trouble with gangs and alcohol, and attributes much of it to not having a strong male authority in his life. But isn’t this precisely the kind of person President Obama would want to champion, especially if he is related by blood? There may be, however, a more profound reason we don’t know George. One that has more to do with ideology than with pathology. In his book no one has read, Homeland, George Obama has the temerity to suggest that if Barack Obama had been born and raised in Kenya rather than America, the life he has lived would be much different. Being born in the greatest, richest, freest country — one where free markets prevail — has allowed Barack to exercise his talents and achieve greatness. For his new movie, 2016: Obama’s America, Dinesh D’Souza interviewed George. It was remarkable not for what George said about his brother (he had not a single bad thing to say about him) but about the anti-colonial mindset that drove his father and that animated his brother#$%$ book, Dreams from My Father.</Msg><Username>przyblinski</Username><Timestamp>1347739096853</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 15:58:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347739571595-141</Id><Topic><Title>Osama Bin Ladin was a Bush Family Friend</Title><Username>buddhazenpeace</Username><Timestamp>1347732284573</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 14:04:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Republicans are brain dead</Msg><Username>buddhazenpeace</Username><Timestamp>1347739571595</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 16:06:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347739649181-142</Id><Topic><Title>GW Bush Republicans left USA in CARDIAC ARREST</Title><Username>buddhazenpeace</Username><Timestamp>1347731216035</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 13:46:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Republicans are #$%$ God has not Fixed the Bush Republican Mess</Msg><Username>buddhazenpeace</Username><Timestamp>1347739649181</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 16:07:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347739973650-143</Id><Topic><Title>Romney Gaining.

Everything looks classically good for BA TA-wise, even though I'll allow it's a bit overbought right now as indicated by those same TA metric's. But when juxtaposed against its peer-set BAC seems undervalued and ripe for further upside. One can only hope the market herd comes to feel the same way, eh?

Indeed, that's my thinking as well. It comes to this. The Bond market is saturated. I cannot get excited there. A money market, mutual fund or bank account? Puh (as my Godson would say). I'd sooner keep my money in a mattress for the interest they pay. If the market continues to move northward then there's a lot of money sitting watching from relative safe havens collecting next to nothing that's just bound to be getting....errrr.....twitchy the more it watches. Especially as it watches all those already in the pool having a great party (heh). There comes a breaking point when the long suffering and spooked herd says #$%$ it I'm going IN" and proceeds to jump into the pool. This tends to be the psychology of crowds...the "wait...wait...wait...aaaaargh I'm MISSING OUT, GO!" psychology. I figure if we have another week like the last one then we'll be at that point Meanwhile I'm swimming around in the deep end of the (mostly) empty pool sayin'...."Come on in...the water's FINE!" ;-) 'Course...just to disclose...this sort of reaction (by the crowd) always tends to be irrational to a certain extent....once they're all in splashing around thinking they're having a good time I'll be setting up my exits.....this is MY nature.....it's not evil...or manipulative...just more the viewpoint of one who got to the party early, has (2) birds now in hand and see's it as better than one or two in the bush. So to speak G/L to the longs.

Time and value. If the stock move big on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, you should profit from your position even if it does not hit $10. But if the stock stay flat, then this position will lose value faster than the 9 strike price. Still your max lost will be $2500. The trick here is don't wait too close to expiration day. 99% of all my option trades are closeout before expiration date. Unless, it's a true gamble and hope for news release or accept the fact it's a total lost. For this trade, you must accept the fact that you may loose all your money on this transaction... a wager. For me, it's still better then blackjack because it's not all or nothing. You can still get out before it goes to zero if you change your mind while taking a partial lost. 50% lost is still better than 100% if you bet wrong.</Msg><Username>greatlife2020</Username><Timestamp>1347749143646</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 18:45:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347749359817-159</Id><Topic><Title>The Navy Seals have been outspoken in their condemnation of Obama; 2 of the 4 Americans killed Tuesday were Ex Navy Seals</Title><Username>tmc7212</Username><Timestamp>1347745964261</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 17:52:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama has a lot of explaining to do.

I can bet this is a 2-3 days trade. If you time the stock right, it could be rewarding even with 1 day of trade for the amount of option contract. Same situation as fbi4hire, i don't like to buy less than 50 contracts option because on these ultra short trade, the commission and spread is very high. In this scenario, the stock day-to-day movement is very important. In this kind of trade, you can even make money in the same day minutes, hours...if you time the stock movement right. So the right question for fbi4hire is does he truly believe BAC will move upward further for the next 2-4 days to the $10 level. The large option contracts is just a piggy back on the stock movement to optimize an ultra short-term option trade gain. Anyway, good luck on your decision.</Msg><Username>greatlife2020</Username><Timestamp>1347749953634</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 18:59:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347751706639-161</Id><Topic><Title>ROMNEY IS SUCH A FRAUD - WHY DID YOU REPUCANS PICK THIS GUY</Title><Username>farawaylife</Username><Timestamp>1347742705141</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 16:58:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>can't stand the truth, loser</Msg><Username>farawaylife</Username><Timestamp>1347751706639</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 19:28:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347752367940-162</Id><Topic><Title>Questions for Options Traders</Title><Username>fbi4hire</Username><Timestamp>1347703704304</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 06:08:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>opss...me bad I ment $2,500 loss plus the commissions.</Msg><Username>tax1099nc</Username><Timestamp>1347752367940</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 19:39:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347752639970-163</Id><Topic><Title>The Navy Seals have been outspoken in their condemnation of Obama; 2 of the 4 Americans killed Tuesday were Ex Navy Seals</Title><Username>tmc7212</Username><Timestamp>1347745964261</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 17:52:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No they haven't, you ball smuggler, or they'd be in the brig.

It declined and finally reversed to surpluses by '97, reaching $236mmm by '00 when he left office. (Google up "history U.S. surpluses &amp; deficits.") Clinton, and, bless their hearts, a Republican congress during much of his presidency, did exactly as Keynes suggested and used good economic times to pay down debt thereby building and reserving capacity to incur more debt when needed to mitigate bad times. Then we got Bush, a Republican Party shifting significantly to the right and big tax cuts, mostly for the rich, because, as the cuts were sold at the time, "surpluses belong to the people, not the government."

Yes, I have options trading enabled. In fact, I am doing quit well with my covered calls on the stocks I own and owned. So that you can understand my thinking better, the idea was to understand the maximum amount of money I can loss should I decided to place the bet. Hence, I am willing to loss it all ($2,500 plus commission) just to see if I can more than double my money in less than 4 days. Believe me, if I have enough liquid funds in my trading account, I would pick up 50,000 shares incrementally like you suggested; I would not be asking questions about options. However, I have had my share of making and losing $19,000 within hours. Therefore, I don't get nervous when I trade. Numbness tends to be the consistant feeling. Anyhow, thank you everyone for confirming my understanding about options. And I hope all the information you shared will also help other guys like me. Good luck to all longs on Monday! I smell $10 coming soon.
