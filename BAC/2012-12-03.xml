Right now they've gone from a philosophy of inclusion for all, meaning making sure to provide access to work, to a viable lifeway, indeed even to Power by dint of one's efforts, which is what built our country and made it great, to one of exclusion and extraction. That is, more and more they sit behind their gated communities, isolate themselves increasingly from the rest in all manner of fashions (from elite educational systems to an increasingly aristocratic meritocracy), all while asking for more and MORE while hogging the levers of power and access. They fail to understand they sit on the shoulders of the proletariats. They fail to understand that the proletariat can get along without them just fine, albeit in a reduced lifeways fashion. But the elites don't exist without the labor of the rest. It's that simple. And it's something they've forgotten. This is not surprising (to me). History proves this happens time and time and time again. Humanity...we never learn from history...we always think along the lines of "I've got mine and that's all that counts." Silly humans; taking the long view it doesn't count at all. So it goes.

The industry asks for leases in certain areas they think have a chance to have oil. The administration then decides whether they want to lease the area the company has asked for. Yes I suppose there are some dry holes. The government is not responsible for making sure there is oil under those leases. The leases Obama rolled back in 2009 were next to national Park land in Utah. Just before he left office Bush went on a binge leasing out as much land as the industry had applied for with no concern for the environment. Some of that was reversed. The government has leased out more land every year than the companies can get to to explore. You can check the statistics and find there are more producing wells right now than during the Bush years even on federal land. True, some are not as productive but that is the nature of drilling. The oil companies drill where they have the best chance of getting good returns whether it be on private or public land it makes no difference to them and should make no difference to you. There is no bonus for you as the tax payer for oil from public land and it has nothing to do with making us "energy independent". You also need to consider rig usage. There are not an infinite number of rigs and crews onshore or offshore. Try to go hire one and see what the backlog is. Oil companies are drilling as fast as they can all over the world. They don't care if it is in the USA or China and the price is global. We don't get a better price for oil that comes from Oklahoma or Canada than that from the middle east. Both BP and Shell have applied for oil export licenses to export oil produced here in the USA . We will soon be exporting oil but don't expect to see that reduce your price at the pump. If you want to see American oil kept for America you will have to nationalize the oil industry and prohibit exportation. That isn't going to happen. The whole argument that oil leases on federal land has anything to do with our energy situation is nothing but FOX news propaganda for their ignorant viewers.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1354548947316</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 10:35:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354549002802-52</Id><Title>ISM NUMBERS BAD-RECESSION ON WAY??</Title><Msg>EVERYTHING GOING LOWER</Msg><Username>dgregsmart</Username><Timestamp>1354549002802</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 10:36:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354549257670-53</Id><Title>Goldman, JP Morgan or whomever that is killing stock price of BAC this AM near 10 dollars again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1</Title><Msg>BAC is now, NOW 8.84 bouncing off 10 dollar underside of BAC 9.94this .

Take Britain, where Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs service reports that the number of taxpayers declaring £1 million a year in income fell by more than 60% in fiscal 2010-2011 from the year before. That was the year that millionaires became liable for the 50% income-tax rate that Gordon Brown's government introduced in its final days in 2010, up from the previous 40% rate. Lo, the total number of millionaire tax filers plunged to 6,000 in 2010-2011, from 16,000 in 2009-2010. The new tax was meant to raise about £2.5 billion more revenue. So much for that. In 2009-2010 British millionaires contributed about £13.4 billion to the public coffers, or just under 9% of the total tax liability of all taxpayers that year. At the 50% rate, the shrunken pool yielded £6.5 billion, or about 4.4%." The inverse relationship between revenues and rates is a fact that bureaucrats/liberals just don't get or accept. It is also demonstrated in the capital gains rates and tax receipts that were yo-yoed in the Reagan - Bush 1 - Clinton years. Now just watch what happens in France....</Msg><Username>jhitcher2011</Username><Timestamp>1354551296305</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 11:14:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354551309982-65</Id><Title>IMHO ..BAC will have a problem to cross $10 until C will go back to approx $38.5</Title><Msg>AS THE LAST TIME</Msg><Username>A Yahoo!

That the debt limit not be reset by Congress but that congress have the opportunity to restrict it if they deem it necessary rather than have to vote to raise it every year. That is not unilateral control, I have seen or heard nothing about any proposed asset tax except the temporary one Donald Trump advocated. Perhaps you can provide a link to some statement by the president or Geitner that has such a scheme.

Merry Christmas to you and remember your statement and mine that you love your neighbors as yourself. Have a good year, my portfolio was further destroyed BAC wise the day after the Presidential election. Thanks to whoever rammed the premarket down to massive BAC drop that November 7, 2012 premarket time morning. Who were those manipulators? Can the SEC help find out who the big dogs were that sold massively in the premarket? All that after Fast Money had BAC as its TRADE OF THE DAY with announcement of buying 10 dollar Jan calls by Scott Nations November 5 2012 I believe. Let's see, those dropped by 50 percent the day after the election. How many options traders listening to your recommendation Scott Nations are really "SOPHISTICATED" investors. Huh? The 10 dollar resistance area is destroying my faith in BAC right now Brian Moynihan. What do you think about the 15 dollar area where you were able to have an offering to get TARP gone that allowed big bonuses to be paid to BAC traders? That's when you took over BAC three years ago. About two months before you took over BAC, BAC hit $19.10 . Can you belive that essentially three years have passed and BAC was at 19 dollars a share right before you took over its helm. That amazing, isn't it? 19 DOLLARS TO 5 DOLLARS TO BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP AGAINST 10 DOLLARS hear by you third anniversary. I guess Golman, JP Morgan, and other traders are just printing money if they trade options and stock of Bank of America. Is it so easy for them that "even a cave man can do it"? In three years we have fallen from 19 to 5 and still have been stuck under 10 with many attempts to get over 10 back toward 15 dollar offering price and I am wearing out now. You have a very Merry Christmas. Jesus loves us and all, the reason for the season.

"There's not going to be an agreement without rates going up," Geithner told CNN in an interview aired on Sunday. "If they are going to force higher rates on virtually all Americans because they're unwilling to let tax rates go up on 2 percent of Americans, then, I mean that's the choice they're going to have to make. Obama also wants to close loopholes, limit deductions, raise the estate tax rate to 2009 levels and increase taxes on capital gains and dividend taxes. In addition, the Obama proposal calls for a new $50 billion stimulus package, a home mortgage refinancing plan, and an extension of unemployment insurance benefits. It also would extend the payroll tax cut passed early in Obama's administration. In return, multiple sources told CNN that Obama is offering $400 billion in new cuts to Medicare and other entitlement programs -- with specifics decided next year." Note none of these tax increase affect anyone making under $200-250K taxable income.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1354563159101</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 14:32:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354563520119-112</Id><Title>OBAMA'S WEALTH (ASSET) TAX LIKELY</Title><Msg>Executive Summary – Obama has not done anything like this yet - a tax on wealth not income. We think it is something the American President from Kenya will try for a lot of reasons. He has a failed social security system that cannot possibly pay the baby boomers soon to start drawing benefits. The government borrowed the social security money already in the past. He is fighting two wars, running thirteen aircraft carrier groups (well you never know when someone might try to do a sea invasion of the USA, by the way what would they do with it, they would just have to bail it out). The USA has super deficit spending, is taking over the private sector (banks, auto industry and soon healthcare) and the President has an awful popularity rating. Please bear in mind that tax revenues in the USA are dropping big time due to many millions of people out of work, closed businesses, rising bankruptcies etc. As much as the government would like to get blood out of a stone they can’t. People are suing Obama in court to show his birth certificate, they have a Kenyan birth certificate for him on file in court. Timothy Geithner is a tax evader now in charge of the treasury (reminiscent of Richard Nixon swearing Elvis Presley in as a Drug Agent). Obama is in a mess. He has communist aspirations and ties. So what is he likely to do? A wealth tax!

A newly resurfaced audio recording of Barack Obama saying; “I Actually Believe in Redistribution” is being circulated in conservative circles with so much frequency and zeal, if you came here from another planet, you’d think there was some sort of controversy about it. Why is everyone so shocked by this 14-year-old audio clip? Is anyone on either side even arguing that President Obama is not for redistribution? Didn’t he say to me in 2008 he wanted to spread the wealth around? People are playing and replaying this thing over and over to the point where you’d think Zapruder himself had actually recorded it. Saying Barack Obama favors the redistribution of wealth is like making the observation that Lindsay Lohan likes to party. Barack Obama’s campaign for re-election is fairly simple: “Vote for me and I’ll give you that other guy’s stuff.” The Obama campaign will then argue that all you have to do is to tax the rich more – which will run the government for about 12 days – then what do you do? Why aren’t people talking about what is obvious to me? Barack Obama and the Democrats think voters are stupid. But they need to look at what happened in Wisconsin. The voters – all voters – are not stupid. Most Americans understand that prosperity results from an economy based on creating wealth, not redistributing it. They know these deficits cannot be sustained and that the liberal math simply doesn’t work.</Msg><Username>failure_in_chief</Username><Timestamp>1354564950717</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 15:02:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354564957591-115</Id><Topic><Title>Even notice GOP does not have one funny comedian?

A rather attractive woman goes up to the bartender in the Rancid Repuglican bar. She gestures alluringly to the barman who comes over immediately. When he arrives, she seductively signals that he should bring his face close to hers. When he does so, she begins to gently caress his beard, which is full and bushy. "Are you the landlord?" she asks, softly stroking his face with both hands. "Actually, no" he replies. "Can you get him for me - I need to speak to him" she asks, running her hands up beyond his beard and into his hair. "I'm afraid I can't" breathes the barman - clearly aroused. "Is there anything I can do?" "Yes there is. I need you to give him a message"she continues huskily, popping a couple of fingers into his mouth and allowing him to suck them gently.......... (Are you ready?) "Tell him that there is no toilet paper in the ladies room."</Msg><Username>venturian321</Username><Timestamp>1354570465594</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 16:34:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354570518302-143</Id><Topic><Title>There is no proposed asset tax</Title><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1354563159101</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 14:32:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Next you'll be telling us that Palin's "death panels" never actually existed either.</Msg><Username>jefatkinson</Username><Timestamp>1354570518302</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 16:35:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354571269785-144</Id><Topic><Title>wow</Title><Username>marksalian</Username><Timestamp>1354552649748</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 11:37:29 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>will be buying more tomorrow</Msg><Username>maxeileen</Username><Timestamp>1354571269785</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 16:47:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354571820591-145</Id><Topic><Title>I saw John Carey at a bar I said , Why the long face</Title><Username>csaintswin</Username><Timestamp>1354568988906</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 16:09:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>?????????

While the first Stamp Act on tea helped precipitate the Revolutionary War, the second was far less dramatic. Revenues from requiring a federal stamp on wills in probate were used to pay off debts incurred during the undeclared naval war with France in 1794. Congress repealed the Stamp Act in 1802. That set a pattern for the next hundred years or so in which estate taxes were used as a sporadic, and temporary, way to finance wars. When hostilities ceased, the tax was repealed. To help finance the Civil War, the Tax Act of 1862 imposed a federal inheritance tax. As costs mounted, the Congress increased the inheritance tax rates and added a succession tax in 1864. When the need for added revenue subsided after the war, the inheritance tax was repealed in 1870. In 1874, a taxpayer challenged the legality of the Civil War estate taxes, arguing they were direct taxes that, under the Constitution, must be apportioned among the states according to the census. The Supreme Court disagreed saying that direct taxes pertained to capitation taxes and taxes on land, houses, and other permanent real estate.2 Another legal decision bearing on, but not directly related to, estate taxes concerned the Income Tax Act of 1894, which included gifts and inheritances as income subject to tax. The Supreme Court struck down the whole bill because the tax was imposed on, among other things, real estate gains and, therefore, was considered a direct tax.3 This decision is particularly notable because it set the stage for the Sixteenth Amendment that allows the federal government great latitude in the types of taxes it can collect. The Modern Estate Tax Evolves: 1916 to 1975 In the early 20th century, worldwide conflict cut into trade tariffs--a mainstay of federal revenues--and Congress turned to another revenue source. The Revenue Act of 1916, which introduced the modern-day income tax, also contained an estate tax with many features of today's system. After an exemption of $50,000 (over $11 million in terms of today's wealth), tax rates started at 1 percent and climbed to 10 percent on estates over $5 million (over $1 billion in terms of today's wealth). Estate taxes were increased in 1917 as the U.S. entered World War I. However, this time the estate tax did not go away after the war ended. Despite sizable budget surpluses, Congress increased rates and introduced a gift tax in 1924. Like the estate tax, the gift tax is a levy on the transfer of property from one person to another. During the 1920s through the 1940s, estate taxes were used as another way to attempt to redistribute income. Tax rates of up to 77 percent on the largest estates were supposed to prevent wealth becoming increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few. Chart 1 shows the starting and top estate tax rates since 1916. While the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 overhauled the federal income tax, it made a seemingly minor structural change to estate taxation. Specifically, it expanded the tax base to include most life insurance proceeds, which could substantially raise an estate's tax bill. Reshaping Federal Transfer Taxes: 1976 to the Present During the late 1960s and early 1970s loophole closing preoccupied tax reformers. These efforts culminated in a 1976 tax bill that overhauled estate taxation, giving us the system we still have today. Perhaps the biggest change was combining the previously separate exemptions for estate and gift taxes and transforming them into a single, unified estate and gift tax credit. The 1981 tax bill brought some relief. The top rate went from 70 percent to 50 percent, and an increase in the unified credit took a lot of smaller estates--those under $600,000--off the tax rolls. But, after that, the search for revenue to close budget deficits led to more than a decade of bills that largely increased estate taxes. In 1997, Congress provided some relief with the first increase in the unified credit since 1987. Gradual increases, which began in 1999, are slated to raise the unified credit to $1 million by 2006. The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 was the first step toward totally eliminating the death tax. It provides for a scheduled phase-out of rates and an increase in the unified credit, finally repealing the tax for calendar year 2010. Unfortunately, the provisions sunset in 2011 and the estate tax reverts back to the 1997 law with a top rate of 55 percent and a unified credit of $1 million</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1354584617923</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 20:30:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354585054444-182</Id><Topic><Title>IF WE GO OVER FISCAL CLIFF, VOTE THEM ALL OUT!!!!!!</Title><Username>theprincipalad</Username><Timestamp>1354582463063</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 19:54:23 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yes, he's trying to make the republicans out to be the bad guys, hoping to get his democrapper congress back in control for 2014, thus giving him more power to exert over all his programs, this is like a very powerful chess game and obama wants to be the only king left standing.this guy isa ruthless s.o.b and cares nothing about this country!</Msg><Username>montyprython</Username><Timestamp>1354585054444</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 20:37:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354585094430-183</Id><Topic><Title>OBAMA WANTS TO CONFISCATE THE MONEY OF THE DEAD WHY THE SURPRISE OVER THE WEALTH TAX?</Title><Username>failure_in_chief</Username><Timestamp>1354564950717</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 15:02:30 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Adjusting the tax brackets has been going on since they started.

It is considered smart because it is an INVESTMENT, remember that concept.? It pays back much more than was spent, and in myrias ways, and it builds on the technology edge we currently have here in the US, but won't have for much longer if we keep thinking small and stupid.
