So Guantanamo is still open, we are burning less coal, solyndra went bust, he has invoked exec privilege to supress information more than Clinton or Bush, and he did not follow through on any of his campaign finance promises. So tell me, all knowing libs, why is it again that he deserves a second term? It is because of the great promises he is making, is that what you are saying, because of his great track record, is that it? Oh, and before you say, like he did, that there is more oil drilling under his administration to improve energy independence, let me cut you off by saying that we all know that is another lie because it has all been on private land while drilling on public land has decreased. What is it again that we can rely on the word of this guy for? Anyone?

From today's Bloomberg article by Robert Sheridan: "Daily rates for Panamax vessels, that typically haul coal and grains, plunged to the lowest in more than eight weeks as a glut of ships swamps the number of cargoes available for loading. Returns for Panamaxes, the largest size able to navigate the Panama Canal, lost 2.2 percent, sliding to $7,096 a day, the lowest level since June 7, according to the Baltic Exchange, the London-based publisher of freight rates. That’s the 14th consecutive decline, the longest losing streak since early February, the data show. The number of Panamax vessels in the global fleet has increased to 2,105, the highest since at least February 2005, according to data from IHS Inc. (IHS), an Englewood, Colorado-based research company. Charterers are able to select ships that offer cheaper rates, as there is a large surplus of vessels available, according to Fotis Giannakoulis, a New York-based analyst at Morgan Stanley (MS), citing data from Clarkson Plc (CKN), the world’s largest shipbroker." For those who can't decipher what this means, the Baltic Dry Index is a measurement of activity in the dry bulk shipping industry. Activity in the dry bulk goods sector (predominately shipments of raw materials like wood, coal, ore, grain, and lumber) is a good leading indicator of future manufacturing activity, and it certainly isn't showing any signs of an impending recovery. This brings us to today' word: 'bubble': "an economic term referring to a market in which speculation based upon faulty assumptions has inflated prices beyond the point of sustainability". ROTFLMAO at bubble-pipe smokers everywhere. "Romney by a landslide."

They are Sikhs. The central tenets of their religion stresses personal responsibility and teaches a moral code emphasizing personal courage, honor, and a commitment to defend the weak, oppressed, and persecuted regardless of race, creed or nationality, at a cost up to and including their lives. Since you operate under an entirely different set of principals, or should I say total lack of them, I should warn you that insulting their honor or religion is a good way to bring your own miserable existence to an immediate conclusion.

It may include groups and individuals that are dedicated to a single issue, such as opposition to abortion or immigration.” “[T]he consequences of a prolonged economic downturn – including real estate foreclosures, unemployment and an inability to obtain credit – could create a fertile recruiting environment for right-wing extremists and even result in confrontations between such groups and government authorities similar to those in the past,” the report says. It adds that “growth in these groups subsided in reaction to increased government scrutiny as a result of the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing and disrupted plots, improvements in the economy and the continued U.S. standing as the pre-eminent world power.” “Proposed imposition of firearms restrictions and weapons bans likely would attract new members into the ranks of right-wing extremist groups as well as potentially spur some of them to begin planning and training for violence against the government,” the report continues. “The high volume of purchases and stockpiling of weapons and ammunition by right-wing extremists in anticipation of restrictions and bans in some parts of the country continue to be a primary concern to law enforcement.” Most notable is the report’s focus on the impact of returning war veterans. “Returning veterans possess combat skills and experience that are attractive to right-wing extremists,” it says. “DHS/I&amp;A is concerned that right-wing extremists will attempt to recruit and radicalize veterans in order to boost their violent capacities.” The report cites the April 4 shooting deaths of three police officers in Pittsburgh as an example of what may be coming, claiming the alleged gunman holds a racist ideology and believes in anti-government conspiracy theories about gun confiscations, citizen detention camps and “a Jewish-controlled ‘one-world government.’” It also suggests the election of an African-American president and the prospect of his policy changes “are proving to be a driving force for right-wing extremist recruitment and radicalization.” The report also mentions “‘end times’ prophecies could motivate extremist individuals and groups to stockpile food, ammunition and weapons. These teachings also have been linked with the radicalization of domestic extremist individuals and groups in the past, such as the violent Christian Identity organizations and extremist members of the militia movement.” “DHS/I&amp;A assesses that right-wing extremist groups’ frustration over a perceived lack of government action on illegal immigration has the potential to incite individuals or small groups toward violence,” the report continues. The report states the DHS will be working with state and local partners over the next several months to determine the levels of right-wing extremist activity in the U.S. Last month, the chief of the Missouri highway patrol blasted a report issued by the Missouri Information Analysis Center that linked conservative groups to domestic terrorism, assuring that such reports no longer will be issued. The report had been compiled with the assistance of DHS. The report warned law enforcement agencies to watch for suspicious individuals who may have bumper stickers for third-party political candidates such as Ron Paul, Bob Barr and Chuck Baldwin. It further warned law enforcement to watch out for individuals with “radical” ideologies based on Christian views, such as opposing illegal immigration, abortion and federal taxes. Chief James Keathley of the Missouri State Patrol issued a statement that the release of the report, which outraged conservatives nationwide, prompted him to “take a hard look” at the procedures through which the report was released by the MIAC. “My review of the procedures used by the MIAC in the three years since its inception indicates that the mechanism in place for oversight of reports needs improvement,” he wrote. “Until two weeks ago, the process for release of reports from the MIAC to law enforcement officers around the state required no review by leaders of the Missouri State Highway Patrol or the Department of Public Safety.” “For that reason, I have ordered the MIAC to permanently cease distribution of the militia report,” he said. “Further, I am creating a new process for oversight of reports drafted by the MIAC that will require leaders of the Missouri State Highway Patrol and the Department of Public Safety to review the content of these reports before they are shared with law enforcement. My office will also undertake a review of the origin of the report by MIAC.”</Msg><Username>urbansquall</Username><Timestamp>1344289479943</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 17:44:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344290025014-175</Id><Title>oboma rooting for his home team</Title><Msg>queen oboma of kenya congratulated his home team of kenya for their olympic game showing.he claimed the american team didn`t deserve credit because the goverment did all the work.</Msg><Username>sammywong65</Username><Timestamp>1344290025014</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 17:53:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344290606739-176</Id><Title>Republican blow hole George Will says, " ...presidential race looks like it might be a lost cause for Republicans."</Title><Msg>Columnist George Will says the 2012 presidential race looks like it might be a lost cause for Republicans and believes that the primary goal of conservatives should be to retain control of the House and win the Senate so Congress can restrain President Barack Obama while the GOP grooms its talent for 2016.

You spent like 1 dollar to buy the Sunday News to hunt for jobs in the employment section. Guess what you will find they are hiring the most ?
