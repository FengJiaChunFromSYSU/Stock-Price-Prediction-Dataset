ROTFLMAO OK, adjust the onlooker demographic as follows: 20% are drunk; 20% are stoned; 5% are on crank, 5% are certifiable; and 10% watch FOX NEWS (I live in the Boston area, so these are reasonably good estimates of an average late-night street gathering). Also assume that there is some overlap among the segments. Odds are good therefore that there's at least 1 drunk, stoned, certifiable meth-headed FOX fan in the crowd, which by itself should be enough to stir at least token vigilante action from the remaining sheep. ROTFLMAO that should put enough cell phones, iPads, empties bottles, and TV remotes into the air to ensure that a few survivors, bystanders and firefighters are injured or killed. By the way, in this case investigators later determined that the fire was started by Schuey getting too far into a bottle of Glenmorangie Lasanta 21-year old single malt and dropping a lit Partagas 160 Robusto behind a sofa cushion (it was a Tuesday night, so he was hitting the cheap stuff).

They had no proof bin Laden was behind things when Clinton had that opportunity. Then you will recall there was a lot of warning to Bush from the intelligence community that Rice , Cheney an W rejected. Clinton did make an attack on Bin Ladens site when it became clear he was behind the growing terrorist threat. Also you have to consider the crippling position the GOP had Clinton in with their attempts to impeach him at the time he could have been more aggressive with foreign policy had he not been dealing with those distractions. Congress was obviously never under "party" control. Efforts were blocked on all fronts. When Obama took office there was the concept of cooperation expected from the administration which never happened as the GOP circled the wagons and fought even the good legislation like that proposed by Volker and Bowles/simpson. I don't own BAC right now either and wish I had heeded your warning earlier but have managed to make some profits on it. I agree that the litigation is still an issued and the attempt to save the housing market for the government by taking on Countrywide was a disaster that Lewis should have avoided. BAC had stayed clear of those bad loans and then took on the worst of them. Growth in banks is a questionable subject. Already to big to fail makes further concentration in the industry a threat to all of the finance system. I agree BAC is improving as it divests itself from those albatrosses hung around its neck in 2008 and the total number of shares outstanding is just unmanageable. The board is out of shareholder control and until circumstances are such that they can provide and issue a decent dividend I'm staying clear.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1366637737674</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-22 09:35:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366638014106-32</Id><Topic><Title>BROKERS are ALL Buying SHORT SHARES......huge downturn this week.</Title><Username>purple_man91</Username><Timestamp>1366609881433</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-22 01:51:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This guy has no idea whats talking about.

The reason you get such a "rise" out of those libs on this Board is that you are exactly accurate in your Posts. The phone program is another Obama vote buying scheme, and no doubt you know that some who are abusing same have like 50 or more cell phones paid for by we taxpayers. Ask any cop who has a recent drug dealer under arrest what the cell phones are doing. MSM are doing their best to keep all the real facts very quiet so as to remain in the favor of the White House. This way they get a TV interview to enhance their own careers. It has become laughable as to the LACK of credibility of most MSM's. Keep up the accurate Posts. BAC is strong, so not to worry.

The Horror!</Title><Msg>I opened the lid of my 'iggy' box a few minutes ago to stick kilgares in with the other trolls, and was confronted by an unimaginable horror. Gone were the multitudes I'd stuck in there over the years, and in their place was a single, vile, repulsive, drooling, naked dwarf! It looked like the love child of Linda Hunt and Gollum, and it was gnawing on the bones of deceased inmates while #$%$ oozed from every orifice, and blood dripped from a hundred or more pin-pricks. Just as I was about to slam the lid, I spotted a hundred or so Yahoo IDs littering the floor next to the creature. "dump_obamie"; "cyc_44"; "i_am_a_proud_american"; twenty different versions of the same name, which as best as I could decipher was something like "sarcoma_und_wart" or "sarcophag_us#$%$ ", and dozen of other names I vaguely recognized but couldn't connect to faces. Suddenly, I realized that the beast inside was: Little Z! I tossed his squirming kilgares clone in, and like a hobo on a ham sandwich Z was all over him in an instant, shrieking and capering as he set about consuming yet another of his multiple personalities and clones. Cannibalism is ugly no matter what the species, but evolution is a cruel mistress and the weak must die. R.I.P kilgares! ROTFLMAO I'd like to say he's gone to a better place, but judging from what I witnessed I think it's gonna feel just like home to him.</Msg><Username>fish2kill</Username><Timestamp>1366654745067</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-22 14:19:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366654758172-78</Id><Title>FCX FCX FCX FCX</Title><Msg>to da moon</Msg><Username>shortburner2013</Username><Timestamp>1366654758172</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-22 14:19:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366654964324-79</Id><Topic><Title>The Horror!

Because the policy, referred to as “Obama phones” by conservatives, has had the bad luck of being distorted as the Obama administration’s policy of handing out free phones to welfare recipients — a claim that was boosted by a racially charged video that went viral. “The program has nearly tripled in size from $800 million in 2009 to $2.2 billion per year in 2012,” Republicans on the committee wrote in March. “American taxpayers — and we as their elected representatives — need to know how much of this growth is because of waste, fraud and abuse.” Lifeline began during the Reagan administration, and was expanded during George W. Bush’s presidency to include cellphone service. It’s funded by phone bill fees that most people pay — not, as some conspiracy theorists believe, by taxes.
