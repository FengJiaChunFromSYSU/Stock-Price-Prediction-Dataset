You are absolutely right. I hope you see my post was exactly about that realization. It was my satirical way of letting the screaming right-wingers know that some of us are aware of their purposeful noise to cover up the reasons they would rather not have George W and Dick anywhere near this current campaign. They HOPE we don't remember. I totally agree with your reasoning. I always prefer facts to the mindless mudslinging from the right. We have not all been diverted from historical facts. I hope many see and read your post. And I AM a BAC shareholder expecting great thiings in the months and years ahead.

Trillion$$$plus deficits to the horizon and beyond. QE3...$40 Billion per month to infinity. Over 100 million on some kind of welfare scheme. Record numbers on food stamps. Record numbers on the poverty roll. Record numbers not looking for work. Record numbers receiving disability assistance. Annual compliance costs now exceed $400 billion. Record borrowing to prop up all of those Prog schemes. Obama unemployment rate above 8% longer than any other President since 1948 (adjusted down below 8% the other day since there are now even fewer looking for work).

The news broke on TheBlazeTV’s “Wilkow!” hosted by Andrew Wilkow, by best-selling author, Ed Klein who said the legal counsel to Clinton had informed him of this information. Klein also said that those same sources said that former President Bill Clinton has been “urging” his wife [Hillary] to release official State Department documents that prove she called for additional security at the compound in Libya, which would almost certainly result in President Obama losing the election. Klein explained that everyone knew what was happening in Benghazi from the CIA to the National Security Agency and that there’s intelligence cables that have not been released. Wilkow asked, “If everybody knew this including the White House, who would have given the order to go in and save the ambassador?” Klein, “The President…he should have given the order to use the rapid reaction force…” Wilkow, “Not Petraeus?” Klein, “Well it has to come from the president.”</Msg><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1351856635188</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 07:43:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351856839292-35</Id><Title>Help for Sandy Victims Turned Away?</Title><Msg>Just heard...workers from Alabama sent to aid power restoration were turned away by union workers from NJ.

Obama appeared on "Late Show" Sept. 17, taking the appearance as an opportunity to slam his opponent Mitt Romney's comment that 47 percent of the American people don't pay income taxes and consider themselves victims. Between campaign stops, Obama has been making the television rounds, answering the public's questions during an interview with MTV and appearing on "The Daily Show With Jon Stewart" and "The Tonight Show With Jay Leno" over the past two weeks.</Msg><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1351857629209</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 08:00:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351857715252-39</Id><Topic><Title>Join the Republicans for Obama Club.

The difference is Bush managed the crisis and he handled the job. Obama hasn't. BTW, the only war we are not able to win is the one the Democrats were in favor of. Afghanistan! Another dose of reality, the Clinton surplus the liberals brag about came from that improperly managed tech bubble, that was allowed to careen out control. Combined with off the books borrowing from Social Security, and the neglect and failure to make appropriate expenditures to counter the increasing incidents of terror perpetrated by Al-Qaeda around the world. In other words, it never really existed except on paper. And, how do you have a surplus while you are still running up the National Debt as Clinton was? Bush, upon entering office, immediately called for investigations into Fannie and Freddie that were held up in committee or filibustered at very turn by Democrats and a handful RINOs. Bush continued to call for and urge congress to investigate these GSE’s throughout his entire presidency. No action was taken. Those investigations had the potential to expose the whole mortgage back security scam before it became critical. Thank Barney Frank, Barack Obama and Chris Dodd for leading the opposition to those requested investigations. Bush never had a super majority in congress as Obama was privileged to have for two years, and wasted on the ideological legislation of Obamacare, rather than on fixing the economy. While Obama sat on his hands waiting for Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi to push though his health care nightmare, the economy continued to fall deeper and deeper into despair. Spending reeled out of control with government sinking it’s tentacles deep into the private sector arena with business choking regulations and bailouts for campaign donors of Obama. Had Obama put aside his ideological nonsense and focused on a private sector based recovery plan we would not still be in this dire recession. This is Obama's mess, in all this time as president he and his party still refuse to take responsibility, and he continues to blame everything under the sun but himself. Yet Democrats blame Bush for everything that transpired in his first nine months. Double standard idiocy! Obama is no leader! Obama is without one original cogent idea! Obama has damage hundreds of thousands of families beyond repair. He's just a sniveling whiner! And now he wants to sue the banks! What a feeble ideologically blinded mind this president has! The fact that the Clinton staff vandalized the White House and government computers and offices, and dumped and scrambled files, before leaving tells you the juvenile mind set of that administration. And Bill Clinton used the full power of the oval office and the presidency to pressure a young fat intern into being his human humidor at the expense of the entire country. A despicable self-absorbed old pervert by any measure. I have no respect for this man nor anyone who does.</Msg><Username>carburetorkid</Username><Timestamp>1351862257873</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 09:17:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>12</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351862267893-90</Id><Title>Presidential betting odds</Title><Msg>London bookies have Obama @ 5/18 (78% probability) &amp; Romney @ 7/2 (22%).</Msg><Username>jefatkinson</Username><Timestamp>1351862267893</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 09:17:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351862312062-91</Id><Title>COME ON REPUCANS, THE ELECTION IS OVER - JETRO ROMNEY LOST</Title><Msg>come on do yourselves a favor and start crying now or better yet, JUMP OFF A TALL BUILDING NOW</Msg><Username>farawaylife</Username><Timestamp>1351862312062</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 09:18:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351862567820-92</Id><Title>Unhinged "bury obama" seen buying box cutters and renting a Ryder truck.</Title><Msg>November 6 didn't turn out the way he wanted, so be warned.

The numbers are startling, and completely contrary to the widespread myth of Republican business superiority. Since 1949, the GDP grew at an average annual rate of 4.2% under Democratic administrations (Truman thru Obama), but at a 2.6% rate under Republican administrations (Eisenhower thru Bush II) Since 1913, the stock market grew at an average annual rate of 12.1% under Democratic administrations (and 12.3% during Obama's tenure), but a 5.1% rate under Republican administrations. Finally, the average annual increase in corporate earnings since 1936 was 10.5% under Democratic leadership, a whopping 51.8% under Obama, and only 8.9% under Republicans presidents. Romney's claim that he would grow the economy at an annual rate of 4% is dubious at best, given that from 1953 to present, no Republican president has ever achieved or surpassed that goal. The GOP has a glaring tendency to dismiss math from their political and economic calculations, which only further undermines their claim to superior business acumen and performance. It is a myth perpetuated by business owners and CEOs and corporate directors, because they understand that their bread is buttered not by the performance of their businesses, but by the growth of their own personal wealth. The Dennis Kowslowskis and Donald Trumps and Jack Welches and Mitt Romney's of the business world enthusiastically endorse the GOP because that party's laissez-faire approach to regulations and competition, and its religious devotion to cutting taxes for the rich, assures them of putting more money in THEIR pockets even as it handicaps or cripples the businesses they own or operate. The GOP itself has thoroughly debunked one myth, though. David Brittan, the Editor-In-Chief of Tufts University's alumni magazine, once observed that "If you want to be happy, you must be prepared to believe some things that aren't true". That is obviously false, because while Republicans certainly believe a host of things that aren't true, they don't seem like a very happy bunch of haters to me. ROTFLMAO and I doubt if more cash will improve their less-than-sunny outlook.</Msg><Username>fish2kill</Username><Timestamp>1351863706961</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 09:41:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351863710670-105</Id><Title>$10 today ???</Title><Msg>Will we see $10 today?.

My father, now retired, ran a very large energy-related business for many years, and one of their key offering was a line of energy cogeneration equipment (waste-heat recovery from industrial and commercial processes, and stand-alone generators) aimed not at the home market but at large businesses and the owners of large building complexes. Yesterday, I was on the phone with him and he was crowing about what a golden opportunity Sandy and the NYC experience have presented to his former outfit. He was urging their board of directors to have their engineering team, rather than PR and marketing and sales weenies, contact current users of that equipment in the NJ/NY/MD area and ask how they and their equipment fared during the storm and its aftermath; then build a PR campaign around the responses. He was adamant about keeping PR idiots away from the fact-finding efforts, ("Those idiots could queer a gold ingot") and only letting them get involved after the data and testimonials had been collected by the engineering group. ROTFLMAO I seem to recall plenty of engineers among the crew of NCC-1701, but I don't remember any PR spokespersons.

The award follows extensive research by the Boston-based firm in which it sent researchers to open accounts at all major banks in the U.S. In addition to BofA, BB&amp;T and SunTrust were among Charlotte banks that received high marks. When the researcher tried to open an account at a BofA branch, the Charlotte-based bank offered a mortgage review, credit card assessment, investment account overview and information on savings accounts. “The XCelent Service Award goes to Bank of America, with an honorable mention to BB&amp;T. They conducted the most thorough needs assessment by a long shot. The entire visit took an hour and involved a platform staff member, an investment manager, and the branch manager,” the report says. “Retail branch banking is fundamentally a people business, and it was a team of people at Bank of America that won the day with their XCelent Service award. From the most thorough needs assessment to demonstrating ATMs to having an investment specialist on site, they were able to offer the broadest array of solutions on the spot,” the report continues. “Great training or maybe just great people at BB&amp;T and SunTrust also helped these two banks drive customer-focused needs assessment to help bankers think like customers.”</Msg><Username>cchaker</Username><Timestamp>1351869908062</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 11:25:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351870026371-137</Id><Title>•7 Reasons To Buy This 7% Yielder</Title><Msg>i think be safe go for mpw..</Msg><Username>sandiegoautofinders</Username><Timestamp>1351870026371</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 11:27:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351870057927-138</Id><Topic><Title>171,000 jobs added in October, some 46,000 more than forecast.

Preliminary revenue results indicate the company's strongest first quarter ever, with revenue expected in the range of $10 million to $11 million. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Pre-earnings implications: - The $11 million expected Fiscal 1Q 2013 revenue will yield 20 -30c/share net income. In 1Q 2012 the company reported 6.2 million in revenues and 30c/share loss. - Strongest 1Q ever - 4th Quarter or significant Y/Y improvements in top and bottom lines - 1Q 2013 Revenues are in line with the $48 million revenue projection for fiscal 2013 or 40% higher than 2012. - Projected $1/share net income (current guidance) will probably be exceeded - Company will likely increase guidance for 2013 because 1Q is always the weakest quarter. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- An analyst covering the stock recently upped its earnings projections for NTWK based on significant increased global demand for all of its software products and services (legacy and cloud) Selected Analyst Comments: All business lines are very strong growth across the board.

A federal court order Thursday morning temporarily halted operations at five telemarketing firms that the Federal Trade Commission said illegally dialed up consumers with millions of prerecorded messages – often saying they were from “Rachel.” “ ‘Rachel from Cardholder Services’ is public enemy No. 1,” FTC Chairman Jon Leibowitz said in a statement. The FTC receives 200,000 complaints a month about robocalls. The agency has shut down companies responsible for 2.6 billion telemarketing calls since such calls were outlawed in 2009, but that’s a drop in the bucket, FTC said. The agency says it can’t trace or block about 59 percent of phone spam because the calls route through a tangle of automatic dialers, caller ID spoofing and voice-over-Internet protocols. The problem is so bad that earlier this month the FTC offered a $50,000 prize to anyone who could come up with a way to stop telephonic spam. wThe contest runs until Jan. 17. FTC said the “Rachel” telemarketing companies, all based in Arizona and Florida, told consumers that they could drastically reduce their credit card interest rates if they paid initial fees. Asking for such an up-front fee for debt-reduction services is illegal, the FTC said. Calls from “Rachel” told listeners that there was an “important message” for them regarding high credit card interest rates, the FTC said. Listeners were then told to press 1 to speak with an operator, or 2 to stop getting the calls. Pressing 1 led consumers to a live telemarketer, some of whom promised to save consumers up to $2,500 in finance charges or pay off their credit card balances faster by using the company’s service, the FTC said. If consumers said they were interested, the telemarketing company then conducted an “audit” to make sure the customer qualified, according to the complaint filed by the FTC. That usually required the consumer giving out credit card and financial information over the phone. The fee for the interest-reduction service ranged from several hundred dollars to $3,000, the FTC said. In some cases, consumers were charged without their consent. In others, the telemarketers did not disclose that there was a fee. In the complaint, the FTC said the companies were violating various consumer protection laws including misrepresenting to consumers that their services would save them money and reduce credit card interest rates.</Msg><Username>yawnfestblink</Username><Timestamp>1351871005191</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 11:43:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351871123762-149</Id><Topic><Title>UNEMPLOYMENT UP FROM 7.8 to 7.9 ....WHY? because most of them are temporary jobs 7.50/hr ......so it fluctuates..no benefits..</Title><Username>urichey</Username><Timestamp>1351869032433</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 11:10:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A lot of TEMPORARY JOBS at the local MALLS too but most of these jobs are rehires from last 1-2 years.</Msg><Username>urichey</Username><Timestamp>1351871123762</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 11:45:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351871512324-150</Id><Title>BBBY will benefit from this storm.

Second point, this country was NOT built on re-distribution, it was built on capitalism-PERIOD! , Your ass-umption that economic growth at any cost is the final solution here is misplaced to say the least. In fact your MR RE-DISTRIBUTOR now in office has thrown everything but the kitchen sink in a desperate attempt to save his political bacon with little to show for it ! Result-more folks than ever dependent on the fed for survival-with a debt that threatens to crush this country if changes are not made in a hurry. "faith based repub. agenda"? I would say more of a common sense capitalism agenda, but you might be on to something here without realizing it. The lefties obviously don't have faith in the american people to find solution's-they are much more willing to trust the "best &amp; brightest" in wash. to make the decisions. How some of you can be so articulate &amp; yet at the same time fail to see the big picture constantly amazes me!

United Illuminating workers reported eggs and other objects being thrown at them a day after Mayor Bill Finch said the utility was taking care of wealthy suburbs while his constituents suffered. The unrest caused United Illuminating to pull its workers out until the city agreed to provide police protection. "Citizens began throwing things at the crews," Michael West, a spokesman for United Illuminating, told FoxNews.com. "It started to get pretty hairy.

I looked at this board and was appalled.</Msg><Username>stefenfetchet</Username><Timestamp>1351887796980</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 16:23:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351887938996-247</Id><Topic><Title>What did the Romney / Ryan Clown Car hit today?</Title><Username>cosmo_vitelli</Username><Timestamp>1351731030882</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 20:50:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's Newtie's turn.</Msg><Username>d_neo_con</Username><Timestamp>1351887938996</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 16:25:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351887941700-248</Id><Topic><Title>What did the Romney / Ryan Clown Car hit today?</Title><Username>cosmo_vitelli</Username><Timestamp>1351731030882</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 20:50:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's Newtie's turn.</Msg><Username>d_neo_con</Username><Timestamp>1351887941700</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 16:25:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351887991775-249</Id><Topic><Title>★★★★★ Five days until the Re-Election of President Obama ★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★</Title><Username>ebonics4gfy</Username><Timestamp>1351747575664</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 01:26:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes.

Thanks to GW Bush, as far as EVERYONE is concerned, if Obama wins 51% of the vote thats a BIG FAT MANDATE. Thats what GW Bush (2nd term) won by, and he wasted no time claiming one in order to ram conservative themes down the nation's throat. The Washington Post (11/4/04) similarly pointed to Bush's "clearer mandate," implying that the election of 2000, in which Bush failed to get even a plurality of the popular vote, was a mandate of sorts, if an unclear one. Of course, there are many definitions by which Bush's narrow victory would not be called a "mandate." Columnist Margaret Carlson, writing in the Los Angeles Times (11/4/04), posed the question bluntly: "What kind of mandate does he think he has with a 51 percent win?" More journalists might want to ask the same question.</Msg><Username>venturian321</Username><Timestamp>1351891307436</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 17:21:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351891344989-273</Id><Topic><Title>Democrats = Social Parasites</Title><Username>kingofvietnam</Username><Timestamp>1351889247544</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 16:47:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It is not that we don't care for the poor.

Concentration camp ring a bell? Suspecting that when many people starve and get angry; and all our troops are fighting foreign wars of our choosing, and only the cops recently up-skilled on the latest weapons in said wars are running the asylum...I conclude the millions of 9mm rounds and military ready to eat meals and states chocked (choked)-full of mandatory ethanol are all necessary to house the millions of alleged citizens to be disappeared as they protest. We need a few disasters a month to justify the training budget alone. Suppression of the Occupy Wall Street movement was simply one of many Police/National Guard emergencies. Next will be the "election (s)". Individual state-wide protection of Diebold digits (alleged votes) in Ohio and Virginia will replace Florida as the bad actor (OJ in an SUV), with each other swing state at the whim/will of its courts and cops. It will take 20 billion dollars just to plan to fix the mess that Sandy and Wall Street left behind. It will take a few generations to complete the work, if we have the skills and balls to accomplish the effort while the legions are fighting outside threats of the VANDALS and neo-cons.

The 3 boyfriends in Chicago died, one from a car "accident", the other 2 murdered "execution-style". Odd, isn't it. Execution style. Almost like it was planned to keep a secret... a secret. Buddy Love is all that's left of that chapter. Another odd coincidence on the name, don't you agree? Your "great president" doesn't measure up to any real measure of greatness. It's amazing to me that you are celebrating when the propaganda machine is still cranking, still trying to pull in the vote necessary to push O back near the top. In case you weren't aware, that means your guy is behind. And not by a little. By a lot. So, let's look at the state of the election: Yes, polls have been coming out saying it's all neck and neck, a real barnstormer of a race. But we both know that isn't true at all, don't we. Obama's voters aren't showing up at the polls. And Romney's are. In huge numbers. Up by a tremendous amount from 2008. Before election day, even. You would do well to recall -- if you ever knew -- that Obama lost the election day vote. The only thing that saved him was early voting. Well, early voting has turned up a huge number of Romney supporters this time, and some 30% fewer for Obama. In the close states, it's really neck and neck. Advantage Romney. And Sandy cannot unwind those votes. And nobody is going to get juiced to go to the polls on election day on the basis that "wow, did you see how presidential he looked before he put on his Bush-like bomber jacket and took off for Las Vegas like he did after Benghazi"... No, if anything, that'll just encourage them that he's already in there, and they'll stay home. Besides, a lot of his voters can't find food, water or gasoline, despite hearing that Obama did a fly-over, a la W. Bush. But then, you wouldn't want them to vote in their current state of mind -- they might just vote for the other guy. The election, from my perspective, is really pretty much over, and I'm not sure what you'll be celebrating, but you should be celebrating the end of a disaster (I know I will), even if you weren't smart enough to realize that Obama's administration has been nothing short of an epic disaster. Like Sandy. And like Sandy, the worst parts won't show up until shortly after he's left the scene. In his Bush-like bomber jacket.</Msg><Username>flippant_1</Username><Timestamp>1351893215972</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 17:53:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351893232560-302</Id><Title>It will be a sad day for America if Romney wins !</Title><Msg>It will prove lying , cheating and money trump eveything .</Msg><Username>sirifuture</Username><Timestamp>1351893232560</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 17:53:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351893256961-303</Id><Title>i don't think this jeep comment from rommney</Title><Msg>gets obama and hillary off the hook for libya not even close but yet again there are some really weird people out there</Msg><Username>victory_val_2007</Username><Timestamp>1351893256961</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 17:54:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351893328792-304</Id><Title>Guess</Title><Msg>How many flips Mitt the has made in 2013 YTD..........................

According to the Public Policy Institute of California, our state is one of the only nine that does not enforce the federal government’s five year lifetime limit on cash welfare assistance. The monthly cash check is almost 70 percent higher than the national average.” The prevalence of welfare fraud is disheartening. ...... Besides the gross misuse of welfare benefits, recipients are not meeting their expected work requirements. Out of a sample of 310 welfare cases, only five individuals participated in activities that moved their family toward self-sufficiency, according to a California Department of Social Services’s study in March 2011. Only 60 of the 310 cases participated in countable work activities.</Msg><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1351899606574</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 19:40:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351899638313-356</Id><Topic><Title>If Obama wins the misery will continue</Title><Username>nasa_rs</Username><Timestamp>1351893419798</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 17:56:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Fact, our economy is growing slightly over 1%.

He predicted on CNBC: “I am still guessing that we will peak out at around 9 percent [unemployment] and that would be late this year.” He assured listeners that double-digit unemployment was “not the most likely event” and “Actually, we are already seeing some positive effects [from the Stimulus].” With unemployment peaking at 10.1 percent and still above 9 percent over two-and-a-half years after he predicted it would peak, Krugman was wrong on both counts. Krugman’s predictions were also filled with personal attacks against those with whom he disagreed. In March 2009, when Greg Mankiw, the chair of George W. Bush’s Council of Economic Advisers, and some conservative economists questioned what they called Obama’s “overly optimistic” growth predictions, Paul Krugman questioned their honesty. In a New York Times blog post titled the “Roots of Evil,” Krugman attacked Mankiw as “more than a bit of deliberate obtuseness” and that “we can expect fast growth.” Yet, our economic growth has not even come close to what Obama and Krugman predicted. It has also been much slower than past economic recoveries. This last year Obama predicted that GDP would grow at 4 percent, while in fact it was less than half of that -- just 1.7 percent. Mankiw challenged Krugman to a bet over whether the Obama prediction was right, but, despite all Krugman’s abusive rhetoric, he never responded. Krugman must be glad that he never bet his money to back up his claims of “evil” or “deliberate” misinformation, but he never tempered his rhetoric. Amazingly, despite his track record against conservatives, Krugman didn’t flinch in late 2010 when he claimed: “It’s also worth pointing out that everything the right said about why Obamanomics would fail was wrong.” Krugman’s predictions were no more accurate for other countries. He criticized the reduction in German government spending in June 2010 as a “huge mistake,” and said: “budget cuts will hurt your economy and reduce revenues [by reducing economic growth].”Yet, more than a year later, Germany’s unemployment rate continued falling, dropping by 0.7 percentage points between June 2010 and August 2011. And as of June 2011, German GDP during 2011 grew at 3 percent, almost twice as fast as our own GDP growth. Germany accomplished the lower unemployment and higher growth rates without burdening its children with the massively higher debt that Obama and Krugman advocated. But you get some idea why Krugman predictions have so been consistently wrong by understanding that he just thinks government spending is free. He also thought that the 9/11 attacks “could even do some economic good” by stimulating the economy because “all of a sudden, we need some new office buildings” and “rebuilding will generate at least some increase in business spending.” Let’s the buildings and spend the money on something else. Digging ditches and filling them in again leaves people no better off. Krugman has a different view: “If we discovered that space aliens were planning to attack and we needed a massive buildup to counter the space alien threat and really inflation and budget deficits took secondary place to that, this slump would be over in 18 months. And then if we discovered, oops, we made a mistake, there aren’t any aliens, we’d be better off.” The federal government’s publicly held debt has almost doubled in just over three years. How many more rosy predictions coming from Paul Krugman can we afford?</Msg><Username>flippant_1</Username><Timestamp>1351900307373</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 19:51:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351900471115-363</Id><Title>I will commit suicide IF Obama wins again</Title><Msg>READ MY LIPS !</Msg><Username>kingofvietnam</Username><Timestamp>1351900471115</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 19:54:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351900490243-364</Id><Title>MOST OBAMA VOTERS ARE VOYING ON SKIN COLOR</Title><Msg>THEY ARE RACISTS</Msg><Username>bury_obama</Username><Timestamp>1351900490243</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 19:54:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351900541380-365</Id><Title>MOST OBAMA VOTERS ARE VOTING ON SKIN COLOR</Title><Msg>THEY ARE MOSTLY RACISTS</Msg><Username>bury_obama</Username><Timestamp>1351900541380</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 19:55:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351900582136-366</Id><Topic><Title>I will commit suicide IF Obama wins again</Title><Username>kingofvietnam</Username><Timestamp>1351900471115</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 19:54:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>NOT WORTH IT</Msg><Username>bury_obama</Username><Timestamp>1351900582136</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 19:56:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351900704021-367</Id><Topic><Title>Mitt Romney is a practicing polygamist.

The only thing Romney's gonna gain from doing what he pledges is a population who could care less about him and who focus intently on being independent. Obama's motivation always puts himself at the center, as the head of state. He's putting government front and center as the be-all end-all of human existence. He can't see you functioning without him, and I am convinced he doesn't want you functioning without him, and he may not let you function with (or without) him. It's not about lies, Reggie. If it were, you'd never even mention O's name. It's about the motivation. And O's motivation is as pure as Stalin's love for his enemies. R gets nothing from the deal if he wins and fixes it all. You think the press will ever give him credit, even if he does fix it? Heck no. So he's gonna lose personally, either way. Can't get hurt financially. A guy who's got a few hundred mil tucked away isn't worried about his taxes, I can tell you right now. It's just not motivating and it isn't plausible. He's worried about either his legacy or his constituency, which includes his progeny. O, on the other hand, is out to prove something else entirely. You don't go down the road he's riding without a serious intent to inflict some change, and it's not the kind of change that spreads joy and peace and happiness. It spreads misery by lopping off the right side of the bell and shifting everything left. Only you can't ever get rid of the right tail -- it's always gonna exist. So the poor get poorer, the middle class get poorer, and the wealthy get poorer but are still wealthy. And everyone suffers from envy disorders. Case in point: Mayor of Bridgeport stirs up his folks, talks about the well-off are getting their power restored faster than us, and we're bigger customers and should come first. When United Illuminated shows up in Bridgeport, the locals throw eggs and rocks and stuff at 'em. They leave, without restoring power. They come back later, but the mayor had to provide police escorts for all of the workers. What good came from inciting the class envy riots? It resulted in longer delays to restore power, it pulled cops off serious anti-looting duty, it spread misery to the utility workers, and it gained zero benefit for the participants. That's what Obama does. Why does that make you happy, again?</Msg><Username>flippant_1</Username><Timestamp>1351903415862</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 20:43:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351903691954-407</Id><Topic><Title>The Final Days, the Biggest Issue, and the Clearest Choice!</Title><Username>giovannijay</Username><Timestamp>1351654714321</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 23:38:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well, that settles it then.

But I sold this week because the PEG ratio is very high compared to other financials right now and there are still issues ahead. I remain bullish long term for BAC but I believe a pull-back will be coming. Then I'll buy back in. I have no crystal ball, so I'll accept the outcome of my own decision. I base my decisions on facts and analysis. I hope voters do the same. And I sincerely hope this seizure of the BAC board by political mudslingers returns to rational discussions about our hopes for BAC. But while we're mixing politics with banking, it is interesting that BAC made a sizable campaign contribution to one of our candidates. So to try to inspire fact-checking, I'll let those who care about truth investigate it for themselves to find out which candidate BAC is backing. We must learn that facts trump wild mudslinging.</Msg><Username>derek.nsai</Username><Timestamp>1351906990919</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 21:43:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351907098511-435</Id><Topic><Title>Mitt Romney is a practicing polygamist.

Sources within Hamas previously disclosed to WND the June 2009 meeting. The gathering allegedly took place in Geneva with two Hamas leaders, Bassem Naim and Mahmoud al-Zahar. Naim is Hamas’ health minister, while al-Zahar is one of the main Hamas leaders in Gaza. Pickering is further tied to the revolutions in the Middle East and North Africa through his role as a member of the small board of the International Crisis Group, or ICG, one of the main proponents of the international “Responsibility to Protect” doctrine. The doctrine is the very military protocol used to justify the NATO bombing campaign that brought down Moammar Ghadafi’s regime in Libya. Gareth Evans, president emeritus of the ICG, is the founder and co-author of the doctrine. Billionaire activist George Soros is on the ICG’s executive board. Soros’ Open Society Institute is also one of only three nongovernmental funders of the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect, the group that devised the doctrine. The ICG itself has long petitioned for talks with Hamas as well as normalized relations with the Muslim Brotherhood, for years urging the Egyptian government to allow the Brotherhood to establish an Islamist political party, as WND previously reported. The crisis group has petitioned for the Algerian government to cease “excessive” military activities against al-Qaida-linked groups and to allow organizations seeking to create an Islamic state to participate in the Algerian government.</Msg><Username>obamistan</Username><Timestamp>1351910904138</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 22:48:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351911120401-452</Id><Topic><Title>I will commit suicide IF Obama wins again</Title><Username>kingofvietnam</Username><Timestamp>1351900471115</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 19:54:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good thing Romney will win</Msg><Username>nycxkavman</Username><Timestamp>1351911120401</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 22:52:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351911398046-453</Id><Topic><Title>I will commit suicide IF Obama wins again</Title><Username>kingofvietnam</Username><Timestamp>1351900471115</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 19:54:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>DUDE I WILL GLADLY HELP YOU, FREAKING DOUCHBAG</Msg><Username>farawaylife</Username><Timestamp>1351911398046</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 22:56:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351911471284-454</Id><Title>Big volume of BAC TARP Jan 2019 leaps traded today</Title><Msg>The 90 day average volume is about 350,000 shares, but today it was 940,000.

Their careers in social services are about as far away from my own interests and abilities and background as they could possible be. I'm a tech geek, and I got what knowledge and skills by doing, not by taking courses. I was born in hillybillyville, western Pennsylvania; served as an enlisted grunt in the Air Force during the Vietnam era; and in addition to a pair of careers as a test engineer and author, I've owned and operated a small auto detailing business, sold motorcycles on commission, painted houses for a living, and taught fishing to children at a nearby day camp. It's quite a stretch to turn a resume like mine into some sort of elitist pedigree or socialist philosophy. Now that I've chased most of the straw dogs out of your monologue, I'll address what remains. Capitalism is indeed what built America, but there are many flavors of capitalism, and history is rife with examples of how bad some kinds of capitalism taste to the average citizen. Unrestrained and unregulated capitalism produced vast fortunes for a select few who financed and owned the whaling industry, the China Trade, and the railroad and coal and oil and steel industries; but their workers were treated and paid little better than indentured servants or slaves. That kind of capitalism, with its attendant speculation, boom-and-bust cycles, and reward for cutthroat competition and monopoly, bore fruit that included the near-extermination of the Indians and too many species of wildlife to list; slavery; the Panics of 1873 and 1907 (the later a currency crises manufactured by a few wealthy bankers to advance their goal of established a privatized central banking system they could control, the Federal Reserve), the euphemistically labeled "Golden Age", and the Great Depression. On the other hand, some capitalists recognized that a strong and sustainable economy is not possible unless wealth and opportunities are distributed among the larger population rather than being amassed by an elite and privileged few. If wealth is distributed more equitably in the first place, there is no need to 're-distribute' it. Henry Ford got that; do you think a guy with a heart as wizened as Mr. Burns' decided to pay his workers more than the prevailing wages because he felt sorry for them? He saw the "big picture", and so do I. You can't build a stable and sustainable economy if only a select few have enough chips to participate in it, and lacking a stable and sustainable economy, what hope can there be for the country that depends upon it? The economic crisis we face is that people are no longer viewed as assets, but as liabilities, commodities whose value is dropping fast as the need for human labor is displaced by the increasing reliance of business upon computers and machines. I was among the first people I know who pointed at the emerging "service economy" and recognized it as the harbinger of death for the American middle class, so you can skip the lecture about not seeing the big picture. You've given quite a lesson, 'drawn', quite unintentionally I'm sure, about the perils of generalizing, but I'm going to leave you with a generalization that made quite an impression on me, and one that I've found useful in understanding what drives the differences in policies and philosophies of the Republican and Democratic parties and their followers. When I was about 12, I already had a vague sense that the Democrats were the Good Guys, and the Republicans were the Bad Guys, but I understood next to nothing about politics or philosophy, and certainly couldn't explain why I felt the way I did. One day I was listening to my grandfather discussing Truman's upset victory over Tom Dewey with one of his friends. I screwed up my nerve, interrupted two grown-ups, and addressing my grandfather by his first name as was my habit, I asked him: "Tom, what's the difference between Republicans and Democrats?" He thought about it for a minute, and then gave this answer: "Well, kid, Democrats don't think they're any better than anyone else." ROTFLMAO his answer, and its implied but unstated corollary, are just as true today as they were then. Labels like 'socialist' and 'fascist' are just fig leaves used to hide this ugly but undeniable truth.</Msg><Username>fish2kill</Username><Timestamp>1351912007495</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 23:06:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351912213780-457</Id><Title>ROMNEY SHOW YOUR TAX RETURN, WHAT ARE YOU HIDING MISTER</Title><Msg>After Nov 6th you can go back and take of companies and leverage them with debt and transfer parts of it to China like you did in the past.
