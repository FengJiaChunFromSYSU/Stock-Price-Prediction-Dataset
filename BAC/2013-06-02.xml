April jobs higher than expected. May report out in a week. Consumer confidence at an all time high. Unemployment lowest in 5 years. Number of hours worked increasing every month. Housing market picking up. Companies setting on mountains of cash. And the fear is... the fed will stop providing low cost money for bankers and investors because the economy is in recovery. We have side by side economic experiments here and in Europe. Austerity in Europe has led to prolonged recession while stimulus here has led to steady recovery. Traders care less about whether a company is doing a good job. The only criteria is what is the short term return. An investor places money with a company to see it grow and prosper. Because stock prices always fall faster than they rise shorting makes fast attractive money for those who care nothing about the consequences to the company. When trades cost $100 and the uptick was 12.5 cents and there were not computers trading faster than humanly possible there was more incentive to be an investor.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1370146664559</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-02 00:17:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370150244764-3</Id><Title>The decline in Tea Bag Party membership doesn't faze losers like zevoter.</Title><Msg>zevoter and his klan have a heritage of lost causes.

Given this clown's need for publicity he may very well do just that. However, if the Judge so stipulates "with prejudice" on ruling it's over for good. At least on this "causation". Hope this helps some.

Obama doesn’t know how to be president. He doesn’t know how the world works. He’s incompetent. He’s an amateur!” Bill Clinton went ballistic and threatened retaliation. Obama backed down. He called his favorite journalist, Steve Kroft of “60 Minutes,” and offered an unprecedented “farewell interview” with departing Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The result was a slobbering televised love-in — and an embarrassment to all concerned.</Msg><Username>barack_crock</Username><Timestamp>1370188755685</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-02 11:59:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370188878003-42</Id><Topic><Title>Jeb Bush cant lose if he runs.

Obuma knew this, played it, and it worked. He won in ALL those states. Romney WON in ALL other states. These facts are available at the NEC. BTW: One of the (minority) election JUDGES is being sentenced for voter fraud in , yup , OHIO. Been on TV, so check it out. She voted 6times in last election, some votes were from dead relatives. No wonder Obuma won. He knew this would happen. Now there is another demoCrap, a U.S. Congressman named D. Garcia of Miami, FL. He's been arrested, but released for voter fraud as well. Seems he had an aide gather voter ballots for all the dead people and vote for Obuma. Maybe hundreds, or more. More to come. This too is on the REAL news.

There you will find how many times Obuma never showed up for class,relied on race to get him thru to each payday. He was more interested in his job as a"community organizer" for ACORN. A professor there confronted him and the response was something similar to ,"pays better". Hmmmm, that job was supposed to be pro bono, and not pay. Upon leaving the U.S Senate job that Blagovich got for him, Obuma had 5.5 MILLION in his personal bank account!!! ACORN budget was 4.9 BILLION!! Obuma was in charge of the funds. Dems covered for this unethical clown like never in history. Oh yes, Valerie Jarrett was with him at the time, like now. She IS no doubt going to brought to the forefront on IRS, Benghazi, AP, HHS, and more.

Best way to make your internet work again so you can bad mouth Obama again is go to "Accessories" then "System Tools" then "Internet Explorer (No Add-Ons) and then after that just disable ALL the add-ons. Trust me you might not be able to watch the poor girls live but your computer will be much safer from an Obama cyber attack.

CWC is pretty much buried and dismembered within BAC now. But it appears the drag on BAC by CWC is abating. In January they settled with FNMA with cash and put backs and in April they settled in three class action suits related to CWC. Meanwhile, mortgage banking income for Q1 was $1.26 billion. That was downYOY because of a smaller mortgage portfolio and lower production, but still profitabie. All in all, the mortgage biz is improving along with the recovery in the housing market.</Msg><Username>jhitcher2011</Username><Timestamp>1370216769860</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-02 19:46:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370217242356-114</Id><Topic><Title>Reality Check: The Tea Bagger menace is nothing but an insignificant nuisance</Title><Username>mr.whizzard</Username><Timestamp>1370201040237</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-02 15:24:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Anger is the sign of a loser and your really angry !</Msg><Username>sirifuture</Username><Timestamp>1370217242356</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-02 19:54:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370217624569-115</Id><Topic><Title>country wide credit</Title><Username>lknapp08</Username><Timestamp>1370207142824</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-02 17:05:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well, don't assume that is the end of the story, you remember accounting gimmicks etc?

The affidavit described Rosen as potentially being an "aider and abettor and/or co-conspirator" to the crime of disclosing government secrets, opening up criticism that the Obama administration was targeting Rosen. However, the Justice Department did not prosecute Rosen, nor did it file charges against him. While he was listed as a "co-conspirator," that often times does not mean he would be considered a target. The Justice Department official on Thursday said that prosecutors have never sought to bring criminal charges against Rosen, meaning Holder's testimony was accurate. "The search warrant application in the Kim matter was focused on obtaining evidence relating to allegations that a government official had leaked highly classified information, which was a threat to our national security," the Justice official wrote. "The warrant application was drafted during the investigation phase of the case, which came before any decisions about prosecution. And nearly three years after completing our thorough investigation of the Kim matter, the Department does not anticipate bringing any additional charges. During the Attorney General's tenure, no reporter has ever been prosecuted."</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1370225471092</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-02 22:11:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370225496501-150</Id><Topic><Title>Back to the markets.

Junk bonds and derivatives just create a false paper economy that allows the easy transfer of paper at higher and higher prices. The real worth of an economy are the goods and services it produces. That comes from labor. When no labor is involved the values are only abstract and as fleeting as tulip bulbs. The better you provide jobs so all can be productive the better off we all become.
