I have never demanded or proposed a free lunch! Get the profit centers out of the healthcare industry, ie bonus checks to the insurance executives, not for inovation and productivity but just because they have been able in the past 50 years to pass yearly premium increases onto companies or the companies employees. That model is now broken! I could run a very profitable insurance company if I could exclude everyone who might use my services and just collect the premiums! Everyone insured and everyone paying a premium proportional to their income and for God sake, get Wall street greed out of this industry!</Msg><Username>andym_30054</Username><Timestamp>1357996472621</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 08:14:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357996528163-8</Id><Title>The Americans With No Abilities Act</Title><Msg>The Americans With No Abilities Act President Barack Obama and the Democratic Senate are considering sweeping legislation that will provide new benefits for many Americans. The Americans With No Abilities Act is being hailed as a major legislative goal by advocates of the millions of Americans who lack any real skills or ambition. "Roughly 50 percent of Americans do not possess the competence and drive necessary to carve out a meaningful role for themselves in society," said California Sen. Barbara Boxer. "We can no longer stand by and allow People of Inability (POI) to be ridiculed and passed over. With this legislation, employers will no longer be able to grant special favors to a small group of workers, simply because they have some idea of what they are doing." In a Capitol Hill press conference, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid pointed to the success of the U.S. Postal Service, which has a long-standing policy of providing opportunity without regard to performance. At the state government level, the Department of Motor Vehicles also has an excellent record of hiring Persons with No Ability (63 percent). Under the Americans With No Abilities Act, more than 25 million mid-level positions will be created, with important-sounding titles but little real responsibility, thus providing an illusory sense of purpose and performance. Mandatory non-performance-based raises and promotions will be given to guarantee upward mobility for even the most unremarkable employees. The legislation provides substantial tax breaks to corporations that promote a significant number of Persons of Inability (POI) into middle-management positions, and give a tax credit to small and medium-sized businesses that agree to hire one clueless worker for every two talented hires. Finally, the Americans With No Abilities Act contains tough new measures to make it more difficult to discriminate against the non-abled, banning, for example, discriminatory interview questions such as, "Do you have any skills or experience that relate to this job?" "As a non-abled person, I can't be expected to keep up with people who have something going for them," said Mary Lou Gertz, who lost her position as a lug-nut twister at the GM plant in Flint, Mich., due to her inability to remember righty tighty, lefty loosey. "This new law should be real good for people like me. I finally have job security." With the passage of this bill, Gertz and millions of other untalented citizens will finally see a light at the end of the tunnel. Said Sen. #$%$ Durbin: "As a senator with no abilities, I believe the same privileges that elected officials enjoy ought to be extended to every American with no abilities. It is our duty as lawmakers to provide each and every American citizen, regardless of his or her inadequacy, with some sort of space to take up in this great nation and a good salary for doing so."</Msg><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1357996528163</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 08:15:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357996776035-9</Id><Title>WE ALREADY HAVE THOUSANDS OF GUN LAWS THAT AREN'T STRICLY ENFORCED WHY DO WE NEED MORE?</Title><Msg>WE DON'T!</Msg><Username>barack_crock</Username><Timestamp>1357996776035</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 08:19:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357998108478-10</Id><Topic><Title>Is BAC worth dropping a boatload in?</Title><Username>oildean</Username><Timestamp>1357952099279</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 19:54:59 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If you think wading through these BS posts trying to find valuable information is tough, try chewing your way through BAC's annual report and 10K filings.

How could this be? Can this be attributed to demographics and the propensity of an aging demographic to save more and/or spend less? This demographic is most likely a saturated consumer (own everything they think they need). The United States is in the same situation. It is completely conceivable that interest rates could remain low for decades. Given the above suggested interest rate phenomena, do rates then become decoupled from inflation. Under this scenario, broad deflation would be a preferred option over inflation. This assumes there is a cash hoard being held by the aged demographic. Deflation would most likely give the aged demographic an incentive to spend on things they normally would not consider. The increased spending would most likely benefit the service sector. Imagine the benefits to the Social Security and the Medicare programs if deflation occurred. I am think of shorting U.S. Treasuries and this provokes thoughts into event possibilities.</Msg><Username>fourmilehill</Username><Timestamp>1358013514478</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 12:58:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358014641667-41</Id><Title>Survey results</Title><Msg>Shows that of the Teapublican base: 1. 30% have been married more than three times 2. 12% are gay, but are in the closet 3. 9% have been discharged from the millitary with a less than honorable discharge 4. 86% have a high school education,, 1% have a college degree and the remainder have an avg. of a 8th grade education 5. 44% receive goverment aid 6. 99% own guns, but only 40% have bullets 7. 60% own cars not made by a an American Car Co. 8. 100% buy non-american made products 9. 76% read at a 4th grade level 10. 2% have read a book 11. 99% report that they receive all of their political knowledge from Fox News 12. .01% have actually researched a political statement received via e-mail to determine if it was true 13. 99% can not define the word socialist correctly 14. 12% have been arrested and convicted of a crime 15. 33% have family members that belong to a White Power group 16. 7% are married to or have had a affair with a realitive. 17. 36% were fired from their last job 18. 42% advised that winning the loto was their retirement plan 19. 32% advised they usually attend church with a hangover 20. 97% think Big Foot is real , UFO's are a goverment coverup, and that wearing tin foil on you head keeps the goverment from spying on them.</Msg><Username>carolyne47</Username><Timestamp>1358014641667</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 13:17:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358015196615-42</Id><Topic><Title>CA shooter, seeks justice for insensitive comments well libs? deterant to being called a non-trump?</Title><Username>ekonprophet</Username><Timestamp>1357911718708</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 08:41:58 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Another Bush to run in Texas.

It is still up to Congress to determine how the bills will be paid for the spending they demanded.</Msg><Username>impossible2no</Username><Timestamp>1358038921296</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 20:02:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358039171101-68</Id><Title>BAC is in the Cat-Bird seat !!!</Title><Msg>By selling 1/4 of their MSR business BAC will increase their Basel 3 capital ratio from 9% to 9!/2 + % which will free them up to increase their puny .01 dividend payout.

But the purpose in raising the debt ceiling is to borrow more money. Historically, Congress has either raised the debt ceiling or approved specific debt issuances. Usurping that function from Congress by executive fiat is a terrible precedent and violates the spiri of the Constitution.</Msg><Username>jhitcher2011</Username><Timestamp>1358040145783</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 20:22:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358041781042-70</Id><Topic><Title>Obama considering raising the debt limit by executive order, bypassing Congress</Title><Username>ysidfso</Username><Timestamp>1358035849680</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 19:10:49 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>so typical of zevoter...he said he was going to take a day off....that just means more chili dogs.....crack a window and don't light a match!

I am wondering if that's correct as the following announcement had given us some numbers to start with: Settlement with Fanni collectively are anticipated to lessen BofA’s pre-tax income by about $2.7 billion in Q4 of 2012. In addition, BofA expects its Q4 2012 financial results to be negatively impacted by approximately $2.5 billion (pretax) for the independent foreclosure reviews, litigation (primarily mortgage-related), and other mortgage-related matters. Results for the fourth quarter of 2012 are also expected to include approximately $700 million of pretax negative debit valuation adjustments (DVA) and fair value option (FVO) adjustments related to the continued improvement in the company's credit spreads. Furthermore, results are also expected to be positively impacted by a benefit of $1.3 billion, primarily related to an income tax benefit from the recognition of foreign tax credits made available from the restructuring of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries. Now let's start with the simple calculation: Q4 result will be negatively impacted by 2.7B+ 2.5B + 0.7B -1.3B= 4.6B which should be almost 41 C per share. If BofA can still get a "modestly positive" with such deduction , earning should be around 42~45C which blow away the 20~23C estimation.</Msg><Username>tanishuma</Username><Timestamp>1358049859673</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 23:04:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358049966530-80</Id><Topic><Title>who was the sucker to sell BAC shares last week? i guess few of them, they will regret it in the next 2 weeks</Title><Username>stevens1958</Username><Timestamp>1358048494158</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 22:41:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I always like your optimism however I am wondering if you can give us a bit justification in terms of the forward P/E and the potential earning powers.
