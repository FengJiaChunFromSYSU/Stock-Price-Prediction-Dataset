"We can confirm a peaceful group of nice, young Afgans who were protesting an anti-Muslim film were joined by insurgents, including multiple suicide bombers, attacked Jalalabad Airfield this morning. None of the attackers succeeded in breaching the perimeter," Susan Rice, a spokesman for the Obama Socialist coalition said on TV this morning. She said that the fighting had ended by mid-morning and that reports showing this to be a "boogie man" attack (editor's note. Members of the coalition are not allowed to use the word terrorist for fear of alienating our beautiful Muslim friends. Praise Allah.) are simply not true.</Msg><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1354455184233</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-02 08:33:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354455531758-7</Id><Topic><Title>Where's SW's (Sodomite's Wetdream) Attempt at a Coherent Synopsis???</Title><Username>sphincterisms_and_witless.isms</Username><Timestamp>1353770843300</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-24 10:27:23 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>SW, a.k.a.

The house of Rep. , dur to the recent infusion of right wing nuts has established its self as the ongoing roadblock to any progress. Their radical "my way or the highway" stance inpeeds all progress. It was this group that created the current situation and even Bonehead , the majority leader can not get them to compermise. By bringing the case to the American people, the president is [1] attempting to bring pressure on republican members of the house to, for once, act like grown men and reach a compermise solution. [2] When the radical idiots once again hurt all Americans, the president is ensureing that the blame will be properly placed ensureing a Democratic victory in the next congressional elections. The Republicans are set-up to continue to lose power due to the major error of allowing the radical nuts to capture their party and must now pay for that error. The next move, if the nuts do not shut up and reach a compermise will be to introduce a bill to reduce the tax rate on the middle class thus placeing the nut cases in the fix of voteing to rasie taxs , breaking their so called pledge. In other words the Republican Party is now in a box they can not escape from, they sold their soul to the radical nut cases , thinking it would win them the recent election and now they find that this error has and will continue to result in ongoing loses.</Msg><Username>carolyne47</Username><Timestamp>1354464291029</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-02 11:04:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354464403283-20</Id><Topic><Title>★★★★★ Welcome to SODOM and GOMORRAH ★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★...</Title><Username>ollienorth777</Username><Timestamp>1354362589996</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-01 06:49:49 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes I agree the Republican party and it nuts case core is the party of Doom Vs the party of hope....... and the majority of Americans agree.</Msg><Username>carolyne47</Username><Timestamp>1354464403283</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-02 11:06:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354464491977-21</Id><Topic><Title>Obamacrats just don't get it ......</Title><Username>dumpobamie</Username><Timestamp>1354410083319</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-01 20:01:23 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Your an excellent Right wing nut case in that you NEVER let the truth stand in the was of spouting your lies</Msg><Username>carolyne47</Username><Timestamp>1354464491977</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-02 11:08:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354464762625-22</Id><Title>Breaking News</Title><Msg>Recently study shows that NO right wing nut cases left the country despite their announced intention to do so if Obama was elected.

Yes dealing with “fiscal cliff” but also matters such as infrastructure. He calls any changes to social security as “off the table” re the fiscal cliff, to be considered separately and later.. the secy considers going over the fiscal cliff very damaging to the economy and awaits the GOP counteroffer. Apparently the senate minority leader made some kind of offer yesterday, but offers should not be via media programs, etc. GOP has nothing on the table, feels Steve Rattner, of car bailout, etc, a few years ago. John Boehner does claim “you will not get the economy growing by taxing the rich more”. M C Roberts, present though co-regular g f will was not, “knows” the 98 per cent “know’ taxes will not go up; Rattner “knows’ medicare needs attention to benefit monitor Geo Stephanopoulos’ generation and subsequent ones, and attention does mean adjustment in costs, and benefits. Brief mention of Susan rice and Behghazi—several GOP senators are not pleased by her words with them; however Rattner feels blaming her for her testimony on Sunday talk programs is unfair to her as she spoke information she was given. Praise for the big city policemen who bought boots for a homeless, barefooted man. Some other examples of concern for the poor—GOP responses showing that concern were presented. Sponsors—heavy dose of natural gas usage arguments, the usual BP, one affluent car ad, Pacific Life, a life insurance pressure group, and United Health Care, 78 thousand helping 77 million… And two members of USA military made ultimate sacrifice in Afghanistan, one age 32 from Calif, one mid-20s from the Garden state, Oh, among roundtable persons, a clear liberal representative from Minn.

So not enough was pay in or too much is being paid out and that portion is unearned. But there are many unpaid for government sponsored programs that don't returned the assumed value. I know the democrats always say well that billion or million is not going to make a difference but when you couple thousands of those programs together they certainly do make a difference. I have to live on a budget and I know it is all those little unaccounted for expenses here and there that kill you. Just look at the massive expanding debt of the USA for gawd sake!

If we are to live in anarchy or go back to a being cave men your message would have some relevance. In modern society people specialize and often have talents that would be useless in your scenario of government collapse but are necessary for civilization. One of the attributes of civilization is that the weak are cared for and not left to die in the streets. How we do this as a society is a test of our humanity and an indication of charity. Recognition that a change of circumstance might place any one of us in that state of need usually provokes empathy rather than hostility. Your assumption that vast segments of society choose to be on the dole is not shared by most and the basis for disagreement. How we get those who are dependent back in to productive employment is the question all societies struggle with. As we now have longer life spans how do we incorporate the aged more productively in the work force? As manual labor is replaced by mechanization how do we provide meaningful labor for the less skilled? How do you provide dignity to those who do manual labor if you do not financially reward them adequately? How do you improve the education of society if some elements of society can not afford to go to school? How do you maintain the opportunity for advancement when most material wealth is held in the hands of a few determined to maintain their position of superiority? Just what are you considering unearned entitlements? Certainly not social security and medicare. When you look at the real dole programs like food stamps, medicaid or aid to dependent children how big of a burden do you really think those expenses are to our overall spending? Perhaps it is FEMA you feel is wasting your tax dollar. Most of these programs are nothing more than the community coming together to help a member during a time of need. Much like in the farming communities I grew up in coming over to plow a neighbors land when the family was incapacitated for some reason or bringing food over to feed a family after a funeral. These are principles of our society brought forward to the foundation of our institutions and fully in agreement with the ideal and morality most of us grew up with.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1354470372173</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-02 12:46:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354470536174-36</Id><Topic><Title>THE RIGHT WING OFFERS TRUE FREEDOM &amp; INDEPENDENCE THROUGH SELF RELIANCE &amp; OPPORTUNITY</Title><Username>america_divided_by_obama</Username><Timestamp>1354465745543</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-02 11:29:05 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No different than being a wage slave shackled to elite masters.</Msg><Username>highlowsel</Username><Timestamp>1354470536174</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-02 12:48:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354470935568-37</Id><Topic><Title>THE RIGHT WING OFFERS TRUE FREEDOM &amp; INDEPENDENCE THROUGH SELF RELIANCE &amp; OPPORTUNITY</Title><Username>america_divided_by_obama</Username><Timestamp>1354465745543</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-02 11:29:05 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I've never allowed myself to be that so I wouldn't know.</Msg><Username>whitest_white</Username><Timestamp>1354470935568</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-02 12:55:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354470939153-38</Id><Topic><Title>Does the din of yelps and yaps from the right wing jackals soothe their depraved existence?</Title><Username>f.dollarhyde</Username><Timestamp>1354412633631</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-01 20:43:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Think of the pain they suffer.

As our life span has increased how do we provide work for these healthy seniors or care for those that are not? In an age of mechanization how do we provide labor for the less skilled? How do we provide the young with the education they will need in a fast changing technical economy? How do we provide dignity for a manual labor force if we do not adequately reward it financially?

And it highlights a relatively unknown, long-range campaign by Republicans conducted over many years (since Reagan at least): what's know as Starve the Beast. Anyone who is not fully aware of this Republican, ideology-driven plan, which to me is obviously subversive but to any reasonable person can only be described as 'under the table', cannot be taken seriously in any political discussion of DEmocrats vs REpublicans. "The Republicans' plan in recent years, White says, has been to "starve the beast": force Congress to cut government spending by keeping taxes low and creating huge budget deficits. The budget deficits have materialized, but the spending cuts haven't--because Americans like the benefits they get from government spending." This Republican "Starve the Beast" campaign has never had anything to do with deficits created by government spending on social programs like SS and Medicare, as it started when those costs were not a problem at all. Instead, it is a vicious, long-term, ideology-driven sabotage of those social programs, which primarily exist to benefit the common man, that uses recessions and bubble crashes as sly and self-serving justifications to scream for massive cuts (abolishment is what they really want, as we all know, don't we, but they are too devious to admit that) . So these massive deficits, mostly caused by unfunded wars and exhorbitant tax cuts (mostly to the wealthy) are EXACTLY WHAT REPUBLICANS WANT...in order to SCREAM THE SKY IS FALLING and WE MUST CUT,CUT,CUT and/or ABOLISH ANY AND ALL SOCIAL PROGRAMS, NOW NOW NOW!

Libertarian views in both social and economic dialog have much to offer for smaller government and present logical rather than emotional arguments. Usually based in sound economics they have a lot more value than the false arguments of the trickle down supporters. While I can't subscribe to pure libertarianism any more than I could to pure socialism, the two arguments present a basis for good compromise and have defined logical basis. Traditionally our nation has gone back and forth between these two extremes tempered by regional and religious arguments as side bars until the GOP got fascinated with voodoo economics and the idea they could get more revenue from lower taxes and took the idea to extremes never envisioned by rational economists. Thirty years of those policies and borrowing put lots of money in the hands of the rich but left the government bankrupt. Neocons preoccupied with the concept that we were the worlds only remaining superpower and should exercise that position for world dominance controlled the GOP until 2010.. Neocons still wield power in the GOP but it is waning. Industrial giants of the military industrial complex and the small government libertarians will fight it out for what remains of the republican party. As long as the neocons can keep the tea party convinced that a big military is OK in a small government they can survive. If the libertarian arm gains power then the big military has to downsize along with all the industry it supports. The religious extremist groups will continue to be on the outside and just used for support in national elections.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1354481099637</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-02 15:44:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354481164585-85</Id><Topic><Title>MY THOUGHTS ON THE FISCAL CLIFF....</Title><Username>parisonr</Username><Timestamp>1354393997121</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-01 15:33:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I agree, Mr. Obama should stop holding the middle class hostage to his overweening need to attack the rich.

Because they do not want to be in the position of the employed, indeed their very own employed. In other words, the 1% dont aspire and attain that level for such foolish notions as altuism, or civic responsibility, as you naively imply. Most do it for the lure or increase of wealth, or prestige. Often we see people driven to create, the Bill Gates-types, who would probably start businesses simply because they know they can do it better. Being a business owner is a privilege that should be appreciated to our society, not a 'revered' social class to which tributes and adulation is expected.</Msg><Username>tinkers_curse</Username><Timestamp>1354492145379</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-02 18:49:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354492246143-146</Id><Topic><Title>OBAMA'S POLICIES AGAINST BUSINESS AND ENERGY PRODUCTION CREATED THE SO CALLED GREAT RECESSION</Title><Username>america_divided_by_obama</Username><Timestamp>1354482379240</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-02 16:06:19 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No truer words were ever spoke</Msg><Username>failure_in_chief</Username><Timestamp>1354492246143</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-02 18:50:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354492499107-147</Id><Topic><Title>The 1 % need the guilotine</Title><Username>severlohhein</Username><Timestamp>1354132653868</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 14:57:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nice!

The difference is Bush managed the crisis and he handled the job. Obama hasn't. BTW, the only war we are not able to win is the one the Democrats were in favor of. Afghanistan! Another dose of reality, the Clinton surplus the liberals brag about came from that improperly managed tech bubble, that was allowed to careen out control. Combined with off the books borrowing from Social Security, and the neglect and failure to make appropriate expenditures to counter the increasing incidents of terror perpetrated by Al-Qaeda around the world. In other words, it never really existed except on paper. And, how do you have a surplus while you are still running up the National Debt as Clinton was? Bush, upon entering office, immediately called for investigations into Fannie and Freddie that were held up in committee or filibustered at every turn by Democrats and a handful RINOs. Bush continued to call for and urge congress to investigate these GSE’s throughout his entire presidency. No action was taken. Those investigations had the potential to expose the whole mortgage back security scam before it became critical. Thank Barney Frank, Barack Obama and Chris Dodd for leading the opposition to those requested investigations. Bush never had a super majority in congress as Obama was privileged to have for two years, and wasted on the ideological legislation of Obamacare, rather than on fixing the economy. While Obama sat on his hands waiting for Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi to push though his health care nightmare, the economy continued to fall deeper and deeper into despair. Spending reeled out of control with government sinking it’s tentacles deep into the private sector arena with business choking regulations and bailouts for campaign donors of Obama. Had Obama put aside his ideological nonsense and focused on a private sector based recovery plan we would not still be in this dire recession. This is Obama's mess, in all this time as president he and his party still refuse to take responsibility, and he continues to blame everything under the sun but himself. Yet Democrats blame Bush for everything that transpired in his first nine months. Double standard idiocy! Obama is no leader! Obama is without one original cogent idea! Obama has damage hundreds of thousands of families beyond repair. He's just a sniveling whiner! And now he wants to sue the banks! What a feeble ideologically blinded mind this president has! The fact that the Clinton staff vandalized the White House and government computers and offices, and dumped and scrambled files, before leaving tells you the juvenile mind set of that administration. And Bill Clinton used the full power of the oval office and the presidency to pressure a young fat intern into being his human humidor at the expense of the entire country. A despicable self-absorbed old pervert by any measure. I have no respect for this man nor anyone who does.</Msg><Username>carburetorkid</Username><Timestamp>1354497550570</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-02 20:19:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354497706797-175</Id><Topic><Title>OBAMA'S POLICIES AGAINST BUSINESS AND ENERGY PRODUCTION CREATED THE SO CALLED GREAT RECESSION</Title><Username>america_divided_by_obama</Username><Timestamp>1354482379240</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-02 16:06:19 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>On federal lands we have the lowest production in history.

He is part of the rich. The overwhelming need is to provide revenue to finance the government to provide the services that the public wants. Those services have been provide for the last thirty years without being paid for. Now those of us that have profited by these low taxes on dividends, capital gains, lower brackets for the wealthy and income caps on social security and medicare taxes at the expense of the working stiff need to pay up. The tax system is totally out of whack and provides breaks for those who don't work and make money solely by flipping investments while it penalizes those who do the labor. Incomes for top management have gone form 15 times the average salary to 150 times the average salary. The gap between rich and poor has all but eliminated the middle class and wealth is more concentrated in a small group than ever in our nation. this does not produce a healthy economy and it is the responsibility of government to address the problems that create those conditions.

Caving in rather than sticking to your guns? Isn't there still 85 billion left for December's Fed stimulus? Operation Twist and MBS buying? Face it, it seems that whoever pushes stocks in the market has been doing the pain trade for too long now. I miss the fireworks that run these stocks up. They are saying Ms. Schapiro does not want to leave an "anti-investor" legacy and I say a huge number of small investors have been destroyed such as me financially by trying to get BAC stock and stock options to get back nicely toward 15 dollars. I wish that would be part of the proinvestor legacy. Individual stocks behaving with upward trend and stability is pro-investor to me. To see BAC back up above 15 dollars by somewhere in December 2012 would be the most wonderful Christmas present for me and my family. I wish so much for it.
