The intelligent &amp; patriotic voters rejected nazi propaganda</Title><Msg>After spending this week celebrating Obama's victory, I have also replayed several of the Goebbles-Fox News Nazi Propaganda archives. I have never laughed so hard as I re-watched so many of the professional liars at Goebbels-Fox spew their hate mongering, their out-right lies, their falsified statistics, and their laughable hidious insinuations, etc., etc. The Goebbels-Fox professional liars actually believed that by flooding the American voter public with their lunacy and fanaticism they could sway and buy the elections. Nice try, Karl Rove, i.e., but YOU FAILED. The liars were taken down. The majority of the intelligent and patriotic American voters dismissed the nazi propaganda, and voted for a progressive America. Kudos to the Democrats who constantly monitored the activity of the Republican lie machine and their never ending attempts at voter fraud, voter suppression, and voter obstruction. Almost every attempt by the Republicans to interfere with fair voting was challenged in the courts, and the courts on every level ruled in favor of Democrats. Justice and Democracy Prevailed.</Msg><Username>j.farragut</Username><Timestamp>1352697667520</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 00:21:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352698098753-2</Id><Topic><Title>★★★★★ Welcome to the Re-Election of President Obama ★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★</Title><Username>ebonics4gfy</Username><Timestamp>1352183530544</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-06 01:32:10 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A great day for America.

Of an estimated 1,464 victims officially recognized by the state of Louisiana, more than 500 names have not been publicly released. And Louisiana's once-ambitious efforts to tackle dozens of related cases of missing persons and unidentified bodies ran out of money in 2006 and has never been revived. "We didn't complete the mission," former Acting State Medical Examiner Dr. Lewis Cataldie, a Baton Rouge-based physician who once ran the state's efforts told the Chronicle this week. "I'm very angry about it." DNA, X-rays and other technology mean that identification remains possible years from now if additional remains get found or family members of the missing submit evidence that gets linked to the nameless. Yet no state or federal agency today keeps track of those who remain missing from Katrina — or have since been confirmed dead. There is no central place for scattered surviving families to call. In New Orleans, 31 unidentified victims' bodies were buried in a $1.5 million monument in 2008. None has been identified since then, officials from the New Orleans Coroner's Office said this week.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1352731028361</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 09:37:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352732249691-117</Id><Topic><Title>Warning</Title><Username>carolyne47</Username><Timestamp>1352684586883</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-11 20:43:06 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>and why are you on yahoo reposting this?

I certainly understand why people believe that this injustice is taking place right under their noses. Conservative media has told them repeatedly, and in no uncertain terms, that this is the trick being played on them by the privileged and powerful. It’s a great story – but it certainly is not the true story. Indeed, you may be surprised to learn that once the lion’s share of the ACA kicks in on January 1, 2014, not only are Members of Congress and their staff obligated to play by the same rules as the rest of us, they will actually be required to follow a more restrictive path to their health insurance than you and I. The false narrative suggesting that Congress gave themselves a special deal appears to have begun with John Fund of the Wall Street Journal who wrote, As the U.S. Office of Personnel Management notes, Members of Congress “enjoy the widest selection of health plans in the country.” According to page 114 of the Kennedy bill, a similar array of choices would not be available to other Americans in the future. Instead, they would be shunted into health insurance plans under the straightjacket of whatever the government decides is a “basic” plan. The goal would be to restrict care for the general public in order to control costs, while making sure Congress gets the gold-plated attention it’s accustomed to. Ultimately, the rest of us would be asked to trade a private insurance company as gatekeeper for a government gatekeeper. The difference, of course, is that most of us can fire our insurance gatekeeper. Just try to do that once the government fills that role. This line of bull was peddled to an even larger audience by Sean Hannity, a man who never met a fact that he wasn’t willing to ignore while making up a new one to better suit his purpose. During Hannity’s Fox News program of March 24, 2010, Hannity stated, without reservation, that that Members of Congress and their staff were exempt from the requirements of the Affordable Care Act. So, here’s the real deal –As things currently stand, Members of Congress and their staff, until 2014, will continue to participate in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP). This program, considered among the best in the nation, allows federal employees- including Members of Congress and their staff- to choose from a wide range of health plans and select the one that best suits their needs. Note that the current plan is neither ‘government’ insurance, ‘free’ insurance nor any other sort of sweet deal that the public has been led to believe is the case. The federal employee’s program involves private insurance policies with premiums, deductibles, co-pays, etc. Here’s the surprise – come 2014, when the lion’s share of the ACA provisions come on line, Members of Congress and their staff will be required to buy their health insurance on an exchange. In fact, their choices will be even more limited than our own. While it is expected that some 24 million people will elect to purchase their health care policy on a state run exchange, we are not required by law to do so. Members of Congress and their staff, however, must buy their insurance in this way.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1352738231105</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 11:37:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352738398992-141</Id><Title>dumpomie and #$%$</Title><Msg>little girl thinks she can slander the POTUS? what to do with BAC...a bad check kited?

Exclusive: Joseph Farah presents evidence of illegal voting, contributions, intimidation Contrary to popular opinion, I am not a “conspiracy theorist.” I live in the real world – always have. I’ve been a journalist who goes where the facts lead him all my life – unlike most of my colleagues whose “facts” are predetermined by their ideology. I understand Barack Obama and Bill Ayers because I was one of them early in my life. I even met Ayers and Bernardine Dohrn and Tom Hayden and Jane Fonda in the old days. I admired them. If Obama had been old enough during the 1960s and 1970s, I probably would have run into him, too. If anyone has a balanced approach to the realities of political life in America, it’s me. I’ve looked at life from both sides. I know the arguments of the other side and can still spout them before most of today’s practitioners of so-called “progressive” thought can. I also know that the reigning ethos of this movement represented so ably today by Obama is this: “By any means necessary …” It was first articulated by Jean Paul Sartre in his play, “Dirty Hands.” But it became popularized as a slogan of the revolutionary left by Malcolm X. What it means, in short, is that the ends justify the means. It means violence is fine in achieving a worthwhile objective. It means lying, stealing, cheating and all those other bourgeoisie “sins” are appropriate means of furthering the cause. Is there any doubt in your mind today that this is now the reigning ethos of the Democratic Party and its various tentacles and allies? There is no doubt in my mind. And that’s why stealing the vote is not only an acceptable practice by these people, it is a moral imperative in their twisted worldview. Am I suggesting that the recent presidential election was stolen through voter fraud and manipulation? Without a doubt. Do I have evidence? Yes, I have plenty of anecdotal evidence to show that it was committed by one side in the election in various ways. And I am convinced that at least 5 percent of the Democratic vote can be attributed to fraud – illegal voters, illegal campaign contributions, rigged balloting, intimidation at the polls, you name it. Here’s just some of the evidence for the skeptical: In September, the Columbus Dispatch in Ohio reported this sad and ugly news: “More than one out of every five registered Ohio voters is probably ineligible to vote. In two counties, the number of registered voters actually exceeds the voting-age population: Northwestern Ohio’s Wood County shows 109 registered voters for every 100 eligible, while in Lawrence County along the Ohio River it’s a mere 104 registered per 100 eligible. Another 31 counties show registrations at more than 90 percent of those eligible, a rate regarded as unrealistic by most voting experts. The national average is a little more than 70 percent. In a close presidential election where every vote might count, which ones to count might become paramount on Election Day – and in possible legal battles afterward.” The Dispatch asked Ohio’s chief elections official, Secretary of State Jon Husted, what could be done about this problem. His answer? Not enough. Nine months ago, he asked U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder for a personal meeting to discuss how to balance seemingly conflicting federal laws so he could pare Ohio’s dirty voter list without removing truly eligible voters. Holder’s office never even bothered to reply – to either Husted or the newspaper. What does that tell you? It tells me voter fraud is and was an important tactic in re-electing Holder’s boss and Democrats throughout the country. Anyway, we all know how Ohio voted. How about Michigan – Romney’s home state? How did Obama win such a resounding victory when the polls showed the two candidates in a virtual tie? And how is it that Obama won by 9 points while Democrats suffered a string of defeats down the entire state ballot? For instance, Republicans maintained control of both the state House and the Supreme Court, while Democrats lost three ballot propositions. Then, of course, there is the fine work of James O’Keefe and Project Veritas, which demonstrated, over and over again on camera, the willingness and ability of Democratic operatives to cheat and commit fraud to win elections. How about WND’s own investigation in which it demonstrated conclusively that the Obama campaign welcomed foreign contributions by intentionally leaving vulnerabilities in its web donation page that allowed even those using bogus names, disposable credit cards and foreign IP addresses to donate cash? The classic example was when WND staffers did just this using the name Osama bin Laden, listing his occupation as “deceased terrorist” and employer as “al-Qaida.” The contributions were accepted by the Team Obama, just as it accepted foreign contributions from the Palestinian Authority in 2008, as WND’s Aaron Klein demonstrated. How much evidence does one need to be convinced? This is just the tip of the iceberg. Did it make a difference in this close race? Without question. Is there anything we can do about it now? Not likely. But if we want to ensure that America has free and fair elections in the future, we better get to work. America’s political system is becoming a thugocracy. I’m fighting back. And you can help me in this fight. I’m challenging the Obama campaign on the acceptance of those illegal donations. I’ve filed a Federal Elections Commission complaint at considerable cost. I have no illusions that it will be easy to challenge a sitting president within his own bureaucracy. But I’m doing it. Meanwhile, some in the press would prefer that I be charged with voter fraud for efforts to expose the system. I wouldn’t be a bit surprised if the Democrat machine tries something like that. That’s why we need your help. We’re fighting to preserve America’s freedom here – nothing less. We’re fighting to preserve the concept of representative government – elections that actually mean something. We’re fighting to expose what no other news agency in the world apparently has an interest in exposing – the dark underbelly of corruption, fraud and abuse in our political system. Can you help?</Msg><Username>obamistan</Username><Timestamp>1352738807136</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 11:46:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352739127262-145</Id><Topic><Title>AAPL for a quick bounce</Title><Username>bos_nu</Username><Timestamp>1352738709387</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 11:45:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>AAPL has had its run up....now it is going down daily including today.

We re-elected the President in line with his vision of balance and sharing of responsibilities. Grover Nordquist was not elected for governance since he pulls the strings of those Tea Party puppets! Grover belongs now in the Karl Rove camp of the beaten strategists (rascals!). Already 250 rich businessmen have signed they would be happy to help our nation by having their taxes raised! Their ranks are growing by the hour... standing with the re-elected President ready to bring their share in restoring our economy to balance and parity. Being against progress and diversity and after a resounding defeat (losing the Latino, Asian, Black, and Youth votes) the GOP led by their right-wing fanatics (TP, etc.) is now facing to lose AGAIN in the 2014 and 2016 elections as wel should they CONTINUE to play politics against our nation's collective interests.

The hearing, held in the Labor Department’s main auditorium, was monitored by NSC staff and featured a line up of left-wing activists including one representative of the AFL-CIO who advocated for more government regulation over private retirement accounts and even the establishment of government-sponsored annuities that would take the place of 401k plans. "This hearing was set up to explore why Americans are not saving as much for their retirement as they could," explains National Seniors Council National Director Robert Crone, "However, it is clear that this is the first step towards a government takeover. It feels just like the beginning of the debate over health care and we all know how that ended up." A representative of the liberal Pension Rights Center, Rebecca Davis, testified that the government needs to get involved because 401k plans and IRAs are unfair to poor people. She demanded the Obama administration set up a "government-sponsored program administered by the PBGC (the governments’ Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation)." She proclaimed that even "private annuities are problematic." Such "reforms" would effectively end private retirement accounts in America, Crone warns. "These people want the government to require that ultimately all Americans buy these government annuities instead of saving or investing on their own. The Government could then take these trillions of dollars and redistribute it through this new national retirement system." Deputy Treasury Secretary J. Mark Iwry, who presided over the hearing, is a long-time critic of 401k plans because he believes they benefit the rich. He also appears to be one of the Administration’s point man on this issue.</Msg><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1352758972929</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 17:22:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352759389619-227</Id><Title>Subject: Golf Czar's Rule Changes</Title><Msg>President B.H.O. Has recently appointed a Golf Czar. Major rule changes in the game of golf will become effective November 6, 2012. This is only a preview as the complete rule book (expect 2716 pages) is being rewritten as we speak. Here are a few of the changes: Golfers with handicaps: - Below 10 will have their green fees increased by 35%. - Between 11 and 18 will see no increase in green fees. - Above 18 will get a $20 check each time they play. The term "gimmie" will be changed to "entitlement" and will be used as follows: - Handicaps below 10, no entitlements. - Handicaps from 11 to 17, entitlements for putter length putts. - Handicaps above 18, if your ball is on the green, no need to putt, just pick it up. These entitlements are intended to bring about fairness and, most importantly, equality in scoring. In addition, a Player will be limited to a maximum of one birdie or six pars in any given 18-hole round. Any excess must be given to those fellow players who have not yet scored a birdie or par. Only after all players have received a birdie or par from the player actually making the birdie or par, can that player begin to count his pars and birdies again . The current USGA handicap system will be used for the above purposes, but the term "net score" will be available only for scoring those players with handicaps of 18 and above. This is intended to "re-distribute" the success of winning by making sure that in all competitions every Player above an 18 handicap will post only "net score" against every other player's "gross score". These new Rules are intended to CHANGE the game of golf. Golf must be about Fairness. It should have nothing to do with ability, hard work, practice, and responsibility. This is the "Right thing to do." So, please remember; if you shot a round of golf under par, you didn't shoot it yourself. Someone else built that course, and someone else cut the grass so that you could play on it. Someone else built the clubs and the cart. You need to share with everyone and anyone who made you a successful golfer</Msg><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1352759389619</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 17:29:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352759672034-228</Id><Title>BAC: Much Lower Div, Less EPS growth, higher risk - who's buying this?</Title><Msg>BAC has a far lower dividend than it's peer group at 0.4% versus ~3% at Wells and JPM.

Vicious and nasty bunch, but we've seen this many times already so they aren't fooling many (seems they need money...lol). From their website: The National Seniors Council is taking the lead in criticizing ten Congressmen who voted not to repeal President Obama’s Health Control Law after voting against the measure last year. "It is incredible that ten Democrats who said last year that Obamacare was a bad idea, are now defending this monstrosity," says NSC National Director Robert Crone. "Obamacare is wildly unpopular yet the members of the Turncoat Ten now feel obligated to support it. Nothing has changed from last year. These ten Members of Congress need to be held accountable for their votes. Opposition to repealing the Health Control Law is the same as supporting it."</Msg><Username>mixtli_speaks</Username><Timestamp>1352760052568</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 17:40:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352760057518-232</Id><Topic><Title>Us to become the #1 oil producer</Title><Username>zevoter22</Username><Timestamp>1352759910538</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 17:38:30 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hows the Pity Party going !</Msg><Username>sirifuture</Username><Timestamp>1352760057518</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 17:40:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352760282952-233</Id><Topic><Title>Us to become the #1 oil producer</Title><Username>zevoter22</Username><Timestamp>1352759910538</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 17:38:30 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I like how the right wing media held back this story till after the election .</Msg><Username>sirifuture</Username><Timestamp>1352760282952</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 17:44:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352760366858-234</Id><Topic><Title>They don't call California The Land of Fruits and Nuts for no reason .......</Title><Username>dumpobamie</Username><Timestamp>1352759985775</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 17:39:45 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hows the meth ,mooshine and incest going hillbilly boy ?</Msg><Username>sirifuture</Username><Timestamp>1352760366858</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 17:46:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352760519711-235</Id><Title>BAC shock and oh welled</Title><Msg>Imagine, it only took a few days or months for the FBI to get all over General P and his will do hose?

Andrew Cuomo plans to request $30 billion in federal aid to rebuild after Superstorm Sandy, which heavily damaged parts of New York City and Long Island, he said Monday. The administration will seek a supplemental appropriation to cover infrastructure, repair and emergency costs beyond those normally covered by federal emergency aid, Cuomo said. "I've asked for 100 percent reimbursement," he said. Generally the Federal Emergency Management Agency will reimburse up to 75 percent of public costs, with the state and local authorities covering the remaining 25 percent. There have been cases, such as Hurricane Katrina, where the federal government has reimbursed up to 90 percent of costs. "The equity and the fairness is inarguable in this case," Cuomo said. It will probably be a regional plan including New Jersey and Connecticut, with money for infrastructure, housing, local governments and small business, he said.</Msg><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1352768150704</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 19:55:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352768157261-254</Id><Topic><Title>Gerinomo..Killed a Bunch of White Settlers</Title><Username>buddhazenpeace</Username><Timestamp>1352749861555</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 14:51:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The world's largest mountain sculpture, Crazy Horse Memorial in SD, is proceeding.

You won't forget the Comanches after reading this.</Msg><Username>tinkers_curse</Username><Timestamp>1352779394081</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 23:03:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352779617487-275</Id><Topic><Title>Goebblels-Fox News got it all wrong.

They all dose up from the maggot infested pile of crap, and then spew it out in a non-stop gush. One maggot sounds exactly like the others. They base all they believe on lies, and then they are shocked when their lie train derails. Romney looked like a deer in the headlights when giving his concession speech. He was fed the lies, believed the lies, spread the lies, and was betrayed by the liars.

Romney was indeed a real threat for America and the world. President Obama's re-election was a historic one for many reasons. Among them one that I cherish is that... had he lost, the RACISTS of America would take it as 'confirmation' of their bias! Though, we do know that ignoramuses would still find other 'reasons' to be who they are- racists!</Msg><Username>giovannijay</Username><Timestamp>1352781337351</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 23:35:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352781644186-280</Id><Topic><Title>Panetta was quoted as saying "You don't deploy forces into harm's way without knowing what's going on, (We) felt we could not put forces at risk in that situation"</Title><Username>the_power_inyou</Username><Timestamp>1352774972097</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 21:49:32 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Looks like you know more than they do.</Msg><Username>dipacultboilwtr</Username><Timestamp>1352781644186</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 23:40:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352781995991-281</Id><Topic><Title>Did you find Iraqs WMDs yet ?

It becomes in-grained to a degree, such that one (Afghanistan), followed by another (Iraq) makes it perhaps easier to justify a third (Iran) by building on the momentum and justifications of the previous war. Iraq, for example, was pre-emptive, we were told they HAD nukes and we HAD to stop them. Now Iran also will (definitely) HAVE them and we MUST stop them. Oh yea, our bestest buds in the whole world, ever, especially if we vote for Romney, says so too (Israel). They will cheer for us on the sidelines. I hope Obama can avoid this fate; he will be severly pressured if things continue as is. The US used to get good stuff out of wars, like land, resources, markets etc. that eventually tricked down to the common folks as jobs, cheap resources,public services. Of course at great human sacrifice, always the common folks. Now we just get punked and chumped, and still lose common folks as sacrifice. Someone always wins....the war profiteers of all the 'allies', the post-war infrastructure 're-builders' (Haliburton, etc) who steal fabulous sums, the politicians, the lobbyists, plenty more.
