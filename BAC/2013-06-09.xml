Referred to as the "nuclear option" by insiders, however, few people seriously entertained the thought the bank was actually serious about doing so. The potential damage to the bank's reputation, not to mention its counterparties, was simply too large. Consequently, it was always assumed that the threat was only being used to gain leverage in negotiations with investors who had sustained damages from Countrywide's malfeasance. In legalese, the doctrine at issue here is known as "successor liability." As a general rule, when one company buys another company, the acquirer does not assume liability for the acquiree's preexisting legal claims. Say, for example, that Company A decides to buy Company B, but before the transaction is consummated, Company B is sued for discrimination. Just because Company A subsequently acquires Company B doesn't mean its coffers are available to satisfy the resulting judgment. The proceeds for that must still come from Company B -- assuming, of course, that its assets remained meaningfully segregated in order to do so. To bring it full circle, in turn, this is the reason that Bank of America claims to have been so careful about the way in which it commingled the two operation's assets. As a spokesman for the bank noted previously to Bloomberg News, it "took great pains to preserve the separate identity of Countrywide." These purported pains aside, the opposing parties argue that Bank of America should nevertheless be on the hook for Countrywide's liabilities. Their position is based on a number of exceptions to the doctrine of successor liability. And while I won't get into them at this point, at least one of the arguments had made significant headway in a parallel case between Bank of America and mortgage-bond insurer MBIA before the parties settled the dispute last month. Suffice it to say, had these arguments succeeded, the issue of Countrywide's bankruptcy would have been rendered irrelevant. But as I write today, it's still one of the most powerful cards that Bank of America has at its disposal.</Msg><Username>jack_mlyn</Username><Timestamp>1370779451291</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-09 08:04:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370779719944-18</Id><Topic><Title>BAC put the mortgage countrywide unit into bankruptcy</Title><Username>t_hooya</Username><Timestamp>1370763212941</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-09 03:33:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No, Countrywide has NOT been put into bankruptcy.

Glenn Greenwald of the once Manchester Guardian (city reference dropped now) stated that, of course, administration did claim, as per usual, that “revelations” threatened national security. He realizes “whistleblowers” will be demonized the most. Dem Senator Udall of Colo says “millions of records” are accumulated and that is invasion of USA citizen privacy. Clip of the president speaking—We have attained wise balance of national security vs personal privacy. Sen Udall cites the/a “war against privacy” but maintains there are still amendments I and iv of the constitution. He concedes “prism” is ok, as it deals with foreigners, but use of 215 (“patriot” law” is not. Ok AS BEING used. Dem sen Dianne Feinstein said what is being done is within the law and what is “taken” is not personal conversation, but telephone-bill type information. She cites our obligation to “keep America safe” Sen feinstein’s GOP counterweight from House considers it OK to prosecute “whistleblowers” because they lack knowledge of full range of the program…with that full knowledge, perhaps they would approve??

"There has been no shortage of oil in the market. Producers have been able to meet consumer needs," Abdullah al-Badri told an energy conference. "We also see this as being the case for the rest of 2012 and the foreseeable future." Oil prices surged in March to $128 a barrel, the highest level since 2008, because of concern about possible supply shortages. Prices have since fallen back and brent crude was trading around $118 on Thursday. "Today the price continues to be driven by excessive speculation," Badri said. OPEC at a meeting in December set a target to produce 30 million barrels per day, settling an argument which broke out in 2011 after Iran and other members opposed a Saudi-led plan to raise OPEC's production ceiling. Output has remained above the target all year as Libyan supply recovered after being virtually shut down during the 2011 uprising against Muammar Gaddafi's rule. The extra oil is filling gaps caused by an unusually large number of supply outages globally, which have also helped support prices. Supply breaks were running at nearly 1.3 million bpd as of early April. The additional supply has also offset a decline in exports from Iran, which is facing stiffening western sanctions over its disputed nuclear energy program. Iranian oil exports were running at between 200,000 and 300,000 barrels per day below last year's level, Maria van der Hoeven, head of the International Energy Agency, told Thursday's conference. Iranian officials have said the country exported an average of 2.2 million barrels a day last year. July supply from the 12-member Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ran at 31.75 million barrels per day (bpd), the high est since September 2008, which was</Msg><Username>fairvalue23</Username><Timestamp>1370794711992</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-09 12:18:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370794758023-48</Id><Title>Sanford Bernstein Oil Value should be $60.00 a barrel</Title><Msg>Sanford Bernstein Oil Value should be $60.00 a barrel..Sanford Bernstein Oil Value should be $60.00 a barrel.Sanford Bernstein Oil Value should be $60.00 to $50.00 a barrel Based on Sanford C.

The average price for gasoline in the U.S.A would drop to $2.80 per gallon. Naimi Says Brent Oil Should Drop to $80.00 as Supply Tops Demand By Ben Sharples - Crude prices should fall because global supply is outweighing demand, according to Saudi Arabia’s oil minister, Ali al-Naimi. “We want a lower price than where it is now,” al-Naimi said in Adelaide today. “We need to get the price to a level of around $80” a barrel for London’s Brent crude, he said. Saudi Arabia is the world’s biggest oil exporter. Brent, a benchmark price for more than half the world’s crude, has dropped 6 percent this month amid concern Europe’s debt crisis will worsen and curb fuel demand. OPEC is working to bring prices down, the group’s Secretary-General, Abdalla el- Badri, said . The producer group, scheduled to meet next month, is pumping 8.3 percent more crude than it considers necessary this quarter, figures from the Vienna-based group show. Brent crude for June settlement dropped 0.8 percent in the week to $112.26 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. West Texas Intermediate oil for June delivery slid 2.4 percent to $96.13 a barrel. At $100 a barrel for London’s Brent crude, that equates to around $80.00 a barrel for West Texas Intermediate oil. The average price for gasoline in the U.S.A would drop to $2.80 per gallon. Oil supply outweighs demand by 1.3 million to 1.5 million barrels a day, al-Naimi said today. Saudi Arabia increased output last month to the highest in more than three decades, according to data it provided to OPEC.</Msg><Username>fairvalue23</Username><Timestamp>1370795186381</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-09 12:26:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370795401664-54</Id><Title>May I axe the board a question????

ROFLMFO. I think what is annoying to everyone is that they were not transparent about it. shucks, that is just silly. if two people really want to communicate there seem to be many ways to do that but perhaps you can give a presentation at the Kyle Dube Al Bundy economic conference on how no-doc lones have helped make ameruca stronger. Regan's trust but verify idea, that was likely obtained from a female russian expert whatever the source may matter, should apply all the way around. . As I said before, the response to wikileaks should have been for the CIA and NSA to out everyone else, glastnost or openness would work here too except where it destorys economic activiaites based on fooling each other. The CIA would probably practice mind control if it thought it was entertaining. ROFLMFO. Part of the problem that is starting to occur has nothing to do with no-doc lones or spies but rather just the use of secrecy for appeasement of others. Don't ask don't tell appealed to the ostriches but it can only go so far and is now out of favour as it relates to sex but is still being used to hold society together in other ways.</Msg><Username>spocklovesyou</Username><Timestamp>1370824407535</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-09 20:33:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370824829339-113</Id><Topic><Title>102.3% of American phone calls, emails, internet communications are boring and of minimal substance</Title><Username>reggie.thoma</Username><Timestamp>1370821978786</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-09 19:52:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wanna make it transparent?
