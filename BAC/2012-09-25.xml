The government makes the laws that allow lawsuits for just about anything. The government runs a good portion of heath care. Did you know illegal immigrants and new immigrants who never paid into SSI are eligible for benefits? Nice eh? And the government runs just about all of the educational system.

Its stock has increased the most among these banks in 2012, and throughout the last year. Bank of America's potential for capital appreciation has increased even more recently since investors' outlook on Europe's crisis is improving, and Bank of America recently made significant strides toward completing its New BAC project. Bank of America is currently absent in the growing housing market, but it's on the way to recovery and improved earnings through its current consolidation and restructuring phase. Bank of America is still available at a significant discount in comparison to its peers. By undergoing the cost savings initiatives in the New BAC project, Bank of America should be financially secure enough to get federal approval for increasing its dividend again in the near future.</Msg><Username>cchaker</Username><Timestamp>1348556388487</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-25 02:59:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348557107157-14</Id><Topic><Title>I'm WARNING people now.

How come? BAC is moving forward as they showed up a lot of capital and cleaned up their act for the year. If you look at this market in general, people look at it as a cyclical market but its more of a volatile growth story. Its been that way historically where from 2000 the stock market hasn't gone anywhere. My opinion is to capture the gains on BAC for the short term and keep your ears to the floor when the quarterly report is published.

It's probably better for the stock to re-test 8-8.50 before another move up to hold above 9 long term. This should happen by the end of the year. But the fiscal cliff and end of the current capital gain rates will lead to a sell off at the end of the year. I probably won't expect it to go over 10 until Q1 next year. There should be a good 25% runup from 8 to 10 coming up.

But for me a new mortgage. I had a good one 5.5% but was able to get a better one on the new Harp 2 program; 3.75%. That saves me nearly $500 per month on my payment. I could buy a new bigscreen every month on the savings. Maybe a new car?</Msg><Username>just_love_this_stock</Username><Timestamp>1348596705890</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-25 14:11:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348596873795-110</Id><Topic><Title>The Liberal Media and Hollywood have Declared the Election Over and Obama gets another 4yrs.

When comparing the price movement oc BAC compare it to KBE which is the S&amp;P bank ETF. Today BAC was doen 1.65 percent KBE was down 1.47 percent BAC has a higher beta, so on winning days it will win by more, on losing days more. Focusing on this will keep you centered on the fact that BAC is performing normally, and is not falling apart.</Msg><Username>caplain_nobull1</Username><Timestamp>1348604382512</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-25 16:19:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348604477238-152</Id><Title>EURO back in nose dive mode...</Title><Msg>As Spain tries to salvage itself from coming back from falling over their fiscal cliff.</Msg><Username>rhinoinchgo</Username><Timestamp>1348604477238</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-25 16:21:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348605620833-153</Id><Title>BAC dropping customers faster than Mitt</Title><Msg>BAC's and mitt's remaining hopes are that fee increases and tax breaks can balance with lost voters and fleeing pension/bank/401k accounts. GOP hopes that none of the remaining 80 percent can read, or with changes even vote (Florida only needs ten percent to win-others- hispanic, black, homeless or changing residency) since removed from eligibility. Goldwater had a good message too. History reflected those eloquent statements as bright move via a landslide...slide being the operative term. I do not think it was Obama worried about his UN appearance to shut down air-drone traffic over the East coast . IMHO it was the supreme court worried they will have to pull another bush deal with five more states to even make this look like a close race.</Msg><Username>f_bird55</Username><Timestamp>1348605620833</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-25 16:40:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348605630764-154</Id><Topic><Title>CNBC is Evil In My Opinion</Title><Username>smythwrd</Username><Timestamp>1348601370061</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-25 15:29:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The rotten #$%$ way BAC stock price has gone down since the Fed said they would buy 40 billion dollars in MBS each month BAC chart with no multicent uptick rule would make people think the Fed said they WERE DUMPING 40 BILLION DOLLARS OF MBS on the market INSTEAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

HFT without the up-tic rule,, shorts enter a number, how far down they want the stock to go... algorithmic trading takes over and gives them that number. The up-tic rule would stop HFT from working, that is why we will never see it come back. The term "fat finger", when someone puts in the wrong number and the stock drops 50% when they only wanted a 20% drop... CNBC is in bed with the NYSE who supports this kind of trading. We are far from equal in this crooked market and CNBC is not going to tell us why. I would like to see 2 things happen: 1. Bring back the up-tic rule. 2. First order in should be the first order filled. Lets see CNBC work to make that happen..</Msg><Username>fireundersmoke</Username><Timestamp>1348627973712</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-25 22:52:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348628918078-190</Id><Topic><Title>I just heard a story</Title><Username>stockbard</Username><Timestamp>1348608276290</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-25 17:24:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Story just not true.

Study the requirements for Admission to California Institute of Technology Dept. Of Physics and Math. They ask about every phase of your life. To be President, you only have to divulge approximately 1/2 of the information that CalTech requires. You can see how the qualifications for the Presidency is purposely set up, so that it can politically be manipulated. Why can't it at least be set up, so that candidates must tell the truth before they can even run?</Msg><Username>bejupete</Username><Timestamp>1348631034183</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-25 23:43:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348631199882-198</Id><Topic><Title>10.00 Close?</Title><Username>fish2kill</Username><Timestamp>1310767228000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2011-07-15 18:00:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Still fighting to get to ten dollars over a year later.
