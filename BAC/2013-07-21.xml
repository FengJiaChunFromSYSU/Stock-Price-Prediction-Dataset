But if your health insurance company is over charging you, even you will get a refund. Most health insurance companies that handle Medicare don't overcharge because they know the AARP is watching them closely. Humana is a possible exception as they have a bad reputation for ripping seniors off. Most everyone knows that the Koch brothers have financed a humongous antiObamacare campaign based on spreading lies. The one that was started by the Mimic ilovepelosi is one of those lies. If you would stop and think for a moment you would realize that if a Fortune 500 company raised the premium on their medical benefits by 50% it would be in the national news. So it is obviously a lie. Please use your brain and stop defending liars.</Msg><Username>whyduyouask</Username><Timestamp>1374380197048</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-21 00:16:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374380983315-2</Id><Topic><Title>BAC an easy double within 5 years</Title><Username>ceausescu_rules</Username><Timestamp>1374368195852</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 20:56:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You guys are so wrong.

Please read my message again and you will see that I didn't say the premiums were increasing by 50%. I said the inflation rate was 50% higher, which is true. My fortune 50 company put into writing what our year over year inflation would have been without affordable healthcare, and stated in writing that amount of increase was 50% higher than it would otherwise had been. They also told any employee that smoked that they had to pay $1,800 more for healthcare next year. These are bona fide facts. Not making it up. Our employees are #$%$ OFF.

What is happening is stagnation in the major indices. This happens when the large derivative players are shifting their positions. They are now moving money and are going to bet against both markets. In the past this is when large corrections take place (over 10 percent). The large derivative players are the ones that run the indices. For example look at Warren Buffet; he is a heavy derivative player that has, over the last five years, substantially decreased his position in stocks and gone the derivative route. Smart, rich player. Derivative are an easy way to hide money.......so large losses can be covered up. The SEC does not understand this and they cannot track this. The result is no regulation. It will only take one major, dishonest derivative player to send our financial systems into ruin.</Msg><Username>geraldmcginty1</Username><Timestamp>1374394789002</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-21 04:19:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374394808643-7</Id><Topic><Title>Two very large, dishonest derivative players will bring down the world financial markets.</Title><Username>geraldmcginty1</Username><Timestamp>1374394789002</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-21 04:19:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>At least the information is out there now.</Msg><Username>geraldmcginty1</Username><Timestamp>1374394808643</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-21 04:20:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374398802199-8</Id><Topic><Title>A single Democrat was responsible for bankrupting Orange County!</Title><Username>defeatsocialism</Username><Timestamp>1374355583539</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 17:26:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Citron never stole anything.

He said, before doctors had to deal with insurance companies that would draw the line on what they would pay to doctors but with obamacare it is guaranteed payment no hassles negotiating they just get paid.

Romney lost the election because every debate and campaign speech was focused on getting more jobs for Americans, whereas nearly all of Obama's speeches focused on protecting existing welfare and gov't subsidy programs and offering even more handouts. Romney wanted Americans to WORK for a living, whereas Obama and democrats want more Americans dependent on Democrats and welfare for their livelihood. Work or welfare? Americans chose welfare.

Yesterday's visit to former aerospace colleagues went well; a company van showed up at the reservation, shuttled me in and out of Seattle (a little over two hours each way), and returned me to the beech bearing a small, specialized load of custom avionics. The threat comes from the Yakama Indians, whose reservation is a fine slice of heaven on earth. Last night I had a long talk and smoke with one of their elders, a tribal medicine man. He showed me maps of the reservation, and the names of the villages and lakes all spoke to me in voices at once foreign yet familiar: Trout Lake, Fish Lake, White Salmon, Goat Rocks, and most powerfully of all, Willy #$%$ Crossing. When I mentioned this to the medicine man, he asked what led me and my great black raven to his land, and I spoke in broad terms of my mission and the Igloo. He pulled on his pipe, and then asked what that man's alleged offense was. "Truth teller" I told him, and he nodded. "FishToKill, why do you deny your true self?

Certainly you can isolate the top 50 USA companies, or the top 10, but why not simply tell us what the company is so we can data mine what is going on and present the facts without an inflamed middle man interpretation? Your original post had the intention of presenting just enough information to make it look like something bad as happening because of Obamacare, when the fact is that what is happening has nothing to do with Obamacare and is the snarky policies of your company. Be honest. It saves a lot of time.</Msg><Username>whydoyoubelievethat</Username><Timestamp>1374420132343</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-21 11:22:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374420211664-34</Id><Topic><Title>78% of the murders caused by 12% of the population</Title><Username>zevoter01</Username><Timestamp>1374418322406</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-21 10:52:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why do you keep bragging about getting away with murder?</Msg><Username>whydoyoubelievethat</Username><Timestamp>1374420211664</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-21 11:23:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374420321588-35</Id><Topic><Title>obama even failed to gin up race riots this weekend</Title><Username>zevoter01</Username><Timestamp>1374418269402</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-21 10:51:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The possibility that President Obama's intent had nothing to do with the white racists' lust for a race war has never occurred to you?</Msg><Username>whydoyoubelievethat</Username><Timestamp>1374420321588</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-21 11:25:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374421712111-36</Id><Topic><Title>Do illegal Hispanics contribute anything to this country</Title><Username>bo_jackson_62</Username><Timestamp>1374364871580</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 20:01:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good point.</Msg><Username>roman_warrior777</Username><Timestamp>1374421712111</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-21 11:48:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374421931401-37</Id><Topic><Title>Do Filthy Wet-Backs Contribute Anything Positive To This Country</Title><Username>bo_jackson_62</Username><Timestamp>1374364971760</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 20:02:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Living off the American tax payer.

Also, it is mainly for children who remain in college as undergraduates (until 21 for undergraduates or graduate school until 26) where the college does not include medical insurance. If a child is not in college but has a job they most likely have their own medical insurance and are no longer included in your plan. That means the percentage of 26 year olds effecting your insurance premiums is a very small percentage. It also was implemented in 2012. What that means is that the costs increase for your next year is not a new cost. Your facts are all jumbled up as if you were deliberately trying to deceive people. Want to start all over again and tell us what are the facts by telling us what company you work for and what your costs are for this year and the projected costs are for next year. Then we can deal with reality and not some imaginary complaint.</Msg><Username>whyduyouask</Username><Timestamp>1374422086889</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-21 11:54:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374422801971-39</Id><Topic><Title>US economy actually SHRUNK in the 4th Quarter...</Title><Username>zevoter01</Username><Timestamp>1374412218324</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-21 09:10:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Another lie from little z.

Welfare recipients are buying groceries with their Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) cards and packing them in giant barrels for the trip overseas, The Post found. The practice is so common that hundreds of 45- to 55-gallon cardboard and plastic barrels line the walls of supermarkets in almost every Caribbean corner of the city. The feds say the moveable feasts go against the intent of the $86 billion welfare program for impoverished Americans. A spokeswoman for the US Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrition Service said welfare benefits are reserved for households that buy and prepare food together. She said states should intervene if people are caught shipping nonperishables abroad. Michael Tanner, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, called it just another example of welfare abuse. “I don’t want food-stamp police to see what people do with their rice and beans, but it’s wrong,” Tanner told The Post. “The purpose of this program is to help Americans who don’t have enough to eat. This is not intended as a form of foreign aid.” The United States spent $522.7 million on foreign aid to the Caribbean last fiscal year, government data show.</Msg><Username>zevoter01</Username><Timestamp>1374452214198</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-21 20:16:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374452289511-80</Id><Topic><Title>Since when did this become a political board?</Title><Username>subduded2000</Username><Timestamp>1374443403270</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-21 17:50:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ROTFLMAO anyone who's been a member since 2003 and can't answer those questions for himself is either beyond help, or just wants to whine.

While no government agencies specifically track crimes by illegal aliens, there have been some efforts to quantify the loss. Last December, Mac Johnson set out to investigate the number of homicides perpetrated by illegal aliens. Since the federal government would not provide any useful information, he contacted all 50 statehouses. Three months later, he had fewer than a dozen responses. Only one state, Vermont, provided any useful information. He then set out to statistically estimate the number of murders by illegal aliens based on available crime data and conservative estimates of the actually number of illegal aliens in the country – which, of course, nobody really knows. He found that between 1,806 and 2,510 people in the U.S. are murdered annually by illegal aliens. If he’s right, that would represent between 11 percent and 15 percent of all murders in the U.S. In one study of a sample 55,000 illegal immigrants serving prison sentences in the U.S., it was discovered that they are responsible for over 400,000 arrests and over 700,000 felony crimes. According to Heather McDonald of the Manhattan Institute, 95 percent of all outstanding warrants for homicide (which total 1,200 to 1,500) target illegal aliens. Up to two-thirds of all fugitive felony warrants (17,000) are for illegal aliens.</Msg><Username>pat_buchanan8888</Username><Timestamp>1374460348187</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-21 22:32:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374460366719-93</Id><Topic><Title>the phrase "unlimited taxing power" keeps coming up re the pensions .</Title><Username>spocklovesyou</Username><Timestamp>1374447856148</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-21 19:04:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Don't count the US out just yet...we our great inventors of the instabulb and soda stream</Msg><Username>vieweroutrage</Username><Timestamp>1374460366719</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-21 22:32:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374464325575-94</Id><Title>this coming week will be great for bac</Title><Msg>don't sell your shares cheap.</Msg><Username>stevens1958</Username><Timestamp>1374464325575</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-21 23:38:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message></Date>
