How do you force people to read and learn? you can't. How do you help people like that? either GIVE them a gov't job or help unions to extort higher wages from companies and then lie to the country. Shift the headcount from unemployment to disability and say the unemployment rate is dropping :) Sure it is cause you're giving handouts from the other pocket. Obama has created more rich via Bernanke.</Msg><Username>tiglet2l</Username><Timestamp>1373170478933</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-07 00:14:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373171387707-2</Id><Topic><Title>James Orrin McKee is the antisemitic poster</Title><Username>darlaleen</Username><Timestamp>1373137652777</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-06 15:07:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You trust who you please but, been posting it for 6 months now.

I'm not sure if I should cite mark twain or regan's campaign slogans ROFLMFO. You are starting to see quality statistics normed to what they are spposed to measure.That is, if corn becomes scarce or expensive, people will switch to cardboard for food and therefore corn is less important in cost of living calculations. Poverty may now be considered having less than 2 good cardbored meals per day, as with the song Alice's Restaurant it is not evil if everyone does it as the psychiatrusts try to determien who is of good moral character. Any thresholded test throws out the distribution- in fact if poverty is some how normed to the overall population, poverty may no longer mean not having access a washing machine but rather not having access to a river with sufficient water flow to do laundy and go to bathroom at the same time. ROFLMFO. 15 or 50, who cares. Regan is still the great communicator and grabs your attention by asking "are you better of now that you were 4 years ago?"Regan could get an important point across without a lot of bizarre language mechanisms and intellectualisation. ROFLMFO. Merely having to buy food with EBT or stamps instead of the proceeds of selling mortgages to Ben is not going to effect quality of life unless the bailed out trumps resent the working pour having tira masu because they can't find homes in north dakota to help the oil workers live and get to work in good shape.

Also that zevoter suffers from enuresis and loves smegma pastries in addition to being a pathological liar and mentally #$%$. Would those be mitigating factors in how he would be sentenced for slander, misrepresentation and other crimes? What would your sentence be for those crimes?</Msg><Username>joyakld</Username><Timestamp>1373229236107</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-07 16:33:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373229604624-34</Id><Topic><Title>dfaduke exposed as liar and racist on ariad board.</Title><Username>hidalgo.pablo</Username><Timestamp>1373132822016</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-06 13:47:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>just pressed to prove you are foolish huh mason?</Msg><Username>zevoter01</Username><Timestamp>1373229604624</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-07 16:40:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373234416089-35</Id><Topic><Title>dfaduke exposed as liar and racist on ariad board.</Title><Username>hidalgo.pablo</Username><Timestamp>1373132822016</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-06 13:47:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ms. Joyakid, in my country we do not have capital punishment. Instead we allow miscreants to undergo forms of punishment that do not harm them physically but subject them to some discomfiture. For example, we may permit a prisoner to spend time in a sealed room which has been densely populated with very feculent odors. Many refer to it as a Mexican Gas Chamber. I leave it to your gentle imagination what it must smell like once donkeys, chickens and swine have been allowed to stay there a long while and no refuse removed. Well, in the cases of zevoter and dfaduke, they might be invited to spend, say, every other night in such an aromatic, nostril-filling space for one or two months. And, possibly, in their cases a few farm animals would share their space. Under our judicial system zevoter and dfaduke would have the right to choose the proportion they wish among 1) donkeys fed a diet of pinto beans and marinated boiled cabbage, 2) chickens fed a diet of spicy chachalupa, and 3) swine fed a diet of chile con carne liberally dosed with fermented tabasco sauce.</Msg><Username>morrissheinberg</Username><Timestamp>1373234416089</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-07 18:00:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373236099360-36</Id><Title>get on board 13.50 this week</Title><Msg>will touch if not close at 13.50..don't be a loser</Msg><Username>ceausescu_rules</Username><Timestamp>1373236099360</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-07 18:28:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373236616082-37</Id><Topic><Title>get on board 13.50 this week</Title><Username>ceausescu_rules</Username><Timestamp>1373236099360</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-07 18:28:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Could be by tues.</Msg><Username>jld2734</Username><Timestamp>1373236616082</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-07 18:36:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373238813227-38</Id><Topic><Title>dfaduke exposed as liar and racist on ariad board.</Title><Username>hidalgo.pablo</Username><Timestamp>1373132822016</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-06 13:47:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The women in your country have hairy armpits and smell like urine.
