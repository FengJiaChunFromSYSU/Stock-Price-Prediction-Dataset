Matthew Shinnick dropped by a Bank of America branch in San Francisco to make sure a check he was about to deposit wasn't fraudulent. The teller found that the check was fraudulent and told the manager, who then had Shinnick thrown in jail. Are you getting this right? The customer who wanted to make sure he wasn't about to draw on a fraudulent check, got thrown in jail by Bank of America. From SFGate, Check from a scammer bounces victim into jail: The teller contacted the business and was informed that no check had been written to Shinnick for $2,000 or any other amount. She immediately passed the check to the branch manager. "I saw him talking on the phone and staring at me," Shinnick said. "A few minutes later, four SFPD officers came into the bank. They didn't say a thing. They just kicked my legs apart and handcuffed me behind my back." The police report for Shinnick's arrest says he was taken into custody "for the safety of the bank employees as well as the bank customers." Shinnick spent several hours in jail, dressed in an orange jumpsuit, before his father posted $4,500 bail. All told Shinnick spent $14,000 to clear his record. Bank of America refused to reimburse him. In response, consumer advocate and radio host Clark Howard started a Bank of America "Money Loss Meter" to show how much money his listeners have withdrawn from BofA as they close their accounts in protest. It's up to $50 million. (There's more on Clark's site.) The Atlanta Journal-Constitution has more on the story: Clark Howard takes on B-of-A. For their part, Bank of America denies that customers are closing their accounts as Howard claims."</Msg><Username>bubba92109</Username><Timestamp>1370668682613</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-08 01:18:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370668897441-6</Id><Topic><Title>Bank America: @ $17,shorts go Buh Bye!</Title><Username>maxxybb</Username><Timestamp>1370643910419</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 18:25:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Bucko.....

According to transcripts of interviews that House investigators conducted with two Cincinnati office employees and which Fox News reviewed, agent Elizabeth Hofacre claimed that the idea this program was the work of two rogue agents is "absurd." She said that when Lois Lerner, the high-level official who oversaw the Cincinnati unit and is now on leave over the scandal, first acknowledged the program last month and traced it to the Ohio office, "I was furious." "I mean, it was inaccurate, but me especially because I was involved in the processing of these in 2010 so it looked like ... Lois Lerner was putting it on us," she said. Hofacre went on to say that she thinks the public has been purposely misled on the claim that two rogue agents were responsible. "Everybody that has been making those statements should know they are inaccurate," she said. "I just thought when Lois Lerner dropped that bomb shell, oh, it was Cincinnati's problem, she thought it would go away, but instead it exploded."</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1370691179424</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-08 07:32:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370694201754-25</Id><Topic><Title>Bank America: @ $17,shorts go Buh Bye!</Title><Username>maxxybb</Username><Timestamp>1370643910419</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 18:25:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Really?

The fact that they have agreed to pay out $50 billion so far when Countrywide was only worth $4.5 billion tells you a lot. The issue of successor liability is not that simple. The law seems to say that successor liability applies when the lawsuits were filed before a company is taken over by another one. The issue here is does successor liability also apply when the lawsuits were filed after company was taken over by another one. Things are not so clear in that case which is one of the reasons why BAC hasn't bankrupt Countrywide yet. If they did, it is guaranteed that it would be in the courts for years with fat legal fees paid to hundreds of lawyers. It would be big, expensive, messy, and even more damaging to BAC's reputation. We could also assume that it wouldn't be a big lift for the stock either. That's the bad thing about the "nuclear" option. It indiscriminately destroys everything.</Msg><Username>tigger.redux</Username><Timestamp>1370712732796</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-08 13:32:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370713002430-50</Id><Topic><Title>Bank America: @ $17,shorts go Buh Bye!</Title><Username>maxxybb</Username><Timestamp>1370643910419</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 18:25:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I pretty much agree, but since this is a NY judge, anything could happen.

Richard Bove, BAC in 2-3 years $30 said 6 months ago that means 1 1/2 - 2 1/2 years from now. Why? BAC was earning around $4.59 eps in 2006. Yes they diluted stock since that time and have paid a price for CW but they got a bargain with ML. Merryll is adding at least $10 billion a year and soon enough profits will be $2-$3 share. Adding, it is buying back shares and reducing its float very fast. BAC does not need to increase its value as many companies need to do it by doubling their size. BAC simply needs to get back to where it was - that is a huge difference. Trading below Tangible BV will be seen 5 years from now as a bargain of a lifetime as people describe the would've, could've reaction. Let's see, the housing downturn was suppose to end BAC and it did not (yes government stepped in but for those who are astute investors they should have known that and bought when appropriate), lawsuits were suppose to end BAC and now we are wrapping up the last major lawsuit. BAC has gone on and will continue to go on. People do not recognize the fact THAT IT IS AMERICA. Cannot let 260,000 people lose their jobs! EVER!!! Going back to where we were means at least $30 a share if not $50 a share in the out years. Surprised how many people get shaken out or cannot see the big picture and the picture is $50 share, in a years yes but it is heading there. Buffett bought Coca Cola (another huge franchise) years ago and now gets dividends as much as his original investment thanks to compounding dividend increases. The same will happen to me. I bought bac ALL IN and with Full Margin at $6 and change. I am continually adding BAC on margin as the stock goes up. Those dividends will eventually pay me $1 milloin a year, of course years from now.

Successor Liability wouldn’t have applied under the Delaware Law (Prof. Robert Dane) or even in California (Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer) but under NY the requirements are slightly more plaintiffs friendlier but still does not imply an automatic de-facto merger has taken place. This is the reason why Judge Bransten has left the door open without summary judgement, considering that BoFA did buy CWF assets at "fair market value" (should not be considered as asset transfer). Meanwhile, BoFA had been operating CWF with its own BOD, employees, and independent financial accounting systems, therefore Limited Liability Law would more than likely be applied in the final verdict in my view. Secondly, the CWF assets were sold (liquidated) to BoFA's sister companies at market value for about $40B and the proceeds went directly into an escrow account to pay for the litigation. The $4.3B merely represents how much BoFA has paid to acquire CWF in 2008 (about $4.1B) and after all the litigation involved that is how much CWF would have been worth in 2011 from its litigation ravages.</Msg><Username>cj_observer</Username><Timestamp>1370722804389</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-08 16:20:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370722934051-59</Id><Topic><Title>"Durbin to Bank of America Customers: ‘Get the Heck Out of That Bank’"</Title><Username>bubba92109</Username><Timestamp>1370670241858</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-08 01:44:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm surprised that between you working together you think you could refresh or navigate a browser to a vibrant and provokative yet tasteful page.

The reason why BoFA was hesitant to put CWF into a bankruptcy in 2011 was because of Merrill Lynch. As a direct result of CWF bankruptcy both Merrill Lynch and BoFA would have been downgraded and would have been forced with a larger counter-party liability and it had nothing to do with CWF itself. “Bankruptcy would be a “last-ditch option,” and possibly a costly one, because counterparties might become hesitant to buy the parent company’s debt or open trading lines with its Merrill Lynch unit, David Hendler, a CreditSights Inc. analyst, said in a Sept. 8 note. Credit-rating firms could downgrade Bank of America subsidiaries, which benefit from the implicit support of their corporate parent, he said. That would drive up the bank’s cost of borrowing.” -Bloomberg But, today, both BoFA and Merrill Lynch are in much healthier financial position and can easily take the hit of putting CWF into a bankruptcy without repercussions.</Msg><Username>cj_observer</Username><Timestamp>1370724855579</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-08 16:54:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370726573687-63</Id><Topic><Title>BAC Value</Title><Username>nasa_rss</Username><Timestamp>1370720130743</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-08 15:35:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Adding, the window of opportunity will quickly close as the bac moves up very fast.</Msg><Username>nasa_rss</Username><Timestamp>1370726573687</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-08 17:22:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370727311984-64</Id><Title>dumpo bombie, zevoter, et al., remember what happened to your idol Mussolini?</Title><Msg>Whatcha gonna do when they come for you?</Msg><Username>f.dollarhyde</Username><Timestamp>1370727311984</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-08 17:35:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370727401813-65</Id><Topic><Title>Chickensh!t Tea Bagger Morons</Title><Username>dawg_earl</Username><Timestamp>1370290426739</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-03 16:13:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The same loser Tea Bag fools keep posting the same loser Tea Bag lies.</Msg><Username>f.dollarhyde</Username><Timestamp>1370727401813</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-08 17:36:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370727452215-66</Id><Title>Soon taxpayers will be asked to bail out the investor class buying up home foreclosures!</Title><Msg>Sweet Jesus, make a few jobs so people can buy a house, have a 30 year mortgage and put some kids through school.
