He and many of his relatives enjoy having Connecticut based social security numbers even though no one ever lived there. He was born in Kenya and therefore keeps all his records sealed for very good reason. Not to be exposed. He is a Fraud. His ambition is to bring America to her knees through "financial enslavement" based on continued reckless deficit spending (spending 6 trillion in less than 4 years). Wasting taxpayer money (i.e. funding GM and Solyndra-like companies). 80% of GM's newly reported revenue was for sales of vehicles purchased by the US government! Solyndra everyone knows is a bust. Scamming America through Obamacare which is actually a bill that was passed by senators who did not or could not read entirely (and he put his own name right on it to boot). Pelosi admitantly said " We must pass this RIGHT NOW." Those that tried to read it couldn't understand much of it at all. It cleverly disguises a number of new, hidden taxes that will be added to the lives of every hard working American.</Msg><Username>insider117</Username><Timestamp>1347452729532</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 08:25:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347453026203-42</Id><Topic><Title>Hey XTrader</Title><Username>marvinthemartiansdog</Username><Timestamp>1347393386594</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 15:56:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Right, and he is connected to the NYSE mainframe or something like that.

Set to launch in Septem division of NetSol North America, NetSolCloudVM will provide clients with IT infrastructure on a monthly tiered subscription basis In its updated public cloud forecast in June, Gartner estimated that IaaS was the fastest growing cloud segment with a projected GAGR of 41.7%, and exceeding a $20 billion global market by 2016. "We made a calculated decision to enter this growing market given our years of experience as a software developer, the minimal investment required, and the revenue potential given just the breadth of our current relationships," said Najeeb Ghauri, chairman and CEO of NetSol. "I am fully confident in our highly capable team, reinforced by our talented group of IT professionals, to scale the business quickly and capture a portion of this burgeoning industry, creating an additional revenue driver and further diversifying our revenue mix by geography." "What we are offering, in essence, is private cloud performance at an elastic cloud price -- giving potential customers in our target market segment the performance, flexibility, reliability, and a no-nonsense fixed pricing model that they have long desired," added Imran Haider, COO of NetSol North America and head of NetSolCloudVM. "As a growing software company ourselves, we have critical insights into the efficiency and productivity needs of NetSolCloudVM's target customer base and look forward to unveiling our new services in the coming months."</Msg><Username>d.malkkey</Username><Timestamp>1347460983499</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 10:43:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347461020761-79</Id><Topic><Title>OBAMA APOLOGIZER IN CHIEF</Title><Username>whitest_white</Username><Timestamp>1347460486550</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 10:34:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>how's that arab spring working out?</Msg><Username>dadiooftheradio</Username><Timestamp>1347461020761</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 10:43:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347461529350-80</Id><Title>told you Wall Street is organized crime</Title><Msg>this isn't trading it's organized crime, day in day out by the very few people who actually control the markets, not buyers or sellers..</Msg><Username>tom.foolery2</Username><Timestamp>1347461529350</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 10:52:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347461612177-81</Id><Title>Market walked it up</Title><Msg>Now market walking it down.

Well, little z if you are such a hot shot why don't we see you running for office? The president gets his intelligence briefings every morning and at any other time necessary. He doesn't have to go to them. they come to him. So now you are going to blame the joint chiefs for letting this happen in Libya because the president wasn't at some meeting weeks ago? How silly you are. You, with no experience in National security other than having it provided for you, want to blame people at the top for every incident around the world as if they should be some all knowing all powerful God. It doesn't work that way little z. 9/11 might be a good example, or maybe the bombings in Lebanon. Your world picture must be very limited to the secure western hotels of friendly nations. Obviously you have never been someplace with gunfire in the streets and little government control.

He bashed Obama for being ignorant on foreign policy, and for throwing Israel by the wayside. Allen West tells it like it is. I wish he was running for president; nevertheless we have to support Romney/Ryan as our only chance to save America from going down the sewer. BO cares NOT a bit about our country; he is bent on destroying us, making us into his slaves. Netanyahu just requested a meeting with president Obama and was summarily turned down. Not surprising what with all of the Muslims he has in his personal advisers, as well as throughout the administration, including high security positions, like Hillary. If you do not believe this, do some research. The Muslim Brotherhood is the most prominent, the ones that just raided the American embassy in Egypt.

Finally, we cannot ignore the David Axelrod factor. Axelrod is Obama's chief campaign strategist, who specializes in sloganeering. Axelrod coined the "hope and change" slogan in 2008, and may have helped devise "Forward!" in 2012. Axelrod is likewise a product of this Chicago world, including (to some degree) the communist influences. Axelrod was mentored by David Canter. David and his father, Harry, were part of Chicago's communist orbit. Harry had been secretary of Boston's Communist Party, and both father and son spent the 1930s in Moscow, where Harry worked for the Soviet government as a translator of Lenin's writings. Harry was among the small group that purchased the Chicago Star from Frank Marshall Davis in September 1948. Harry was familiar to Star readers. Among other instances, he appeared in the April 28, 1947 edition, wishing "May Day Greetings" to fellow comrades. Davis would have joined Harry at that May Day parade in Chicago. Davis editorialized in support of the 1947 May Day."</Msg><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1347491932172</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 19:18:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347492066133-153</Id><Topic><Title>ALL BLACKS GET BEHIND YOUR BOY ODUMBO..HE IS GOING TO NEED IT!!!</Title><Username>milesed18</Username><Timestamp>1347491200109</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 19:06:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And this pretentious bee yotch Hell-ary too.

According to annual data from the Census Bureau, median income adjusted for inflation – a closely watched measure of the financial health of average Americans – fell to $50,054 in 2011, or 1.5 per cent below its 2010 level and 4.1 per cent below its score when Mr Obama took office in 2009. More Although real median income had already started to slide beginning in 2008, before Mr Obama entered the White House, the fact that he was not able to reverse that downward trend could expose him to criticism from Mitt Romney, his rival, that his policies have not aided the middle class. In addition to the drop in overall median income, the data also showed a rise in income inequality last year. The release of the dire median figures also offers the latest reminder of the sluggishness of the recovery, marked by high unemployment and weak job creation, which is prompting Federal Reserve officials to consider a new round of monetary easing as early as Thursday.</Msg><Username>gunther_md</Username><Timestamp>1347507477032</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 23:37:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347507688937-211</Id><Topic><Title>When will the white trash tea baggers stop letting the Republican 1% rule them?</Title><Username>f.dollarhyde</Username><Timestamp>1347499664842</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 21:27:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The uneducated racist white trash are so easily manipulated.
