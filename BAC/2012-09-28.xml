France's cabinet has approved the socialist government's first budget since it gained power, with the aim being to cut the country's deficit to 3% next year. The package mainly consists of tax hikes for the rich and big business, and assumes growth of 0.3% this year and 0.8% next year. The budget comes as data shows that France's debt rose to 91% of GDP in Q2 from 86.2% a year earlier.</Msg><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1348835244996</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 08:27:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348835255517-40</Id><Topic><Title>How will we impotent liberals spin the latest horrific display of arrogance and elitist superiority from Obama?</Title><Username>cosmo_vitellii</Username><Timestamp>1348829071336</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 06:44:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you just told us who owns that id.

Knowing how much you dislike me, why should I risk undermining your appreciation of OTHER active-duty and retired service men and women? You DO know how to use the message history feature, don't you? I'm sure with a little effort you can piece together a reasonable picture of my military service from it. If you're genuinely interested in understanding the environment and circumstances under which I served (the height of the air war against the North during the Vietnam War), I recommend you read "Fast Company: Jet Pilots and the Vietnam Experience" by John Darrell Sherwood. During my four-year hitch in the Air Force (1970-73) I supported the Air Force fighter pilots mentioned in that book who flew out of Udorn Royal Thai Air Force Base (including aces Steve Ritchie and Chuck DeBellvue). I was enlisted swine, though: a radar weapons systems flight line technician on F-4 Phantoms. I made sergeant in 20 months, was honorably discharged IN Thailand (my greatest military achievement LOL) in late 1973, and remained in-country as a Defense Communications Agency technician (DoD civilian with a GS-11 rating) for another two years. ROTFLMAO try not to be awed....I certainly wasn't. I'm sure you served far more heroically.</Msg><Username>fish2kill</Username><Timestamp>1348836749487</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 08:52:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348836908426-47</Id><Title>I am not paying Obama to play golf 4 more years while we sink into a depression and nukes spread in the middle east</Title><Msg>No way</Msg><Username>value_investorr</Username><Timestamp>1348836908426</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 08:55:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348837028515-48</Id><Topic><Title>Unbelievable..another hit to earnings..down we frigging go again</Title><Username>hubertus88</Username><Timestamp>1348836561485</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 08:49:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>BAC is preparing for slide and sell-off, while profit-takers are still able to take money off the table.

Obama never used the word "apologize". It's just that anybody with foreign policy experience knows that the intent was patently obvious, except to useful idiots who want to defend him. He apologized and degraded America in the process. Accept it. We may not be "inches" from no longer having a free economy. He should have said "days" or "hours". If you don't believe this, you choose poorly at your own peril, demonstrating no knowledge of economics or of Obama's obvious flaunting of ignoring the rule of law in his everyday maneuvers. Accept it. Your apples/oranges argument on healthcare is ludicrous. The 10th amendment makes it clear that any power not delineated elsewhere resides with the states or the people. You are obviously willing to sign over your rights to a "saintly" narcissist statist twit. I am not, and I will not. Just because you and 40-odd percent of Americans are complete and utter simpletons about Obama does not mean that the rest of us will sit by and accept this. Obama will end medicare, if he has his way, which he will not. It will end with rationing and no doctors willing to accept it because of the reduced payments. Accept it. By the way, where have his budgets been for the past 4 years? Oops, he hasn't sent one that his demcong buddies in the senate are willing to vote on. Where was his open debate on healthcare? Oops, he and his demcong buddies did it behind closed doors, locking out republicans. Where was the rule of law in permitting GM &amp; Chrysler to go through normal bankruptcy instead of Arbamatration? Oops, he gave the senior secured creditors' legitimate asset claims to his union demcong buddies. This man's political being is pure evil. I don't care if he's a good father - he's a horrible human being for what he's doing to this country's future. He's expanded every precedent for an authoritarian executive branch. You don't see it because you choose not to, or you lack the intellect and objectivity. Accept it.</Msg><Username>flippant_1</Username><Timestamp>1348841598761</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 10:13:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348841839228-89</Id><Topic><Title>What's the payout</Title><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1348838377278</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 09:19:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'll gladly take my $341 if you're accurate at all.</Msg><Username>tiglet2l</Username><Timestamp>1348841839228</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 10:17:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348841937523-90</Id><Topic><Title>VERY, VERY fed upwith this institution.</Title><Username>dfaduke</Username><Timestamp>1348838252286</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 09:17:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>special div, how about any div? 10/6/08 dividend cut 50% to 32 cents 1/15/09 dividend cut to 1 cent</Msg><Username>tiglet2l</Username><Timestamp>1348841937523</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 10:18:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348842083216-91</Id><Topic><Title>Obama most recent true statements</Title><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1348839697983</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 09:41:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Idiot.

Durable Goods data was stinky…New orders for manufactured durable goods in August decreased $30.1 billion or 13.2 percent to $198.5 billion, the U.S. Census Bureau announced today. This decrease, down following three consecutive monthly increases, was the largest decrease since January 2009 and followed a 3.3 percent July increase. Excluding transportation, new orders decreased 1.6 percent. Excluding defense, new orders decreased 12.4 percent. Transportation equipment, down following four consecutive monthly increases, had the largest decrease, $27.8 billion or 34.9 percent to $51.9 billion. Who needs durable goods data when surely other economic strength was able to pull GDP much higher than expected? After all, this is a recovery – right? Uh, not so much. In fact, GDP and Durable Goods data were both so bad it made Art Cashin exclaim on TV that they were recessionary…and he’s correct. ZeroHedge said the following about the all-important GDP data that has somehow become meaningless… So much for the US recovery (we will never tire of saying that). After the first Q2 GDP revision bubbled up from 1.5% to 1.7%, the sell-side brigade was confident that the rate of growth would continue and final Q2 GDP would be in line. Instead, we got an absolute shock of a print, with the final Q2 GDP print coming in at a ridiculously low 1.25% (rounded up to 1.3%), below the lowest Wall Street estimate of 1.4%, and the lowest number since the revised 0.1% reported in January 2011. Here is the final GDP trendline: Q4 2011: 4.1%; Q1 2012: 2.0%; Q2 2012: 1.25%. Luckily, at least "housing has bottomed." The reason for the major contraction in the final print: a downward revision to all favorable components except Government which detracted the least from growth in years at just -0.14%. Of note - Personal Consumption was 1.06%, down from the 1.20% per the second revision. If nothing, we now know just what data Bernanke was looking at on an advance basis to come up with QEternity, and we also know the reason for the media and administration's all in gamble to reflate housing yet again. If the housing market does not go up courtesy of infinite cheap leverage, it could be curtains for the Bernanke reflation experiment. Thank goodness, he centrally-planned policy vehicle once upon a time known as "the market" refuses to react to this horrendous, if only for the meaningless economy, news.</Msg><Username>mrj.premier</Username><Timestamp>1348843055530</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 10:37:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348843087176-95</Id><Title>stock buy back</Title><Msg>Will bac announce a stk buy back durung october?</Msg><Username>dickkim2</Username><Timestamp>1348843087176</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 10:38:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348843107586-96</Id><Title>The Next Lawsuit will be for like $50Bil Probable atg this rate!!</Title><Msg>Jesus that is why we are at $8</Msg><Username>fuhcitichien</Username><Timestamp>1348843107586</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 10:38:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348843144816-97</Id><Title>I'm IN oct 5 calls</Title><Msg>Bought a few hundreds october 5 calls at .45, looking for a mild movement for BAC back over 9$ for a healthy profit</Msg><Username>ryanmilliron</Username><Timestamp>1348843144816</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 10:39:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348843705975-98</Id><Title>BAC is really Nations Bank that stole the Bank of America's good name and is now a lousy, corrupt instituion.</Title><Msg>Yes you'll go down the drain.</Msg><Username>amfads</Username><Timestamp>1348843705975</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 10:48:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348843784773-99</Id><Title>Watch they Will Raise Capital Offer More Shares then Reverse Split and be $20!!!

"There has been no shortage of oil in the market. Producers have been able to meet consumer needs," Abdullah al-Badri told an energy conference. "We also see this as being the case for the rest of 2012 and the foreseeable future." Oil prices surged in March to $128 a barrel, the highest level since 2008, because of concern about possible supply shortages. Prices have since fallen back and brent crude was trading around $118 on Thursday. "Today the price continues to be driven by excessive speculation," Badri said. OPEC at a meeting in December set a target to produce 30 million barrels per day, settling an argument which broke out in 2011 after Iran and other members opposed a Saudi-led plan to raise OPEC's production ceiling. Output has remained above the target all year as Libyan supply recovered after being virtually shut down during the 2011 uprising against Muammar Gaddafi's rule. The extra oil is filling gaps caused by an unusually large number of supply outages globally, which have also helped support prices. Supply breaks were running at nearly 1.3 million bpd as of early April. The additional supply has also offset a decline in exports from Iran, which is facing stiffening western sanctions over its disputed nuclear energy program. Iranian oil exports were running at between 200,000 and 300,000 barrels per day below last year's level, Maria van der Hoeven, head of the International Energy Agency, told Thursday's conference. Iranian officials have said the country exported an average of 2.2 million barrels a day last year. July supply from the 12-member Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ran at 31.75 million barrels per day (bpd), the high est since September 2008, which was shortly before it agreed to a series of supply curbs to combat recession and collapsing demand, based on Reuters surveys</Msg><Username>fairvalue23</Username><Timestamp>1348847070027</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 11:44:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348847103987-132</Id><Title>"There has been no shortage of oil in the market"</Title><Msg>"There has been no shortage of oil in the market" OPEC Says Supply Ample, Speculation Driving Price , | 28 September 2012 | 06:18 AM ET Oil supply will be more than sufficient to meet demand this year and beyond, OPEC's Secretary General said on Thursday, but added the price of fuel is being driven higher by speculation.

The rule of law is designed to counter that. BAC doesn't own the loan in all likelihood, but only services it, if the bank is even involved. An investor owns the loan and all the terms &amp; conditions of it, including whether it is assumable. Death does not transfer ownership of debt, only of the asset. If the asset is encumbered, as this one sounds like it was, and the instrument of debt was not assumable (as it sounds like this one was not), then the encumberance must be satisfied -- either paid off or refinanced. If he couldn't qualify for the loan and there weren't enough assets in dad's estate to pay it off, then so sorry to say, it is simply a matter of rule of law. Throw whatever derogatory language you will; the Dodd/Frank regulatory environment makes it very difficult for banks to make loans to people who cannot afford them, just as Messrs. Dodd &amp; Frank originally made it mandatory for banks to give loans to people who could never repay them, which caused the subprime meltdown. And the investor could sue the bank for not fulfilling its obligation under the mortgage t's &amp; c's. This particular hero to our nation has to make a decision that is no more or less relevant to any American, whether war hero or protesting hippie. That decision is whether he can afford to keep an asset he inherited. If he can raise money from friends or find an alternate financier, then all parties are served. But pushing this as a feel-bad story with the only culpability being with the bank is a huge deviation of aim and object. Time to course correct - No blame to the bank for doing what it is legally obligated to do. No blame to the soldier in his father's death or inheriting the house through no fault of his own. Just a need to do this guy a favor and find an alternative that keeps the bank on the right side of the law (which it sounds like it is now), and keeps the soldier in his inherited home -- and do so without impacting the bank's shareholders, who are under no obligation to allow the bank to purposely lose money by picking winners and losers outside of the law.</Msg><Username>flippant_1</Username><Timestamp>1348856273037</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 14:17:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348856713054-193</Id><Topic><Title>I just heard a story</Title><Username>stockbard</Username><Timestamp>1348608276290</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-25 17:24:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This story is not true.</Msg><Username>just_a_little_business</Username><Timestamp>1348856713054</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 14:25:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348856912573-194</Id><Topic><Title>Is BAC Ready to Break Out?</Title><Username>glaydszll432</Username><Timestamp>1348850501843</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 12:41:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I just joined.</Msg><Username>haynes_jeanette559</Username><Timestamp>1348856912573</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 14:28:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348857061840-195</Id><Topic><Title>OMB says Obama budget cuts deficit</Title><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1336357017000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-05-06 22:16:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>OMB scores what they are told, not reality.

NOW the whole world knows about the GOP from their behavior trying to obstruct and sabotage any thing Obama tried to IMPROVE THE ECONOMY of our nation. In the process the GOP was revealed for who they really are- EVIL , TREASONOUS and DANGEROUS for America... and the rest of the world! They have no chance- I say absolutely no chance - to win.

The GOP that are about 22% of the voters. Then he will get about 30% of the female voters which is about 18% overall voters. Also about 30-40 percent of the under age 30, the latinas, and other minorities. Polls show that almost no black will be voting for him; hmm... let's assume about 15% may vote for Mitt. Independents? hardly 35% of them to vote for Mitt... Thus, based on my calculations... all those votes will add up hardly to 46% for Mitt... at best. The debates in all likelihood could end up being disastrous for him... as he shoots from his hip, he is nervous and perspires when he is on the spot... and speaks before he thinks. He is unauthentic and lacks experience in many areas of governance. I have no doubt President Obama will win by a landslide!</Msg><Username>giovannijay</Username><Timestamp>1348875285726</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 19:34:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348875474712-269</Id><Title>Little Big Town Says:</Title><Msg>The only thing better that a barbeque on the Pontoon is barbequing the whole Middle East.

If foreclosures were allowed to continue, you would have lost MORE equity. You saved some interest. And you bought intending to live in it long term? If so, there will be a recovery in home values and you will see appreciation. Be patient. You can sleep well. Your credit isn't ruined and you are secure in that your home is paid for. You're blessed and I respect your responsible decisions. And if you're holding BAC long term? You'll reap another sizable reward. Good things come to those who wait.
