Security was not removed September 11 (Events are listed using the time in Benghazi) 9:42 p.m. -- Armed men begin their assault on the U.S. Consulate. 9:59 p.m. -- A surveillance drone is directed to fly over the U.S. compound, but it is unarmed. 10:32 p.m. -- The Office of the Secretary Defense and the Joint Staff are notified of the attack by the National Military Command Center at the Pentagon. "The information is quickly passed to Secretary Panetta and General Dempsey." 11 p.m. -- Panetta and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Martin Dempsey meet with President Obama at the White House where they discuss the unfolding situation and how to respond. The meeting had been previously scheduled. 11:10 p.m. -- The surveillance drone arrives over the Benghazi facility. 11:30 p.m. -- All surviving U.S. personnel are evacuated from the consulate. U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and State Department computer expert Sean Smith were killed in the initial assault. 2. There were no seals killed that came to the attack on the Consulate. There were two contract employees who use to be Navy seals that were killed in the attack on the safe house at about 2 in the morning at a different location. 3. The attack was over by the time the drone got to the site and you can't send bombers or artillery in on a situation like this. We do not have a declaration of war with the country of Libya and there were no clear targets. You could have destroyed the entire surrounding neighborhood and probably killed nothing but innocent civilians by the time those attacks were able to be mounted and it would have been a violation of international protocol. 4. Who would you like to have secure the consulate after the attack? No forces were on site they were standing by in Croatia and Spain. The personnel were in the safe house and were evacuated. 5. It was a campaign appearance not a fund raiser and the incident was over and nothing more for the president to do about it. He had made his decisions and it was in the hands of the state department, CIA and Military. Case closed.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1354082563676</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 01:02:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354082894910-3</Id><Topic><Title>5 Questions Obama needs to answer before a Congressional Committee with C-Span cameras rolling</Title><Username>the_power_inyou</Username><Timestamp>1354079756795</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 00:15:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Excuse me I made a mistake it didn't start until around 5 not at 2 1:30 a.m. -- A six-man security team from the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli arrives in Benghazi. 2:39 a.m. to 2:53 a.m. -- The National Military Command Center gives formal authorization for the deployment of the two special operations force teams from Croatia and the United States. 5:15 a.m. -- Attackers launch assault on a second U.S. facility in Benghazi.

Magnanimity in victory, and all that. It often works the other way, though. Victors misread their triumph and overplay their hands. Republicans, who failed to retake the White House and lost ground in the Senate, are beginning to accept that they will have to bend on a core principle in the fiscal talks now underway. Federal revenue will have to increase, substantially, with the wealthy taking the biggest hit. Editorials represent the views of The Washington Post as an institution, as determined through debate among members of the editorial board. News reporters and editors never contribute to editorial board discussions, and editorial board members don’t have any role in news coverage. President Obama’s moment Editorial Board NOV 27..To save the nation’s finances, the president has to be bigger than his party. Democrats, meanwhile, are sounding more and more maximalist in resisting spending cuts. Many insist that Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and education — pretty much everything except the Pentagon — are untouchable. Senate Majority Whip Richard J. Durbin (Ill.), who had been one of the more reasonable Democratic leaders, said Tuesday that, while he favors reform of entitlement programs, it shouldn’t be part of the negotiations on the fiscal cliff. The Post’s Greg Sargent reported that union leaders and other liberals came away from a White House meeting encouraged that administration officials agree. “They expect taxes to go up on the wealthy and to protect Medicare and Medicaid benefits,” one attendee said. “They feel confident that they don’t have to compromise.” Don’t have to compromise? Elections do have consequences, and Mr. Obama ran on a clear platform of increasing taxes on the wealthy. But he was clear on something else, too: Deficit reduction must be “balanced,” including spending cuts as well as tax increases. Since 60 percent of the federal budget goes to entitlement programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, there’s no way to achieve balance without slowing the rate of increase of those programs. This could be accomplished in a progressive manner, shielding the poorest beneficiaries from cuts. But that seems less likely to be achieved if progressives boycott serious negotiations by pretending that Social Security and Medicare are sustainable with no reform at all. Mr. Obama has understood this since at least 2009, when he told The Post’s editorial board that he would tackle entitlement reform. “What we have done is kicked this can down the road. We are now at the end of the road and are not in a position to kick it any further,” he said then. “We have to signal seriousness in this by making sure some of the hard decisions are made under my watch, not someone else’s.” Four years later, has the moment arrived? Since his reelection, Mr. Obama has fueled a campaign-style effort to pressure Republicans to give ground on taxes. That’s fine, but it won’t be enough. At some point, he has to prepare the American people — and his own supporters most of all — for the “hard decisions” required to put the country on a sound financial footing. That means spending cuts, it means entitlement reform, it means compromise, it means a balanced solution that will please neither House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) nor Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.).

We are now at the end of the road and are not in a position to kick it any further,” he said then. “We have to signal seriousness in this by making sure some of the hard decisions are made under my watch, not someone else’s.” Four years later, has the moment arrived? Since his reelection, Mr. Obama has fueled a campaign-style effort to pressure Republicans to give ground on taxes. That’s fine, but it won’t be enough. At some point, he has to prepare the American people — and his own supporters most of all — for the “hard decisions” required to put the country on a sound financial footing. That means spending cuts, it means entitlement reform, it means compromise, it means a balanced solution that will please neither House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) nor Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.).

Collins also noted that Rice was working at the State Department in 1998 — and was the assistant secretary for African Affairs — when U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania were bombed. Requests for additional security at both outposts had been denied and Collins said she asked Rice on Wednesday whether she had been involved in those decisions. “She [Rice] said she would have to refresh her memory, but that she was not directly involved in turning down the request,” Collins said. But the senator said Rice must have been aware of the requests.</Msg><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1354142476111</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 17:41:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354142624555-208</Id><Topic><Title>the rice explanation is full of holes</Title><Username>victory_val_2007</Username><Timestamp>1354130407276</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 14:20:07 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>don't you dare disgrace our american soldiers the rice issue is about fools unable to do their job good God where did you people come from ?????</Msg><Username>victory_val_2007</Username><Timestamp>1354142624555</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 17:43:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354142636354-209</Id><Topic><Title>If Obama wants it, Susan Rice WILL be confirmed as Sec. of State.</Title><Username>sammysedwat</Username><Timestamp>1354142021879</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 17:33:41 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>All indications are that you will be spending Christmas with us.
