It's All Good.</Title><Msg>Bank of America is still comparatively cheap trading at 10.5 times forward earnings. The cumulative decline in share price over the last five years is staggering. The underlying trends (deposit- and loan growth, declining provision expenses and net-charge offs) should set the path for future shareholder value generation. In the third quarter 2013 BofA has repurchased 60 million common shares and 140 million shares in the last nine month. Ongoing share repurchases, which are going to happen, provide an additional catalyst for rising share prices. I also expect BofA to initiate a competitive dividend in 2014/2015 that might parallel Wells Fargo's dividend yield of 2-3%. Bank of America represents a cyclical bet on a buoying financial sector in the United States. Long-term Buy.</Msg><Username>cchaker</Username><Timestamp>1382083877654</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-18 04:11:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382088670864-18</Id><Topic><Title>Nothing left for walking dead far-right zombies to do but post ludicrous desperation</Title><Username>ebonics4gfy</Username><Timestamp>1382049910859</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-10-17 18:45:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>They are great at yelping like whipped rats.

Many of these things pay back later. In this case uncontrolled spending, using credit to puff everyone up allowing consumption now with no reasonable hope of reciprocating with similar value production will eventually lead to destruction. This is like when they complain about the cost of missile that can take out a much cheaper box cutter factory but prevent the box cutters from being used to hijack US planes. The trumps may not realize there is more to life than tampons. ROFLMFO. All praise the tampons. The problem is that the religion the libs view as insane and self-defeating has been replaced by a worship of an even more imaginary self that will be defended with even more passion.

They've got all of the other networks and papers printing and spouting bolshevik propaganda all day long, yet they focus on the one network that actually does its job in the fifth estate. It's like when they focus on the House of Representatives despite having the Executive and Senate branches, as well as co-conspirators in the Supreme Court. The only thing it proves is that liberals are voracious whiners who can never overcome their misery even when everyone else is as brainwashed as they are.

As Hannity called on each of them, the guests recounted their “Obamacare” horror stories: canceled policies, premium hikes, restrictions on the freedom to see a doctor of their choice, financial burdens upon their small businesses and so on. “These are the stories that the media refuses to cover,” Hannity interjected. But none of it smelled right to me. Nothing these folks were saying jibed with the basic facts of the Affordable Care Act as I understand them. I understand them fairly well; I have worked as a senior adviser to a governor and helped him deal with the new federal rules. I decided to hit the pavement. I tracked down Hannity’s guests, one by one, and did my own telephone interviews with them. First I spoke with Paul Cox of Leicester, N.C. He and his wife Michelle had lamented to Hannity that because of Obamacare, they can’t grow their construction business and they have kept their employees below a certain number of hours, so that they are part-timers. Obamacare has no effect on businesses with 49 employees or less. But in our brief conversation on the phone, Paul revealed that he has only four employees. Why the cutback on his workforce? “Well,” he said, “I haven’t been forced to do so, it’s just that I’ve chosen to do so. I have to deal with increased costs.” What costs? And how, I asked him, is any of it due to Obamacare? There was a long pause, after which he said he’d call me back. He never did.</Msg><Username>whyduyouask</Username><Timestamp>1382107428259</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-18 10:43:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382107541570-78</Id><Topic><Title>More Lies from FOX Media</Title><Username>whyduyouask</Username><Timestamp>1382107428259</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-18 10:43:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There is only one Obamacare requirement that applies to a company of this size: workers must be notified of the existence of the “healthcare gov” website, the insurance exchange. That’s all. Next I called Allison Denijs. She’d told Hannity that she pays over $13,000 a year in premiums. Like the other guests, she said she had recently gotten a letter from Blue Cross saying that her policy was being terminated and a new, ACA-compliant policy would take its place. She says this shows that Obama lied when he promised Americans that we could keep our existing policies. Allison’s husband left his job a few years ago, one with benefits at a big company, to start his own business. Since then they’ve been buying insurance on the open market, and are now paying around $1,100 a month for a policy with a $2,500 deductible per family member, with hefty annual premium hikes. One of their two children is not covered under the policy. She has a preexisting condition that would require purchasing additional coverage for $800 a month, which would bring the family’s grand total to $19,000 a year. I asked Allison if she’d shopped on the exchange, to see what a plan might cost under the new law. She said she hadn’t done so because she’d heard the website was not working. Would she try it out when it’s up and running? Perhaps, she said. She told me she has long opposed Obamacare, and that the president should have focused on tort reform as a solution to bringing down the price of healthcare. I tried an experiment and shopped on the exchange for Allison and Kurt. Assuming they don’t smoke and have a household income too high to be eligible for subsidies, I found that they would be able to get a plan for around $7,600, which would include coverage for their uninsured daughter. This would be about a 60 percent reduction from what they would have to pay on the pre-Obamacare market.</Msg><Username>whyduyouask</Username><Timestamp>1382107541570</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-18 10:45:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382107642813-79</Id><Topic><Title>More Lies from FOX Media</Title><Username>whyduyouask</Username><Timestamp>1382107428259</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-18 10:43:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Allison also told me that the letter she received from Blue Cross said that in addition to the policy change for ACA compliance, in the new policy her physician network size might be reduced. That’s something insurance companies do to save money, with or without Obamacare on the horizon, just as they raise premiums with or without Obamacare coming. If Allison’s choice of doctor was denied her through Obamacare then, yes, she could have a claim that Obamacare has hurt her. But she’d also have thousands of dollars in her pocket that she didn’t have before. Finally, I called Robbie and Tina Robison from Franklin, Tenn. Robbie is self-employed as a Christian youth motivational speaker. (You can see his work here.) On Hannity, the couple said that they, too, were recently notified that their Blue Cross policy would be expiring for lack of ACA compliance. They told Hannity that the replacement plans Blue Cross was offering would come with a rate increase of 50 percent or even 75 percent, and that the new offerings would contain all sorts of benefits they don’t need, like maternity care, pediatric care, prenatal care and so forth. Their kids are grown and moved out, so why should they be forced to pay extra for a health plan with superfluous features? When I spoke to Robbie, he said he and Tina have been paying a little over $800 a month for their plan, about $10,000 a year. And the ACA-compliant policy will cost 50-75 percent more? They said this information was related to them by their insurance agent. Had they shopped on the exchange yet, I asked? No, Tina said, nor would they. They oppose Obamacare and want nothing to do with it. Fair enough, but they should know that I found a plan for them for, at most, $3,700 a year, a 63 percent less than their current bill. It might cover things that they don’t need, but so does every insurance policy.</Msg><Username>whyduyouask</Username><Timestamp>1382107642813</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-18 10:47:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382107702009-80</Id><Topic><Title>More Lies from FOX Media</Title><Username>whyduyouask</Username><Timestamp>1382107428259</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-18 10:43:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It’s true that we don’t know for sure whether certain ills conservatives have warned about will occur once Obamacare is fully enacted. For example, will we truly have the same freedom to choose a physician that we have now? Will a surplus of insured patients require a scaling back (or “rationing,” as some call it) of provided healthcare services? Will doctors be able to spend as much time with patients? These are all valid, unanswered questions. The problem is that people like Sean Hannity have decided to answer them now, without evidence. Or worse, with fake evidence. I don’t doubt that these six individuals believe that Obamacare is a disaster; but none of them had even visited the insurance exchange. And some of them appear to have taken actions (Paul Cox, for example) based on a general pessimistic belief about Obamacare. He’s certainly entitled to do so, but Hannity is not entitled to point to Paul’s behavior as an “Obamacare train wreck story” and maintain any credibility that he might have as a journalist. Strangely, the recent shutdown was based almost entirely on a small percentage of Congress’s belief that Obamacare, as Ted Cruz puts it, “is destroying America.” Cruz has rarely given us an example of what he’s talking about. That’s because the best he can do is what Hannity did—exploit people’s ignorance and falsely point to imaginary boogeymen.</Msg><Username>whyduyouask</Username><Timestamp>1382107702009</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-18 10:48:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382107704951-81</Id><Topic><Title>$125,000 return on investment with SEEK with its search engine TheDirectory.

But for the sake of putting the monstrous amount of money into perspective, here are a few figures to chew on: Facebook, which received its first investment in June 2004, operated for a full six years before surpassing the $500 million mark in June 2010. Twitter, created in 2006, managed to get by with only $360.17 million in total funding until a $400 million boost in 2011. Instagram ginned up justt $57.5 million in funding before Facebook bought it for (a staggering) $1 billion last year. And LinkedIn and Spotify, meanwhile, have only raised, respectively, $200 million and $288 million.” Indeed, not only is the $500 million blown on Obamacare websites a lot by Washington standards, but even some of the most successful names in Silicon Valley history spent fractions of that sum to steer their projects to the pinnacle of the Web. “There have been more expensive government boondoggles over the years,” American Thinker blogger Rick Moran added. “But as a metaphor for government incompetence, this example takes the cake.” Couts settled at his latest estimate by taking into account the “almost $394 million from fiscal year 2010 through March 2013” awarded in federal contracts to build the “federally facilitated exchanges,” or FFEs, including healthcare.gov and similar sites. Not all of that figure was used towards building the site, Couts determined, but roughly $363 million did get funneled towards technology-related costs, which was then topped off by at least $150 million just during 2012 and 2013, according to budget requests filed by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services to go towards the sites. “At this point I can only speculate on the total cost to build out Healthcare.gov and the related FFEs. Based on the available data, however, a conservative estimate puts the cost so far at over $500 million,” he wrote.</Msg><Username>pokerface_liar</Username><Timestamp>1382109974927</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-18 11:26:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1382109978963-104</Id><Title>You know you are a Teabagger if you consider the fifth grade you senior year.</Title><Msg>Inbreed and vote GOP !</Msg><Username>teabagsonscrotum</Username><Timestamp>1382109978963</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-18 11:26:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1382110071972-105</Id><Title>You know you are a Teabagger if your brother-in-law is also your uncle.</Title><Msg>and you vote GOP !!</Msg><Username>teabagsonscrotum</Username><Timestamp>1382110071972</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-18 11:27:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382110332669-106</Id><Topic><Title>ObamaCare FAILS again ....</Title><Username>dumbama.sucks</Username><Timestamp>1382103522971</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-18 09:38:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Saw in the newspaper this morning (Lafayette,La) that a total of 50 people has signed up for Oblundercare.

If what i'm hearing is any indication, it appears that the electorate is very unhappy with the display of cowardice by their elected representatives, and the pendulum may be swinging much further right in the next election.

Recall that GOP dissatisfaction levels were high in 2009 as well, and we all know how that turned out for sitting GOP moderates and for libs. If anything, double it.

Even if the new checking account is introduced, Bank of America will still offer its existing checking account -- which will remain unchanged. For more than two years, the bank's checking accounts have not allowed customers to overdraw funds at the point of sale, like when you're checking out at a cash register. The new account would not only stop overdrafts from happening at the point of sale, but it would also prevent them from occurring on any other transactions, including ATM withdrawals, automatic bill payments and checks. Currently, customers are dinged with a fee of $35 each time they overdraw their accounts in these ways.</Msg><Username>cchaker</Username><Timestamp>1382125783866</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-18 15:49:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1382126066744-169</Id><Title>GST</Title><Msg>breakin out!</Msg><Username>pacer12</Username><Timestamp>1382126066744</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-18 15:54:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1382126157096-170</Id><Title>BAC GRWTH Estimates</Title><Msg>Growth Est BAC Current Qtr. 833.30% Next Qtr. 200.00%</Msg><Username>cchaker</Username><Timestamp>1382126157096</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-18 15:55:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1382126511052-171</Id><Title>whats with AH.......</Title><Msg>jumped 10 cents from close on some vol......... more opex bs probably</Msg><Username>iamagod991</Username><Timestamp>1382126511052</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-18 16:01:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382126661501-172</Id><Topic><Title>whats with AH.......</Title><Username>iamagod991</Username><Timestamp>1382126511052</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-18 16:01:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>An announcement hit the wires that JPM may be in a $4 billion mortgage settlement.</Msg><Username>tigger.redux</Username><Timestamp>1382126661501</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-18 16:04:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382126732816-173</Id><Topic><Title>Bank of America is considering a new checking account that will prohibit overdrafts</Title><Username>cchaker</Username><Timestamp>1382125783866</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-18 15:49:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What a concept.

On Oct. 17, Chase Manhattan issued letters to their depositors that beginning in November, capital controls would be implemented on their accounts and money, limiting them to total cash transactions of $50,000 per month, and halting wire transfers outside the U.S. for most depositors. These new policies, which will devastate small business and place a burden on anyone wishing to purchase high end items with cash only, is being done primarily because the banks have reached the end of their liquidity, and according to the Guerrilla Economist, are completely broke and insolvent.</Msg><Username>dumbama.sucks</Username><Timestamp>1382147581961</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-18 21:53:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1382147780235-231</Id><Title>US Debt Tops 17 Trillion</Title><Msg>Washington Spends spends spends spends spends</Msg><Username>biotech.king</Username><Timestamp>1382147780235</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-18 21:56:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382147790257-232</Id><Topic><Title>The overwhelming majority of patriotic Americans despise Obamacrats obsession with Big Government controlling every aspect of our lives!</Title><Username>dumbama.sucks</Username><Timestamp>1382145592307</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-18 21:19:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Don't use the words "patriotic Americans" When you talk about tea party terrorists, they are not even American.
