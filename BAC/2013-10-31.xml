There have been estimates about hundreds of thousands of people losing coverage, CBS News' Jan Crawford reported on "CBS This Morning." CBS News has reached out to insurance companies across the country to determine some of the real numbers -- and this is just the tip of the iceberg, Crawford said. The people who are opening the letters are shocked to learn they can't keep their insurance policies despite President Obama's assurances to the contrary. The White House is on the defensive trying to explain it, after Mr. Obama repeatedly said, "If you like your doctor or health care plan, you can keep it." White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said, "What the president said and what everybody said all along is that there are going to be changes brought about by the Affordable Care Act to create minimum standards of coverage." It's an unexpected reality of Obamacare being told through anecdotes in local papers and on social media. But the hard numbers reveal the evidence is far more than anecdotal. CBS News has confirmed with insurance companies across the country that more than two million people are getting notices they no longer can keep their existing plans. In California, there are 279,000; in Michigan, 140,000; Florida, 300,000; and in New Jersey, 800,000. And those numbers are certain to go even higher. Some companies who tell CBS News they've sent letters won't say how many. Industry experts like Larry Levitt, of the Kaiser Family Foundation, say the insurance companies have no choice. "What we're seeing now is reality coming into play," he said. Obamacare forces them to drop many of their plans that don't meet the law's 10 minimum standards, including maternity care, emergency visits, mental healt</Msg><Username>doncassel365</Username><Timestamp>1383197852908</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-10-31 01:37:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1383197886179-11</Id><Topic><Title>October 29, 2013 7:18 AM Obamacare: More than 2 million people getting booted from existing health insurance plans</Title><Username>doncassel365</Username><Timestamp>1383197852908</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-10-31 01:37:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That means consumers have to sign on to new plans even if they don't want or need the more generous coverage. Industry experts say about half the people getting the letters will pay more -- and half will pay less, thanks to taxpayer subsidies. Levitt said, "The winners outnumber the losers here, but because of all the website problems, it's hard to find out who the winners are because they don't even know it themselves." And for the people who've gotten the letters, the broken website is a real problem, Crawford added on "CTM." They don't know what to do. They don't know if they get subsidies. And then there are others getting the letters who have very good insurance but are being told they can't keep it. Industry experts CBS News talked to say for everyone, the best bet is to just call their insurance companies to get the information.</Msg><Username>doncassel365</Username><Timestamp>1383197886179</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-10-31 01:38:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1383201288817-12</Id><Title>"I Take Full Responsibility"</Title><Msg>I heard Obama and Sebellius say this repeatedly but what does it mean?

It's really embarrassing when I see democrats like that trying to play the part. Not impressive at all. Oh by the way, I'll be going over to Starbucks and wearing my new $1100 Chanel sweater. Do you think the manager will be impressed?</Msg><Username>thurstonbillingsley</Username><Timestamp>1383227968601</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-10-31 09:59:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1383228090209-40</Id><Title>Stock Set to Rally 45% Next Week!</Title><Msg>Agria (GRO) is set to rally 45% from $1.30 to $1.88 over the next 3-5 trading days. GRO's 80.81% owned Agria Asia subsidiary owns 379.1mm shares of PGG Wrightson (PGW.NZ), New Zealand's largest agriculture company, which brokeout last night by rising $0.02 to NZ$0.41 per share. GRO's PGW shares are now worth $104.12 million and GRO has 55.38 million shares outstanding, which means GRO is about to rise to $1.88. A few weeks ago when PGW was only $0.38, GRO's stake in PGW was worth $1.74 per share and GRO rallied from $1.12 to $1.74 for a gain of 55% in just two weeks. Afterwards, GRO fell back down to $1.30 due to one major investor cashing out for personal reasons unrelated to the company. GRO bounced strongly yesterday off of its 50-day moving average of $1.25 and with the seller now 95% gone and PGW rising last night to NZ$0.41 on the New Zealand Exchange, GRO is about to rally by 45% to $1.88 between now and this time next week! Take advantage of any GRO shares available here it is the biggest blessing of our lifetimes! GRO is artificially low and must rise to $1.88 based on the rising value of its PGW shares! For every 1 penny PGW rises, GRO's stake in the company increases in value by $0.0459 per share! Whatever price PGW trades at, GRO's proper value is a share price that is 4.59X higher! (We own 550,000 shares of GRO and don't intend to sell until GRO is trading at MUCH higher prices.)</Msg><Username>ahara45</Username><Timestamp>1383228090209</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-10-31 10:01:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1383228160525-41</Id><Topic><Title>$8.5 billion settlement is one big step closer</Title><Username>nasa_rss</Username><Timestamp>1383185129389</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-30 22:05:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>AIG Ceo is a greedy ……you fill in the word.

Too bad the SEC is so powerless.</Msg><Username>dfaduke</Username><Timestamp>1383233178710</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-10-31 11:26:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1383233182251-75</Id><Title>MOMO STOCK ON ( IALS ) You Better to Check to Prove Sure Winner today!!!</Title><Msg>$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$</Msg><Username>yson</Username><Timestamp>1383233182251</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-10-31 11:26:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1383233261371-76</Id><Topic><Title>Will Endless Bank Charges and Settlements Kill the Economy?</Title><Username>doncassel365</Username><Timestamp>1383181930499</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-30 21:12:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Don, to be factual it is best if you quote someone you put it in quotes and cite the author, but it is quite obvious you are quoting someone. It was a good article which pointed out that the endless legal issues will suppress loan demand - all in the cause of populist vengance and fee/fine income to the gov't. Worse is the irony that BAC and JPM were strong armed by the regulators Paulson, Bair etal, into taking on Merrill, Bear Stearns and WAMU, then getting sued for the sins of the acquired co's. Paulson's interview with Bartaromo was quite telling.</Msg><Username>jhitcher2011</Username><Timestamp>1383233261371</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-10-31 11:27:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1383234111805-77</Id><Topic><Title>Will Endless Bank Charges and Settlements Kill the Economy?</Title><Username>doncassel365</Username><Timestamp>1383181930499</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-30 21:12:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It was obvious to all those of us with at least half a brain.

Open enrollment for 2014 is about to begin at thousands of companies, and many employers are blaming Obamacare -at least in part-for cost increases they are passing on to their workers. Employees' costs are expected to rise 5 to 7 percent next year, according to early estimates. Those annual increases have been a fixture for years.

Thye had supposedly the cream of the crop civil lawyers. The best minds in the country defending this case. 20 whole minutes it took them to vote guilty.

I've read your posts and know that you apparently have a heavy short position..... it shows in all your posts. No one would post such negative dialog unless they were really worried about their short position. Just a word of advice..... I don't post often but you seem like a decent fellow. Be VERY careful here. It may drop to the $13.50ish level at best but it will be short lived. Hopefully your timing will be spot-on but just be careful. BAC is not ever going away and the uphill trend will grab hold within a couple of months. Short as you may but plan for the quick unnoticeable turn-a-round.

This is what banking is all about - ripping off the public, ripping off shareholders, ripping off customers. Banks used to provide a service to the community to help small business grow, to help families buy homes, to help with college education loans and improve America, but not anymore. It all about ripping everyone off.
