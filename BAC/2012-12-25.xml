Don't know where you were. Didn't matter what you made there, you got a bigger piece of the pie: when they take 15% instead of whatever your higher figure was, that's helpful. I suppose if you don't save and invest for your future it doesn't matter. The rebate was stupid. I agree. Since it's Mr. Obama that originally and I'm sure still wouldn't like any of us to keep any tax cuts, I don't know what your rant is against Bush. If you didn't like the Iraq war, you should have told your congressmen to vote against it....and/or to put some legislation thru to cover costs. When Bush is president you say he's responsible for the costs....when Obama is you say the president doesn't have that power, only congress does. Me, I can't seem to go two ways.

First Obama has cut spending on many programs. The financial crisis is because of republican belief in trickle down economics and not meeting fiscal responsibilities from the Reagan administration on. Only Clinton was financially responsible. The problem is not spending it is not providing revenue for the spending and not collecting taxes to pay for republican wars. The dept was mostly created by Reagan and Bush which put us on this path to calamity whether on purpose or just from ignorance. Obama has behaved financially responsibly to put us on a path to recovery while republicans have been bent on a path to destroy the safety net for citizens while lining the pockets of the very rich. The "starve the beast" program of the right wing fringe has brought the nation to it's knees but now the republicans are being thrown out. The economy will be restored by responsible demoocrat leadership.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1356465092069</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-25 14:51:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356467291951-31</Id><Topic><Title>DEMS: NO BUDGET IN 4 YEARS AND NO PLAN THAT ADDRESSES THE DEBT CRISIS</Title><Username>carburetorkid</Username><Timestamp>1356366264947</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-24 11:24:24 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>OBAMA HAS TRIPLED THE US CREDIT CARD</Msg><Username>pastel_hero</Username><Timestamp>1356467291951</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-25 15:28:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356467397303-32</Id><Topic><Title>THE FISCAL CLIFF SIMPLIFIED AMAZING!</Title><Username>purebred_red</Username><Timestamp>1356457453373</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-25 12:44:13 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>DEFININATELY A SPENDING PROBLEM</Msg><Username>turtle_toss</Username><Timestamp>1356467397303</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-25 15:29:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356468791699-33</Id><Title>79 New Democratic Voters Hit the Streets</Title><Msg>California Gov.

The argument against big cuts, typically made by Keynesian economists, is twofold. First, large cuts in government spending, with no offsetting tax cuts, will lead to a large drop in aggregate demand for goods and services, thus causing a recession or even a depression. Second, with a major shift in demand (fewer government goods and services and more private ones), the economy would experience a wrenching readjustment, during which many people would become unemployed, and the economy would slow down. But if such claims were true, wouldn’t history confirm them? And wouldn’t the decline in the economy be large when the government cuts spending a lot? That’s certainly what the late Keynesian economist Paul Samuelson thought. Well, Samuelson was wrong, and not just wrong, but spectacularly wrong. In a 2010 study for the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, I examined the four years from 1944, the peak of World War II spending, to 1948. Over those years, the U.S. government cut spending from a high of 44 percent of gross national product (GNP) in 1944 to only 8.9 percent in 1948, a drop of over 35 percentage points of GNP. The result was an astonishing boom. The unemployment rate, which was artificially low at the end of the war because many millions of workers had been drafted into the U.S. armed services, did increase. But between 1945 and 1948, it reached its peak at only 3.9 percent in 1946. From September 1945 to December 1948, the average unemployment rate was 3.5 percent. Most of the policies that Samuelson had feared actually happened, and in spades. Price controls were eliminated. Not only was the federal budget deficit decreased, but also, in 1947, the budget surplus was over 5 percent of GNP. Demobilization happened big-time. Between 1945 and 1947, when the postwar transition was complete, the number of people in the armed forces fell by 10.5 million. Civilian employment by the armed forces fell by 1.8 million, and military-related employment in industry fell off the cliff from 11.0 million to 0.8 million. As demobilization proceeded, optimistic employers in the private sector scooped up millions of the soldiers, sailors, and others who had been displaced from the armed forces and from military industries. What Do You Believe: The Official Data or Your Own Lying Eyes? According to official government data, in 1946, the U.S. economy suffered the worst one-year recession in its history. The official data show a 12-percent decline in real GNP after the war. That certainly sounds like a depression. So, is the story about a postwar boom pure myth? No. What is mythical are the government’s data. Ask most people who were young adults in those years (a steadily diminishing number of people, so talk to them soon) about economic conditions after the war, and they will talk about “the postwar boom.” Why is there such a disconnect between their perceptions and the data? There are two reasons.</Msg><Username>sablepony</Username><Timestamp>1356475616574</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-25 17:46:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356475941095-43</Id><Topic><Title>DEMS: NO BUDGET IN 4 YEARS AND NO PLAN THAT ADDRESSES THE DEBT CRISIS</Title><Username>carburetorkid</Username><Timestamp>1356366264947</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-24 11:24:24 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No one has addressed this simple truth</Msg><Username>saintly_jim</Username><Timestamp>1356475941095</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-25 17:52:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356475982952-44</Id><Topic><Title>DEMS: NO BUDGET IN 4 YEARS AND NO PLAN THAT ADDRESSES THE DEBT CRISIS</Title><Username>carburetorkid</Username><Timestamp>1356366264947</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-24 11:24:24 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>As has been said before, why is the budget Bush's fault when he's president, and congress's fault when Obama is president?</Msg><Username>abloomingradish</Username><Timestamp>1356475982952</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-25 17:53:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356476064608-45</Id><Topic><Title>DEMS: NO BUDGET IN 4 YEARS AND NO PLAN THAT ADDRESSES THE DEBT CRISIS</Title><Username>carburetorkid</Username><Timestamp>1356366264947</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-24 11:24:24 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A prime example of why one cannot do anything much with most democrats.
