That is only part of why we have thousands of three legged and two legged pigs in DC -- the pols can't bear to kill or eat the entire beast all at once, just one leg at time as they have fond place in their hearts for the animals that saved the global capital markets. BAC, JPM and WFC continue to bear billions and billions more than their respective share of those costs (Countryfraud, Merrill, WAMU, Bear Stearns, Golden West, etc) because they can and the govt wants a scapegoat so they don;t have to blame themselves for CRAct, uneconomic affordable housing programs and policies encouraging -- no, insisting -- on giving credit to people who could ill afford to borrow anything let alone finance a home, and ridiculously ineffective administration of then existing regulatory oversight. FNM and FRE are the same disaster -- except now they are both 1 legged pigs being milked and milked because they are very helpful with the Federal budget deficit. Housing policy in the US remains effd with no economic resolution in sight... a big reason the Fed will be artificially sponsoring uneconomic interest rates for longer than understood by most. We all see what Jamie Dimun has brought onto himself and JPM for calling himself "just barely a democrat" and Dodd Frank and enabling regulations "incredibly stupid" from a policy and regulatory perspective. Now WFC's ceo is throwing stink bombs around about these policies, the TARP debacle that helped the govt while effing the healthy banks incl BAC, JPM and WFC. And still more ridiculous nonsense is oozing on prop trading and consumer protection coming from Elizabeth Warren and her pal Mr 50.01% republican and leader of Keating Five, illustrious senator McCain.</Msg><Username>squeezetracker</Username><Timestamp>1382614780876</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-10-24 07:39:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382614818674-129</Id><Topic><Title>Early trades</Title><Username>gopats1112</Username><Timestamp>1382611147347</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-10-24 06:39:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Trades are posted on site starting 4:15 am till 9:30 remember foreign markets open 9 pm EST in Asia then Europe US stocks will traded there</Msg><Username>jack_mlyn</Username><Timestamp>1382614818674</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-10-24 07:40:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382615422485-130</Id><Topic><Title>insigificant lawsuit</Title><Username>pmknauf</Username><Timestamp>1382574437140</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-23 20:27:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wow..... finally a smart observation.

Yes, opens the door to many more lawsuits, BUT, BAC lawyers are already looking at appeals on grounds as above. We feel strongly it is a emotional jury finding as many have been hurt by banks.

Why hasn't Moynihan dumped it? The answer is complicated, but he most likely is doing everything he can to salvage the bank's reputation. That may sound like a silly thing to say, but for a bank to take any part of itself bankrupt could have major implications. In addition, since BAC literally stripped Countrywide of all of its "good" assets at the time of the merger, creditors could argue that BAC has liability because of that move. Stripping all the good assets and leaving all the bad, then bankrupting it could be a hard sell. Finally, a bankruptcy such as this would probably be very messy, very public, and last many years. The legal questions surrounding successor liability are murky, and will cause a lot of fighting. I think Moynihan has been trying to avoid that simply because the risks still outweigh the rewards in such a step. Yes, it has already cost the bank billions, but if the bank were to lose in bankruptcy, and still be found legally liable as successor for everything, it could make things even worse.</Msg><Username>tigger.redux</Username><Timestamp>1382625222457</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-10-24 10:33:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382625303091-207</Id><Topic><Title>I signed up for Obamacare with no trouble, but I get paid to post that I dint</Title><Username>kingofvietnam</Username><Timestamp>1382623739161</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-10-24 10:08:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Not only that, but all my other IDs got paid to.</Msg><Username>kingofvietnam</Username><Timestamp>1382625303091</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-10-24 10:35:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382625332434-208</Id><Topic><Title>Called Investors Relations... waiting for response</Title><Username>nasa_rss</Username><Timestamp>1382624492107</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-10-24 10:21:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Google "Brian Moynihan Interviewd" find the Jan 30, 2012 interview and read the transcript.

Essentially the lady said (and I am just paraphrasing since I did not take notes) that there are possible legal challenges if BAC would put Countrywide into Bankruptcy. That in other words they may be challenged and stopped from being able to do it that it is not necessary just a slam dunk. I guess the last thing we need are even more lawsuits. Although she would not answer my question on how much they anticipate paying out over the next two years in settlements and legal expenses and also would not tell me the amount in their legal reserve either. At least I tried. I guess we are stuck with these d%#m lawsuits and can only throw Countrywide into BK in an absolute last ditch effort. I did get the feeling that she felt as if these legal issues are going to quickly subside. But my great concern is we just keep getting hit by new lawsuits, that they simply do not end and after our recent guilty of fraud lawsuit my guess is the lawsuits will really start to fly in.</Msg><Username>nasa_rss</Username><Timestamp>1382625520056</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-10-24 10:38:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382625532845-210</Id><Topic><Title>The radical left hacked my mail and made my disability check and food stamps late again</Title><Username>kingofvietnam</Username><Timestamp>1382623559703</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-10-24 10:05:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Who scrmbled that up?

GRO's 80.81% owned Agria Asia subsidiary owns a controlling 50.22% stake in PGG Wrightson (PGW.NZ), the largest agriculture company in New Zealand. PGG Wrightson is projecting EBITDA this fiscal year of NZ$52-$56mm (USD$44-$47mm), which will equal huge growth of 14%-22%. Agria Asia's 50.22% of PGG Wrightson's projected EBITDA is USD$22.1-$23.6mm. GRO's 80.81% of Agria Asia's projected EBITDA is USD$17.85-$19.07mm. GRO also owns a China seeds business which will likely add about USD$2 million to GRO's EBITDA, which could give GRO total EBITDA of $19.85-$21.07mm. A valuation of just 10X EBITDA could give GRO a market cap of $198.5mm-$210.7mm. With 55.38mm shares outstanding, this would equal a GRO share price of $3.58-$3.80. GRO just reduced its debt to $75mm, with short-term debt of $43mm and $32mm that matures in May 2008. GRO has $26.8mm in pledged restricted cash deposits that can be used towards paying off its debt plus another $42.7 million in unrestricted cash. Therefore, GRO's net debt is only $5.5mm and GRO will likely receive over $10mm in cash dividend payments from PGW.NZ next year. Disclaimer: We own 550,000 shares of GRO and intend to sell these shares at much higher prices.</Msg><Username>tomdjgf7</Username><Timestamp>1382642515619</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-10-24 15:21:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1382642558989-335</Id><Title>Reagan raised the Debt ceiling 17 times and tripled US debt and deficits !</Title><Msg>It is a fact Teabaggers !</Msg><Username>teabagsonscrotum</Username><Timestamp>1382642558989</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-10-24 15:22:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382642749410-336</Id><Topic><Title>Reagan raised the Debt ceiling 17 times and tripled US debt and deficits !</Title><Username>teabagsonscrotum</Username><Timestamp>1382642558989</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-10-24 15:22:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He had to.

Lower lows, lower highs and very light volume, especially on the heels of very negative news and average volume that's been dropping for months, are hardly indicative of a turn-around. A 3% or greater down day on more than 150% average volume is the threshold for what I would call capitulation and reversal. Until then, it'll be up &amp; down, down &amp; up with no real direction and no significant moves barring major surprises or news. Looks like dead money to all but the sharpest of day traders, and even some of the sharpest of that breed have been reading their tea leaves wrong lately.

Everyone got sucker punched by the events that followed.</Msg><Username>tigger.redux</Username><Timestamp>1382650818181</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-10-24 17:40:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382651480914-370</Id><Topic><Title>These lawsuits are getting out of hand !

Last year when the Affordable Care Act was being debated in the Supreme Court, Justice Samuel Alito pointed out that the crucial component central to the sustainability of Obamacare is the concentration of cost burden on healthy American youth ages 18-35 to offset the cost of covering older Americans with pre-existing conditions. Currently, on average within the 18-35 age group, $854. annually is what is spent on health care .Based on non-partisan estimates, state exchanges need at least 2.7M signed up in the 18-35 year old category and spend a minimum of $5800. on average. If not, the state exchanges will FAIL! In fairness, with the IRS Sheriff of Nottingham bounty hunters on the case, the 2.7M enrolled SHOULD rise to numbers that will spread the overall cost out to more palatable levels. Also in fairness, Justice Alito is a staunch conservative BUT, his comments right about now have a kind of Nostradamus quality to it, don't you think?

My daughter is 26, single, no kids, with a master's in occupational therapy (magna cum laude). Based in Massachusetts, she works through various agency as a contractor (a "Travel OT") in Arizona (primarily greater Phoenix area schools systems). SOMETIMES she has access to and and coverage under employer-provided insurance plans that she pays dearly for, (sorry, I don't have an exact number since those plans are always changing, expiring at the end of a school year, absent altogether between contracts, or not yet in effect thanks to a new agency's 30-day waiting period for benefits to kick in on a new job). Even when she IS covered, though, these plans never seem to cover much. She is practically doing handsprings about the prospect of access to an AFA plan costing around $500 a month that will actually cover her for both minor and major illnesses, catastrophic illnesses and injuries (with a high deductible), preventative tests and wellness programs, etc. More significantly, it will also cover medical expenses associated with pre-existing conditions (in her case, mitral valve leakage since birth, migraines since childhood, and kidney stones since her early teens). And then there's the BIG bonus: she can actually preserve her coverage (on a pay-as-you go basis) when she's between jobs with no income . You can fling all the BS horror stories and made-up numbers you want against the cyberwall, but out there in the real world my real daughter knows how to do real math and spend her real, hard-earned money responsibly (in a good year, almost 70K, and in a bad one, not even 40). She's bright, hard-working, competent, a risk-taker, and doing better than about 95% of her contemporaries from high school and college.
