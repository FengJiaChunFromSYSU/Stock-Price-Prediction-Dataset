THIS WEEK REPORT COMPARES ATEA TO DWCH BEFORE DWCH RALLIED FROM $3 TO $30+....INCREDIBLE GROUND-FLOOR OPPORTUNITY</Title><Msg>This week's Seekingalpha article compares ATEA to DWCH before it went from $3 to $30. ATEA has seen an exponential increase in interest for its cloud-delivery mode of its software for service life-cycle management and mobility solutions. ATEA has recently released the most advanced software solution in the industry and has partnered with global IT/Software giants Wipro and Capgemini. ATEA's market cap is only $10M and it's trading at 0.5 X sales compared to DWCH's 7++. Excerpts of Seekingalpha article: ATEA -A Stock Under $3 Poised To Climb Higher ATEA has positioned itself for potentially significant growth through a recent convergence of the following positive developments: 1) a significant uptick in cloud software as a service wins - a trend that is expected to continue, 2) an increase in its backlog for professional services, 3) the recent announcement of a major software release, and 4) numerous recent announcements of sales and marketing alliances with large global firms. The company appears ready to capitalize on a significant recent interest for the company's SaaS delivery model. Last quarter ATEA reported that that number of cloud users increased by 587% compared to the prior quarter. Monthly contracted recurring revenue increased 245% quarter to quarter. Last year at this time, the company did not have any cloud subscribers. Zack Bergreen, founder/CEO of ATEA stated recently, "We've optimized our business both strategically and operationally, to better adapt to the increasing customer adoption of the cloud SaaS business model, and as a result, these actions we are now well positioned for growth and increased revenues. We are seeing an increase in the number of sizable companies, around the world, that are interested in our robust service management solution. In addition to this positive trend, our professional services backlog is growing. Accordingly, we are confident that we will return to profitability by the end of the year"</Msg><Username>twittyforever</Username><Timestamp>1381386498567</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-10-10 02:28:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381386961405-20</Id><Topic><Title>Tony Dungee, I'm not gonna ignore you, because you at the "very" least, made a factual statement.</Title><Username>doncassel365</Username><Timestamp>1381372810486</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-09 22:40:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>excellent Idea!!</Msg><Username>tony_dungeee</Username><Timestamp>1381386961405</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-10-10 02:36:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381387828576-21</Id><Topic><Title>Obama may actually do something now, his poll numbers are falling faster than Anthony Weiner's pants.</Title><Username>the_power_inyou</Username><Timestamp>1381379892220</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-10-10 00:38:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Liberals Always overestimate their appeal to the regular folks.

However, barry's "lawyers" found a supposed out that he felt allowed him to bypass the payments, despite the bill having been reviewed in advance by the DoD specifically for those payments.

Americans spend $36,000,000 at Wal-Mart Every hour of every day. 2. This works out to $20,928 profit every minute! 3. Wal-Mart will sell more from January 1 to St. Patrick's Day (March 17th) than Target sells all year. 4. Wal-Mart is bigger than Home Depot + Kroger + Target +Sears + Costco + K-Mart combined. 5. Wal-Mart employs 1. 6 million people, is the world's largest private employer, and most speak English. 6. Wal-Mart is the largest company in the history of the world. 7. Wal-Mart now sells more food than Kroger and Safeway combined, and keep in mind they did this in only fifteen years. 8. During this same period, 31 big supermarket chains sought bankruptcy. 9. Wal-Mart now sells more food than any other store in the world. 10. Wal-Mart has approx 3,900 stores in the USA of which 1,906 are Super Centers; this is 1,000 more than it had five years ago. 1 1. This year 7.2 billion different purchasing experiences will occur at Wal-Mart stores. (Earth's population is approximately 6.5 Billion.) 12. 90% of all Americans live within fifteen miles of a Wal-Mart. You may think that I am complaining, but I am really laying the ground work for suggesting that MAYBE we should hire the guys who run Wal-Mart to fix the economy. This should be read and understood by all Americans: Democrats, Republicans, EVERYONE!! To President Obama and all 535 voting members of the Legislature It is now official that the majority of you are corrupt and ineffective: a.. The U.S. Postal Service was established in 1775. You have had 237 years to get it right and it is broke. b.. Social Security was established in 1935. You have had 77 years to get it right and it is broke. c.. Fannie Mae was established in 1938. You have had 74 years to get it right and it is broke. d.. War on Poverty started in 1964. You have had 48 years to get it right; $1 trillion of our money is confiscated each year and transferred to "the poor" and they only want more. e.. Medicare and Medicaid were established in 1965. You have had 47 years to get it right and they are broke. f.. Freddie Mac was established in 1970. You have had 42 years to get it right and it is broke. g.. The Department of Energy was created in 1977 to lessen our dependence on foreign oil. It has ballooned to 16,000 employees with a budget of $24 billion a year and we import more oil than ever before. You had 35 years to get it right and it is an abysmal failure.</Msg><Username>fevoter</Username><Timestamp>1381415340058</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-10-10 10:29:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381415519190-84</Id><Topic><Title>Republican/ Tea Party shutdown keeps death benefits from fallen troops' families</Title><Username>sammysedwat</Username><Timestamp>1381348312667</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-09 15:51:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>libertylies you show no shame in your posts or in your insistance to manipulate and spin obama failure into fantasy land untruths.

The right complains that the rich have to pay all the taxes. That is the penalty for taking all of the income. It should be appalling that so many don't even receive enough of the American Pie that they need to pay taxes. Income disparity caused by the GOP trickle down policies for the last 30 years has put the vast majority of wealth and income in to the hands of a small group. The perception by the public of this disparity is so far off from the reality of the situation, the public doesn't even realize how bad this situation has become. They generally think the income distribution is still like a bell shaped curve but it is far from it.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1381415799505</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-10-10 10:36:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381415923616-89</Id><Topic><Title>Republican/ Tea Party shutdown keeps death benefits from fallen troops' families</Title><Username>sammysedwat</Username><Timestamp>1381348312667</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-09 15:51:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Suck some more sack, jackass tea bagger.

Entrepreneurial spirits have always been tempered by the fact that you had to step out on your own and in most cases the entrepreneur had to figure out a way to obtain healthcare while starting a business. This is especially true for those who are married with kids. Generally a show stopper that keeps creative types locked up working for the man!

Luckily the sociophiles value manipulation and spite is a reasonable complement to flattery. All praise the humans. ROFLMFO. The problem was always that non-god praise had to be enfarced, and now what do you have? Unable to have people go their separate ways, many independent problem solvers were probably re-educated to be consumptive praisers. ROFLMFO. No one wanted the stable solution and now things are starting to precipitate out from the metastable mess. Everyone thought shutupstellas and ekonprophet were evil, you never had to encourage people to flatter each other to make short term personal gains at the expense of another. Everyone could win until the wealth and trust were depleted. The trumps wonder if they are sincerely trumps, maybe even doubting social security of if their neighbor is consuming enough to make them all rich. ROFLMFO. And so the moral inversion collapses. Have the indian killers lost their way? ROFLMFO. It takes a village to share the responsibility of insurng that all people have access to midechal maryjwanna and high dose novum. Right now anyway this is just democracy at work- however it seems to be departing from the unity everyone thought they could inflict on ameruca. The problem is ponzi is gone and the trade deficiet means the valuable assets are not under control of the US. At least the crops held out and we have domestic energy supplies.</Msg><Username>spocklovesyou</Username><Timestamp>1381445163360</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-10-10 18:46:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381445400432-248</Id><Topic><Title>Just Remember To Bring Guns To Tea Party Republican Town Halls</Title><Username>fireundersmoke</Username><Timestamp>1381440809834</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-10-10 17:33:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I remember when those tea bag terrorists brought their guns and were holding them when Our President was at those town halls, I am going to enjoy giving them some of their own medicine, I got 35 lbs of second amendment.

The congress shut the government down that means only essential services like security and air traffic controllers can be funded. For anything else to be funded the Congress has to provide funds. So when they shut down the government death benefits could not be paid by the defense department until a special bill went through the house, the senate and then brought to the president to be signed. He did that this afternoon. "President Barack Obama has signed a bill to continue financial benefits to families of fallen troops during the government shutdown. The White House says Obama signed the measure into law Thursday hours after the Senate cleared it for his signature. Final passage came a day after Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said a military charity, the Fisher House Foundation, would make the benefit payments during the shutdown. The lapse in funding meant the Pentagon had no authority to continue the payments."</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1381455661373</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-10-10 21:41:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381455753512-288</Id><Topic><Title>libertylies lies, clearly the obama gang defunded the vets, and benefits</Title><Username>fevoter</Username><Timestamp>1381450372899</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-10-10 20:12:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>gee libertylies spin it baby spin it, your lips are moving but you make no sense dweb</Msg><Username>fevoter</Username><Timestamp>1381455753512</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-10-10 21:42:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1381455845246-289</Id><Title>libertlies did you stick mason's gerbil up your obama?</Title><Msg>will obamacare pay to remove it?</Msg><Username>fevoter</Username><Timestamp>1381455845246</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-10-10 21:44:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381455885849-290</Id><Topic><Title>libertlies did you stick mason's gerbil up your obama?</Title><Username>fevoter</Username><Timestamp>1381455845246</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-10-10 21:44:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This may expalin your mental handicap being able to think clearly</Msg><Username>fevoter</Username><Timestamp>1381455885849</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-10-10 21:44:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381455918782-291</Id><Topic><Title>What hate-based hellish acts will the GOP and their bad seed Tea Party indulge in today?</Title><Username>willy_the_sage</Username><Timestamp>1381404105278</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-10-10 07:21:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>They couldnt care less about widows or children of fallen troops.
