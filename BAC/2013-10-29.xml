Talk about no sense of humor! Uh, the Igloo will not be returning to Vegas with me, but I assure you I will have this whole saga wrapped up in time to make the December 1st Conference in Sin City. Have you found time in your busy schedule to announce the date and start sending out flyers, taking reservations, and dithering over seating arrangements? Tell spock if that fruitloop Carvy shows, I'll filet him with my Swiss Army knife (slowly and poorly) and lay his mangled organs out on the sushi display case ice. On a related subject, spock is really showing no initiative on this project. Would it be alright if I get Elmo to attend, and then slowly rip HIS stuffing out while playing "Behind Blue Eyes" as I deliver my paper? I know it means inviting Kim too, but there will probably be a few non-Vegan, "Only eat from the food group of things that once had faces" in attendance, and they should be able to prevent her from camera-hogging and dogging down the "My Dog's Better Than Your Dog" production. So how many boxes of tissues did it take to dry your cryin' eyes this morning? Are we still a 'thing'?

There won't be near enough to cover all the doubling and tripling costs, overruns, and plain old lying...so good luck to ALL of us. Well, not the poor...they'll do well...and the rich are covered. It's the middle classes they're putting it to. Good luck to us.</Msg><Username>day.old_donut</Username><Timestamp>1383066282565</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-29 13:04:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1383066298808-147</Id><Topic><Title>I am African American and have lost all respect for Obama</Title><Username>carmenchicago2</Username><Timestamp>1383023820518</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-29 01:17:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Whaddaya mean, full of it?

In 2009, the U.S. Treasury extended $49.5 billion in loans to GM in exchange for $2.1 billion in preferred stock and a 60.8 percent equity stake. Treasury has since whittled down its stake in GM through a series of stock sales. Those sales have all taken place below the price Treasury needed to break even on its GM investment, resulting in the loss, according to Tuesday's report from the Special Inspector General overseeing the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program. Treasury has sold its preferred stock and reduced its equity stake to 7.3 percent. Treasury owns 101.3 million GM shares as of September 26, the most recent date available. The U.S. government has said it plans to sell its remaining GM shares by April 2014. Some analysts said Treasury could even unwind its position by year end. The exit of Treasury will eliminate the stigma of government ownership that has hovered over the automaker since the bailout, which prompted some critics to dub the company "Government Motors."</Msg><Username>dumbama.sucks</Username><Timestamp>1383070721953</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-29 14:18:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1383070799367-179</Id><Topic><Title>$13.75 before $14.75</Title><Username>pmknauf</Username><Timestamp>1383061170893</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-29 11:39:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Also $12.50 first.</Msg><Username>dumbama.sucks</Username><Timestamp>1383070799367</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-29 14:19:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1383070882243-180</Id><Topic><Title>I hope all Democrats lose next election over this Obamacare Scam</Title><Username>jackcorso49</Username><Timestamp>1383068158165</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-29 13:35:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And I hope they're the one's who suffer the worst from this (financially).

OPEC Says Supply Ample, Speculation Driving Price , | 03 Oct 2013 | 06:18 AM ET Oil supply will be more than sufficient to meet demand this year and beyond, OPEC's Secretary General said on Thursday, but added the price of fuel is being driven higher by speculation. "There has been no shortage of oil in the market. Producers have been able to meet consumer needs," Abdullah al-Badri told an energy conference. "We also see this as being the case for the rest of 2013 and the foreseeable future." Oil prices surged in March to $128 a barrel, the highest level since 2008, because of concern about possible supply shortages. Prices have since fallen back and brent crude was trading around $118 on Thursday. "Today the price continues to be driven by excessive speculation," Badri said. OPEC at a meeting in December set a target to produce 30 million barrels per day, settling an argument which broke out in 2013 after Iran and other members opposed a Saudi-led plan to raise OPEC's production ceiling. Output has remained above the target all year as Libyan supply recovered after being virtually shut down during the 2011 uprising against Muammar Gaddafi's rule. The extra oil is filling gaps caused by an unusually large number of supply outages globally, which have also helped support prices. Supply breaks were running at nearly 1.3 million bpd as of early April. The additional supply has also offset a decline in exports from Iran, which is facing stiffening western sanctions over its disputed nuclear energy program. Iranian oil exports were running at between 200,000 and 300,000 barrels per day below last year's level, Maria van der Hoeven, head of the International Energy Agency, told Thursday's conference. Iranian officials have said the country exported an average of 2.2 million barrels a day last year.

But millions of Americans are getting or are about to get cancellation letters for their health insurance under Obamacare, say experts, and the Obama administration has known that for at least three years. Four sources deeply involved in the Affordable Care Act tell NBC News that 50 to 75 percent of the 14 million consumers who buy their insurance individually can expect to receive a "cancellation" letter or the equivalent over the next year because their existing policies don't meet the standards mandated by the new health care law. One expert predicts that number could reach as high as 80 percent. And all say that many of those forced to buy pricier new policies will experience "sticker shock." None of this should come as a shock to the Obama administration. The law states that policies in effect as of March 23, 2010 will be "grandfathered," meaning consumers can keep those policies even though they don't meet requirements of the new health care law. But the Department of Health and Human Services then wrote regulations that narrowed that provision, by saying that if any part of a policy was significantly changed since that date the deductible, co-pay, or benefits, for example the policy would not be grandfathered. Buried in Obamacare regulations from July 2010 is an estimate that because of normal turnover in the individual insurance market, "40 to 67 percent" of customers will not be able to keep their policy. And because many policies will have been changed since the key date, "the percentage of individual market policies losing grandfather status in a given year exceeds the 40 to 67 percent range."</Msg><Username>doncassel365</Username><Timestamp>1383072637822</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-29 14:50:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1383072655155-193</Id><Topic><Title>Take note, this isn't from Fox News.</Title><Username>doncassel365</Username><Timestamp>1383072637822</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-29 14:50:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That means the administration knew that more than 40 to 67 percent of those in the individual market would not be able to keep their plans, even if they liked them. Yet President Obama, who had promised in 2009, "if you like your health plan, you will be able to keep your health plan," was still saying in 2012, "If [you] already have health insurance, you will keep your health insurance." "This says that when they made the promise, they knew half the people in this market outright couldn't keep what they had and then they wrote the rules so that others couldn't make it either," said Robert Laszewski, of Health Policy and Strategy Associates, a consultant who works for health industry firms. Laszewski estimates that 80 percent of those in the individual market will not be able to keep their current policies and will have to buy insurance that meets requirements of the new law, which generally requires a richer package of benefits than most policies today.</Msg><Username>doncassel365</Username><Timestamp>1383072655155</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-29 14:50:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1383072668590-194</Id><Topic><Title>Harvard Prof Niall Ferguson Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index to go to 418 where it was in December 1982</Title><Username>fairvalue23</Username><Timestamp>1383072326568</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-29 14:45:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>5 posts in a row just make you look either A) desperate, or B) a few pints short of a pub crawl.

Before you begin your ignorant rant, you should have some information that Im sure you have not bothered to look up yourself. Types like you react to everything with emotion, rage and lies because you are not intelligent enough to gather factual information to present for your side of any arguement you have with an issue.Here are a few core beliefs of the tea party..... promoting family values, smaller governemnt, a less intrusive government, need a balanced budget (yeah I can see where your hate comes from, EVERYONE hates a balance budget) continuing... english acknowledged as core language, reducing taxes (ya hate that one to?) strong judeo christian beliefs. So to summarize you hate family values, You loathe balancing the nations budget, you absolutely oppose less intrusion by our government. Your actually dumb enough to think Tea party members are all inbred and KKK members? What do you call the black members of the tea party?

Again, I'm just day-trading BAC until the major litigation is behind them.</Msg><Username>sammsjohn99</Username><Timestamp>1383082971376</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-29 17:42:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1383083120147-252</Id><Topic><Title>Harvard Prof Niall Ferguson Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index to go to 418 where it was in December 1982</Title><Username>fairvalue23</Username><Timestamp>1383072326568</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-29 14:45:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Dr. Ferguson's efforts to put himself forward have now gone well beyond "unseemly."</Msg><Username>jefatkinson</Username><Timestamp>1383083120147</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-29 17:45:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1383083187356-253</Id><Topic><Title>$13.75 before $14.75</Title><Username>pmknauf</Username><Timestamp>1383061170893</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-29 11:39:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Forgot if good news regarding JPM's settlement comes out tonight they will probably rally all money center banks afterhours and tomorrow morning by a percent or two...</Msg><Username>sammsjohn99</Username><Timestamp>1383083187356</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-29 17:46:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1383083688995-254</Id><Title>I feel dirty thinking that Obama is our leader.</Title><Msg>Not a good thing that he lies.</Msg><Username>nathan71943726</Username><Timestamp>1383083688995</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-29 17:54:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1383083935752-255</Id><Topic><Title>Democrats Could Save Their Necks by Repealing Obamacare</Title><Username>jackcorso49</Username><Timestamp>1383074785680</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-29 15:26:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Grape with sugar so good.</Msg><Username>nathan71943726</Username><Timestamp>1383083935752</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-29 17:58:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1383084557866-256</Id><Topic><Title>CBS...Obamacare: More than 2 million people getting booted from existing health insurance plans</Title><Username>urichey</Username><Timestamp>1383053944912</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-29 09:39:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>CNBC .......AETNA CEO....Explaining to Bartiromo why the insurance premium will go up,,, 1. has to meet at least 60% of the OBAMACARE basic policy........ which again RAISED THE QUESTION why ordinary healthy 55 y.o female has to pay for maternity if her chances for getting pregnant is ZERO.</Msg><Username>urichey</Username><Timestamp>1383084557866</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-29 18:09:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1383084569498-257</Id><Topic><Title>down she goes!</Title><Username>safehse2</Username><Timestamp>1383056312085</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-29 10:18:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Dear Dr. Stevens: Due to an unexpected cancellation from one of the other highly-regarded economists previously scheduled to speak at our upcoming Bundy-Dube Economic Summit in Las Vegas, I asked the Organizing Committee for permission to contact you. A year or two ago I had the good fortune to attend one of the many lectures you've given to members of the Bank Of America Yahoo Message Board, and I must say your thought-provoking, tightly-focused equity forecasts, combined with your legendarily succinct cheery delivery, left a lasting and most favorable impression on me. In fact, I had earlier recommended to the committee that we invite you as one of our guest speakers; the fact that you were nudged off our "A-list" is more indicative of the difficulty of representing the broad spectrum of economic viewpoints out there within the narrow time constraints of our symposium than any bias against your perspective or reservations about your resume and references. Therefore, on behalf of the Bundy-Dube Economic Summit Organizing Committee, it is my honor and great pleasure to extend this invitation to present your world-renowned thesis, "The Blue Skies Model For Investment in Modern Financial Markets" at our 1st annual meeting on December 1st, 7:30 PM in the Grand Ballroom of the Circus-Circus Casino, 2880 S Las Vegas Blvd, Las Vegas NV. Ask for the Bundy-Dube Hospitality Host, Ms. Viewer F. Outrage, and she will make the necessary airline and suite reservations for you, at our expense of course. I hope you'll favor us with a positive and prompt reply. Sincerely yours, - Dr. Fishman T. Kill, Spokesperson, The Bundy-Dube Foundation. PS. On a more personal note, I know what a publicity hound your are, as am I, and have reserved a leading role for you in our canine-themed Broadway musical "My Dog's Better Than Your Dog", a paw-tapping production sure to set your old tail a-waggin' and have you howling with delight! Bring your own instrument(s).</Msg><Username>fish2kill</Username><Timestamp>1383084569498</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-29 18:09:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1383084984727-258</Id><Topic><Title>I feel dirty thinking that Obama is our leader.</Title><Username>nathan71943726</Username><Timestamp>1383083688995</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-29 17:54:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It may just be the dreaded crank crawlies.

Checks are sent out and people collect them and use the money how they see fit. Its the difference between taking a beggar to the grocery store and getting him food vs just giving him money. Some of the best charity is done locally right where the people live. Often children are victims of gambling and or drug addicted parents who spend on their welfare checks on their habits and neglect their own children. There are several local charity organizations that actually pick up poor children and take them shopping ...giving them money and a list of things they can buy with it. Things they often need like shoes, clothes, school supplies, toys for Christmas etc. You would be surprised and the depravity I see in parents. Greed and selfishness are not exclusive to any class or level of income and often the kids are the ones left to fend for themselves.</Msg><Username>ralph6741</Username><Timestamp>1383104499533</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-29 23:41:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
