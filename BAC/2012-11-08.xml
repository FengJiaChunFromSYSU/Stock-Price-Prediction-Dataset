That is not racist, that is not elitist that is just the straight up truth. He uses division as well as anyone in recent history, pick your own example. He got a second term by slamming the rich including everyone from Mitt Romney to anyone making over 200K a year and promising that if he is elected he will make sure to redistribute that wealth from the greedy rich into everyone else's pocket. That of course will solve nothing, the rich will still be rich, the poor will still be poor and the economy will still suck because he has no clue how to get it moving.

The country was required by its institutional lenders to pass 13.5 billion euros ($17.2 billion) of extra cuts before receiving 31 billion euros of additional financial aid. The measures were passed amid protests inside and outside parliament, the reports stated, with staff and parliamentary members walking out at one stage and violent demonstrations taking place outside the building.</Msg><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1352373382027</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 06:16:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352373555840-30</Id><Title>Something for which Obama can apologize to Foreigners,</Title><Msg>And we are ashamed to admit to foreigners that it has been three years since our Congress has approved an annual budget – and this, after all, is the most basic element of economic governance.</Msg><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1352373555840</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 06:19:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352373840948-31</Id><Topic><Title>WHEN the USA begins austerity cuts like Greece, will Democrats and the Mass Media coolly applaud Obama or will they</Title><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1352373382027</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 06:16:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Most likely the Plutocrats will have to stay locked in their gated communities watching FOX NEWS reinforce their slanted views!

Imitation IS the sincerest form of flattery, but outright theft of someone else's words or ideas without attribution is simple (and I do mean simple) plagiarism. Mrstan should give some thought to hiring an editor, who could justify their position merely by blocking half of the words he repetitiously and tediously dumps into his cut-and-paste pablum. Just eliminating 'stupid', #$%$, 'idiot', 'loser', the omnipresent 'liar libs', and 'pathetic' would practically achieve that mark ROTFLMAO; in fact, it would leave him practically speechless. Mrstan pontificates endlessly and ad nauseam here about the illegitimacy of all things Left and the sanctity of all things Right, the genius of antediluvian knee-jerk knuckle-draggers like Boehner and Rove, and the intellectual poverty and naivety of erudite and compassionate thinkers and doers like Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren, as if ensconced on lofty Mt.

Two days ago he was ranting and raving about a Romney-Ryan landslide victory, yet when the market tanked yesterday he had the unmitigated gall to pronounce it an entirely foreseeable and expected consequence of Obama's win? ROTFLMAO that ball-smuggling little eunuch didn't even get the election call right, but thinks he can continue to posture here as some kind of infallible expert? Hey,twinkie, your credibility is less than zero, or have you overlooked that part of 'obvious' too?

Had 150,000 voters gone for Romney instead of Obama, spread across the four key states as needed to surpass Obama, Romney would have won the electoral college votes needed to assume Presidency, 270 to 268. (Florida, Ohio, Virginia, New Hampshire) In Florida, non-Obama (Republican + Independent) votes beat Obama votes. I think we're in for more gridlock, as many, if not most, representatives of Congress won by a greater margin in their respective elections than Obama did. I foresee them honoring their constituents desires, just like Obama says he will do. All along, all the #$%$ about the 47% was a reaction to a description of Romney's strategy. How do you get enough votes to overcome that 47% who were going to vote for Obama? You have to "worry" about swaying the undecided voters, rather than "worrying" about convincing the 47%. If Obama hasn't fixed things by mid-term elections, I think Democrats will be in for big election problems in 2014. Can he fix things? Yes, he can, if he is willing to compromise. I'm not sure his make-up will allow this though. Entitlement and welfare reforms are a must, along with revenue increases. Good luck, America!

Related in Opinion Mitt Romney won the white vote, the male vote, the elderly vote, the small cities vote and the high-income vote. The Rep's better recognize the historical aspects of a tsunami of a demographic transition sweeping over our country and move themselves back to a more representative version of the Party of Lincoln. If they don't then they will be marginalized even more than they are right now.

Within socialism, societal equality means everyone finishes the same. Economics students at one well-known university learned the hard way why socialism doesn’t work. The course was on comparative economic policies. The instructor asserted that finishing the same under the socialistic model would remove incentives to excel and the risk of failure and would ultimately lower the overall quality of life in a society. Some students asserted that without incentives to excel or the risk of failure, people would give their best effort and altruistically excel to advance the greater good. So, the professor proposed an experiment: on individual exams in the course, all students would receive a score equal to the average score of all students. Students would finish the same. The students agreed. On the first exam, the average score was a B and all students received a B. On the second exam, the average score was a C and all students received a C. After successive exams in the course, the average score dropped to an F. At the end of the course, all students received a cumulative grade of F. Why did this happen? The instructor learned from the lower performing students that they saw no reason to study at all. The top performing students related that their hard work was for naught, so they studied less. And, then what happened? The students complained to the university’s administration that they each received an F and not a higher grade. After confirming that the students agreed to the grading methodology and that the students chose to apply themselves less, the university’s administration left their grades unchanged. Government must not remove the ability of the individual to excel or fail. Similarly, government must not remove the ability of companies to excel or fail.</Msg><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1352384978855</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 09:29:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352385184641-81</Id><Topic><Title>Nowhere In Our Constitution Does It Say To Send U.S. Tax Dollars To Foreign Countries.</Title><Username>fireundersmoke</Username><Timestamp>1352379271441</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 07:54:31 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Congress should stop thinking they can Buy Friends for the U.S., True friends of the U.S. will be the one's that stay friends after the Gift Money Stops.</Msg><Username>fireundersmoke</Username><Timestamp>1352385184641</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 09:33:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352385241848-82</Id><Topic><Title>The only reason Obama won was</Title><Username>jeffgman69</Username><Timestamp>1352382228735</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 08:43:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you didn't answer my question though, if 49% of Americans receive some form of government assistance, what percent of just those black and hispanic votes do you think receieve some form of government assistance?

Sometimes politicians, journalists and others exclaim; "It's just a tax cut for the rich!" and it is just accepted to be fact. But what does that really mean? Just in case you are not completely clear on this issue, I hope the following will help. Please read it carefully. Let's put tax cuts in terms everyone can understand. Suppose that every day, ten men go out for dinner and the bill for all ten comes to $100. If they paid their bill the way we pay our taxes, it would go something like this: The first four men (the poorest) would pay nothing. The fifth would pay $1. The sixth would pay $3. The seventh would pay $7. The eighth would pay $12. The ninth would pay $18. The tenth man (the richest) would pay $59. So, that's what they decided to do. The ten men ate dinner in the restaurant every day and seemed quite happy with the arrangement, until one day, the owner threw them a curve. "Since you are all such good customers," he said, "I'm going to reduce the cost of your daily meal by $20." Dinner for the ten now cost just $80. The group still wanted to pay their bill the way we pay our taxes so the first four men were unaffected. They would still eat for free. But what about the other six men - the paying customers? How could they divide the $20 windfall so that everyone would get his 'fair share?' They realized that $20 divided by six is $3.33. But if they subtracted that from everybody's share, then the fifth man and the sixth man would each end up being paid to eat their meal. So, the restaurant owner suggested that it would be fair to reduce each man's bill by roughly the same amount, and he proceeded to work out the amounts each should pay. And so: The fifth man, like the first four, now paid nothing (100% savings). The sixth now paid $2 instead of $3 (33% savings). The seventh now paid $5 instead of $7 (28% savings). The eighth now paid $9 instead of $12 (25% savings). The ninth now paid $14 instead of $18 (22% savings). The tenth now paid $49 instead of $59 (16% savings). Each of the six was better off than before. And the first four continued to eat for free. But once outside the restaurant, the men began to compare their savings. "I only got a dollar out of the $20," declared the sixth man. He pointed to the tenth man," but he got $10!" "Yeah, that's right," exclaimed the fifth man. "I only saved a dollar, too. It's unfair that he got ten times more than me!" "That's true!!" shouted the seventh man. "Why should he get $10 back when I got only two? The wealthy get all the breaks!" "Wait a minute," yelled the first four men in unison. "We didn't get anything at all. The system exploits the poor!" The nine men surrounded the tenth and beat him up. The next night the tenth man didn't show up for dinner, so the nine sat down and ate without him. But when it came time to pay the bill, they discovered something important. They didn't have enough money between all of them for even half of the bill! And that, boys and girls, journalists and college professors, is how our tax system works. The people who pay the highest taxes get the most benefit from a tax reduction. Tax them too much, attack them for being wealthy, and they just may not show up anymore. In fact, they might start eating overseas where the atmosphere is somewhat friendlier.</Msg><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1352387015343</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 10:03:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352387053055-96</Id><Topic><Title>The Ignorant of Society voted for Obama on pure emotion and hope rather than any metric</Title><Username>jack_ste56</Username><Timestamp>1352359605786</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 02:26:45 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>credit - is an IOU - that you are expected to pay back money is what you have - in hand - at time of purchase .!!!!!!!!!!!!</Msg><Username>da23533</Username><Timestamp>1352387053055</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 10:04:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352387168495-97</Id><Topic><Title>Interesting Election Data</Title><Username>kentex1952</Username><Timestamp>1352383047592</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 08:57:27 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Gridlock.

CNBCBy Antonia van de Velde | CNBC – 1 hour 34 minutes ago European Central Bank President Mario Draghi warned on Thursday that economic activity in the euro zone was expected to remain weak. The bank left interes rates unchanged at a record low of 0.75 percent as expected. At a press conference following the decision, Draghi said the growth momentum in the euro zone was expected to remain weak. "Economic activity in the euro area is expected to remain weak although it continues to be supported by our monetary policy stance and financial market confidence has visibly improved on the back of our decisions as regards Outright Monetary Transactions," Draghi said, referrring to the bank's bond buying program unveiled in September. The European Commission on Wednesday sharply cut its forecasts for growth in the euro zone and recent data showed that the crisis in was now starting to affect Germany, which has so far remained resilient to the economic downturn. "I think we're heading for a severe recession in the economic area of the 17 counties. We may see a contraction of up to 1.5 percent in 2013 and I would say becoming even more severe in 2014," Thorsten Polleit, chief economist at Degussa Goldhandel told CNBC. He believes the ECB will have no choice but to cut rates before 2013 in a desperate effort to boost the struggling economy. "I think in December they're going to cut interest rates by 50 basis points and so interest rates at the short end will be basically zero in nominal terms and negative in real terms," he said. Draghi said there was clear evidence that consolidation efforts in euro area countries were bearing fruit, adding is was crucial that efforts were maintained to restore sound fiscal positions. "Full compliance with the enforced EU fiscal and governance framework including the rapid implementation of the fiscal compact would send a strong signal to markets and strengthen confidence in the soundness of public finances," he said. Spain remains one of the biggest concerns for ECB policymakers. Draghi declined to comment on whether he would like Spain to request aid through a new bond buying program, known as Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT). He said it was up to Spain to decide whether it wanted to request aid, not the ECB. Draghi unveiled the program in September to address what he said were "severe distortions" in sovereign bond markets. The high yields some heavily indebted countries face to finance their debt have exacerbated Europe's debt crisis. But the program, created to ease Spain's troubles in particular, remains to be kicked into action. It is only activated once a country applies, and it comes with strings attached. The country in question must meet strict conditions set by the ECB, including enacting austerity and cutting budget deficits. Those conditions mean that Spain has so far been reluctant to ask for help.</Msg><Username>rhinoinchgo</Username><Timestamp>1352388936455</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 10:35:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352388960018-114</Id><Topic><Title>AMERICANS NEED TO CHOOSE UP SIDES BUY GUNS AND FIGHT FOR THIS COUNTRY</Title><Username>whitest_white</Username><Timestamp>1352388115311</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 10:21:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes, teabaggers.

Save the corn for food and feed. Obama's policies are not aligned with this. Iowa, Minnesota and Illinois are huge corn producing states. All three voted heavily for Obama. He will ensure they get the highest price for their crops.

BAC stock behavior today and other stocks show that without the rule they have a hard time recovering. When a stock drops 7 percent one day, it needs a greater than 7 percent rally the next day to get back to even. It's very hard to recover from losses when there is no multicent uptick rule there. I am a very little guy that appreciates your input and I may never recover. May never recover the losses from the Internet bubble crash, 911 crash, credit crisis crash, real estate bubble busting, and others since the uptick rule really lost its effectiveness back right with the internet bubble bust since that is when decimalization happened without updating of the uptick rule to multicent status. Instead the upticks could be ten thousandths of a dollar and be considered an uptick. We need the multicent uptick rule to fight the BEAR RAIDS that keep happening. Thank you once again for any time or effeort that has been spent on this most important capital matter for the stock market..

After meeting in London with Bank of America CFO Bruce Thompson, Staite on Thursday reiterated his "Overweight" rating for Bank of America and $12 price target, saying that Thompson "expressed confidence that in Q4 there will be a decline in Legacy Asset Servicing costs, that mortgage delinquencies will decline and that the NIM will benefit from lower funding costs." Following a brutal 7% pummeling on Wednesday in the wake of President Obama's reelection, Bank of America's shares led the market in morning trading on Thursday, with shares rebounding by 3% to $9.48. Staite last month upgraded Bank of America from a neutral rating, as the company "has a bigger cost-cutting story, greater potential to reduce funding costs and faster improvement in capital ratios," relative to peers. The shares closed at $9.23 Wednesday, returning 67% year-to-date, following a 58% return in 2011. While the shares are trading at just 0.7 times their reported their reported Sept. 30 tangible book value of $13.48, it would appear that investors agree with Staite, since the shares trade at the highest multiple to forward earnings among the "big four" U.S. banks. Bac shares trade for 9.5 times the consensus 2013 earnings estimate of 97 cents a share, among analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.

A banknote (often known as a bill, paper money or simply a note) is a type of negotiable instrument known as a promissory note ( ie credit), made by a bank, payable to the bearer on demand. When banknotes were first introduced, they were, in effect, a promise to pay the bearer in coins, but gradually became a substitute for the coins and a form of money in their own right. Banknotes were originally issued by commercial banks, but since their general acceptance as a form of money, most countries have assigned the responsibility for issuing national banknotes to a central bank.

It lost 7 percent yesterday and fell from 9.95 to 9.23 with a need to gain more than 7 percent to get back to 9.95. How can you not say anything publicly about BAC today and get it on the press wires? Don't let the shareholders just flap in the breeze after those several attempts to bust through the 10 dollar barrier in just the past few days. Now we wait for input. Your public statement for something that would reiterate how this company has changed to where the Dodd Frank doesn't harm it as much anymore. How it has changed its capitalization ratio. Something that helps this get back through that unbelievable 10 dollar barrier that was busted down through, it seems, somewhere kind of close to when John Paulson sold alot of his fund's bigger share of BAC shares. Is there any benefit to putting Countrywide into bankruptcy now? Maybe a statement about Countrywide would help. Maybe we are in quiet mode since there are suits out there in progress and some things can't be discussed publicly that would influence them. You have the attorney background and know better than my stupid uninformed useless opinion. I wonder if John Pauson is coming back to buy in well to BAC? I wonder and hope, that's all. Good luck to you Mr. Moynihan and I appreciate your efforts with BAC.

These tiny-brained pests aren't after our brains and never were; in fact they'll swear on a stack of Bibles and/or Golden Tablets that they're doing just fine with the tiny ones they already have. No, what they're after are our biscuits and our balls.* (*footnote/dedication: multi-layered muse-ical/sexual/racial allusion: cue Jack White/White Stripes/"Let's Have A Ball and A Biscuit"; this one goes out to 'viewoutrage'). They suspect that they're the target of some sort of Muslim-inspired, government-directed, taxpayer-funded eradication effort, but these disease-ridden scavengers can't seem to grasp the connection between their shrunken sacks and the real enemy. They've already chemically castrated THEMSELVES, neutered by their own witch's brew of toxins released into the very air they breathe and the sewage they drink and swim and live in. They don't understand that they've already doomed themselves to a seemingly endless living nightmare followed by inevitable extinction; all they know is that they're p!$$ed-off, and that their atavistic urges for gorging and reproduction must be satisfied at any cost. This frustrated pack of well-fed eunuchs just came within a few filthy whiskers of overrunning the health, sanitation, and animal control department, not to mention the food and liquor and gun stores, of our fair city. Fattened by a combination of princely largess and nocturnal raids, and emboldened by the false confidence of numbers and full bellies and each other's flattery, they almost prevailed, and only the last-ditch efforts of a united, civilized populace manage to drive them back into their sewer-temple. The slimy vermin are playing the BACK nine of Dante's country club; they've made their way back to the 2nd green but have lost their own balls and must steal someone else's to proceed.* (*credit: ekonprophet.

Nothing worked until I tried inverting the Circles algorithm, and 'voila'! Unsatisfiable lust PRECEDES limbo and salvation if one is trying to crawl out! Do you think shutupstellas' thematic aperception merits a citation here as well? ) It would be nice if we could just let these sack-jackers and psuedo-scrotes play through, but there are far too many of them and they're bound to destroy the turf and consume the flag, the cup, and probably more than a few golf bags and shoes and caddies before stealing our balls and leaving us to deal with an irate groundskeeper and his well-armed staff. Already they're popping their ugly heads up through the grates again, sniffing the air tentatively, sending out plaintive squeaks to rally their comrades and sneaking out just long enough for a few hit-and-run raids. Make no mistake, though; in a week they'll be scurrying around again in broad daylight, unabashed and unashamed, mangling purple prose until it's as red and bleeding as the war heroes they imagine themselves to be; palavering and pontificating about self-reliance and Their flights of fancy and delusion will soar higher than an eagle once more, even as they earthbound and tethered, flopping around on that second green like molting chicken hawks.* (*Note to editor: man, this is some great boo! Tidy up this mess with your magic wand and dark, immense, inscrutable powers - you know, the usual treatment for my drafts...) I guess all I'm really trying to say is that as nice as it would to help ALL of the ball-smugglers into limbo, the cost is unreasonably high.

US News By Philip Moeller | U.S.News &amp; World Report LP As strapped state and local governments scramble for ways to balance their budgets, it's become very clear that it will be impossible for many to honor their pension promises to new employees and even current retirees. According to a recent economic study, the cost to fully fund these promises would cost taxpayers $5 trillion over a 30-year period, or nearly $1,400 a year in higher state and local taxes and fees for every household in the country. Put another way, contributions to pay for public employees' retirement benefits now total 5.7 percent a year of all state and local taxes, fees, and other government charges. "Government contributions to state and local pension systems must rise to 14.1 percent" to produce fully funded pension systems, the study said, and it will take 30 years to get there......

A top State Department security official in Libya told a congressional investigator that he had argued unsuccessfully for increased security in the weeks before Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other American envoys were killed in a terrorist attack. And yet, “Jarrett seems to have a 24-hour, around-the-clock (security) detail, with five or six agents full time,” Democratic pollster Pat Caddell said in an interview with Breitbart. “The media has been completely uninterested," Caddell said. "We don’t provide security for our ambassador in Libya, but she needs a full Secret Service security detail. And nobody thinks there’s anything wrong with this. And nobody in the press will ask, what kind of slavish stoogery are they perpetrating here?” Jarrett has held positions in both the public and private sector, including the chairwoman of the Chicago Transit Board, Chicago's commissioner of planning and development and deputy chief of staff for Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley. She also practiced law with two private law firms.</Msg><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1352417559029</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 18:32:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352417653592-344</Id><Title>"This is Rangoon calling Paris, Rangoon calling Paris, come in, Paris.

Schapiro's Check List:</Title><Username>forzsnow</Username><Timestamp>1247934860000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2009-07-18 12:34:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Where on that list is the 12 cent (i.e. like the old 1/8 interval uptick rule? When it takes years for investors to make billions in Apple stock, but the shorts and panicked sellers can take 20 percent of the money back in just the last two months, does one not see how lucrative it is to hedge funds and mega shorts to keep that effective multicent uptick rule that helped make the stock market a respectable and non-gambling activity again after the Stock Market Crash of 1929, buried under a mass of distracting double speaking pseudoscientific mid 2000's study? Doesn't surprise me. BAC went from 9.95 to 9.23 in one day and is fighting an uphill battle right now under the absence of a multicent uptick rule with a close of 9.39 the day after pillaging of little retail investors. We were suckered again with the 10 dollar "wall" that somehow Scott Nations on CNBC tried to morph into making BAC the Trade of the Day with recommending buying 10 dollar calls on Monday this week the day before the Presidential Election. This recommendation immediately after he said BAC hit a brick wall at 10 dollars back in March of this year. And again Scott Nations, why was it going to be different this time the day before the election? You said 50 cent option would be less sickening to see bounce off 10 dollars than watching actual stock fall down. Did you forget to tell your massive television audience that they can't get out of their call options during premarket and afterhours when you can get out of your drowning stock shares? Did you see how much pressure and massive down draft of BAC was going on in the premarket AM prior to open on post election day? The share price dropped like nearly at a 60 degree downward angle in the premarket trading chart that morning. All those call option buying people unable to do anything until regular market hours opened at 9:30 AM. Did you say that would be less sickening than watching BAC stock go down. "It's only 50 cents?" One contract is 100 shares time 50 cents and who buys only one contract? I sure hope this doesn't happen again. I can't think of anything more market sickening than watching your 50 cent contract lose 50 percent of its value while you are locked out of getting rid of the firecracker like instrument. Has anyone seen him make a public statement since that fateful day? All the regular crew that was on the day before the election, but Adami and Lee, were not on Fast Money the day after the election when that Trade of the Day fell like a knife losing from its 9.95 close to 9.23 close and their options that were recommended fell 50 percent....50 percent in one day since there is no multicent uptick rule. How did it go down so fast? I SAY AGAIN, THERE IS NO MULTICENT UPTICK RULE AROUND ANYMORE. REMEMBER?

Disgusting and Mr. Moynihan still hasn't gotten rid of Countrywide by putting it into bankruptcy and also has not sold Merril Lynch. You know there is a considerable number of businesses that had to file bankruptcy and go away because of lawsuits. Does anyone at BAC corporate headquarters monitor this board? Why can't Bank of America stand on its own right now and rid itself of these ill timed purchased subsidiaries? Why not? I don't want to wait from 2008 til 2014 for resolution of this black cloud hanging over Bank of America. Get on the stick. This is taking too long!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

So that maybe you will understand what is happening consider that the idiots in the republican majority in congress made the pledge to not raise taxs. All the robuts shouted with glee, but now we see a outstanding move by the democrats ..........let the bush tax reductions expire since the radical pledge takers are dedicated to no compermise or progress. Once they have expired the democrats will put forth a bill to return to the prior lower level for those earning $250,000 or less per year. Only at that point will the republican radicals realize they have once again been out smarted and will face the choice of rasing taxs on the middle class if the bill is not passed and the tax increase will remain in place for the upper income people.

If they paid 1,000 dollars a piece then it would total 10 billion dollars and so on and so on. Take those homeowners and see if they would become a CO-OP or Cooperative that would agree to accept the liability and thus these enitities would no longer be suing some big bank but a CO-OP that was filled with regular homeowners. That may be a solution to this quagmire ill timed subsidiary purchase and the liability issue. Are there laws against all those homeowners becoming part of a Cooperative that purchases the liability from Bank of America? Shoot that one full of holes, you legal real estate business experts.

With President Obama winning another term and democrats taking control of the Senate, the move to fundamentally change America from within has begun – with a vengeance. We’re all aware of the restrictive gun laws in the State of California which require low capacity magazines for handguns, fixed magazines for “assault” rifles, and a whole lot of running around just to be granted the right to carry a concealed firearm. undefined Now, Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), who has championed gun control in her state for decades and co-wrote the original assault weapons ban enacted by the federal government in the 1990′s, wishes to bring even more stringent federal mandates to the land of the free. What is being proposed by Feinstein is the most significant attack on the second amendment in history. [Must Read: America Has Shifted To The Left And The Culture War Is Over] It would essentially ban thousands of firearms and require gun owners to turn them over to the Federal government. I don’t have the minutes of the meeting (yet), but sources tell me California Senator and longtime gun-hater Dianne Feinstein’s legal staff held meetings on Friday with FTB/ATF legal staff to discuss a new “Assault Weapons Ban” Madame Feinstein would be looking to push through Congress if President Obama wins reelection. This same “pretty good intelligence” says the items that would lead to a banwould ban pistol grips and “high-capacity” magazines, eliminate any grandfathering and ban sales of “weapons in possession”. I don’t know about you, but if these things come to pass and I’m “in possession” I’m certainly not selling. In fact, the lack of interest in the idea surprised the California liberal’s legal staffers. Apparently, they believe no logical person could possible disagree with them. … I began receiving the first reports of increases in gun buying by people concerned about tomorrow’s election. Dealers in Oklahoma, Arkansas, Texas, Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama and Indiana all tell me there hasn’t been a huge number of buyers expressing those concerns, but the numbers were noticeable. Among that group -and the majority of “regular” purchasers- the core driving most of the purchasing seem to be in their mid-to-late 30s. Again, home and personal defense are the most frequently cited reasons for buying.

Najarian changed his rating to buy from hold, saying in a note to investors yesterday that Bank of America may be able to buy back common shares sooner and in greater amounts than he expected. The dividend, now 4 cents a share annually, could jump to an annual 20 cents next year and 40 cents by 2015, ISI wrote. The stock buyback could amount to 11 percent of common shares over the next three years, “and that outlook could easily prove too conservative,” Najarian wrote. Bank of America is ranked second by assets among U.S. lenders and is based in Charlotte, North Carolina. The stock closed at $9.23 yesterday, leading the Dow Jones Industrial Average this year with a 66 percent gain. Najarian forecast the stock could reach $12 a year from now and $18 by the end of 2015.</Msg><Username>jedbs2</Username><Timestamp>1352431212787</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 22:20:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352431296216-436</Id><Topic><Title>50% of Americans Hated Obama</Title><Username>kingofvietnam</Username><Timestamp>1352428222276</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 21:30:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>51.25% of voters liked Obama (61,122,638 votes) 48.75% of voters liked Romney (58,130,991 votes) From this election, Republicans learned that over half of those who voted wanted Obama to be the next President of the U.S., among other things.</Msg><Username>oldestnetsurfer</Username><Timestamp>1352431296216</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 22:21:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352432112950-437</Id><Topic><Title>50% of Americans Hated Obama</Title><Username>kingofvietnam</Username><Timestamp>1352428222276</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 21:30:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Because he kicks republican #$%$ every time with 52% who trust him</Msg><Username>jpotatohart</Username><Timestamp>1352432112950</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 22:35:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352432486798-438</Id><Topic><Title>50% of Americans Hated Obama</Title><Username>kingofvietnam</Username><Timestamp>1352428222276</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 21:30:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nobody AMERICAN likes OBAMA!

What you're essentialy suggesting is an IPO of Countrywide, assuming you can convince 10 million people - specifically the holders os the exact toxic mortgages that Countrywide holds - to pool capital to take an ownership position in a company with (arguably) more liability than assets. So, not only can they not make good on their own mortgages, but now they would assume legal liability to the holders of their mortgage should they default - essentially doubling the liability. I'm sure your heart was in the right place, but what you suggest - aside from being a bad investment for those individuals - is a functional impossibility. The only practical solution is for BofA to sell Countrywide for far less than it's "worth" - basically realizing a risk adjusted valuationof toxic mortgages - and agree to acept the full legal liability for any current or future legal case arrising from the period prior to the sale - including the period prior to BofA's purchase. At this point, that looks to be somewhere in the neighborhood of $35B. Yikes! Worst. Acquisition.
