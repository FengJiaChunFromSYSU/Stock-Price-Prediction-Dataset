Good luck to all longs. I sold today at 8.65 and sold way too soon, but I am in the black again and so I decided not to be greedy. Sometime I may play BAC again, but not right now.

By that measure, it's down quite a bit. About 50%. Oil prices are a great and universal indicator of currency value, and our DOW companies are valued in dollars. Price of oil in 2008 was about $1.95. Even with the worst recession in 80 years dampening demand, oil is now over $3.90 and climbing. You just can't keep printing money and look at profits the same way.

Did they also have groups of citizens that saw what was happening and tried to stop it, only to have the media and politicians of their day belittle and humiliate them. When Obama was elected, many of us were excited about the possibilities. Finally we had a black person elected who could be a role model to other minorities and inspire them to graduate from high school, get college or vocational education, get a job and work harder than your peers, get married before you have children, and thank God you were born in America and have the freedom and opportunity to be what ever you want to be -- even the President of the United States of America! It was an opportunity to tell Jackson, Rangel, NAACP, and all of the other pathetic national black leaders to step aside, because America was no longer going to allow minorities to believe they couldn't achieve the American dream. The next generation of minorities wouldn't see themselves as victims of racism living in a country where the obstacles were too great for them to overcome. Instead, Obama ended up being the same type of Democratic leader that believes ordinary Americans can't do extraordinary things. That people are too stupid and lazy to overcome life's obstacles and become successful without a gov't program to take care of them. Instead of inspiring Americans to stay in school, get married before having kids, work harder than your peers, and realize your dreams and destiny, all we've seen is Obama attack those that did every thing they were suppose to do and realized the American dream. The answer too every problem is taxing the Americans that did every thing they were suppose to do, and give the money to the gov't so that they can give it to the high school dropouts, single mothers with children destined for poverty, felons, drug addicts, illegal aliens who are taking the jobs that our high school drop outs should be taking. etc. We've seen rules for getting food stamps, disability and welfare relaxed so that Democrats can get more and more people dependent on gov't and solidify their voting base. Also encourages Americans to drop out of the work force to lower the unemployment rate and improve Obama's chance for re-election. The American debt is now $16 trillion, which equates to over $50,000 for every citizen and is growing by $4,000 per citizen every year. Those that are under 30 years old, which vote overwhelmingly for the Democrats who are bankrupting their future, now owe about $130,000 of the debt since it will be them and their children who will ultimately have to pay for it. I am sickened by Obama's message. Vote for me and you'll get free food, shelter, healthcare, contraceptives, abortions, more gov't jobs, subsidized college loans and grants, etc etc. Meanwhile the country gets weaker and weaker as we have to cut our defenses to pay for all of the welfare programs that have failed miserably. Ultimately, our empire will be unable to defend itself and will collapse. "Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country" used to be part of the Democratic belief structure. Now it's "Ask what your country can do for you, and to hell with future generations!" The more Americans we get dependent on the gov't, the more voters for Democratic party and the closer to the collapse of the great American empire.</Msg><Username>defeatsocialism</Username><Timestamp>1347115720037</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-08 10:48:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347116151101-59</Id><Title>BOOKVALUE $20.16 &amp; $636.18B in Cash</Title><Msg>Bank of America has $636.18B In Cash Trading WELL BELOW BOOKVALUE OF $20.16,BAC Need to Do a $50B - 100B Share BuyBack &amp; Get Stock Above $30</Msg><Username>sutton7michaels</Username><Timestamp>1347116151101</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-08 10:55:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347116475520-60</Id><Topic><Title>RYAN.

Oh how wrong they were, just like all of the other liberal beliefs. The % of black babies born to single mothers is now 70%, that's right 70%! Not a typo. The % of white babies born to single mothers is 30%. Again, not a typo. How can that be? We were told that all we needed to do was provide birth control to teenagers and poor people and % of unwanted babies and abortion would go down dramatically. Teenagers can get free birth control at their schools. Poor people can get it from their local planned parent hood butcher shop. Yet the exact opposite of what the intellectuals told us would happen - has happened. Back in the mid 1960's Lyndon Johnson declared war on poverty, and the welfare programs were passed. The president and congress told us we would eradicate poverty, crime, higher unemployment etc etc. UTOPIA! What did we get? The poverty rate is currently over 14% vs around 15% when the so called Great Society welfare programs were passed. The welfare programs encouraged mothers and fathers not to get married because gov't subsidized their food and housing if the mother remained single and poor. Children born to single mothers have over 40% higher probability of ending up in poverty, and the welfare programs have only encouraged this reckless and irresponsible behavior. The national debt is now over $16 trillion, and is it a coincidence that we've spent about $16 trillion on the so called "Great Society" welfare programs? Incredible. Why are there so many people who continue to vote for the Democrats who are destroying the country. Is it because they believe they are too stupid, incapable, and lazy to achieve success on their own and need the gov't to take care of them?

There are other skeletal disabilities that people can manage but their docs want them to have less inflamation and sometimes walking can accerbate that inflammation. There is a lot of biogtry and ignorance in this country, particularly where President Obama is concerned. I'm not afraid to use the word bigot. I'm also disabled. I don't always look disabled and I resent those who try to insinuate that I have a lack of disability.

I wish Obama would just take all two trillion dollars of their wealth and run the the government for a year or so. That way we can eliminate the wealthy class altogether; of course we'd have a problem with creating jobs without that segment, because, as you implied they (those currently in government) don't have a clue. Perhaps that's why Romney/Ryan are for reducing regulations on businesses and reducing taxes on the job creators (you call them the wealthy) and reducing taxes on the consumers so they can buy products. The way you create jobs is to put into place regulations (or a lack of them) and tax policy that encourages job creation. This is, without a doubt, what we have NOT done for the past three years. Having an understanding of why we get into recessions and how we get out of them can be helpful. We get into them because consumers overextend their credit. When enough consumers do this sales slow and a recession begins. People are laid off and the recession deepens. The recession ends when consumers and businesses pay down their debts and rebuild their savings. Over the past 60 years or so this process has taken about 10 to 13 months because the government has given across the board income tax rate reductions and other tax incentives. This has left more money in the pockets of consumers and businesses to pay down those debts, rebuild their savings and generally qualify for loans again. When the government doesn't help, as we are experiencing today, the time needed to get out of recessions takes much longer. (One need only look at the flawed policies that extended the depths of the Great Depression to understand this.) Perhaps it would be more beneficial to review economic history than repeat the tired phrases. After all, the government, by itself, isn't supposed to create jobs. It's supposed to create an environment that encourages job growth. Economic history has shown, over and over that raising taxes and increasing regulations on businesses will hamper robust job growth.</Msg><Username>vvcrealestate</Username><Timestamp>1347137832818</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-08 16:57:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347137846074-113</Id><Title>Obama wants to raise taxes on the few...

He must have been a major influence on JFK or at least one of his speech writers. ("Ich bin ein Berliner." JFK - “I am a Roman citizen." MTC) The statement was originally composed several centuries prior to the start of any perceived fall of the Roman Empire. A more relevant and apparent derivative of the quote may be; "Are you a politician asking what your country can do for you or a zealous one asking what you can do for your country? If you are the first, then you are a parasite; if the second, then you are an oasis in a desert." Khalil Gibran. Seeing as how Romney and Ryan are running on a platform that eliminates taxes on capital gains, interest &amp; dividends which certainly would be a great benefit to Romney and his benefactors it would be fair to say they lie more towards the former in the above universe than the latter. Forget Romney’s 13% tax rate, it would be closer to zero. The original premise of the supply side tax cuts was that those people who know how to create jobs should have the means to do so, the presumed result being increased productivity with increased government revenues. This was illustrated by the Laffer curve. The beneficiaries of these tax cuts certainly of late have not shown any interest in holding to their side of the bargain they claim it is Obama’s responsibility to create the jobs. Romney and Ryan are both smart enough to know that their supply side tax proposal is way past any point of inflection on the Laffer Curver. Talk about an overused excuse for a pile of chits. The positive difference in payroll taxes and payments in the 80's and 90's due to the large Boomer population certainly helped to cover for the tax cuts then, but now with their aging and the start of retirement so much more is having to go out. So what do Romney and Ryan do, they propose more supply side tax gimmicks with obvious disregard for a balanced budget despite claims to the contrary. It's going to take tax cuts and less spending to straighten this mess out, there are two sides to a balance sheet. So obviously "Now it's 'Ask what your country can do for you, and to hell with future generations!'" for the supply siders as well.</Msg><Username>imadtchdgr</Username><Timestamp>1347138006449</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-08 17:00:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347138038868-115</Id><Topic><Title>Romney and Ryan tell us they will create jobs but don't have a CLUE how to do it!</Title><Username>andym_30054</Username><Timestamp>1347119030012</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-08 11:43:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What did the American Jobs Act call for?

I am not talking about government debt, which ends up taking capital out of the economy...once in the form of loans to the government and again in the form of taxes to pay for those loans. You are quite right that consumers and businesses were up to their eyeballs in debt when this recession began, but that comes at the beginning of every recession...nothing new. As consumers and businesses pay down their debt to a more manageable level and rebuild their savings they start to purchase more. As they purchase more, more people are employed and the recession comes to an end...again nothing new. The only difference with how we are getting out of this recession is the lack of help from the government. Economic history would tell anyone who cared to learn more that the government often helped speed the pay down of short terms debts by offering across the board income tax reductions and a drawback on abusive regulations. For whatever reason we are not employing these solutions this time. One has to go a little deeper and ask themselves why rather than try to deflect blame to inconsequential issues.</Msg><Username>vvcrealestate</Username><Timestamp>1347138777623</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-08 17:12:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347138796369-118</Id><Topic><Title>Democrats at convention Boo God and Jerusalem</Title><Username>spanktrison</Username><Timestamp>1347137336038</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-08 16:48:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>god? what god? you mean the god that lets 30,000 children starve to death EVERY month in Africa? oh wait...he has a devine plan. religion is for the weak minded! jmho</Msg><Username>yank_mydoodleitsadandy</Username><Timestamp>1347138796369</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-08 17:13:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347139283740-119</Id><Topic><Title>Democrats at convention Boo God and Jerusalem</Title><Username>spanktrison</Username><Timestamp>1347137336038</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-08 16:48:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Some are Obama's own family what a Messiah Obama turned out to be, lets his own family starve</Msg><Username>tulsaturd</Username><Timestamp>1347139283740</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-08 17:21:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347139433286-120</Id><Title>Why Does Valerie Jarrett get secret service protection?</Title><Msg>Some say she is actually the president</Msg><Username>tulsaturd</Username><Timestamp>1347139433286</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-08 17:23:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347139528834-121</Id><Topic><Title>Only Mitt Romney can find you a job !</Title><Username>kingofvietnam</Username><Timestamp>1347077027736</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-08 00:03:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I have no Trust at all in Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan and the whole Republican Party is so corrupt ,they even make the Communist Party look good ,and I don't like either one of them Party's, I like a Party who cares about the POOR and the MIDDLE Class and that is the DEMOCRATIC PARTY who wants to move FORWARD and not backwards and likes PEACE and PROSPERITY and not WAR as the REPUBLICAN PARTY who always looking to start another WAR in order to deplete the US TREASURY some more!!!!!!!!</Msg><Username>bingo.bello</Username><Timestamp>1347139528834</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-08 17:25:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347139884120-122</Id><Topic><Title>Democrats at convention Boo God and Jerusalem</Title><Username>spanktrison</Username><Timestamp>1347137336038</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-08 16:48:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>some are your own family too. think about it. and how did this evolve to Obama?

His goal to lower taxes will appeal to the folks that think you can get something for nothing and that the answer to reducing debt is just dissolve government but that isn't going to happen no matter who gets elected and the debt doesn't go away without paying it. Government is the necessary evil of civility. The alternative, anarchy, is a poor substitute. Romney does not propose balancing the budget. That means debt will increase for the next 8 years if he is elected. Threats to not pay the bills like the tea party members of congress did before will only make rating agencies question out bond ratings again as it did the first time. There is no secret silver bullet or magic underwear that is going to make these problems go away only the hard work and sacrifice by all elements of society will resolve it. We can no longer afford to have the top 10% getting richer while the rest decline and suffer. .</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1347142956557</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-08 18:22:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347142990698-131</Id><Title>WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRAT #$%$</Title><Msg>Whoever becomes our leader in the next election will be a liar, a cheat, a deceiver, a perjurer, a shyster,and the worst kind of pretender found among men, If the contender does not possess these vile attributes, he can't possibly win an election.

I received a tax rebate check during the so called "Bush tax cuts" ...which I might add had tax liabilities...ha I purchased a LCD TV that hangs in my bedroom. I call it "The GW TV". Better than a sharp stick in the eye but if you think the "Bush tax cuts" fueled growth by returning money to the worker bees pockets or the already wealthy, then you really need to study your recent fiscal history. Less regulation generally leads to salmonella in my peanut butter. I don't think you can point to any evidence that the "Bush tax cuts" fueled any job creation. A move from 15% to 20% or even higher on capital gains will not shutdown business expansion. I don't know of one business person that would not add worker bees if it they thought there was a tasty profit to be made by expanding their company. My point is business people are greedy! Again, I am not mad at them for being greedy but they never stop being greedy because of a difference in a few bucks in taxes.</Msg><Username>andym_30054</Username><Timestamp>1347143630162</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-08 18:33:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347143791535-135</Id><Topic><Title>How could anyone propose lowering taxes and cutting spending?</Title><Username>tulsaturd</Username><Timestamp>1347141518679</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-08 17:58:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>just facts you can't handle in your government centered world of yours.

This time around I can see that the election is manily between dumbos- ideologues, zealots, fanatics, true believers, blinded followers - and the voters who are of ave. intelligence and above who do their DD to find out for themselves the facts about the candidates! Let's see who in the U.S. happens to have critical mass to prevail in the election. I will be able to tell that from the election RESULTS. The age of consciousnes and enlightenment started recently and is slowly expanding. We shall know if the latter have gained critical mass.

The latest daily tracking poll showed Obama, a Democrat, with a lead of 4 percentage points over Romney. Forty-seven percent of 1,457 likely voters surveyed online over the previous four days said they would vote for Obama if the November 6 elections were held today, compared with 43 percent for Romney. "The bump is actually happening. I know there was some debate whether it would happen... but it's here," said Ipsos pollster Julia Clark, referring to the "bounce" in support that many presidential candidates enjoy after nominating conventions. Obama had leapfrogged Romney in the daily tracking poll on Friday with a lead of 46 percent to 44 percent. The president's lead comes despite a mixed reaction to his convention speech on Thursday night in Charlotte, North Carolina, and Friday's government data showing that jobs growth slowed sharply last month. Obama's lead over Romney is comparable to Romney's former lead over the president after the Republican National Convention finished last week, Clark said. "We don't have another convention now to turn our attention to, so (Obama's bounce) may maintain," Clark said. "How big it'll be and how long it will last remains to be seen." Obama increased his lead over Romney in certain favorable characteristics. Asked who was more "eloquent," 50 percent of the 1,720 registered voters questioned in the poll favored Obama, compared to 25 percent for Romney. Asked about being "smart enough for the job," 46 percent sided with Obama compared to 37 percent for Romney. In fact, Obama led Romney in a dozen such favorable characteristics, such as "represents America" or "has the right values." The only such category in which Romney had an advantage was being "a man of faith," as 44 percent picked Romney, who is Mormon, compared to 31 percent for Obama, who is Christian. The Democratic National Convention itself received a rather muted response in the poll. Of those registered voters who had heard, seen or read at least something about it, 41 percent rated it as "average" and 29 percent as "good." The Republican National Convention that wrapped up August 30 in Tampa, Florida similarly was rated "average" by 38 percent and "good" by 27 percent in Saturday's polling results. The precision of the Reuters/Ipsos online polls is measured using a credibility interval. In this case, the poll has a credibility interval of plus or minus 2.7 percentage points.</Msg><Username>j.farragut</Username><Timestamp>1347153839150</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-08 21:23:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347153986674-170</Id><Topic><Title>Florida Republican Charlie Christ Says Vote For Obama</Title><Username>fireundersmoke</Username><Timestamp>1347104029055</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-08 07:33:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He is not alone.

On June 1, the Bureau of Labor Statistics issued bad economic news. The number of jobs created was only 69,000 and the unemployment rate increased from 8.1 to 8.2 percent. In a presidential campaign, the difference between an 8.2 and a 7.5 percent unemployment rate or a month of 250,000 jobs versus 69,000 can be the difference between re-election and defeat. The die is already cast. Obama bet all his money on Keynesian stimulus propped up by super-expansionary monetary policy, the Detroit bailout, and extensions of unemployment insurance. He has nothing left other than infrastructure projects, subsidies for state teachers and first responders, and a feeble jobs credit for small business. The one move that could turn things around quickly — extension of the Bush tax cuts – would deprive Obama of his prime campaign message that “the rich must pay their fair share.” In a piece dated August 28, 2011 Why Obama Cannot Support a Real Jobs Program, I laid out an anti-Keynesian jobs program to create jobs and lower the unemployment rate. The third point in my program read “to create economic conditions that encourage businesses to hire and the unemployed to seek and accept jobs.” To do this, I advised not to extend unemployment benefits and to reduce the minimum wage, particularly for youths. The President did not follow my advice and look where he is now. I wish to throw the social security disability into the mix of anti-job programs. The disability program is not the creation of the Obama administration, but Obama appointees have set and interpreted its policies for more than three years. Let’s examine their record: Is It Within Bounds To Ask: Is Obama A Socialist? Paul Roderick Gregory Contributor Should The New York Times Investigate Wal-Mart Or Carlos Slim? Paul Roderick Gregory Contributor Questioning China's Economic Model: One Spark? Paul Roderick Gregory Contributor Look To Sweden! Obama's High-Tax Gurus Paul Roderick Gregory Contributor At this time in the election cycle four years ago, 7.2 million workers were on social security disability. Today, the number is 8.7 million – an increase of 1.5 million, or twenty percent. The 1.5 million disability recipients under Obama are “no longer in the labor force.” They are, it appears, safely shelved outside the labor force, which they no longer reenter to potentially swell the ranks of the unemployed. As disabilities explore new highs, the labor force participation rate (the labor force divided by the working age population) plumbs new lows. Under Obama, an incredible 8.6 million have dropped out of the labor force, 1.5 million of them due to disability. Making disability “the new normal” has contributed almost twenty percent of the declining percentage of Americans available for work. Why have disabilities increased by 20 percent under the Obama administration? Have Americans have suddenly become less healthy or more accident prone? Under normal conditions, we expect disabilities to rise with the population, which would be a four percent increase, not a 20 percent increase. It should be noted that disability is meant only for long-term health problems. Unemployment insurance and worker compensation are there for short term issues. A study by the super-non partisan National Bureau of Economic Research explains the reasons for the rise in disability. First, the Social Security Administration now places more weight on self-reported pain and discomfort, has relaxed the screening of mental illness, and accepts medical evidence from the applicant’s own doctor. The share of awards for mental illness rose from 16 percent in 1983 to one third in 2010, while the share of back pain rose from 13 percent in 1983 to 28 percent. Together they account for more than half of disabilities. Of the 2.7 million workers on disability for mental disorders, 1.7 million have “intellectual and mood disorders.” Even young people can be declared disabled if they get nervous at work or school, have attention deficit disorders, or are not very intelligent. Second, the application process has been streamlined. Applicants can begin on line, and they are entitled to a free call from a lawyer. Slick law firms specialize in navigating clients through the bureaucratic maze, and their appeals for clients fill the airwaves. If applicant claims are denied, they can appeal to administrative judges, who overturn examiners in half of their cases. Some administrative judges achieved notoriety by never turning down a disability appeal. No wonder. They can be reprimanded and their decisions set aside for “talking down to claimants” or for “lack of respect.” To cite one superior court verdict: “Applicants for social security disability payments, most of whom are truly ill or disabled, are entitled to be treated with respect and dignity no matter what the merits of their respective claims.” Third, the relative economic attractiveness of disability has increased. The NBER study finds that, for low-income workers, disability (plus Medicare) replaces almost 90 percent of working income. During recessions, wages decline, and workers at or near the minimum wage receive almost as much income through disability as by working. The system itself raises disability claims during recessions. Disability, as the new normal, is only one factor contributing to slow job growth. Companies will not create jobs if their tax, health insurance, and regulatory costs are not predictable. But a shrinking work force slows down job creation as well. Almost by definition, job creation depends on the number of people wishing to work at wages employers are willing to pay. As fewer people seek employment under prevailing wage and work conditions, the number of jobs shrinks. There may be plenty of minimum wage jobs out there, but if disability is the preferred option, there will be fewer job takers and fewer jobs. If this sounds counter-intuitive, consider Germany’s successful experiment with “making work pay.” Under Angela Merkel, Germany reduced unemployment and welfare benefits to insure that workers earn more by working than not working. Lacking a legislated minimum wage, Germany also experimented with low wage jobs that allowed job takers to retain a substantial portion of their benefits despite higher earnings. The result: Germany became almost overnight a job creating machine after decades of labor-market stagnation. Workers took jobs they had rejected before. The unemployment rate plummeted from above ten percent to almost six percent – the lowest in the Europe. Unlike its European neighbors, Germany has either avoided job losses or added jobs throughout the global economic downturn. Policies that encourage people to return to the labor force could conceivably raise the unemployment rate if new entrants fail to find jobs. But the German experience shows that “making work pay” both creates jobs and lowers the unemployment rate. The Obama administration may have reckoned that warehousing the potentially disabled, long-term unemployed, and marginally-attached outside the labor force would hold down the unemployment rate. The German “making work pay” policy says otherwise. The excessive use of disability also has a generally corrosive impact on society. It suggests, especially to low-income workers, that work is not a necessary part of life and that others should pay for you. It is only tax payer money, so you are really not living at the expense of others. Both the Netherlands and Sweden, noted for their healthy populations, realized that they had gone too far when more than ten percent of their people were on disability. Both countries reversed too liberal disability criteria and returned to levels consistent with the health and welfare of their populations. Currently, almost seven percent of the Americans 16-64 are on disability. We are rapidly approaching where the Netherlands and Sweden used to be before they reversed course. We are confronted with all kinds of inducements to take the easy way out – to get something for nothing. Sleazy lawyers tell us they will fight for the money that should be ours due to the neglect or malfeasance or others. University students are given automatic passing grades if they show up for class or even if they do not. If we earn too little, we are told it is someone else’s fault. Society owes us. If too many of us decide to take the easy way out, there will be too few earners left to support everyone else.
