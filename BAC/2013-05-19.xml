IMO: Las Vegas would run out of water sooner if were not for Mexico allowing 1.5 million acre feet of water to be stored in Lake Mead while the country makes repairs from an earthquake. Before Las Vegas runs out of water, Hoover Dam will cease to generate electricity.

Lake Mead could drop another 30 feet by 2015, dangerously close to shortage levels, according to new projections by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (BOR). The BOR projects Lake Mead could sink to 1,084 feet by next fall—its lowest level since 2010 and just 9 feet from triggering a federal shortage declaration, reducing Nevada and Arizona's available Colorado River water. The projections follow a mild winter and an unseasonably warm spring, drying up any hope of increased run-off. The Colorado River system depends on snowmelt from the Rockies to feed tributaries that flow into the river and subsequently lakes Powell and Mead. Lake Mead has dropped more than 90 feet since the drought began over a decade ago, and another BOR study predicts those challenging conditions will persist. The study—funded by the SNWA, other agencies representing the Colorado River Basin States and the BOR—offers recommendations to supplement existing supplies including increased water conservation and reuse, desalination and other augmentation projects. The U.S. and Mexico recently entered an innovative agreement to temporarily shore up Lake Mead levels. Minute No. 319 allows Mexico to store as much as 1.5 million acre-feet of water in Lake Mead while repairs are being made to that country’s water infrastructure, which was damaged in a 2010 earthquake. Nevada receives approximately 300,000 acre-feet of Colorado River water annually. One acre-foot of water is enough to supply two average homes for one year."

More from ABC News: “After five years of research in animals, he [Dr. Woo, editor] is now retrieving stem cells from Christy’s bone marrow and using them to grow blood vessels around the heart. “They form brand new micro blood vessels and deliver blood flow to the heart muscle,” said Woo. He has started the first U.S. trial where stem cells are harvested during surgery, prepped and then re-inserted back into the patient’s own heart. … Woo says any patient who is a candidate for coronary bypass surgery is a good candidate for his stem-cell transplant.”""" Source: Health Care Zone.</Msg><Username>bubba836</Username><Timestamp>1369018186892</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 22:49:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369018488449-130</Id><Topic><Title>Will Stem Cell Therapy Eliminate Bypass Surgery in the next 5 Years?</Title><Username>bubba836</Username><Timestamp>1369017714803</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 22:41:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>sound fine.

Fikes9 a.m.April 29, 2013 A molecular mechanism prompting growth of new arteries has been discovered by a team led by scientists from Yale University and University College London. The newly discovered pathway may lead to developing drugs to encourage arteriogenesis after heart attacks and strokes. A paper describing the findings was published online Monday in the journal Developmental Cell. It is one of three papers relating to blood vessel growth published in the journal Monday. The process of angiogenesis, the growth of capillaries, has been explored for decades by scientists, most notably the late Judah Folkman, who investigated how to stop the process in cancer. On the flip side, encouraging this growth is being investigated to help repair damage caused by heart attacks. However, capillaries aren't enough. Promoting the growth of new arteries, or arteriogenesis is essential to bring in enough blood supply to regrow dead heart muscle. While arteriogenesis and angiogenesis are related, they are not the same."""</Msg><Username>bubba836</Username><Timestamp>1369019279574</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 23:07:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369019403252-133</Id><Topic><Title>"Artery Formation Process Discovered"</Title><Username>bubba836</Username><Timestamp>1369019279574</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 23:07:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"""The process of arteriogenesis is complicated, relying on a molecular trio working in harmony. These include two growth factors, VEGF-1 and VEGF-2. A third molecule, NRP1, transports these molecules to the proper place in blood vessel walls to start regrowth. The Yale-UCL study found that a certain part of NRP1 called the cytoplasmic tail is necessary is necessary for arteriogenesis, although angiogenesis is unaffected. The lead researchers are Michael Simons of Yale and Christiana Ruhrberg of UCL. "We show that mice with a knockin mutation that ablates the NRP1 cytoplasmic tail (Nrp1cyto) have normal angiogenesis but impaired developmental and adult arteriogenesis," the study stated. The malformed NRP1 fail to activate a pathway involving ERK, or extracellular-signal-regulated kinases, enzymes involved in arteriogenesis. The paper is titled, "The Neuropilin-1 cytoplasmic domain is required for VEGF-A-dependent arteriogenesis".
