Police Officer Kirk D. Merricks, 43, is now facing 11 counts of possession of an explosive device, four counts of obtaining stolen property and one count of illegal possession of ammunition. A bomb squad was called in to remove the explosives from the residence on the night of July 11. “We requested the assistance of the Mass State Police Bomb Squad, as well as the [Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives], and we sought a search warrant after we secured those devices that we did locate—some were in the house and some were in a shed in the backyard,” Plymouth Chief Michael Botieri told WATV. A police report states that Merricks’ wife and son discovered the explosives when they were going through the officer’s belongings. After calling Plymouth police around 3 p.m. Thursday, the officer’s wife led them to a shed containing military-grade explosives. A metal box contained four explosive sticks wrapped in military-style cloth and marked as ”TNT”. A black briefcase contained four 40 mm grenades that are normally used with an M203 grenade launcher – a device that the US military introduced in the early 1970s. M203 grenade launchers are categorized as “Destructive Devices” under the National Firearms Act and are rarely available on the civilian weapons market. Officers also found a detonation cord, blasting caps, and military-grade ammunition. Chief Botieri told reporters that investigators believe the items were stolen, since they are generally not available for civilian purchase. Although Merricks is licensed to carry firearms, none of the explosives or military-grade ammunition were issued to him by police. “They are obviously not anything that civilians should possess,” Botieri told the Boston Globe. “We believe it’s all stolen. It’s not something you can go out and buy without the correct permits.” Merricks was on duty while his home was being searched, and was arrested shortly thereafter. He has been placed on paid administrative leave and stripped of his handgun and badge. After pleading not guilty to his charges on Friday morning, he was freed on $1,000 bail. Botieri is a 14-year veteran of the Boston Police Department who previously served with the Marine Corps during Desert Storm. Police were called to his home during a domestic dispute last month. Merricks’ wife says the couple separated on June 4, when she filed a restraining order against him, accusing him of verbal abuse. Eric Goldman, the attorney representing Merrick, said his client had not been living in the house for three months, and suggested that the “contentious” divorce proceedings may have something to do with the woman’s call to police. Police have launched an investigation into the incident.</Msg><Username>mel_gibson1111</Username><Timestamp>1373739701535</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 14:21:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373739788781-30</Id><Topic><Title>Boston police officer arrested after bombs and explosives found inside home</Title><Username>mel_gibson1111</Username><Timestamp>1373739701535</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 14:21:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I was wondering if he was missing his backpack.</Msg><Username>mel_gibson1111</Username><Timestamp>1373739788781</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 14:23:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373739992295-31</Id><Topic><Title>Boston police officer arrested after bombs and explosives found inside home</Title><Username>mel_gibson1111</Username><Timestamp>1373739701535</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 14:21:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Kirk D.

Many suburbanites value self-reliance? ROFLMFO. The RV park is for republicans that don't quite qualify as being insane according to the standards of the winning party. I don't think lindsay will remain alone for long, perhaps the king could start another subtle campaign like fast and furious but this one to model normal heterosexual social activities that don't involve revealing classfied information. They can't keep running a trade deficit like this forever and giving free money to US citizens through mortgage purchases. I guess this is technically trickle down idea, the money is not trickling through entities that turn out needed products but just churn the monopoly money and then pay taxes with some of it.

At no point did I hear testimony indicating that he announced himself or his quasi-official authority, warn the victim that he was armed, or even shout 'Stop or I'll shoot'. He pulled the ultimate sucker punch on Martin by goading him into swinging first; misjudged his opponent's ability to clean his clock, and when things went bad defended the ground he was lying on. Florida's "stand your ground" law gets him off the 2nd degree murder charge, but his decision to pursue and accost someone without probable cause gets him convicted of manslaughter. Oh, wait, that's what a system of justice would deliver. In the American simulation of a justice system, justice is an incidental by-product and not the goal of a system intended to resolve disputes. The system will work, and produce a resolution, but justice was never even under consideration and should not be expected as an output of the court.

The probe continues, with no specified end date, a Canadian Forces spokesperson said, long after most Canadian soldiers have left Afghanistan and nearly five years after a board of inquiry was convened on Nov. 21, 2008, by Lt. Gen. Andrew Leslie. A preliminary investigation into the claims concluded in 2010 and since then the case has been under review by the office of the Canadian army’s deputy commander, currently Maj. Gen. P.F. Wynnyk. Eight board investigators, as well as board president Brig.-Gen. Glenn Nordick, have interviewed 87 witnesses and collected more than 30,000 pages of documents, said a spokesperson for the Department of National Defence. Jessie Chauhan, a DND spokesperson, said the investigation has taken so long because of its “complex” nature. ... Tyrel Braaten, for instance, a Canadian army bombardier, said during a December 2008 interview that he had witnessed an Afghan interpreter taking a boy who was about 12 years old into a building on Forward Operating Base Wilson, about 30 kilometres outside Kandahar. The boy was wearing a wig, lipstick and perfume, and was dressed in a flowing robe. The interpreter, who worked for the Canadian army, told Braaten that the boy was one of “the b i t*c h e s.”</Msg><Username>bo_jackson_1</Username><Timestamp>1373769733081</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 22:42:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373769852954-114</Id><Topic><Title>What will happen in Sanford.</Title><Username>trayvonmorton</Username><Timestamp>1373667927944</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 18:25:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Viewer wants to move on ... we need to discuss the minuettes doll dance and fish2kills clarinet solo</Msg><Username>vieweroutrage</Username><Timestamp>1373769852954</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 22:44:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373770207722-115</Id><Topic><Title>twana sharptons head must be about to explode</Title><Username>zevoter01</Username><Timestamp>1373768744721</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 22:25:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Zimmerman has a great case against NBC, hope he wins billions</Msg><Username>zevoter01</Username><Timestamp>1373770207722</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 22:50:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373770426899-116</Id><Topic><Title>Boston police officer arrested after bombs and explosives found inside home</Title><Username>mel_gibson1111</Username><Timestamp>1373739701535</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 14:21:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Bump....</Msg><Username>barry_bonds64</Username><Timestamp>1373770426899</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 22:53:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373771146709-117</Id><Topic><Title>No shortage of angry FAT MAMA's in Stanford!!</Title><Username>cameltozy</Username><Timestamp>1373769190804</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 22:33:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Apparently the GOP BS....which is in endless supply.</Msg><Username>erazor111</Username><Timestamp>1373771146709</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 23:05:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373772176715-118</Id><Title>Will twana sharpton make it in for a camera shot?</Title><Msg>MSNNBC is unable to contact him.
