The chart shows an uncanny resemblance (lower or weekly chart) to the 2010 rally when the stock went from $8 to $24 in 4 weeks. I hear that the company is stronger and more diversified now than in 2010. The company did not have the highly profitable cloud divisions in 2010. I will be buying with both hands tomorrow. I became interested today after I've received an alert from SeeekingAlpha.

During an interview that was noted for actually asking Obama questions with follow-up rather than the sorry spectacle we’ve become accustomed to of a reporter attaching himself to Obama’s nether regions and demonstrating their absence of a gag reflex, Obama was questioned about the ill-conceived Operation Fast and Furious and the DOJ IG report: Q Mr. President, you told me during an interview that you — Eric Holder or you did not authorize the Fast and Furious operation that allowed 2,000 weapons from the United States to Mexico, and they were in drug-trafficking hands. I think that up to 100 Mexicans might have died, and also American agent, Brian Terry. There’s a report that 14 agents were responsible for the operation. But shouldn’t Attorney General Eric Holder — he should have known about that. And if he didn’t, should you fire him? THE PRESIDENT: Well, first of all, I think it’s important for us to understand that the Fast and Furious program was a field-initiated program begun under the previous administration. When Eric Holder found out about it, he discontinued it. We assigned an inspector general to do a thorough report that was just issued, confirming that, in fact, Eric Holder did not know about this, that he took prompt action and the people who did initiate this were held accountable. This is a lie on a lot of levels. The program, Operation Wide Receiver, that was started under President Bush was coordinated with the Mexican government. Guns were not allowed to leave government surveillance. The operation initiated under Obama was done without the consent of the Mexican government and no attempt was made to keep the weapons under surveillance. Rather the harebrained scheme was to link the weapons to actual murders in Mexico for the ostensible reason of identifying gun trafficking networks. A more cynical view sees Rahm Emanuel’s dictum of “don’t waste a good crisis” and a deliberate arming of Mexican gangs with the express intent that the weapons would be used in mayhem and thus create a set of facts to increase ATF authority over gun sales. This guy isn’t smart. He isn’t quick on his feet. His entire political life has been characterized by the press treating him with kid gloves and telling each other what kind of a master communicator he is. The Univision interview is what happens when he is confronted with actual journalism.</Msg><Username>obamistan</Username><Timestamp>1348476998628</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 04:56:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348478119979-10</Id><Title>CBS is like satans girlfriend</Title><Msg>And Obama is like Mini Me satan.

Today NTWK is a much stronger company with far more revenue sources including new Cloud Divisions. Unlike 2010, NTWK today has the flexibility to deliver reliable software products and services not only from Pakistan but also from excellence centers located in Bangkok, Beijing, the US, and the UK. The float today is 1/10 of what it was then and 2013 revenues are expected to breakaway into the mid $40 million for the first time in company history. During 2010 (and 2007) NTWK's market cap reached over $100 million on 50% lower revenues of what is projected for 2013. During the September 4Q CC NTWK officials stated that revenues are expected to reach $100 Million in 2015 up significantly from the $38 Million reported in 2012. They also expect margins to continue to go up as the high-margin Cloud divisions keep continuing exponentially to revenues. MUST READ ……This Week’s Analysts Comments on Upgrade: We project 13% annual growth to FY14 from FY10 reflecting 80 significant NFS legacy customers in FY14, up from 52, 37, and 28 in FY12, FY11, and FY10, respectively. The new Vroozi Cloud Division contributed $1.3 million in FY12. We expect at least $4 million in FY13 and $6 million to FY14 Our price target is based on the average forward 2013 P/E multiple of 13.2X (up from 12.8X in August 2012). NTWK is trading at 6.4X our FY13 projections. We are forecasting EPS of $0.85 per share. We applied an 11X multiple to our FY13 EPS forecast. We anticipate a richer multiple as earnings momentum builds in FY13. The company guidance calls for $1/share net income in 2013. NTWK is entering FY13 with a $25 million backlog and approximately $100 million in qualified leads. One quarter of the backlog is from four new NFS platform customer implementations that began in 4Q12. In August 2011, NetSol launched its Cloud Vroozi Division, an e-procurement search tool for SAP supplier relationship management (SRM) users. SAP AG is a global vendor of enterprise management systems that has the largest market share (24%) based on a worldwide Gartner survey. Vroozi should provide sales diversification and a higher margin recurring revenue stream. The Vroozi division contributed $1.3 million in FY12 sales and is expected to grow to $4 million in revenues in 2013 NTWK announced its 2nd Cloud Division last week offering an array of products and services to capture a greater % of the cloud applications in North America. The company is implementing this division using their significant software development capabilities and infrastructure. === MORE NTWWK HIGHLIGHTS: - Company projects Doubling/Tripling revenues and net income by 2015 - Significant Institutional investor ownership and growing - Insiders bought over 5% of the Outstanding shares the last 2 years and never sold a single share - Total share count is only 7.5 million shares.

In 2010 NTWK went from $8 to $24 in a few weeks. Today NTWK is a much stronger company with far more revenue sources including new Cloud Divisions. Unlike 2010, NTWK today has the flexibility to deliver reliable software products and services not only from Pakistan but also from excellence centers located in Bangkok, Beijing, the US, and the UK. The float today is 1/10 of what it was then and 2013 revenues are expected to breakaway into the mid $40 million for the first time in company history. During 2010 (and 2007) NTWK's market cap reached over $100 million on 50% lower revenues of what is projected for 2013. During the September 4Q CC NTWK officials stated that revenues are expected to reach $100 Million in 2015 up significantly from the $38 Million reported in 2012. They also expect margins to continue to go up as the high-margin Cloud divisions keep continuing exponentially to revenues. MUST READ ……This Week’s Analysts Comments on Upgrade: We project 13% annual growth to FY14 from FY10 reflecting 80 significant NFS legacy customers in FY14, up from 52, 37, and 28 in FY12, FY11, and FY10, respectively. The new Vroozi Cloud Division contributed $1.3 million in FY12. We expect at least $4 million in FY13 and $6 million to FY14 Our price target is based on the average forward 2013 P/E multiple of 13.2X (up from 12.8X in August 2012). NTWK is trading at 6.4X our FY13 projections. We are forecasting EPS of $0.85 per share. We applied an 11X multiple to our FY13 EPS forecast. We anticipate a richer multiple as earnings momentum builds in FY13. The company guidance calls for $1/share net income in 2013. NTWK is entering FY13 with a $25 million backlog and approximately $100 million in qualified leads. One quarter of the backlog is from four new NFS platform customer implementations that began in 4Q12. In August 2011, NetSol launched its Cloud Vroozi Division, an e-procurement search tool for SAP supplier relationship management (SRM) users. SAP AG is a global vendor of enterprise management systems that has the largest market share (24%) based on a worldwide Gartner survey. Vroozi should provide sales diversification and a higher margin recurring revenue stream. The Vroozi division contributed $1.3 million in FY12 sales and is expected to grow to $4 million in revenues in 2013 NTWK announced its 2nd Cloud Division last week offering an array of products and services to capture a greater % of the cloud applications in North America. The company is implementing this division using their significant software development capabilities and infrastructure. === MORE NTWWK HIGHLIGHTS: - Company projects Doubling/Tripling revenues and net income by 2015 - Significant Institutional investor ownership and growing - Insiders bought over 5% of the Outstanding shares the last 2 years and never sold a single share - Total share count is only 7.5 million shares.

Kevin Castel substantially denied Defendants’ motions to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint in In re Bank of America Corp. Securities, Derivative and “ERISA” Litigation, No. 09-MD-2058 (S.D.N.Y.), upholding Lead Plaintiffs’ claim alleging misstatements and omissions concerning Merrill Lynch’s fourth quarter 2008 losses, but dismissing the ancillary claim of false statements concerning the necessity of obtaining a bailout in order to complete the merger between Bank of America and Merrill. In its July 29 opinion, the Court reinstated Lead Plaintiffs’ claim concerning Merrill’s fourth quarter losses based on allegations added to the Second Amended Complaint in support of scienter, which led the Court to conclude that scienter was adequately alleged as to CEO Ken Lewis, CFO Joseph Price, and BofA. Specifically, with respect to Lewis, the Court found scienter was adequately alleged “by virtue of his position within BofA and his awareness of Merrill’s losses,” against which Lewis’s inaction in seeking disclosure advice was at least severely reckless. As to Price, the Court found that the complaint adequately alleged that he understood the significance of Merrill’s massive and increasing losses, stating “it is implausible to conclude that Price, the CFO of BofA, did not understand that there was a correlation between the size of Merrill’s losses and BofA’s disclosure obligations.” Moreover, the Court thoroughly rejected Defendants’ arguments that Price merely relied, in good faith, on the advice of counsel in not disclosing the losses because the complaint alleges that he “cherry-picked the figures and even then was untimely in giving counsel updated information.” IMHO</Msg><Username>greenpoint21</Username><Timestamp>1348506969809</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 13:16:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348506984518-133</Id><Topic><Title>poor jugears everywhere he turns he is confronted with the lies he spewed</Title><Username>zevoter22</Username><Timestamp>1348502878576</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 12:07:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Typical unsupported nonsense from you little z. What do you think of Romney's plan not to round up illegals and deport them? His reliance on "self deportation" to solve the illegal immigration problem? These were his statements when interviewed by latino TV. Why do you suppose he had to release a twenty year summary of his tax returns to get an average tax rate paid instead of just the last 10 everyone has asked for and no details? Why do you suppose he dropped 1.75 million in charitable contributions from his 2011 tax return so his tax rate paid wouldn't be below 10%? Of course you wouldn't be part of the 47% like the military serving in a combat zone or the elderly on social security or the disabled that have a victim mentality and want to be dependent on government or one of the 4000 making over a million a year that pay no income taxes.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1348506984518</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 13:16:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348507142931-134</Id><Topic><Title>Very soon October12...all the lies...lack of full disclosure...misrepresentation...negligence...ignorance of FIDICIARY OBLIGATION to shareholders may now come back to bite !!!</Title><Username>greenpoint21</Username><Timestamp>1348506969809</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 13:16:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>FIDUCIARY DUTIES (spelling error)</Msg><Username>greenpoint21</Username><Timestamp>1348507142931</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 13:19:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348507588655-135</Id><Topic><Title>BAC is a on the border and trying a cover to scrap back the origin on every deal</Title><Username>alvaelliott392</Username><Timestamp>1338381722000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-05-30 08:42:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Need some advise from someone that knows the anwser</Msg><Username>wilburnoliver242</Username><Timestamp>1348507588655</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 13:26:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348507721229-136</Id><Topic><Title>Very soon October12...all the lies...lack of full disclosure...misrepresentation...negligence...ignorance of FIDICIARY OBLIGATION to shareholders may now come back to bite !!!</Title><Username>greenpoint21</Username><Timestamp>1348506969809</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 13:16:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>they all criminals buddie..</Msg><Username>tom.foolery2</Username><Timestamp>1348507721229</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 13:28:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348507739735-137</Id><Title>MOUCHSHELL</Title><Msg>Says she is not proud o f the usa well she sure likes spending our money well the usa is not proud of her .

Operated activity was focused on the northern block of Evi during Q1, where LPR drilled eight wells in a single section. All eight wells are now on stream and initial rates indicate no signs of interference between wells. LPR has regulatory approval for up to 16 wells per section in certain sections at Evi and has plans to initiate a pilot of up to 12 wells per section in H2. Notwithstanding certain step-out wells that did not perform as expected, we believe LPR ultimately has the opportunity to double its current 500 well location inventory and surface up to ~$9/share. As well managements guidance For second half of 2012 was for 90$ wit with a differential of 12 meaning they only expected to receive 78$ a barrel for oil vs. The 100$ we are getting today. Wti at 92 Edmonton par wit premium of 7.50$ That is a big deal especially when oil accounts for 70% of rev. At current cap ex and prices we will be fc positive in q3 with 1 rig in evi, I suspect we will add back the second one and ramp up into 2013.....and if we sell off some ng acreage, then add more evi......look out ....this stock came public at the wrong time and forest shouldn't have dividended out the ownership....there is no short interest, no interest, completely unknown which is great for us in at these vast discounts. Time will reprice. The oil is flowing. Liquidity secure with over a 100 million available and that to will expand as banks use higher price decks. No worries on a possible winfall tax from US govt should and when oils spikes. Land in NWT more productive then Barnett Shale, once Ng recoveries LPR is a ATM, spitting out cash.

Its stock has increased the most among these banks in 2012, and throughout the last year. Bank of America's potential for capital appreciation has increased even more recently since investors' outlook on Europe's crisis is improving, and Bank of America recently made significant strides toward completing its New BAC project. Bank of America is currently absent in the growing housing market, but it's on the way to recovery and improved earnings through its current consolidation and restructuring phase. Bank of America is still available at a significant discount in comparison to its peers. By undergoing the cost savings initiatives in the New BAC project, Bank of America should be financially secure enough to get federal approval for increasing its dividend again in the near future.</Msg><Username>jedbs2</Username><Timestamp>1348512944627</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 14:55:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348513143768-166</Id><Title>Wake Up and Smell the B.O.</Title><Msg>The B.O. rally, that is. lol Bennie and B.O. , Bennie knows his career and more importantly his legacy is on he line.

Today NTWK is a much stronger company with far more revenue sources including new Cloud Divisions. Unlike 2010, NTWK today has the flexibility to deliver reliable software products and services not only from Pakistan but also from excellence centers located in Bangkok, Beijing, the US, and the UK. The float today is 1/10 of what it was then and 2013 revenues are expected to breakaway into the mid $40 million for the first time in company history. During 2010 (and 2007) NTWK's market cap reached over $100 million on 50% lower revenues of what is projected for 2013. During the September 4Q CC NTWK officials stated that revenues are expected to reach $100 Million in 2015 up significantly from the $38 Million reported in 2012. They also expect margins to continue to go up as the high-margin Cloud divisions keep continuing exponentially to revenues. MUST READ ……This Week’s Analysts Comments on Upgrade: We project 13% annual growth to FY14 from FY10 reflecting 80 significant NFS legacy customers in FY14, up from 52, 37, and 28 in FY12, FY11, and FY10, respectively. The new Vroozi Cloud Division contributed $1.3 million in FY12. We expect at least $4 million in FY13 and $6 million to FY14 Our price target is based on the average forward 2013 P/E multiple of 13.2X (up from 12.8X in August 2012). NTWK is trading at 6.4X our FY13 projections. We are forecasting EPS of $0.85 per share. We applied an 11X multiple to our FY13 EPS forecast. We anticipate a richer multiple as earnings momentum builds in FY13. The company guidance calls for $1/share net income in 2013. NTWK is entering FY13 with a $25 million backlog and approximately $100 million in qualified leads. One quarter of the backlog is from four new NFS platform customer implementations that began in 4Q12. In August 2011, NetSol launched its Cloud Vroozi Division, an e-procurement search tool for SAP supplier relationship management (SRM) users. SAP AG is a global vendor of enterprise management systems that has the largest market share (24%) based on a worldwide Gartner survey. Vroozi should provide sales diversification and a higher margin recurring revenue stream. The Vroozi division contributed $1.3 million in FY12 sales and is expected to grow to $4 million in revenues in 2013 NTWK announced its 2nd Cloud Division last week offering an array of products and services to capture a greater % of the cloud applications in North America. The company is implementing this division using their significant software development capabilities and infrastructure. === MORE NTWWK HIGHLIGHTS: - Company projects Doubling/Tripling revenues and net income by 2015 - Significant Institutional investor ownership and growing - Insiders bought over 5% of the Outstanding shares the last 2 years and never sold a single share - Total share count is only 7.5 million shares.

Proponents of the Government Plan claim that the majority of the cuts will go to reducing Fraud. "", the cuts will come from two prime sources; (1) eliminating Medicare fraud, estimates are that this fraud cost tax payers 60 billion dollars annual and (2) a reduction in the amount of payments that are paid into Medicare Advantage"" . 1. Cutting medicare advantage is cutting benefits. 2. How does reducing the funding by 715 Billion fight Fraud? Medicare Fraud has been going on for years. Why hasn't Medicare eliminated it long before this? And again, how do you reduce Fraud by reducing funding. Lies, lies, and dammmmmmmmmmmed lies. But then that's B.

PLUS, they will gain insurance policies under Obamacare that now go to current insurance companies. And NOBODY will be able to make the government controlled doctors actually treat Americans. You see it with Worker's Comp all the time. They pick the doctors and the judges! The workers (Americans) get turned away by good doctors, get refused treatment by the chosen "doctors", and are forced to suffer for the rest of their lives in poverty. Prepare to see poverty numbers soar well above 50 MILLION Americans under Obamacare. My gosh, 3% of you home sale to Obamacare and 7% to the realitor and suddenly owning a home looks even less appealing. If people have their house foreclosed on, do the avoid the 3% to Obamacare? They at least avoid the 7% to realitors who cause the high home prices to begin with.

If you give your son your house valued at 525,000, as a gift...he will likely pay any amount over the 200,000 limit. i.e. 325,000 taxed as ordinary income. It really doesn't matter if you already owned the property and has paid all taxes. Days will come next tax filings that all these women salivating for OBAMA will say I want to go back to BUSH years. If OBAMACARE is really that good then why did DEMOCRATIC CONGRESS passed the Kennedy health care bill exempting the PRESIDENT, CONGRESS and their families as well as certain FEDERAL and GO'VT EMPLOYESS. They are 100% exempted from participating in OBAMACARE. and the ordinary common middle class will be left holding the BAG, PAYING FOR THE UNINSURED. As what the BRUHA PELOUSY had said " you have to pass the bill before you will know whats in it" ALL the multi millionaires and billionaires really don't care , because no matter how much the health care cost, it is tax deduction to them. The " HAVE NOTS" will not shoulder the burden because they got it for free. SMALL BUSINESSES will just trim the work force and hire a lot of temporary jobs and will opt just to pay the penalty of 2500 for not insuring them. If the employer keeps on hiring temporary jobs every two months and laying off people every two months...you really don't need to pay any penalty. So the COLLEGE GRAD SCHOOL TEACHER WILL BE SUBSTITUTE FOR LIFE.
