Yes, the Democrats are reponsible for the dismal economy. And it will get much worse in the next year. But no matter what happens, they will somehow spin it to blame someone else. Of course it is all in the name of free stuff! That 47% will do &amp; say anything to protect their free stuff World. The Liberals have had so much for so long that they want everything forever! Let the successful achievers pay for everything the lazy say! Obama wants to punish the successful &amp; not the rich as he would want you to believe. It is more politicaly correct to make the poor think it is someone else who is responsible for their plight. Of course a vote from a poor person counts the same as a vote from a successful person. Sad to say people will only learn the hard way why Socialism does not work forever. Greece, Spain &amp; France are learning the hard way. The USA is next! For the 1st time in our Nations history we have been downgraded by S&amp;P. Early in 2013 S&amp;P will downgrade us once again. Why? Because of Obamas failed policies &amp; dismal economy. Good luck Liberals!

You seem to suffer from some vanity that makes you think we need you in the USA but you have presented no evidence that you have ever done anything that is important to anyone here. We seem to be getting along just fine without you. Yes the American dollar will buy you a lot more some places offshore. You can have servants, you can have a house with an ocean view and you can pay foreign taxes, enjoy that countries form of government and all those things you think are so much better than you had here in the USA. Maybe you should tell us what is so much better about the government where you are now or at least what country you are enjoying such comfort in away from the terrible USA. I doubt many here will want to make the USA more like your present location. What is the GDP, poverty rate, life expectancy, what kind of health care does it provide and how is it paid for? How are the elderly cared for? Security? Sanitation? Infrastructure? Does the local population there enjoy the same comforts you do from the largess you were able to accumulate in the USA? What are the economic opportunities for the average citizen and not for the wealthy gringo that arrives with a fat bank account? How are the schools for your children? Are you really allowed to own property there or just have a long lease? If you want to start a business what are the rules for having an indigenous partner? Life and living is a lot more than having a house with an ocean view and servants.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1355411987930</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 10:19:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355411995192-67</Id><Title>Judging from action on MBI..looks like they will get a lot in settlement with BAC</Title><Msg>going to $30</Msg><Username>greatestideaman</Username><Timestamp>1355411995192</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 10:19:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355412070407-68</Id><Topic><Title>BAC: This week direction?</Title><Username>wine_bread</Username><Timestamp>1315321996000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2011-09-06 11:13:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In a good agreement with * I Know First system * positive stance on BAC: Bank of America receives constructive comments from JPMorgan, which says to expect a number of upside earnings estimate revisions.

Today they said housing forclosures have dropped to a six year low. We should see this reflection in BAC next quarter report causing a squeeze. I have been holding my shares for the last three years and have seen my stock go up a little less than 300 percent since my purchase in 2009. As I have said may times on this board, most of my gains comes from corporate bonds in which I get over $100 a day everyday 365 days a year. In Jan. of next year, that daily amount should be over $120 a day. Last week I sold one of my corporate bonds for a net gain of over $8000 plus the $.60 rise in BAC's stock price gave me a $10,000 week. I spend very little time watching this stock and will sell at $50 a share. Looking forward to the dividend and stock repurchase by BAC in the very near future.</Msg><Username>m.inally</Username><Timestamp>1355420343357</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 12:39:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355420447232-113</Id><Title>This is one reason JVA will soar this week or by Monday closing next week.</Title><Msg>STATEN ISLAND, NY -- (Marketwire) -- 12/06/12 -- Coffee Holding Co., Inc. (NASDAQ: JVA) (the "Company") today announced that its board of directors approved an increase to its regularly scheduled quarterly dividend and an acceleration of such dividend payment. The quarterly dividend of $0.06 will be paid on December 28, 2012 to stockholders as of the close of business on December 17, 2012. The prior quarterly dividends have been paid at a rate of $0.03 per share and the fourth quarter dividend payments were previously paid in the January following the Company's fiscal year end. "Given the likelihood of a change in the tax rates applicable to dividends starting in 2013, we believe it is prudent to accelerate the timing of the payment of our fourth quarter dividend and increase the return of value to our shareholders prior to the contemplated changes in the tax rates. Going forward, we will continue to monitor our dividend program and any future determination as to the payment of dividends will depend upon the financial conditions and results of operations of the Company and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors, including changes in the tax rates applicable to dividend payments," said Andrew Gordon, President &amp; CEO.</Msg><Username>rimmdiva</Username><Timestamp>1355420447232</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 12:40:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355420461650-114</Id><Title>BAC #1 Windi dressingh stockby year's end at 52 week HIGH</Title><Msg>Manager are gonna rush in to load up on BAC for window dressing.

Beppe Grillo, the disheveled stand-up comic whose severe criticism of Italy's mainstream politicians has helped his party, the Five Star Movement, gain the support of close to 15 percent of Italians in recent polls, said: "Monti was as the Americans say a "bluff," a bubble. Our country went bankrupt last year but half of the debt was in French and German banks. " "Had we gone bankrupt last year, Europe would have ended. So they sent in Monti to manage the situation in order for the German and French banks to get their money back." (Read More: Grillo Surfs Anti-Establishment Wave) The announcement that Monti will step down as Prime Minister before the expected time, after losing the support of Silvio Berlusconi's party, has put heavily-indebted Italy firmly back on the euro zone agenda this week. Monti was viewed as a safe pair of hands in Italian politics,often dominated by larger-than-life characters like Berlusconi or satirist Grillo - who dismissed the current administration as "amateur parasites." However, Grillo, who worked as an accountant before starting his career in comedy, believes that the imposition of austerity laws backed by other euro zone leaders and accepting more backing from the ECB is hurting Italy. Grillo rarely gives TV interviews as he prefers the medium of blogging, but spoke to CNBC in Milan. (Read More: Italy's Next Leader: Neither Comedian Nor Cavalier) "The ECB puts out money that is meant to help our banks,but they do not use it to finance our businesses, but they give it to them to buy back their debt, to help French and German banks. That was Monti's work," he said. Elections in Italy are now expected in late February or early March. While Grillo has said in the past he does not want to stand for office or become part of a coalition, his party could still influence government if it gets a significant share of the vote. The Monti government is currently trying to put through a law which would stop convicted criminals becoming members of the Italian parliament, a move that would rule Grillo out because he was convicted for manslaughter in 1981 after he crashed his car on a mountain road, killing his three passengers. Meanwhile, Grillo has said his party would reject any attempt by Italy to seek assistance from the ECB's outright monetary transactions (OMT) program, the cheap debt widely viewed as a potential savior for both Italy and Spain. "The OMT would just mean more debt," Grillo said. "We want to interrupt the increase in debt. We have to stop the strangling and reschedule the debt with close to zero interest rates. We cannot afford it. This beautiful country is dying." Grillo attacked bond markets for raising the cost of Italian debt and claimed the current rise in yields is "mental hallucination created by speculation in the banking sector." (Read More: Italian Banks and Bonds in Trouble) "The spread is completely detached from the real economy...(and) created by speculation in the banking sector. Because half of the Italian debt is owned by foreign banks. And these banks try to get higher rates in order to earn more. So we are a victim of banking speculation of both foreign and domestic banks....which are detached from the real economy," he said. "We need to stop the vicious cycle of debt that is strangling us."</Msg><Username>rhinoinchgo</Username><Timestamp>1355435408002</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 16:50:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355435487081-175</Id><Topic><Title>HOORAY FOR MICHIGAN!</Title><Username>barack_crock</Username><Timestamp>1355257078673</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 15:17:58 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>While problems exist in Unions , just like problems exist in all organizations they were the driving force in the establishment of a strong middle class.

That was Monti's work," he said. Elections in Italy are now expected in late February or early March. While Grillo has said in the past he does not want to stand for office or become part of a coalition, his party could still influence government if it gets a significant share of the vote. The Monti government is currently trying to put through a law which would stop convicted criminals becoming members of the Italian parliament, a move that would rule Grillo out because he was convicted for manslaughter in 1981 after he crashed his car on a mountain road, killing his three passengers. Meanwhile, Grillo has said his party would reject any attempt by Italy to seek assistance from the ECB's outright monetary transactions (OMT) program, the cheap debt widely viewed as a potential savior for both Italy and Spain. "The OMT would just mean more debt," Grillo said. "We want to interrupt the increase in debt. We have to stop the strangling and reschedule the debt with close to zero interest rates. We cannot afford it. This beautiful country is dying." Grillo attacked bond markets for raising the cost of Italian debt and claimed the current rise in yields is "mental hallucination created by speculation in the banking sector."

Beppe Grillo, the disheveled stand-up comic whose severe criticism of Italy's mainstream politicians has helped his party, the Five Star Movement, gain the support of close to 15 percent of Italians in recent polls, said: "Monti was as the Americans say a "bluff," a bubble. Our country went bankrupt last year but half of the debt was in French and German banks. " "Had we gone bankrupt last year, Europe would have ended. So they sent in Monti to manage the situation in order for the German and French banks to get their money back." (Read More: Grillo Surfs Anti-Establishment Wave) The announcement that Monti will step down as Prime Minister before the expected time, after losing the support of Silvio Berlusconi's party, has put heavily-indebted Italy firmly back on the euro zone agenda this week. Monti was viewed as a safe pair of hands in Italian politics,often dominated by larger-than-life characters like Berlusconi or satirist Grillo - who dismissed the current administration as "amateur parasites." However, Grillo, who worked as an accountant before starting his career in comedy, believes that the imposition of austerity laws backed by other euro zone leaders and accepting more backing from the ECB is hurting Italy.

Even though I have worked in a union shop for only a very short time period in my life, we have all benefited from the unions. In order to keep the unions out of non-union work places, a business would have to be competitive with union shop benefits. I have a son who is handycapped and has been working for a company for 15 years. This company is a union based employment and when we wanted to relocate because of a new home, the company would not except his relocation. The union stood behind him and made the company take him back. Once the union loses it power it will be all down hill, wages and benefits. The other problem is our governor who is a business man and everything he has done is for business. The hell with the common man. His first act was to removed prices on products in stores. The shelves would have the price, but the product would not, leaving the possabilities of errors at the checkout. He said that this would increase labor. Instead it reduces labor and jobs and provides an opportunity for shady retail practices.</Msg><Username>m.inally</Username><Timestamp>1355445108000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 19:31:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355445794062-197</Id><Topic><Title>HOORAY FOR MICHIGAN!</Title><Username>barack_crock</Username><Timestamp>1355257078673</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 15:17:58 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If the union offers value added then people can decide if they want to join or not.

They work their butt off for years, not paying union dues (which guarantee nothing in the long term), but paying the other kind of dues that guarantee a future. Non-union licensed electricians are just as good as union electricians. Your point makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. Unions were NEVER organized to protect the public from shoddy product (see Chrysler) nor to create a middle class. They were organized to ensure workers had a safe working environment, that they weren't exploited (in the worst sense of the word, not the mollycoddling sense we use today) or indentured, and that's about it. Today, they niggle over petty work rules to pretend that they are delivering something for the low-information union members while the company languishes and goes bankrupt, leaving the union members jobless.
