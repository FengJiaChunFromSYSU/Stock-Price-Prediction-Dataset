It was mainly the 'college age #$%$' throughout this country who all voted for Obama again...They are the ignorant fools, many of which are definitely un-informed with world, political and economic affairs or just plain facts of life! These young college fool voters are the future of the country what is left of it. Scary isn't it! All the other Obama voters are typical left wing liberals who all have the same distorted mentality and many others feel the 'government owes them something' and that the wealthy should support them. And, the remaining individuals who voted for Obama 'are also out-of-touch with reality', many of the Obama voters were single women never married, and many are divorced or on some form of government subsidy who feel the government owes them something........America is losing democracy......... Our future is uncertain.........</Msg><Username>carthom09</Username><Timestamp>1352437518160</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-09 00:05:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352437906005-2</Id><Title>get the us out of debt the easy way!!

The CBO yesterday gave its view of how precipitous the drop from the fiscal cliff would be, forecasting that it would cause GDP to shrink 0.5% next year and unemployment to climb to 9.1% from 7.9%. However, growth would be stronger in the long run. If the cliff is avoided, the economy would expand 1.7% but would still remain "below its potential." President Obama is due to have his say later today. ...and Germany warns of slowdown... Germany's Economy Ministry expects "a noticeably weaker economic dynamic" over winter," but said the slowdown will only be temporary. The forecast follows a week of depressing data, including falling industrial output and exports. Q3 GDP is due out next week, with economists expecting an increase of 0.2% on quarter. ...while France heads for recession. France's GDP will slide 0.1% in Q4, the country's central banks predicts. With the bank also estimating that Q3 GDP fell 0.1%, that would put France in recession. German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble is so worried about the decrepit state of the French economy that he's asked the government's council of economic advisers to consider writing a report on what France should do to turn it around, Reuters reports.</Msg><Username>mike_van_der_slut_irvin19</Username><Timestamp>1352467889526</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-09 08:31:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352468006190-47</Id><Topic><Title>good grief california</Title><Username>victory_val_2007</Username><Timestamp>1352318979615</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 15:09:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Believe me I pray everyday</Msg><Username>failure_in_chief</Username><Timestamp>1352468006190</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-09 08:33:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352468185072-48</Id><Title>WHY WOULD BAC GO TO $6 JUST BECAUSE OF THE FISCAL CLIFF???

At one time I thought a party with a platform was a reasonable idea. Time proves me wrong. How then do you create a differentiation in parties? Maybe the parties should only be an organizing mechanism without a platform. The object becomes to support the platform of the candidates it represents. A party with a platform probably somewhat restricts the free will of candidates. No doubt there are unintended consequences to this. If a society is more secular, what fills the void for establishing social norms? In my view, there is an unconscious push back of the government exiting the social norm business. This seems to be a contradiction of the mantra of less government. The government saying it has no position on abortion, it is a social norm issue and the government should not be involved. This obviously appears as less government to me. Is this a failure of government or a failure of social organizations to establish social norms that frown on abortions?</Msg><Username>saving_grandma</Username><Timestamp>1352478281125</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-09 11:24:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352478559646-96</Id><Topic><Title>Mannkind "MNKD" - Upgraded to "Buy" At Bank of America</Title><Username>solantey</Username><Timestamp>1352139399165</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-05 13:16:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Currently trading at under $2.00/share.

I want a copy of my signed Lockin Agreement document and copies of my 6 signed modification attempts as stated in my QWR and a now I want a copy of communications with a hired third party attorney (Lend a Helping Hand of New Jersey) that tried to modify our loan as well from BANK OF AMERICA, but in response to my QWR Bank of America's attorney says I'm on a fishing expedititon and they are foreclosing, on my predatory loan. They have denied me copies of my signed Lock-in agreement showing different loan that was changed and it wasn’t known about until signing (which was supposed to have a signed agreeance of change 72 hours before signing escrow and did not happen) with the explanation from Countrywide of “You couldn't afford the cheaper loan”. To avoid our family becoming homeless and Countrywide knowing we would be, we had to sign. Ever since loosing my job from workplace bullies lies we've been trying to get our loan modified and was even able to pay mortgage all the way through to the end of unemployment benefits. Bank of America has denied sending us copies of 6 different signed modification attempts in the last 3 years back to original 5.75% loan originally agreed upon and was sent a denial letter once. What happened to the other modification attempts? We weren’t being greedy and now we are denied copies of our signed documents that were misplaced or lost by Bank of America and we were left with no choice but to avoid their ignorance, bullying and greed, leaving it in God’s hands. We didn’t want anymore of our personal documents lost so we stopped all communication with Bank of America. Then after several lawsuits, they make it look like we called and applied for a 7th modification attempt and denied us immediately, making it look like the 7th time they did their job and trying to remove our previous attempts, one modification attempt in which was a third party with attorneys and Bank of America won’t give us that communication either. We don’t want our documents lost nor do we want our loan serviced by religious people and countries that hate and are prejudice of True Americans and or True Christians in which we are, nor do we want to support them or allow them to judge us or our wages ever again. Countrywides predatory lending practices and Bank of Americas practices of trying to hide and uphold those loans against borrowers has caused the worth of my home as well as others in the whole neighborhood, to be worth $60,000 less than orginal purchase price. Now my home is being shown online for being in foreclosure and it can be bought at that price at a mortgage of $600 a month, but the bank won't relent from charging me $1,600 -$1,700 a month at 6.25% on the full worth of original price. Why should someone else get to have my house at the loan price and interest rate I am asking to be modified to? In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, I command Bank of America and all lenders to stop all foreclosure and credit check judging practices, and modify every loan in existence to be 25% of the household’s or business’s income, until the loan is paid off at the same fixed low interest rate of 2%, without ever changing, for there shall be storm after storm with God Eternally awake in nature, light, air, water and substance, foreclosing on and removing the businesses and homes of all that entertain; foreclosure of predatory or unequal loans by the greed of money, idolatry, exploitation and judgement of and against American Christian wage earners, which shall be poured back out double upon and towards All banks, lenders, investors, employees and supporters of them, in the name of My Lord, Jesus Christ, AMEN!</Msg><Username>zion93561</Username><Timestamp>1352488502553</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-09 14:15:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352488514166-159</Id><Topic><Title>What were you thinking!?

If you honestly care, which I doubt, the issue isn't paying 35 cents of the $1. of course, if that was the question, it's not an issue. Of course if that was the question, everyone would be a billionaire. Have you figured it out yet? No? It's because the $1 isn't guaranteed. it not a question of paying 35 cents against the guarantee of $1. It's a question of whether 65 cents is worth RISKING $1 to make $1. If your rewad is 65 cents instead of 85 cents, you're less likely to risk your $1. I hope that begins to make snese to you. But I suspect it won't.

In addition, there must be different degrees of risk and each degree of risk could be taxed differently. Is that what you are saying. So instead of 1 capital gains rate there should be 100 capital gain rates to match the degrees of risk. True innovation and entrepreneurship doesn’t care about the tax rate.

One of the major reasons discussed for the layoffs was a proactive response to the Medical Device Tax mandated by the new healthcare law. Dana Holding Corp. As recently as a week ago, a global auto parts manufacturing company in Ohio known as Dana Holding Corp., warned their employees of potential layoffs, citing "$24 million over the next six years in additional U.S. health care expenses". After laying off several white collar staffers, company insiders have hinted at more to come. The company will have to cover the additional $24 million cost somehow, which will likely equate to numerous cuts in their current workforce of 25,500 worldwide. Stryker One of the biggest medical device manufacturers in the world, Stryker will close their facility in Orchard Park, New York, eliminating 96 jobs in December. Worse, they plan on countering the medical device tax in Obamacare by slashing 5% of their global workforce - an estimated 1,170 positions. Boston Scientific In October of 2009, Boston Scientific CEO Ray Elliott, warned that proposed taxes in the health care reform bill could "lead to significant job losses" for his company. Nearly two years later, Elliott announced that the company would be cutting anywhere between 1,200 and 1,400 jobs, while simultaneously shifting investments and workers overseas - to China. Medtronic In March of 2010, medical device maker Medtronic warned that Obamacare taxes could result in a reduction of precisely 1,000 jobs. That plan became reality when the company cut 500 positions over the summer, with another 500 set for the end of 2013.

That's a third of the range lands that President George W. Bush planned to offer, and the new administration said it was taking wilderness-quality lands off the table. On paper, the Rocky Mountain oil shale deposits could yield a great abundance of oil — more than 1 trillion barrels — but environmental groups say it would involve ripping up public lands and depleting scarce sources of water. Political leaders in Arizona and Nevada and farmers worry about a diversion of Colorado River water. Big-game hunters oppose the intrusion of mining. Thousands of pages of comments have been filed on the plans. The U.S. Bureau of Land Management said it selected the best reserves for oil shale, a rock that contains fossilized algae, a primitive form of oil that never received enough heat or pressure to produce liquid crude. It's also a hard nut to crack — major oil companies are still experimenting with ways to make production economical, notably by baking rock in the ground to release fluids." Seems they are doing a great job. 1250 square miles for a technology that isn't even developed yet.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1352514011365</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-09 21:20:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352514547382-230</Id><Topic><Title>petraeus admits affair so he is not forced to drop a dime on obama</Title><Username>zevoter22</Username><Timestamp>1352492746877</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-09 15:25:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You don't make sense.
