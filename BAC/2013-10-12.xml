Big cities are like watch Rome fall. Things just get out of control. Too many people in the scheme of things, too many people, period! Look at the map again, and realize how many states are red. It's everything, except the West coast states, MI and the Northeast (for the most part). Now, here's a fact. Obama won by 5,000,000 people (5 million). At this point in time, there are 317,000,000 (317 million) people in the US. That sure is a small win, when you take it out of context :) But, keep in mind, Obama won. And look again at all those red states. Do you know what that means? There's a helluva lot of people crammed into those few blue states. And that's always were most of the problem cities are. It's just human nature. Pack a bunch of people together and things change. Usually for the worse. Google earth lights, click on a map with the USA on it, then keep clicking on "us" till you fill the screen with the good ole USA! Except for FL, where do you see the big clobs/fingers of pure white? Just by this pic, you could almost tell the blue states :) I always liked the earth lights satellite pics, Don</Msg><Username>doncassel365</Username><Timestamp>1381550400010</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-10-12 00:00:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381550456380-2</Id><Topic><Title>Republican/ Tea Party shutdown keeps death benefits from fallen troops' families</Title><Username>sammysedwat</Username><Timestamp>1381348312667</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-09 15:51:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Let's see some more right-wing lies and spin on how this was not caused by the GOP and the Tea Party.

Apparently you are forgetting that humans are social animals. That means we are born with an instinctive behavior to be interdependent on each other. Only deviant sociopaths behave differently. Our government is a reflection of that dependency, and provides resolution for social problems where private entrepreneurship fails. Can you imagine the Tennessee Valley Authority, one of many national projects, without the government. Spanning several states it would have bogged down in interstate squabblings. Even then Eisenhower had to protect it from people like you by pretending it was necessary for our military defense. Same thing for the Interstate Highway system. But in the case of ACA (aka ObamaCare) we have the government using private medical insurance companies to provide regulated insurance to far more citizens than has ever been done in the past. Pretending we are on our own and the government should be cut down to a minimum defies our innate social nature. That is a perverse ideology that is self destructive and weakens us against any nation that utilized all of its citizens to compete against us. Just imagine that the ACA is the Interstate Highway System of our decade and you will start to appreciate what the Obama and Federal government has done.</Msg><Username>reallyyousure</Username><Timestamp>1381593179610</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-10-12 11:52:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1381593541564-50</Id><Title>Rafael Edward "Ted" Cruz!</Title><Msg>He currently has a safe seat but if he doesn't mend fences with his peer's so he can bring back the bacon...he won't last long in the Senate.

There is no question to gov can do things for mutual benefit, but your specific argument should make food material for liberal frenzy. The TVA and interstate highways systesm would be better used here as an example of creating more capabilityt, as in more doctors or a tricorder, not making redistribution promises and enforcing people to pay for each other's lifestyle choices when that detracts from their own liberties.

By Domenico Montanaro, NBC News | CNBC – Fri, Oct 11, 2013</Title><Msg>That's the message 60 percent of Americans are sending to Washington in a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, saying if they had the chance to vote to defeat and replace every single member of Congress, including their own representative, they would. Just 35 percent say they would not. The 60 percent figure is the highest-ever in that question recorded in the poll, registered in the wake of the government shutdown and threat of the U.S. defaulting on its debt for the first time in history. If the nation's debt limit is not increased one week from now, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew warns that the entire global economy could be in peril. "We continue to use this number as a way to sort of understand how much revulsion there is," said Democratic pollster Peter D. Hart, who conducted the poll with Republican Bill McInturff. "We now have a new high-water mark." The numbers reflect a broader trend over the last few years. Americans have traditionally said that while they might not like Congress, they usually like their own representatives. But that sentiment appears to have shifted. The throw-them-all-out attitude has slowly taken hold over the last three years, coinciding with two things - the rise of the Tea Party caucus in the House and the debt ceiling fight of 2011. In October 2010, a majority of Americans - 50 percent to 47 percent - said they would not fire all congressional members. But by August 2011, 54 percent said they would toss every lawmaker from office; in January 2012, 56 percent said that; and just three months ago, in July, it was 57 percent. Frustration was evident among poll respondents across the ideological spectrum. "You look at 800,000 people being out of work merely because Congress can't come to an agreement to do their job, which we sent them there to do," said a respondent from Mississippi, a strong Democrat. "I am prayerful for a revolution."</Msg><Username>doncassel365</Username><Timestamp>1381610037860</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-10-12 16:33:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381610080352-98</Id><Topic><Title>Poll - Throw the bums out.

One Ohio woman, who considers herself a strong Republican, said her husband is a federal worker and they are worried about paying the bills. "We will not get a paycheck," she said. "It is federal pay and mortgage is due. Who is going to pay that - Obama or Congress who is still getting paid?" Hart points out that the seeds are there to give rise to independent or third-party candidates. According to Hart, "Somewhere, someone's going to pick up and run with the 'throw them all out'" banner. The number of Americans who say they want to fire everyone is fairly consistent among most groups - at around 60 percent - but it spikes among rural voters (70 percent), white independents (70 percent) and those in Republican-held congressional districts (67 percent). Just 52 percent of respondents in Democratic-held districts would vote to fire every lawmaker on Capitol Hill. In another sign of dissatisfaction with the state of politics, 47 percent of Americans said they do not strongly identify with either party. The numbers in this poll also reflect a broader anger and pessimism among Americans, especially when it comes to the economy. A record-low 14 percent think the country is headed in the right direction, down from 30 percent last month. That's the biggest single-month drop in the poll since the shutdown of 1990. And a whopping 78 percent think the country is on the wrong track. Just 17 percent think the economy will improve in the next year, while 42 percent think it will worsen. Americans' confidence in the economy has nose-dived, they say, because of President Barack Obama and congressional Republicans' negotiations - or lack thereof - on the budget. Almost two in three - 63 percent - say it makes them less confident that the economy will get better.</Msg><Username>doncassel365</Username><Timestamp>1381610080352</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-10-12 16:34:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381610090524-99</Id><Topic><Title>Poll - Throw the bums out.

"We're seeing numbers that are associated with historic lows in public confidence." Almost two-thirds - 65 percent - also say the government shutdown is having quite a bit or a great deal of harm on the U.S. economy. "That linkage between these actions in Washington and economic confidence and what that means for trying to stabilize our economy, I think at a big-picture level [shows] how destabilizing" the standoff has been for the economy. Democratic pollster Fred Yang, who helped conduct the poll with Hart, added that Americans are paying attention to this fight and want it resolved before the debt ceiling deadline of Oct. 17.

WASHINGTON – President Obama signed a bill late Thursday to pay death benefits to families of fallen soldiers during the partial government shutdown. The move came after the White House drew heavy criticism from Republicans over White House press secretary Jay Carney's comment earlier in the day that it was "not necessary" to sign the bill since a charity already had stepped in to foot the expenses. The Senate approved the bill Thursday afternoon, after it cleared the House a day earlier. The bill reinstated the $100,000 "death gratuity" payments to military families and resumed funeral and burial expenses. The funding had been suspended as a consequence of the partial government shutdown. Carney claimed the bill was "not necessary," noting that charity group The Fisher House Foundation had just entered into an agreement with the Pentagon a day earlier to provide the benefits in the short-term. "The legislation is not necessary," Carney said, adding that the Defense Department had already agreed to reimburse the Fisher House. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, who pushed the bill in the Senate, blasted the White House over Carney's remark. "Now, we're learning the president has taken his political obstinacy to a new low and believes the legislation Congress has passed to right this wrong is 'not necessary,'" he said in a written statement. "Not only is this legislation necessary it's the moral obligation of this nation and it's the spoken will of Congress that we deliver immediate assistance to the families of fallen service members. "I call on the president to sign this necessary legislation without delay. Anything less would represent dereliction of duty by our commander in chief," he said.</Msg><Username>doncassel365</Username><Timestamp>1381611649850</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-10-12 17:00:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381611715595-105</Id><Topic><Title>Since no one will back up their accusation that the Repubs are responsable for the VA death benefits.</Title><Username>doncassel365</Username><Timestamp>1381611649850</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-10-12 17:00:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>By voice vote Thursday, the Senate approved the measure that would reinstate benefits for surviving family members, including funeral and burial expenses, and death gratuity payments. The Pentagon typically pays out $100,000 within three days of a service member's death. Twenty-nine members of the military have died on active duty since the government shutdown began last Tuesday. The Pentagon infuriated congressional Republicans and Democrats and touched off a national firestorm when it claimed earlier that a law allowing the military to be paid during the partial government shutdown did not cover the death benefit payments. Congress passed and Obama signed that measure into law before the partial government shutdown last Tuesday, and lawmakers insist that the benefits shouldn't have been affected. Despite the Senate vote, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., sided with the White House. He said the voice vote was "for show" and the Pentagon had essentially resolved the problem. He said the issue was moot, but he didn't object to passage of the bill. Across the Capitol, Republicans on a House Armed Services panel excoriated Pentagon comptroller Robert Hale, accusing him of playing politics with his interpretation of the original law. They said the law was designed to pay the death benefits as well as keep all Defense Department civilians on the job -- not to select the most essential. "You went out of your way to make this as ugly as possible, to inflict as much pain as possible on this department," said Rep. Mike Coffman, R-Colo., who introduced the first bill days before the shutdown in an attempt to exempt the military. Hale responded that the law was poorly written and there never should have been a shutdown in the first place. "I resent your remarks," the budget chief said. "I acted on the advice of attorneys and our best reading of a loosely worded law." He said it was "not a political judgment -- we were trying to do what the law said."</Msg><Username>doncassel365</Username><Timestamp>1381611715595</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-10-12 17:01:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381611727089-106</Id><Topic><Title>Since no one will back up their accusation that the Repubs are responsable for the VA death benefits.</Title><Username>doncassel365</Username><Timestamp>1381611649850</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-10-12 17:00:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The chairman of the House subcommittee, Rep.

Until the public's outrage at both parties rises to the level currently being misdirected towards the "bums" they reliably place before us at every election, nothing in America is going to improve.

His overall job approval is now 37/53, and a majority want Obama to start cooperating more with Republicans, as 63% want Republicans to meet Obama part-way, too: Americans are holding Republicans primarily responsible for the partial government shutdown as public esteem sinks for all players in the impasse, President Barack Obama among them, according to a new poll. It’s a struggle with no heroes. … Most Americans disapprove of the way Obama is handling his job, the poll suggests, with 53 percent unhappy with his performance and 37 percent approving of it. Congress is scraping rock bottom, with a ghastly approval rating of 5 percent. Indeed, anyone making headlines in the dispute has earned poor marks for his or her trouble, whether it’s Democrat Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader, or Republican John Boehner, the House speaker, both with a favorability rating of 18 percent.</Msg><Username>doncassel365</Username><Timestamp>1381625668635</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-10-12 20:54:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381625678583-141</Id><Topic><Title>Repubs are getting hardest hit, but everyone's down</Title><Username>doncassel365</Username><Timestamp>1381625668635</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-10-12 20:54:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The amusing headline in this instance is “GOP gets the blame in shutdown.” However, the data shows that plenty of blame is being heaped on all sides, by all sides: Sixty-eight percent said the shutdown is a major problem for the country, including majorities of Republicans (58 percent), Democrats (82 percent) and independents (57 percent). Fifty-two percent said Obama is not doing enough to cooperate with Republicans to end the shutdown; 63 percent say Republicans aren’t doing enough to cooperate with him. Only 30% approve of raising the debt ceiling, clean or otherwise. And despite the best (that is to say, most malicious) efforts of the National Parks Service, more than 80% have had no impact from the government shutdown. That’s not exactly the kind of momentum Obama and the Democrats hoped to generate for pressure on Republicans, and their “no negotiations” stand is practically designed to backfire, if this poll accurately reflects public temperament.</Msg><Username>doncassel365</Username><Timestamp>1381625678583</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-10-12 20:54:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381625703390-142</Id><Topic><Title>Poll - Throw the bums out.

It's a small price to pay to put Marxism on the back burner for a few more decades. If they were smart, they would step in front of the microphones and claim credit now, and then explain how that shutdown turned obama from president into tyrant. Whether the GOP takes blame or not, only the liberals are ultimately responsible for the pain intentionally inflicted on the public, and the public will be informed and will remember that it was obama and the democrats who treated grandma like a terrorist when she tried to snap a photo of Old Faithful, and then wrongfully imprisoned her in the hotel at Yellowstone with armed guards refusing to let her go to the bathroom on the 2 1/2 hour ride out of the park. And because he didn't pay death benefits to military families on a trumped up condition that can easily be proven false, heap that on the list too. Adding to the fury in the next general election will be obama's words to make it as painful as possible, words that were acted upon by all of his cabinet, from Chuck Hagel in DoD to Lew in Treasury, to the most visible DoI with their NPS gestapo. This will not be forgotten, because it will be mentioned tens of thousands of times in every TV add across the country.</Msg><Username>anotherobamafailure</Username><Timestamp>1381627070034</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-10-12 21:17:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1381627538481-147</Id><Title>CIA wanted to hire me</Title><Msg>I told them I like the NSA better</Msg><Username>kingofvietnam</Username><Timestamp>1381627538481</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-10-12 21:25:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381627665511-148</Id><Topic><Title>ObamaCare rates trigger more sticker shock</Title><Username>pfswsucks</Username><Timestamp>1381615189173</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-10-12 17:59:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The program is more accurately known as 404care (for the 404 messages that everyone continues to get on the website) or obamacrash.</Msg><Username>anotherobamafailure</Username><Timestamp>1381627665511</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-10-12 21:27:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381628301074-149</Id><Topic><Title>Just Remember To Bring Guns To Tea Party Republican Town Halls</Title><Username>fireundersmoke</Username><Timestamp>1381440809834</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-10-10 17:33:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>My American flag only has 49 stars, I removed Texas long ago, Mexico and Texas are the same.</Msg><Username>fireundersmoke</Username><Timestamp>1381628301074</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-10-12 21:38:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1381628377139-150</Id><Title>Worst black President in America</Title><Msg>Barack Husin Obama no doubt</Msg><Username>kingofvietnam</Username><Timestamp>1381628377139</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-10-12 21:39:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381628505212-151</Id><Topic><Title>Texas tea Terror Are Finished, We Don't Deal With T, Get Out Of Our House</Title><Username>fireundersmoke</Username><Timestamp>1381458572755</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-10-10 22:29:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama should not pay welfare to texas, that would kill off more than half the state.</Msg><Username>fireundersmoke</Username><Timestamp>1381628505212</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-10-12 21:41:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381629286335-152</Id><Topic><Title>So be honest, my young Lib friends.
