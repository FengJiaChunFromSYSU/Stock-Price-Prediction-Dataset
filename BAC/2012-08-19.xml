Note the GOP ways don't have a chance to succeed. Every year they delay is making it worse. Social Security is financed by a 12.4 percent tax on wages. Workers pay half and their employers pay the other half. The tax is applied to the first $110,100 of a worker's wages, a level that increases each year with inflation. For 2011 and 2012, the tax rate for employees was reduced to 4.2 percent, but is scheduled to return to 6.2 percent in January. Options: —Apply the Social Security tax to all wages, including those above $110,100. Workers making $200,000 in wages would get a tax increase of $5,574, an amount their employers would have to match. Their future benefits would increase, too. This option would eliminate 72 percent of the shortfall. Two years ago, it would have wiped out 99 percent. —Increase the payroll tax by 0.1 percentage point a year, until it reaches 14.4 percent in 20 years. At that point, workers making $50,000 a year would get a tax increase of $500 and employers would have to match it. This option would eliminate 53 percent of the shortfall. Two years ago, it would have wiped out 73 percent. ___ Retirement age Workers qualify for full retirement benefits at age 66, a threshold that gradually rises to 67 for people born in 1960 or later. Workers are eligible for early retirement at 62, though monthly benefits are reduced by about 25 percent. The reductions shrink the longer you wait to apply. Options: —Gradually raise the full retirement age to 68 in 2033. This option would eliminate 15 percent of the shortfall. Two years ago, it would have eliminated a little more than 20 percent. —Gradually raise the full retirement age to 69 in 2039 and 70 in 2063. This option would eliminate 37 percent of the shortfall. Two years ago, it would have eliminated about half. ___ Cost-of-living adjustments Each year, if consumer prices increase, Social Security benefits go up as well. By law, the increases are pegged to an inflation index. This year, benefits went up by 3.6 percent, the first increase since 2009. Option: Adopt a new inflation index called the Chained CPI, which assumes that people change their buying habits when prices increase to reduce the impact on their pocketbooks. The new index would reduce the annual COLA by 0.3 percentage point, on average. This option would eliminate 19 percent of the shortfall. Two years ago, it would have eliminated 26 percent. ___ Benefits Initial Social Security benefits are determined by lifetime wages, meaning the more you make, the higher your benefit, to a point. Initial benefits are typically calculated using up to 35 years of wages. Earnings from earlier years, when workers were young, are adjusted to reflect the change in general wage levels that occurred during their years of employment. Tinkering with the benefit formula can save big money, but cuts to initial benefits mean lower monthly payments for the rest of a retiree's life. The average monthly benefit for a new retiree is $1,264. Option: Change the calculation for initial benefits, but only for people with lifetime wages above the national average, which is about $42,000 a year. Workers with higher incomes would still get a bigger monthly benefit than lower paid workers but not as big as under current law. It's a cut they would feel throughout their entire retirement. This option would eliminate 34 percent of the shortfall. Two years ago, it would have eliminated almost half.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1345385343463</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-19 10:09:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345385521298-24</Id><Title>Paul Ryan's entertainment value</Title><Msg>Google up Brit Hume's (Fox News) interview w/ the courageous fiscal conservative and intellectual leader of the Party and watch it.

And while he regularly talks about the importance of balanced budgets, that’s not what matters most to the GOP’s soon-to-be vice presidential nominee. Ryan’s holy grail is low taxes and small government, not fiscal balance. Those priorities are clear in the fiscal plan Ryan wrote for the House Republicans last spring. Ryan, who chairs the House Budget Committee, was the architect of the House’s 2013 fiscal framework–a plan that wouldn’t balance the budget until after 2040. In fact, looking at the next 10 years—the budget window that really matters to Congress—Ryan’s deficit would be roughly identical to the Congressional Budget Office’s baseline. At the end of the period, in 2022, they’d be exactly the same. In other words, Congress would achieve the same amount of deficit reduction by doing nothing as it would by following Ryan’s blueprint."</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1345403590490</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-19 15:13:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345403631397-54</Id><Topic><Title>to all americants idiots</Title><Username>solev</Username><Timestamp>1345397720891</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-19 13:35:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>that is why - you love looking in the mirror - - aah idiot "</Msg><Username>da23533</Username><Timestamp>1345403631397</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-19 15:13:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345403682963-55</Id><Topic><Title>Will Obama's 15 Member panel allow me to have my hip replacement surgery?

Census figures for 2011 will be released this fall in the critical weeks ahead of the November elections. The Associated Press surveyed more than a dozen economists, think tanks and academics, both nonpartisan and those with known liberal or conservative leanings, and found a broad consensus: The official poverty rate will rise from 15.1 percent in 2010, climbing as high as 15.7 percent. Several predicted a more modest gain, but even a 0.1 percentage point increase would put poverty at the highest since 1965.</Msg><Username>happy_bagholder765</Username><Timestamp>1345424919354</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-19 21:08:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345425272262-113</Id><Topic><Title>A falling Tide Sinks all boats</Title><Username>happy_bagholder765</Username><Timestamp>1345422710431</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-19 20:31:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So why does President Barack Obama conflate his stated goal of helping the middle class with the need to impose higher taxes on the rich? Maybe he thinks he can “spread the wealth around,” as he told Joe the Plumber during the 2008 presidential campaign? Alas, a “middle-class welfare state can’t be supported solely by taxes on the rich,” says Peter Sepp, executive vice president at the National Taxpayers Union in Washington. The president’s Buffett rule, which would impose a minimum effective rate of 30 percent on those earning more than $1 million a year, would generate no more than $162 billion over 10 years, according to Congress’s Joint Committee on Taxation. That’s hardly enough to enrich the middle class, no less sustain existing entitlement programs. Besides, the committee’s estimates assume the rich blithely fork over the money rather than engage in tax-avoidance strategies. Unequal Burden More importantly, Obama’s fairness argument doesn’t hold up under scrutiny: The rich already pay the lion’s share of taxes in the U.S. In 2009, the last year for which complete Internal Revenue Service data are available, the top 20 percent of earners received 50 percent of pretax income and paid almost 70 percent of federal taxes, according to a study by the Congressional Budget Office. (In the CBO study, federal taxes include individual, corporate, payroll and excise taxes.) Income may be skewed, but the tax burden is even more heavily weighted toward the rich. These trends have been in place for at least 30 years. In 1980, the top quintile paid 19 percent of the federal personal income tax compared with 36.7 percent in 2009. At the same time, the tax burden of the bottom 50 percent fell to 2.3 percent from 7 percent. And, thanks to an array of tax credits, the percentage of filers with no tax liability has crept up during the last two decades to 42 percent in 2009.</Msg><Username>spanktrison</Username><Timestamp>1345425272262</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-19 21:14:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345425298186-114</Id><Topic><Title>Liar Lib logic: If you are successful, then you must have done it illegally or immorally.</Title><Username>mrstan4089</Username><Timestamp>1345418565776</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-19 19:22:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ignore Stark, he's wrong but can't bring himself to face truth.

And the party philosophy is nothing but a bunch of victim mentality hogwash. They (Biden &amp; Bama) absolutely stated that position and have reinforced it in EVERY campaign speech in every swing state. So it's easy to see that a person who believes in it, who espouses it, who lives it, is really nothing more than a victim of his own lack of self-esteem and accountability.

And from a medical perspective and the situation he described, "forcible" was the proper word to use and his statement would have been 100% accurate. As it was, there was no reason for him to answer in that vein at all. All he needed to do was point out that rape is the excuse of the left who want to have abortion on demand for any time any reason any where, and forcible rape pregnancies occur approximately zero percent of the time according to studies published by AMA. Actually, the published study said it did not occur over the course of the study in over 15,000 instances, period. Now, if he had said that, then the follow-up question would have been more thoughtfully worded and statutory rape and incest would become the focus. And under that scenario, you simply refer back to justification #1 - on demand anytime anyreason anywhere, and it's an expression of a reasonable standard to say you don't support on demand abortions.

By tuning out the only non-propaganda news source, the only thing you are left with is a fried egg and a dogturd where your brain used to be. Your "conscience" is a dysfunctional byproduct of official sanction of outright theft. Were you able to think without sound bites, you would realize that your guilt at being a heartless imbecile is still real and is not assuaged by stealing someone else's money to give to the beggar. That is not the definition of compassion. It is, however, the definition of theft. Humanity, as you have altered it through liberal policies, is the destruction of the minority family by direct government intervention. And the KKK was a Democrat creation. Sorry to burst your poorly formed bubble, but these are not just "some" facts. These are "the" facts.</Msg><Username>flippant_1</Username><Timestamp>1345432777916</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-19 23:19:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345432795180-142</Id><Topic><Title>Obama release your school records</Title><Username>mrstan4089</Username><Timestamp>1345418306080</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-19 19:18:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I know what he's hiding...the fact that he's a total Kenyan idiot.</Msg><Username>king1mrchess</Username><Timestamp>1345432795180</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-19 23:19:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345432846527-143</Id><Title>The repugnant Republican Party has shape-shifted into a vile parasitic beast that exists to feed off of 99% of the population</Title><Msg>After the inevitable defeat of Romney, the beginning of the end of the beast will be cheered by freedom loving patriots throughout the land.</Msg><Username>mr.whizzard</Username><Timestamp>1345432846527</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-19 23:20:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345433135428-144</Id><Topic><Title>Poverty makes a new Record High</Title><Username>happy_bagholder765</Username><Timestamp>1345416992384</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-19 18:56:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Join the green party, man.

That's all Mitt knew; after all, a major part of that company's business was medical waste disposal. Nothing wrong with Bain funding them, at least under public law, although some Right-To-Lifers and Christian Coalition and Mormons probably expect that in such a delicate matter, Romney would have yielded to an even higher authority than the Almighty Dollar. Where it gets really, um, sensitive is that in 2006, a Texas court convicted and fined Stericycle for illegally dumping those aborted fetuses in a public landfill. Oops. Talk about a PR man's bad day at the ranch. Mitt's selective memory and 'I was/wasn't living here/there and did/didn't do something/anything while being paid well for whatever reason until I retired retroactively' stunt ballet is the best his PR team has been able to come up with so far, though they're certainly established precedent for continuously changing that storyline.
