It will be far easier to limit and undo the follies of an Obama presidency than to restore the necessary common sense and good judgment to a depraved electorate willing to have such a man for their president. The problem is much deeper and far more serious than Mr. Obama, who is a mere symptom of what ails America . Blaming the prince of fools should not blind anyone to the vast confederacy of fools that made him their prince. The Republic can survive a Barack Obama, who is, after all, merely a fool.

Just look at Apple where it was in 2007: meager $120; MAC was dying (no one except California surfers-dudes had MACs); company had no corporate business. Then came the Iphones with its touch interface (borrowed from LG, which released a similar phone about 9 month before Apple). Apple smartly decided to appeal to women and introduced I-pads (light, medium and heavy/overnight protection). As a result, the stock is at $600. Now, if you don't have an Iphone, you are either a boring/tasteless person or BofA long term common stock holder. Write to Brian and tell him you will sell unless he pushes for B-phone.

It simply avers that business entities have the same rights as people. To test the validity of that concept, have the Selective Service send a draft notice to a corporation and see if it shows up at the Induction Center. If it does, try putting it in a uniform and getting it to follow lawful orders. Or try telling a corporation that if it wants to conduct business overseas, it needs to obtain a passport ("Birth certificate and photo ID, please."). Or try telling a corporation that it must buy health insurance for itself or pay a penalty for refusing to do so. The rights of an individual are subject to certain obligations, and failure to meet them can result in the loss of rights. If felons lose their right to vote, why should corporate felons be allowed to influence elections? Finally, since people can exist without corporations, and have done so in the past, the case you rested must have been your head's.

I figure the least we can do is keep them busy. The political blather here is a nice start and I'm sure it won't end after the election, but eventually it's going to taper off, and it would be a shame for those friendly NSA professionals to be faced with reductions in work hours, layoffs, or unemployment. With this looming threat in mind, I'd like to suggest changing the standard, informal greeting of "Hi, how have you been?" to "Hey, blown up any federal buildings lately?" In the same vein, a little thoughtfulness, like finding creative ways to use "fuel oil" and "ammonium nitrate" in the same sentence, or offering constructive criticisms of James Holmes' weapons selection, timing, and defensive measures, can put food on the plates of the children of those NSA employees, and boost job security at Homeland Security too. Even announcing bake sales for the PLO and North Korean orphans can help. I call upon all BAC message board participants to think of other small ways they can contribute to these worthy organizations, but be sensitive......nobody wants a handout. ROTFLMAO at recent improvements to Security everywhere. They even impounded my Staggerwing Beech.</Msg><Username>fish2kill</Username><Timestamp>1343754734820</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 13:12:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343755340560-110</Id><Topic><Title>Who took Romney's place in Vietnam when Willard dodged the draft?</Title><Username>frankmangus</Username><Timestamp>1343746202462</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 10:50:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Perhaps it was the same guy who served in Clinton's place?</Msg><Username>dabuff57</Username><Timestamp>1343755340560</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 13:22:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343755456983-111</Id><Topic><Title>HOW STUPID IS THIS?

Another dose of reality, the Clinton surplus the liberals brag about came from that improperly managed tech bubble, that was allowed to careen out control. Combined with off the books borrowing from Social Security, and the neglect and failure to make appropriate expenditures to counter the increasing incidents of terror perpetrated by Al-Qaeda around the world. In other words, it never really existed except on paper. And, how do you have a surplus while you are still running up the National Debt as Clinton was? Bush, upon entering office, immediately called for investigations into Fannie and Freddie that were held up in committee or filibustered at very turn by Democrats and a handful RINOs. Bush continued to call for and urge congress to investigate these GSE’s throughout his entire presidency. No action was taken. Those investigations had the potential to expose the whole mortgage back security scam before it became critical. Thank Barney Frank, Barack Obama and Chris Dodd for leading the opposition to those requested investigations. Bush never had a super majority in congress as Obama was privileged to have for two years, and wasted on the ideological legislation of Obamacare, rather than on fixing the economy. While Obama sat on his hands waiting for Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi to push though his health care nightmare, the economy continued to fall deeper and deeper into despair. Spending reeled out of control with government sinking it’s tentacles deep into the private sector arena with business choking regulations and bailouts for campaign donors of Obama. Had Obama put aside his ideological nonsense and focused on a private sector based recovery plan we would not still be in this dire recession. This is Obama's mess, in all this time as president he and his party still refuse to take responsibility, and he continues to blame everything under the sun but himself. Yet Democrats blame Bush for everything that transpired in his first nine months. Double standard idiocy! Obama is no leader! Obama is without one original cogent idea! Obama has damage hundreds of thousands of families beyond repair. He's just a sniveling whiner! And now he wants to sue the banks! What a feeble ideologically blinded mind this president has! The fact that the Clinton staff vandalized the White House and government computers and offices, and dumped and scrambled files, before leaving tells you the juvenile mind set of that administration. And Bill Clinton used the full power of the oval office and the presidency to pressure a young fat intern into being his human humidor at the expense of the entire country. A despicable self-absorbed old pervert by any measure. I have no respect for this man nor anyone who does.</Msg><Username>bury_obama</Username><Timestamp>1343756805705</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 13:46:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343757221263-115</Id><Title>"I was gung-ho for the war in Vietnam, but I didn't have to go.

TRY COMPARING OBAMA TO THIS, WHAT A JOKE OBAMA IS!!!!</Title><Msg>His full Name is: Willard Mitt Romney He was Born: March 12,1947 and is 65 years old. His Father: George W. Romney, former Governor of the State of Michigan He was raised in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan He is married to Ann Romney since 1969; they five children. Education: B.A. from Brigham Young University, J.D. and M.B.A. from Harvard University Religion: Mormon - The Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter-Day Saints Working Background: After high school, he spent 30 months in France as a Mormon missionary. After going to both Harvard Business School and Harvard Law School simultaneously, he passed the Michigan bar exam, but never worked as an attorney. In 1984, he co-founded Bain Capital a private equity investment firm, one of the largest such firms in the United States . In 1994, he ran for Senator of Massachusetts and lost to Ted Kennedy. He was President and CEO of the 2002 Winter Olympic Games. In 2002, he was elected Governor of the State of Massachusetts where he eliminated a 1.5 billion deficit. Some Interesting Facts about Romney: Bain Capital, starting with one small office supply store in Massachusetts, turned it into Staples; now over 2,000 stores employing 90,000 people. Bain Capital also worked to perform the same kinds of business miracles again and again, with companies like Domino's, Sealy, Brookstone, Weather Channel, Burger King, Warner Music Group, Dollarama, Home Depot Supply, and many others. He was an unpaid volunteer campaign worker for his dad's gubernatorial campaign 1 year. He was an unpaid intern in his dad's governor's office for eight years. He was an unpaid bishop and state president of his church for ten years. He was an unpaid President of the Salt Lake Olympic Committee for three years. He took no salary and was the unpaid Governor of Massachusetts for four years. He gave his entire inheritance from his father to charity. Mitt Romney is one of the wealthiest "self-made men" in our country but has given more back to its citizens in terms of money, service and time than most men. In 2011 Mitt Romney gave over $4 million to charity, almost 19% of his income.... Just for comparison purposes, Obama gave 1% and Joe Biden gave $300 or .0013%. Mitt Romney is Trustworthy: He will show us his birth certificate He will show us his high school and college transcripts. He will show us his social security card. He will show us his law degree. He will show us his draft notice. He will show us his medical records. He will show us his income tax records. He will show us he has nothing to hide. Mitt Romney's background, experience and trustworthiness show him to be a great leader and an excellent citizen for President of the United States. You may think that Romney may not be the best representative the Republicans could have selected. At least I know what religion he is, and that he won't desecrate the flag, bow down to foreign powers, or practice fiscal irresponsibility. I know he has the ability to turn this financial debacle that the current regime has gotten us into. We won't like all the things necessary to recover from this debt, but someone with Romney's background can do it. But, on the minus side, He never was a "Community Organizer", never took drugs or smoked pot, never got drunk, did not associate with communists or terrorists, nor did he attend a church whose pastor called for God to damn the US. You should know the difference between the men running for America's top office. Does Obama/Biden deserve 4 more years?</Msg><Username>whitest_white</Username><Timestamp>1343764133832</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 15:48:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343764285474-172</Id><Title>Credit Unions, becareful what you ask for</Title><Msg>Banks Ditch Mom and Pop.Article Comments Overheard HOME PAGE ».smaller Larger .smaller Larger facebooktwittergoogle pluslinked ininShare.0EmailPrint Big banks that have been cast as the bad guys since the financial crisis took more than just verbal abuse from Occupy Wall Street. Last year’s National Bank Transfer Day accelerated a trend that has seen millions of depositors abandon large institutions. SNL Financial released data on Tuesday showing that the five largest credit unions have grown their deposits by 45% since 2007. Has all this caused an outcry from financial executives? Crying all the way to the bank is more like it. The type of customers they are losing are overwhelmingly the kind they don’t want. Bank of America boss Brian Moynihan said last year that his strategy for 2012 was focusing on the top fifth of customers. The bank announced last week that it would cut the number of automatic teller machines too. J.P. Morgan Chase chief Jamie Dimon said recently that it costs around $350 to run a checking account. Most customers with less than $100,000 in assets at the firm are thus unprofitable according to the bank’s analysis. Credit unions can serve customers more cheaply and have regulatory advantages big banks lack, but data from the Credit Union National Association highlight how tough it is to make money taking deposits. Their “surplus funds” have nearly doubled since 2007 while their loans outstanding have barely budged. Meanwhile, business deposits, which are more profitable, have taken up much of the slack at big banks. Back in 2007, J.P. Morgan had 32 times the deposits of the largest credit union. Today it has 33 times as much. Big banks’ message to mom and pop? Don’t let the door hit you on the way out. – Spencer Jakab</Msg><Username>nasa_rss</Username><Timestamp>1343764285474</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 15:51:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343764315295-173</Id><Topic><Title>BAC breaks out 200 moving average, Bug signal shows Up</Title><Username>chasestockhigh</Username><Timestamp>1343764095237</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 15:48:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I just added another 5,000 shares at $7.33.

Obama also has been shutting down U.S. oil drilling, and buying oil from Brazil.Yet he has the gall to blame Romney for his success. Obama also prevented the U.S.oil pipeline that would create more jobs in the U.S., and also has tried to shut downtheNorth Dakota oil fields, and the oil shale throughout Colorado and other western states, and then he buys oil from Brazil.

General Electric placed an order with wind turbine manufacturer ATI Casting, but then canceled it in order to get the parts cheaper from China. ATI offered to match the Chinese price, but GE refused to reinstate its order to the U.S. company. So ATI was forced to lay off 302 American workers. Obama also promised in October 2008 that he would "invest $15 billion a year in renewable energy sources to create 5 million new energy jobs over the next decade -- jobs that pay well and can't be outsourced."

Significant Terror Threat</Title><Msg>Political kooks are unstable and dangerous. READ THIS !! 17 Years After Oklahoma City Bombing, Right-Wing Extremism Is Significant Domestic Terror Threat Apr 19, 2012 at 2:15 pm By Ken Sofer and CAP National Security team intern Molly Bernstein Oklahoma City National Memorial Seventeen years ago today, Timothy McVeigh and co-conspirator Terry Nichols detonated 4,800 pounds of homemade explosives under the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building’s daycare center in downtown Oklahoma City. The explosion resulted in 168 dead, 680 injured and over $652 million in damage. The Oklahoma City bombing was the deadliest terrorist attacks in U.S. history until 9/11. McVeigh said that he attacked the Murrah building, which held the local offices of the DEA, ATF, Social Security, and the Army and Marine recruiting offices, because of his hatred of the federal government, opposition to gun control laws and anger at the FBI for its actions during the Waco Siege of 1993. McVeigh was found guilty on eleven counts of murder and conspiracy in 1997 and was executed by lethal injection on June 11, 2001. Though the terrorist attack on Oklahoma City happened nearly two decades ago, right-wing extremist terrorism remains a significant domestic threat to American security. The Department of Homeland Security released a report in 2009 stating that the economic and political climate bears important similarities to the conditions of the early 1990s when right-wing extremism experienced a dramatic resurgence. These conditions, including the public debate around hot-button issues such as immigration, gun control, and abortion, along with the election of the first African-American president, present “unique drivers for right-wing radicalization and recruitment,” the report said. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano eventually ordered the report withdrawn because of significant political backlash from mainstream conservatives. But the report, which was originally commissioned by the Bush administration, also found that “lone wolves and small terrorist cells embracing violent rightwing extremist ideology are the most dangerous domestic terrorism threat in the United States.” A look at terrorist incidents since the Oklahoma City bombing, including both successful and disrupted ideologically-motivated attacks, backs up the conclusions of the DHS report:</Msg><Username>newvulgarian</Username><Timestamp>1343783476822</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 21:11:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343783627580-240</Id><Topic><Title>I doubt Obama ever passed Economics 101</Title><Username>kingofvietnam</Username><Timestamp>1343782064061</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 20:47:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I belive people will vote their stomachs Vote ROMNEY you will eat RIBEYES Vote OBAMA.....only cat food, that's it !</Msg><Username>kingofvietnam</Username><Timestamp>1343783627580</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 21:13:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343784103630-241</Id><Topic><Title>All presidential candidates have disclosed their REAL BCs EXCEPT Obama</Title><Username>dumpobamie</Username><Timestamp>1343782919552</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 21:01:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why doesn't he come out and support Chick fil A?
