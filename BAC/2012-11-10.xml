You had the honor and hit your ball a modest 250 yards to the middle of the fairway, leaving a simple six iron to the pin. Your opponent then hits his ball, lofting it deep into the woods to the right of the fairway. Being the golfing gentleman that you are, you help your opponent look for his ball. Just before the permitted five minute search period ends, your opponent says: "Go ahead and hit your second shot and if I don't find it in time, I'll concede the match." You hit your ball, landing it on the green, stopping about 10 feet from the pin. About the time your ball comes to rest, you hear your opponent exclaim from deep in the woods: "I found it!" The second sound you hear is a click, the sound of a club striking a ball and the ball comes sailing out of the woods and lands on the green, stopping no more than six inches from the hole. Here is the ethical dilemma: Do you pull the cheating bastxxd's ball out of your pocket and confront him with it or do you keep your mouth shut?</Msg><Username>mike_van_der_slut_irvin19</Username><Timestamp>1352552236228</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-10 07:57:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352552381461-25</Id><Topic><Title>Why Should I pay more in Taxes for Crony Capitalism?

BAC is one monster of a stock and I am sure you thought long and hard about it before coming on such a Hot Seat Fast Money show as that one on November 5, 2012. NationsShares reputation and subsequently Fortress Trading's reputation is really on the line on this front and center, BIG TIME TRADE OF THE DAY and you think this time is different enough than April 2012 to come out and make that CALL.. YOU CHOSE TO GO OUT ON THE LIMB ON THAT ONE. NO ONE MADE YOU DO IT. IT WAS YOUR CHOICE I PRESUME. Now do your listeners and people who have trusted you live the next few months in terrorized capital misery or do they live in investor feel good vindication land? TIME WILL TELL. I want you to win on this one. You know you didn't even say buy some puts to go along with it. The 10 dollar puts in the next 48 hours or so went up 200 or 300 percent in value while your calls decreased in value by about 50 percent. A 50 percent loss in capital for the call options in 48 hours verses a 200 or 300 percent increase in value for the put options. Do you want to repeat your Fast Money statement about how sickening it would have been to have doubled up on the stock of BAC rather than buy the call options again? I think if you doubled up on the stock and it went down then those 48 hours would have seen that stock lose 7 percent of its capital value. Are you sure that would have been less sickening? None of this matters and it is all opinion...BUT AGAIN, NONE OF IT MATTERS IF THE 10 DOLLAR CALL OPTIONS BUYERS DON'T HAVE TO LIVE IN PURE AGONIZING MISERY FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS, RIGHT? Oh I so hope you are right on this TRADE OF THE DAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I am hoping and praying for this Trade of the Day not to give misery from November 8, 2012 each day on to expiry. Have a nice Veterans Day. I honor the Veterans out there. Also, have a Happy Thanksgiving.

It's amazing that so many believe (ie Republicans) that rule by plutocrats, using corporate fascism as their model, is good for the citizens and the nation at large. I mean, come on, they didn't acquire such power and wealth by serendiptious accident, in their primary. pursuit of patriotic duty to country and fellow citizens. Quite the contrary, they wish to portray their souless pursuit of power, wealth and control as 'virtues' that not only enrich them beyond the dreams of Mammon but also, as a begrudged by-product and through the sacred 'Trickle Down' Theory, sprinkles gold dust over the masses (those ingrates) for them to scatch and squabble over as it floats down. Sounds like a ridiculous ploy that would never work, but con-men know that avarice tweaked brings out the chump in some of the savviest of folks (e.g. Madoff, Sir Alan, etc). That they couch it also in specious economic 'theories' with lots of econo-gibberish, refuted by reality time and again, sucks in plenty also. Well, truth be told, I doubt the Republican 'rank and vile' *think* on this plane at all; it's probably more simple knee-jerk conditioning, as in..."Romney say 'tax bad'..that good, brain off now". And their puppet-masters continue their snickering, cynical ways. It may be that the US populace is learning, although I wonder about memory retention and human fickleness.</Msg><Username>mixtli_speaks</Username><Timestamp>1352568488995</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-10 12:28:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352569697774-83</Id><Title>RAISING TAXES ON THE RICH HURTS THE POOR</Title><Msg>What they really need is real jobs</Msg><Username>romney_rocks</Username><Timestamp>1352569697774</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-10 12:48:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352570337905-84</Id><Topic><Title>THANK GOD AMERICAN DEMOCRACY IS ALIVE AND WELL - BIG MONEY FAILED</Title><Username>farawaylife</Username><Timestamp>1352561195030</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-10 10:26:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Facts must really hurt republicans.They will never learn.From here on they will never see oower again.Thanks for a great analysis.</Msg><Username>kilfeatherj</Username><Timestamp>1352570337905</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-10 12:58:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352571383690-85</Id><Topic><Title>THANK GOD AMERICAN DEMOCRACY IS ALIVE AND WELL - BIG MONEY FAILED</Title><Username>farawaylife</Username><Timestamp>1352561195030</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-10 10:26:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty is a non-fiction book by two American economists: Daron Acemoglu, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and James Robinson (economist), a Harvard professor. In the book they try to answer the most basic question of global economics and politics: why do some nations (for example, Norway) thrive while others ( for example, Mali) fail? The book is intended for a general audience. The volume presented a detailed argument for a proposition that a nation’s economic success is predominantly determined by its political institutions. Inclusive states have no single centre of power but are innovative and prosperous thanks to the jostling of competing interests under the rule of law and secure property rights. Inclusive democracies with strong independent judicial systems thrive. It claims that importance of politics is far ahead of geography, resources or culture, that freedom begets prosperity. Countries such as Great Britain and the United States became rich because their citizens overthrew the elites who controlled power and created a society with political rights more broadly distributed and the government accountable and responsive to citizens. In the countries the great mass of people could take advantage of economic opportunities. To the contrary, nations dominated by self-centred elite fail and they are extremely poor. Extractive, totalitarian states are in a vicious circle of plutocracy, suppression of technological innovation and economic and personal freedom.</Msg><Username>eatmayercooch</Username><Timestamp>1352571383690</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-10 13:16:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352572006076-86</Id><Topic><Title>THANK GOD AMERICAN DEMOCRACY IS ALIVE AND WELL - BIG MONEY FAILED</Title><Username>farawaylife</Username><Timestamp>1352561195030</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-10 10:26:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"..republicans..will never see power again."

To maintain/regain power and control, what's a little superficial change? Once in office, they can always 'undo' the changes. But here's a hopeful thought...maybe the core Republican party will return to it's more progressive, principled, less-biased ways and days, perhaps in the mold of Teddy Roosevelt or Eisenhower.

So far it seems the needed changes are still in doibt. Republicans would do well to: 1. Rid the party of the biggiots and idiots. Followers of Rush [ El Blimp Bo] can not win a national election for the Republicans 2. End the tatic of simply being a hater of Obama and develop, define, and communicate the real issues. 3. Adopt and push for passage of a Immergration Bill that reflects the same type of approach as Bush Jr. purposed 4. Stop being the party of NO and enter into the development of laws that help the majority of Americans.Compermise is critical to the future of the party 5. End the Social issues #$%$. Aboration, Etc. is a reality that is not going away. Stop wasting breath on something you will never change. 6. If the party really supports individual freedoms, adjust your policy to reflct all personal freedoms do not always support someones narrow view or their own values 7. Stop pandering to the self-interests of the rich 8. Accept that trickle down will not work and push for those items that will increase the wealth of the Middle class 9. Change the image that the only recourse to a situation is going to War. Be the first party to develop a bill that requires a declared War when an armed conflict exceeds 90 days 10. Learn to not provide a policy without provideing the details, cost and impact. 11. Develop an approach to Big Business that supports growth , provides needed oversite, and punishes those who neg. impact American workers In short, pull your head out and realize you will never accomplish victory until you realize that people want leaders with vision, not flippers who have no real values and stop pandering to the Bigiots and radicals. Now, of course I realize the Republican party most likely will not learn from their failures and will continue with their pandering to the nuts and as a Democrat I thank you for your stupidity.</Msg><Username>carolyne47</Username><Timestamp>1352576142623</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-10 14:35:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352576356283-97</Id><Topic><Title>4.3M in KY FWIW.

The only other reason to let the General go is he has a lot of family distractions he needs to take care of away from work right now. The other reason was he had to be an example for those under him. The CIA more than any other group has to keep themselves away from any compromise that can be used against them. Infidelity would not have even been a subject for proper conversation 50 to a hundred years ago. It would not have been "politically correct" to even mention such activities.

Drilling on private, federal, public or foreign land makes no difference in the price. Unless you want to nationalize the oil industry and not export any it doesn't make a bit of difference where it is drilled. This silliness about how many oil wells are on public land has nothing to do with the price of oil or Gasoline. There are millions of acres of public land leased to oil companies yet to be explored and oil fields discovered yet to be pumped like the one that blew up in the gulf last year. That was an exploratory well and that area has yet to be developed. You argument is only for idiots that know nothing about the industry and the oil markets. Save it for the ignorant that think oil from federal lands is some how free to us. It is not. It is just one more area the oil companies can work.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1352600065543</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-10 21:14:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352600515055-139</Id><Topic><Title>Guess who is out on the golf course instead of helping thos in NYC, or the fiscal cliff?</Title><Username>zevoter22</Username><Timestamp>1352577258448</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-10 14:54:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wrong again little z. 332 electoral votes.
