ROFLMFO. you can laugh about all of this but its looking more like the marathon bombers were simply disgrunteld at being disquialifed from boxing. Many of the problems you are now seeing are due to the wealth being exhausted that had been used to appease everyone that would otherwise be disgrunteld. . Thinking they were living on love, various forms of covert spite have become professions. As the wealth and appeasement capability decay from within, spite will be all the brats have left. You may not think of a housing shortage in north dakota having the impact of a bombing, but the ability to appease everyone came from capitlist signals that actually reward and encourage production. By letting bankers get rich by making desert homes for enronald mcdonald, you stop them from getting angry but in the mean time no one is trying to determine that we will need homes hear oil facilities to keep ameruca strong. This was how regan could outspend the communists and now the brats are doing it to themselves. Then of course nature has not gone away either. Wheather and flu could be economic forces. A lot of the effective responses to these threats are being created by government while you guys try to find ways to keep your tira masu supply safe while building homes no one can use. ROFLMFO. more brat puffing, more undoing that's the power of the sociophile. ROFLMFO. A lot of capitalism has just turned into way to fool each other. This contrasts to central authority trying to define truths but neither produces anything. One way to keep society stable of course is to start censoring ideas and data, kind of like deleting all my posts ROFLMFO.</Msg><Username>ekonprophet</Username><Timestamp>1367153746374</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-28 08:55:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367154875911-9</Id><Topic><Title>OUR BABY IS GROWING UP SOOO FAST................</Title><Username>fbrow10</Username><Timestamp>1367151861677</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-28 08:24:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Cute, but I'm not sure if there's enough of a catalyst to push this up to $13 this week. This seems to be a level that most are fairly comfortable with until something else comes along to show that more improvement is taking place. With the MBIA and AIG lawsuits still hanging over them, and with the $8.5 billion mortgage settlement still unapproved, folks are going to play a waiting game. A break in any of these areas will then set the stage for the next leg up.

He also praised area residents who opened their homes to complete strangers. Later, during talk of the Washington correspondents’ dinner, he was praised for his “impeccable sense of timing” in humorous dialogue…and a possible post presidency career path was mentioned. But Syria also discussed. ABC’s Martha Raddatz spoke of clear evidence of use of sarin (poison gas), yet noted “no chain of custody” of it has been proven. GOP House member from Michigan, “Mike’ Rogers claimed evidence of its use during the past years. The Atlantic magazine’s Jeffrey Goldberg spoke of the need for that “clear evidence”, especially in view of the MWDs NOT found in Iraq. Goldberg also maintains “no one” is pushing for USA boots on the ground in Syria. Re the Boston “suspects”—there is need to determine when the older one was radicalized…his six months in Russia mentioned, but “what happened” there unknown. Goldberg noted, “one can be radicalized” in USA—the internet, etc. He also cited the role of “moderate” USA Muslims in dealing with radicalized members of their faith. “We love our country and we do our best”, the current president said re his predecessors, one assumes including himself in the “we’ as well. The sequester matter—called “colossal failure of leadership” by GOP House member from Fla. Democrat strategist Donna Brazile said the sequester has harmed many an ordinary citizen—meals on wheels cited. LA mayor, serving final term, feels that Congress is fixed on ideology to the detriment of the country. Past speaker “Newt” Gingrich wishes congress to deal with immigration “one piece at a time”.

If you've noticed during this stock's long climb back, it has tended to consolidate at certain levels, bouncing around for awhile, even taking a few steps backward. Those that took advantage of those set backs were rewarded accordingly. The long term trend, at least in my opinion, is upward. It won't happen fast, and it definitely won't be in a straight line. We will see many ups and downs, and every time it does go down, the doom and gloomers will scream about how the stock is collapsing, and every time it goes up, the pollyanna's will scream about how it is flying to the moon. The reality is that we will continue to see what has been going on the past few months, with the trend continuing to move up.

The video shot April 7 and first obtained by MidEast Christian News, shows a men shooting guns, wielding machetes and hurling stones and possibly Molotov cocktails as mourners carry caskets out of St. Mark’s Coptic Orthodox Cathedral in the Abbassia District of Cairo as uniformed police watch, unmoving. At one point, a police officer appears to help a gunman take aim at a courtyard full of mourners who had spilled out of the church. The attack left two Copts dead and another 84 people injured, including 11 police officers. When it was over, the only arrests made were of four Copts. Christians, who were already outraged over a three-day attack that began April 4 attack in Khosous which saw the four men killed and homes, a nursery and a church burned, said the events show how elusive justice is for Christians, who make up about 10 percent of the nation's population.</Msg><Username>starkdirt</Username><Timestamp>1367190300038</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-28 19:05:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367191030620-62</Id><Title>Is this is BAC board, or anything board?</Title><Msg>What a bunch of losers.</Msg><Username>motleyvee</Username><Timestamp>1367191030620</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-28 19:17:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367192375387-63</Id><Topic><Title>Most Americans now identfy with common sense Tea Party</Title><Username>drwstring</Username><Timestamp>1367164481384</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-28 11:54:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The tea party wants the consitition followed and the goverment to stay as much as possible out of there lives!This has the socialist commies panties in a knot!</Msg><Username>trader77777777</Username><Timestamp>1367192375387</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-28 19:39:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367192624765-64</Id><Topic><Title>The Muzzie-in-Chief isn't concerned ..... he keeps sending arms to Egypt .....</Title><Username>starkdirt</Username><Timestamp>1367190300038</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-28 19:05:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There brother in Washington will send them more planes and tanks and money and on top of that you will do nothing about it!</Msg><Username>trader77777777</Username><Timestamp>1367192624765</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-28 19:43:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367195554547-65</Id><Title>time to buy gold and the gold miners world needs more gold that it bac to the moon!</Title><Msg>ok</Msg><Username>ron.wallach</Username><Timestamp>1367195554547</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-28 20:32:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367195862196-66</Id><Topic><Title>time to buy gold and the gold miners world needs more gold that it bac to the moon!</Title><Username>ron.wallach</Username><Timestamp>1367195554547</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-28 20:32:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Babble that by us again idiot!</Msg><Username>starkdirt</Username><Timestamp>1367195862196</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-28 20:37:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367196178745-67</Id><Title>Is Obumer still pouting about losing the vote on his gun bill in the Senate?</Title><Msg>Harry Reid is gonna have to do a better job of trading pork for votes!</Msg><Username>starkdirt</Username><Timestamp>1367196178745</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-28 20:42:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367196306176-68</Id><Topic><Title>Most Americans now identfy with common sense Tea Party</Title><Username>drwstring</Username><Timestamp>1367164481384</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-28 11:54:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"there lives" LOL.
