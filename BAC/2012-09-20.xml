Bernanke, who has publicly warned that dawdling by lawmakers was putting the U.S. economy in peril, spoke to members of the Senate Finance Committee for about an hour behind closed doors in a meeting requested by the panel chairman, Democrat Max Baucus. "I believe strongly that nothing of consequence is ever solved when somebody tries to do something alone. You got to work together. My whole goal here is to get senators working together and it is happening," Baucus said after the meeting.</Msg><Username>rhinoinchgo</Username><Timestamp>1348118461665</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 01:21:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348118505993-14</Id><Topic><Title>Mitt lacks any kind of conscious moral need to explain himself or apologize to the peasant masses.</Title><Username>j.farragut</Username><Timestamp>1348022405095</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 22:40:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He has been a boss all his life.

They inject money into the economy, the only "rich people" in corporations are the ceo's and I agree they need their pay lowered. What we need to do is create an environment in which the wealthy can feel comfortable investing money into the economy creating job growth. CEO pay needs to be cut, we need to get politics out of business and the average american citizen needs to wake up and learn that life is hard, and you have to work, just to live. Romney will cut taxes, cut spending and create job growth, stock market growth. Yes, eventually we will level off as many debts are to be repayed. Too many people on entitlements with "hurt backs" or other #$%$ diseases they say inhibits them. Take medications, painkillers, and go to work. Some are truely sick and need to be taken care of, those truely sick people are a very small percentage of the people receiving entitlements now. I am voting for Romney because I don't believe in a large central government, it's highly inefficient and encourages people to mooch. This is a debate of "humanitarianism" v.s. "suck it up" is what it is.</Msg><Username>lukem5</Username><Timestamp>1348126099654</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 03:28:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348126387192-22</Id><Topic><Title>BEN BUZZ LIGHT YEAR SEES MAJOR MARKET CRASH IF CONGRESS DOES NOT ACT</Title><Username>rhinoinchgo</Username><Timestamp>1348118461665</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 01:21:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Areyou people idiots?

Romney, he said, “only wants to be president of half the United States of America” — a response to Romney’s remark that 47 percent of Americans are “victims” who cannot be shaken from their dependence on government. Reid said that Romney was disparaging toward — and hoping to raise taxes on — the elderly, the disabled, young students and members of the military. “The 47 percent are ordinary, hard-working Americans who deserve respect – especially from a man who wants to be their president,” Reid said. “They’re not avoiding their tax bills using Cayman Island tax shelters or Swiss bank accounts, like Mitt Romney.” Reid went on to suggested that Romney is not paying any such taxes. “For all we know, Mitt Romney could be one of those who have paid no federal income taxes,” he said. The Senate Democrat had previously claimed to have evidence that Romney paid no taxes for 10 years. He has since backpedaled and now publicly speculates that Romney did not pay taxes. The Romney campaign has denied suggestions that the candidate hasn’t paid taxes in a single year.</Msg><Username>j.farragut</Username><Timestamp>1348143189697</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 08:13:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>11</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348143334818-36</Id><Topic><Title>GIVE US A REAL AMERICA PRESIDENT NOT A MUSLIM PRESIDENT !!!!!

The Fox news survey puts Obama ahead of Romney by 7 percentage points among likely voters in Ohio, 49 to 42 percent, and in Virginia, 50 to 43 percent. In Florida, the president has a five-point advantage, 49 to 44 percent. The poll also showed Democratic candidates leading Republicans in U.S. Senates races for the same three states — Ohio, Virginia and Florida. Fox also released a survey in which a majority of Hispanic Americans say the country is ready to elect a Hispanic president. In the survey of 887 likely Latino voters, 48 percent believe U.S. voters would have been ready to elect a Latino president this year, while 40 percent said no and 12 percent were undecided.</Msg><Username>j.farragut</Username><Timestamp>1348143860766</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 08:24:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>11</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348143925460-39</Id><Title>16000 more unemployed</Title><Msg>Millions given up and homeless.....shut the borders and stop this free trade scam.

Separately, Gillard angered some Australian Muslims on Wednesday by saying she supported spy agencies monitoring the nation's mosques. Quote: 'IMMIGRANTS, NOT AUSTRALIANS, MUST ADAPT... Take It Or Leave It. I am tired of this nation worrying about whether we are offending some individual or their culture. Since the terrorist attacks on Bali , we have experienced a surge in patriotism by the majority of Australians.' 'This culture has been developed over two centuries of struggles, trials and victories by millions of men and women who have sought freedom.' 'We speak mainly ENGLISH, not Spanish, Lebanese, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Russian, or any other language. Therefore, if you wish to become part of our society, learn the language!' 'Most Australians believe in God. This is not some Christian, right wing, political push, but a fact, because Christian men and women, on Christian principles, founded this nation, and this is clearly documented. It is certainly appropriate to display it on the walls of our schools. If God offends you, then I suggest you consider another part of the world as your new home, because God is part of our culture.' 'We will accept your beliefs, and will not question why. All we ask is that you accept ours, and live in harmony and peaceful enjoyment with us.' 'This is OUR COUNTRY, OUR LAND, and OUR LIFESTYLE, and we will allow you every opportunity to enjoy all this. But once you are done complaining, whining, and griping about Our Flag, Our Pledge, Our Christian beliefs, or Our Way of Life, I highly encourage you take advantage of one other great Australian freedom, 'THE RIGHT TO LEAVE'.'

Last week Mark Zuckerberg was talking up ZNGA in his 1st official Q&amp;A after the FB IPO. Zuckerberg spoke about Zynga in New York City more times then FACEBOOK; remarking that with the information it has on its Global Users in Legal Gambling Markets that FB will be "The Worlds Largest Wagering Site on The Internet". With no "Bricks &amp; Mortar" the profitability will easily give Vegas a run for its Money using the established ZNGA Gaming Platform. If Zuckerberg was pointing to an upcoming Acquisition Candidate there is no doubt that Zynga is on the TOP of The List. Considerable effort has been placed in buying as much stock as possible without breaking the stock out to cause a "ZNGA Stock Run" while several Fund Managers are grabbing small lots with this unknown buyer and the others that are getting "The Sub-$5 Rule Lifted" to get in on this one early rather then wait until $5 to take initial positions; GS, JPM, MS Institutional Fund Managers in specific. Mark Cuban has also been approached with no comment at this time over the weekend. With this new joint targeted Ad Program rolling out as of now it will not take long for ZNGA to run. The upside is over 168% to the upside to PAR and then add the outcome of this TARGETED "The Worlds Largest Wagering Site on The Internet" using FACEBOOK'S proprietary User Profiles collected and acceptable Terms Of Service. ZNGA was profiled to our Institutional Clients at $3+ last week after FACEBOOK's Mark Zuckerberg said GREAT THINGS about the potential revenue streams and the validity of Zyenga last week in New York City. ZNGA is hovering around $3.20 with ALL T/A POINTING TO A HUGE BREAKOUT.

Can’t Post Here…. NTWK is poised to stage a significant breakout any day now.....today's mini breakout is just one more white candle on a beautiful upward trend === Most Recent Analyst Research (last week): We project 13% annual growth to FY14 from FY10 reflecting 80 significant legacy NFS customers in FY14, up from 52, 37, and 28 in FY12, FY11, and FY10, respectively. The great majority of them in China and the rest of Asia where NTWK is the undisputed preferred software provider of every major public and state-owned car company in the region. It's global alliance with Mercedes Benz has resulted in over a dozen multi-million implementations in the region and many more in the pipeline Globally The new Vroozi Cloud Division contributed $1.3 million in FY12. We expect at least $4 million in FY13 and $6 million to FY14 Our price target is based on the average forward 2013 P/E multiple of 13.2X (up from 12.8X in August 2012). NTWK is trading at 6.4X our FY13 net income projections. EPS forecast of $0.85 per share. We applied an 11X multiple to our FY13 EPS forecast. We anticipate a richer multiple as earnings momentum builds in FY13. . NTWK is entering FY13 with a $25 million backlog and approximately $100 million in qualified leads. One quarter of the backlog is from four new NFS platform customer implementations that began in 4Q12.

SAP AG is a global vendor of enterprise management systems that has the largest market share (24%) based on a worldwide Gartner survey. Vroozi should provide sales diversification and a higher margin recurring revenue stream.

Romero – has debunked both myths. Today, Romero wrote the following to Congress: After 3½ years, the Troubled Asset Relief Program (“TARP”) continues to be an active and significant part of the Government’s response to the financial crisis. It is a widely held misconception that TARP will make a profit. The most recent cost estimate for TARP is a loss of $60 billion. Taxpayers are still owed $118.5 billion (including $14 billion written off or otherwise lost). And earlier this month, Romero stated that the portion of the Tarp funds which were supposed to help homeowners haven’t been disbursed: A fund to support homeowners in the communities hit hardest by the collapse of the housing bubble has disbursed just 3 percent of its budget and aided only 30,640 homeowners in the two years since its creation, according to a report released on Thursday by a federal watchdog office. The Hardest Hit Fund, which was created in the spring of 2010, grants money to state housing finance agencies for efforts to help families that are facing foreclosure. It has “experienced significant delay” because of “a lack of comprehensive planning” by the Treasury Department and limited participation by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the large mortgage servicers, said the report by the special inspector general for the Troubled Asset Relief Program. “Look at the TARP money that goes out to the banks,” said Special Inspector General Christy Romero in an interview with The Huffington Post. “That goes out in a matter of days. This has been two years and only 3 percent of these funds have trickled out to homeowners.” Indeed, bailing out the big banks hurts – rather than helps – the American economy. See this, this and this. (And it doesn’t take a PhD economist to guess that using bailout funds to buy gold toilet seats and prostitutes is probably not the best way to stimulate the economy as a whole). The only way to really stimulate the economy would be for the government to give money to the little guy on Main Street – instead of the big boys on Wall Street. And see this. Yet the big banks continue today to be bailed out through a wide variety of overt and hidden schemes … while the little guy gets nothing. This is true even though the American people were opposed to the bank bailouts from day one, and continue to oppose them: As I’ve noted since 2008, Americans are united in their overwhelming disapproval for bailouts to the big banks. This has remained true right up to today. As Rassmussen found only last month (as summarized by KXLF news): Today’s Rasmussen Reports survey finds that most Americans don’t like bailouts for financial institutions. 60% Oppose Financial Bailouts; 74% Say Wall Street Benefited Most Survey of 1,000 American Adults *** • Just 20% think it was a good idea for the government to provide bailout funding to banks and other financial institutions, but 60% say otherwise. • While many activists try to link the Republican Party and Wall Street, Republicans think the bailouts were a bad idea by an eight-to-one margin. • Those not affiliated with either major party think they were a bad idea by a four-to-one margin. Democrats are much more evenly divided. Thirty-four percent (34%) of those in the president’s party say the bailouts were a good idea while 42% disagree. • Overall, 68% believe that most of the bailout money went to the very people who created the nation’s ongoing economic crisis, but 12% disagree and 21% aren’t sure.</Msg><Username>newgoldmanmoney</Username><Timestamp>1348175991043</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 17:19:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348176347783-183</Id><Title>"When we wrote Part I of this paper in June 2009, the total U.S. public debt was just north of $10 trillion.

The Solution…is the Problem, Part II When we wrote Part I of this paper in June 2009, the total U.S. public debt was just north of $10 trillion. Since then, that figure has increased by more than 50% to almost $16 trillion, thanks largely to unprecedented levels of government intervention. Once the exclusive domain of central bankers and policy makers, acronyms such as QE, LTRO, SMP, TWIST, TARP, TALF have found their way into the mainstream. With the aim of providing stimulus to the economy, central planners of all stripes have both increased spending and reduced taxes in most rich countries. But do these fiscal and monetary measures really increase economic activity or do they have other perverse effects? In today’s overleveraged world, greater deficits and government spending, financed by an expansion of public debt and the monetary base (“the printing press”), are not the answer to our economic woes. In fact, these policies have been proven to have a negative impact on growth. While it hasn’t received much attention in recent years, a wide body of economic theory suggests that government policies and their size relative to the total economy can have a significant detrimental impact on economic growth. A recent paper from the Stockholm Research Institute of Industrial Economics compiles evidence from numerous empirical studies and finds that, for rich countries, there is overwhelming evidence of a negative relationship between a large government (either through taxes and/or spending as a share of GDP) and economic growth.1 All else being equal, countries where government plays a large role in the economy tend to experience lower GDP growth. Of course, correlation does not imply causation. While the literature is not definitive on causation, it still provides strong evidence that more taxes and government spending as a share of GDP (except for productive investments such as education) is associated with lower growth. One exception to these findings is the experience of Scandinavian countries. They have both high taxes and high government spending as a share of GDP but have experienced relatively rapid growth over the past 20 years. However, a significant share of their spending goes to education, which has been found to foster growth. They also counterbalance the large role of the state with very liberal, pro-market reforms and low levels of public debt.2 Debt overhang and economic growth Even if one believes that temporary Keynesian-type fiscal stimulus, in the form of tax breaks and increased government spending, can spur growth in the short-term, these actions inevitably lead to larger deficits and higher government debt (see July 2010 Markets at a Glance, “Fooled By Stimulus”). As Figures 1 and 2 below show, the U.S. Federal Government deficit and debt levels are already at their highest levels since the end of World War II and the scope of future stimulus appears to be rather limited. According to our projections (which assume there will be no fiscal cliff), the U.S. federal debt will increase significantly as the deficit remains sustained and elevated. For many European countries the situation is even worse. FIGURE 1: U.S. DEFICIT AS A SHARE OF GDP FIGURE 2: U.S. DEBT-TO-GDP* Source: The White House: Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and Sprott Calculations *For reasons discussed in May 2009 Markets at a Glance The Solution … is the Problem, Part 1, we show total federal debt subject to the debt ceiling. High levels of debt, or debt overhangs, cause more problems. Recent work by Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff (Harvard University) demonstrates that banking crises are strongly associated with large increases in government indebtedness, long periods of unemployment and, ultimately, some form of default. They identify a threshold of 90% debt-to-GDP as the trigger to a debt crisis.3 As shown in Figure 2, the U.S. has already passed that threshold. The historical evidence shows that countries with large governments and high levels of debt have on average, achieved lower economic growth. Given the already high level of debt and deficits in most developed countries, it is doubtful that increased fiscal stimulus will really help the recovery. It’s clear that debt is the problem and the solution does not lie in piling on even more of it. The current debt situation, coupled with the increasing lack of transparency of politically motivated regulations and interventions, leaves little room for a healthy deleveraging of our economies. Here is what central planners have in mind. Debt overhang resolution and implications for the future Througout history, high debt-to-GDP ratios have been resolved through five channels:4 Economic growth Austerity Defaults Sudden bursts of inflation Steady financial repression and inflation Clearly, number one and two are not working right now and, in some European countries, are actually negatively reinforcing each other. The U.S. is facing its homegrown fiscal cliff and political polarization makes its resolution doubtful. Number three seems politically unacceptable for rich, developed nations, which see default as the realm of developing countries. Sudden bursts of inflation are hard to contain and work only so many times as investors, assuming a normal bond market, demand higher interest rates to compensate for inflation risk. Moreover, with interest rates already, at zero it seems that we are left with number five: steady financial repression and inflation. This terminology was first introduced in the early 1970s by Edward Shaw and Ronald McKinnon, both from Stanford University.5 They define financial repression as: Explicit or indirect caps or ceilings on interest rates The creation and maintenance of a captive domestic audience (i.e.: forced holdings of government debt by financial institutions and pension funds) Direct ownership of financial institutions and/or entry restriction in the financial industry (i.e.: China, India) We are clearly living through a period of financial repression. The symptoms include: Artificially low interest rates in most of the G20 countries and commitments to keep them low for long periods of time combined with inflation, which results in negative real interest rates Large expansion of central banks’ balance sheets through the purchase of government bonds Basel III liquidity rules which force banks to hold more government debt on their balance sheets6, Newly nationalized banks in many countries (UK, Ireland, Spain, etc.), which have drastically increased their holdings of government debt and it will bet worse... Figure 3 below shows that financial repression can be observed within the holdings of U.S. financial institutions and pension funds, which have steadily increased their holdings of U.S. Treasuries since 2009.</Msg><Username>newgoldmanmoney</Username><Timestamp>1348176347783</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 17:25:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348177794357-184</Id><Topic><Title>NEW ROMNEY FLIPP FLOPP.

He called them “takers” and all but accused them of mooching off the rest of society. As numerous news outlets have pointed out in the wake of those comments’ release, about half the households in the group paid no income tax because the standard deduction put them below the taxable threshold. Three-quarters of the other 38 million households were either elderly or in families that received refundable tax credits for their school-age children or as supplements to their income – the so-called earned income tax credit. In other words, they paid no taxes because they benefited from tax expenditures, exclusions and deductions in the tax code that lower personal income taxes. If that is “taking,” how does that compare with Romney’s 53 percent or, for that matter, with Romney himself? The Fiscal Times FREE Newsletter The Tax Policy Center has a detailed study of the distribution of tax expenditures, which in addition to the earned income tax credit includes reduced tax rates on capital gains, exclusion of retirement savings and the deductions for charitable giving and home mortgage interest that reduced household federal income taxes by $1.08 trillion in 2011. It found that the top 1 percent of filers earning over $400,000 raked in 23.9 percent or about $258 billion in reduced taxes through deductions and exclusions. The top 10 percent of filers took in 40.3 percent, or more than $435 billion. On the other hand, the bottom 60 percent of tax filers, which includes more than 99 percent of the people who paid no income tax last year (the non-paying group also included 7,000 millionaires), grabbed just 20.1 percent of the tax reductions from deductions and exclusions. That was worth $217 billion or half of what was claimed by far fewer top earners in the U.S. “If you counted tax expenditures as a form of spending, then the rich would be paying a lot more in taxes,” said Eric Toder, a fellow at the Urban Institute and co-author of a study on the distribution of tax expenditures. “If you didn’t have tax expenditures, the tax system would be more progressive than it is today.” Two factors drive the skewing of tax expenditures toward the well-off. First, the more money you make, the more likely you are to engage in activities the tax code favors, whether it is saving for retirement, purchasing expensive homes with larger mortgages or giving to a favored charity. Second, people in high income tax brackets get a higher percentage of their deductions returned in the form of lower taxes. A dollar given to charity by someone in the 35 percent tax bracket reduces federal taxes on that income by 35 cents, while a dollar given to charity by someone in the 10 percent tax bracket only reduces their taxes by a dime. Some tax-favored activities are almost entirely the province of the well-to-do. For instance, the capital gains and dividends exclusion – it is taxed at a flat 15 percent rate instead of normal rates – reduced taxes by $77.7 billion in 2011. Fully three-quarters of that tax break went to filers in the top 1 percent of the income distribution. The bottom 60 percent of the population received just 1.1 percent of its benefits. Romney, who includes himself among the makers, is a major beneficiary of this special treatment in the tax code. It was among the many tax breaks that allowed him to pay an effective tax rate of 13.9 percent in 2010, far below the statutory 35 percent that would normally be applied to his $21.6 million in income."</Msg><Username>blackjackkid41</Username><Timestamp>1348187715776</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 20:35:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348187870362-220</Id><Title>Mitt Romney's politics are fraudulent, deceptive and dishonest..........</Title><Msg>the latest video of his 47% is the real Mitt the Twitt.

Me thinks you may have "multiple personality disorder", Mason... you may want to get yourself checked out by a qualified health care professional soon. In order for you to be taken seriously, Mason, you need to answer a few questions, otherwise everything you post will be taken as nonsense: How long have you been pretending to be a woman? (You know, your "lovinglickablelabia" id...) Is that why your wife left you? Did Warren even notice? How many browsers you got open? How many of your ids are currently signed in to yahoo at this moment? How many of those ids are you using to converse with yourself? How do you spell "loser""? And...what's the difference between an "accomplishment" and a "task"? And finally, given all the above, how can ANYTHING you post ANYWHERE be taken seriously, Mason? LMFAO Later...
