Whether that will happen Monday I don't know and I admit that some of that 25 cents may already be built into the current price. But the judge will probably hand down her decision next week. Then it may oscillate around $14.75 to $15.25 for the next few months before moving up again. Might even drop back down to the low $14s before September or October. But October should provide another good earnings report and then BAC should head towards $16 by the end of the year. That means I now expect BAC to reach $20 before the end of 2014. I am not sure when it will hit $20 during the next year. Could close around $22 by the end of next year if the dividend is raised. Just buy and don't sell is the safest strategy as the moves up will be sudden and unexpected. Selling on a down move could be the stupidest thing you could do.</Msg><Username>whyduyouask</Username><Timestamp>1374328494393</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 09:54:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374328540114-17</Id><Topic><Title>new "Life After People" episode to be filmed in detroit.

Kudos; I never would have thought of preserving property values by getting wild animals and weeds to start flipping homes to one another too, but I can see where that should work, although some minor adjustments in municipal ordinances will be required, such as changing 'borough' to 'burrow', but as always good fences still make good neighbors and will aid in keeping the bunnies and the vegetables segregated ROTFLMAO. As the Igloo mission drags on and days turn into weeks, I am becoming ever more appreciative of drone technology. In fact, the appeal of controlling the beech from the comfort of my den has become so strong that it makes me weep whenever I think about it, which is more or less all the time now thanks to the incessant drone from that big Pratt&amp;Whitney, alway 3 feet in front of my face no matter how fast or slow I go.

I don't agree with Obama on a lot just like I didn't agree with Bush on a lot but guess what both of them was my commander in chief. And as people fight for you to have the freedom to spit out your bigotry I hope you find yourself in a position where you have no choice but to eat your words or choke on them.</Msg><Username>fbrow10</Username><Timestamp>1374364538059</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 19:55:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374364871580-66</Id><Title>Do illegal Hispanics contribute anything to this country</Title><Msg>besides popping out babies and living off the taxpayers dollars.</Msg><Username>bo_jackson_62</Username><Timestamp>1374364871580</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 20:01:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374364971760-67</Id><Title>Do Filthy Wet-Backs Contribute Anything Positive To This Country</Title><Msg>Filthy Animals!</Msg><Username>bo_jackson_62</Username><Timestamp>1374364971760</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 20:02:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374365100143-68</Id><Topic><Title>I HOPE WE OPEN AT 15 ON MONDAY</Title><Username>fbrow10</Username><Timestamp>1374323694415</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 08:34:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If the charts and graphs are right it looks like the best dip we'll see is 14.54.

But if, by that, you are referring to Republicans not supporting unions who want little more than to reduce productivity to increase the number of employees, bankrupt the company with silly work rules that require still more unproductive employees, and then go on strike when anyone threatens to touch the benefits that the union insists on and the company cannot afford, then I guess you are right. But I would argue that's not hypocrisy. It's common sense, but it's not hypocrisy. Hypocrisy is saying you want a living wage, then throwing in a luxury benefits/retirement package, then insisting on silly work rules that kill productivity and increase cost, then bankrupting your company, then complaining that Republicans are responsible for your job loss and your loss of benefits. Now THAT is hypocrisy.</Msg><Username>anotherobamafailure</Username><Timestamp>1374375868077</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 23:04:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374376324279-79</Id><Topic><Title>Our company just announced much higher health care costs next year.</Title><Username>ilovepelosi</Username><Timestamp>1374356425746</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 17:40:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well, that is absolutely false. The ACA has everything to do with the types of policies that can be offered by employers, who must offer them (over 50 FT emps), and how much penalty you must pay if the plan is too generous. If it had no impact on employer-provided health insurance, then you wouldn't have thousands of employers who have sought and received waivers for Obamacare because they cannot afford it. You are wholly misinformed or mal-educated. Take your pick.
