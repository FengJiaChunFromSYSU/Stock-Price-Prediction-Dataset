Sen Rubio feels he and his seven senators are “freezing” the status quo by stricter border controls. He also feels his group does not foster “amnesty” because the present program sends illegals back to their homeland to return to USA “at back of line”. Process takes ten plus years, so does the proposal presented by the group of eight, rubio claims. Re guns, “background checks’ do not work because they are not enforced. Criminals, of course, are not intimated by them. We need, not debate on guns, etc, but on “violence”. Now GoP Sen from Alabama, Jeff Sessions states “we are not prosecuting” the 11 million illegals, some of whom have been here a decade or more years. Sen Chas Schumer, from NYS, says the group is procuring a way to treat the 11 million illegals, and yes stopping/reducing the flow of more of them to the USA. He says the present system blocks those we want from entering, lets others in… In all talk of “background checks’, no mention of how complete (or otherwise) is the file with which the “background checks’ are made G f Will simply claims, “the ll million are not leaving”. Therefore, he claims, there is a “path to citizenship” “sometime” for them Dem Representative from Ill, Luis Gutierrez says “we need to do something for parents of children born in USA, those children of course USA citizens” Ruth Marcus, major newspaper (N Y Times or Wash Post, not sure which) plugs for better background checks. Sponsors—touch of financial ones—etrade, Ameriprise—plus the usual gas/oil pressure group, BP, chevron, GE (like BP two spots) and Xerox. Also Natl Car Rental and Pacific Life, latter first, as usual. Three members of USA military made ultimate sacrifice. Each within a year of age 25, one Tenn, one Calif, one Puerto Rico—the latter obviously in military by complete personal choice.</Msg><Username>cent_0425</Username><Timestamp>1365956014783</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 12:13:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365956723114-34</Id><Topic><Title>What do you call 10 inbred tweakers living in a lot rent singlewide who mate with farm animals?</Title><Username>sofreakinghot</Username><Timestamp>1365596857731</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 08:27:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Trust fund?
