I have some experience with so called regulators. Most of them don't get out from behind their desks. The ones that do usually are in it for the buck and get kickbacks for looking the other way. I am not a fan of big giant corporations because often they get that big because people in the government collude with them to get rid of their competition but at least with companies you have word of mouth, websites etc telling you to stay away from bad products if they don't provide you a good product or service provided you have other options to fill your need. However there is no transparency of what goes on in the dark shadows of government.

Yes. And YES!!! If they're human, breathing, and in the United States, whether legally, illegally, visiting, just passing through, fell out of a balloon, or were beamed down by the crew of the Enterprise: YES!!!. Furthermore, it should be free, and everyone should have equal access to the exactly the same care, care that is the best available anywhere, for everyone. As long as America claims to be the greatest country on earth with the best system of government the world has ever seen, yet cannot meet even the first demand of its declaration 'Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness', it's all a grand lie. Cut all the bank subsidies, the farm subsidies, the oil company giveaways, the corporate tax breaks, the defense budget, foreign aid, campaign funds, and all the rest of the 'special interest' payola to non-persons, and it would be easy. Don't, and we continue sliding down the road to ruin. "Shining city on a hill" my patootie! "Abbotoire" is more like it: if you have enough money, you get the meat. Not enough money?

Fixing the web site should not be a problem, unrealistic expectations however could be if the trumps keep clinging to them. You are already seeing that the sociophiles relationships with allies fall apart as more information is revealed, and that was their route to salvation. The problem is that when people need to define themselves to be right, the first victims of their happiness campaign are those who would identify the problems to realizing the dream. Then the puffed up brats, used to getting their way, need to get even angrier until they can no longer get angry enough to help anyone. All praise the humans. ROFLMFO.

Let me offer you something I think you'll enjoy more: an excerpt from a work in progress of mine about fishing and sensory processing disorders, from a chapter titled "The Cost Of Fishing". Straight ahead descriptive prose: a fisherman has just landed a huge native brook trout in a New Hampshire stream: "The fish is an improbable amalgam of contrasts: simplicity and complexity at war, subtlety and flash colliding, opposing colors vying for space on the canvas of its flanks, and layer upon layer of hues and patterns struggling to assert themselves over one another. The effect is at once jarring yet sublime, a dizzying and hallucinogenic explosion of color superimposed on restful earth tones and mild sunrises. It is dazzle camouflage done to perfection. Most arresting are its spots, some like random yellow bursts of fireworks exploding against a night sky, and others suggesting more intent, as if an artist had somehow flicked a brush-load of droplets along the lateral line without hitting it. Each droplet holds a crimson center, a sharp red bull’s-eye surrounded by a thin sky-blue ring that shades away from the center through periwinkle into deep purple before it disappears. He is no more able to comprehend what he sees than a child gazing into the movement of a fine watch. He fumbles in the face of its complications, unable to grasp its intricacies and mechanisms. Hefting the fish critically, and inchworm-spanning one hand from nose to tail, a pair of conclusions is reached: nearly 18 inches, and just under 3 pounds. This information is distilled even further, down to a pair of four-letter words: nice fish." ROTFLMAO,"Hot-cha-cha-cha-cha, I gotta a millyun of 'em"....personalities and styles, that is.</Msg><Username>fish2kill</Username><Timestamp>1382840965911</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-10-26 22:29:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382841544889-142</Id><Topic><Title>Spock and Fish.</Title><Username>doncassel365</Username><Timestamp>1382838325445</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-10-26 21:45:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Meanwhile your government just added another 65 Million to the National Debt Last Hour</Msg><Username>humblehawk88</Username><Timestamp>1382841544889</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-10-26 22:39:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382842102500-143</Id><Topic><Title>Spock and Fish.</Title><Username>doncassel365</Username><Timestamp>1382838325445</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-10-26 21:45:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ROTFLMAO so do you think for a moment that your head is in a better place than mine?</Msg><Username>fish2kill</Username><Timestamp>1382842102500</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-10-26 22:48:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1382842458446-144</Id><Title>Is Obama a Big Clown Show or What?</Title><Msg>I find the guy simply not believable.
