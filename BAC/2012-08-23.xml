Why does the left have to make abortion a front page issue like it's going to be re-decided in every election... I know the right is trying to apply a standard to taxpayer dollars provided by citizens who, by a vast majority, don't support taxpayer funding of it in any event... why do you lefties open up with both barrels (gun analogy doesn't make sense for left, but so be it)? Why do you rejoice at the killing by ripping limb-from-limb of babies? Why do you think that makes you such a great person? Why do you want to elevate by activism the "war on women" status of this? Why is being pro-abortion considered a moral virtue in your party? Oh sure, the mommy lives to get laid another day, but the baby gets suctioned out piece by piece or, in the case of partial birth, brain sucked out and skull crushed. What a glorious thing to be praising. If you guys like it so much, you should serve it as a pate at the DNC convention. I have friends/relatives who won't even consider thinking about what is involved in an abortion. All they can imagine is not having their child have to deal with raising a baby and "ruining their future". Imagine how the kid feels... I don't preach to them, I respect that it's an intensely personal decision that a person can't really contemplate without being in the shoes of those who are there. But whatever their position, my tax dollars SHOULDN'T EVER pay for it. The idea that I work my butt off so that somebody can murder their kid for free is not part of "general welfare". It's an abomination. That's my stand. I completely and totally agree with the GOP platform. It's about tax dollars, not overturning Roe v Wade.</Msg><Username>flippant_1</Username><Timestamp>1345694865229</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 00:07:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345696389512-2</Id><Title>Precious Metals</Title><Msg>The Precious Metals are going crazy..

You cannot use the word "data" in any way with the term "Obamacare" because there is no data. There are only projections, and estimates, NO DATA. Secondly there is no evidence to suggest that our government can do anything but spend more than it originally planned. On anything. You need only research the history of Medicare and compare the cost projections made in 1965 under LBJ and the astronomical increases that have come since. There may be other governments that have the discipline and focus to control costs such as Singapore but the US government has NEVER shown that discipline and always spends more WAY more on everything. Unless overturned, Obamacare will be the most costly government program ever.</Msg><Username>the_power_inyou</Username><Timestamp>1345703135771</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 02:25:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345706771966-10</Id><Title>Rain</Title><Msg>Ask him maybe can call Africa to do a rain dance</Msg><Username>gmprv9345</Username><Timestamp>1345706771966</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 03:26:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345716844706-11</Id><Title>Commander-in-Chief Willard?

"It feels like political stars are now aligning so that regardless of who wins the next election, under almost any scenario they will get it together," he tells The Daily Ticker's Aaron Task. "Odds are good they will come up with a plan that addresses the fiscal cliff, the Treasury debt ceiling — which expires early next year — and fiscal sustainability." Zandi attributes his rosy sentiment to deleveraging throughout the economy. "The banking system is on much more solid ground, households have done a very good job of reducing their debt and most importantly American businesses are in very good financial shape," he says.

It does need to retest under $7 for those shorter term trades to make a few bucks here and there so if investing for at least three years, any price now is great to buy and forget about but if going by charts for shorter term gains, BAC is extremely overbought, cannot sustain the uptrend, is far above the graph line and must pull back over a buck a share soon! I expect as always; Sept-November to be the lows but is only my opinion. See you at $6.00 in this great company.</Msg><Username>canadakongchong</Username><Timestamp>1345768622066</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 20:37:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345769121450-154</Id><Topic><Title>BAC due for large pullback BUT</Title><Username>canadakongchong</Username><Timestamp>1345768622066</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 20:37:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I sold my 10k shares today (I previously purchased several weeks ago @ $6.92 ) I was going to hold out for $10. but changed my mind.
