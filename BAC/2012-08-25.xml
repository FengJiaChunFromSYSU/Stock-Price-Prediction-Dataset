Bain Capital Fund VII, a $515 million Cayman Island-based limited partnership in which Ann Romney has at least $1 million, according to financial disclosure forms. In the words of the writer, John Cook, the documents "reveal the mind-numbing, maze-like, and deeply opaque complexity with which Romney has handled his wealth, the exotic tax-avoidance schemes available only to the preposterously wealthy." Reaction ranged from an angry Bain statement decrying the release of confidential documents to a yawn from a Fortune blogger who claimed this was old news to an accusation by a Colorado University law professor who argued that the documents revealed evidence of an illegal tax dodge. What's not in dispute: The documents show that Bain, like other private equity firms, goes to great lengths to reduce its tax liability, and they show how tax loopholes are available to wealthy investors that less affluent, salaried workers can't use.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1345897402265</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 08:23:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345897670084-32</Id><Topic><Title>BIRHER IN CHIEF - MITTEN WILLARD ROMNEY - WHAT AN IDIOT</Title><Username>farawaylife</Username><Timestamp>1345853914076</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 20:18:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>damn you guys are retarded</Msg><Username>farawaylife</Username><Timestamp>1345897670084</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 08:27:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345897989100-33</Id><Topic><Title>Bain records show Romeny lied about his income tax.</Title><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1345846966298</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 18:22:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You may not like what I say but you can't show it is a lie.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1345897989100</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 08:33:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345899324695-34</Id><Title>What evidence is there for huge oil fields off of the Eastern US Coast?</Title><Msg>Anyone have any proof of oil there?

Oil companies drilled 5 wells in Atlantic Florida state waters and 51 exploratory wells on federal leases on the outer continental shelf of the Atlantic coast. None of the wells were completed as producing wells. All the leases have now reverted to the government. US Atlantic coast federal offshore areas (Minerals Management Service) Although no oil or gas have been produced from beneath US Atlantic waters, there are active offshore fields to the south in offshore Cuba and to the north in offshore Canada. Each coastal state along the Atlantic coast owns the territory extending three nautical miles (3.45 statute, or land miles) from the shore at mean low tide, and has jurisdiction to decide whether or not, and under what terms, to lease the territory for oil and gas. The federal government owns and controls the minerals between three and 200 nautical miles (370 km) from the shore. In accordance with congressional restrictions and presidential orders, no federal leasing has taken place on the offshore US Atlantic coast since the early 1980s. The federal government had scheduled a lease sale offshore Virginia, to take place in 2011, and in March 2010, US President Barack Obama announced his intention to open the Mid-Atlantic and South Atlantic planning areas to oil and gas exploration.[1][2] However, lease sale plans were cancelled in May 2010 following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. In December 2010, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar announced a ban on drilling in federal waters off the Atlantic coast through 2017.[3]</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1345899793866</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 09:03:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345900378781-37</Id><Title>Klienbards analysis of the Ryan Tax plan</Title><Msg>" The purest articulation of Paul Ryan’s fiscal belief system is his 2010 Roadmap for America’s Future.

Unlike the 9-9-9 Plan the Roadmap further would largely immunize “old” capital from the efficient (if arguably unfair) imposition of consumption tax when that capital was consumed, by providing a write-off of existing depreciable basis. And finally the Roadmap would reduce the tax burdens on the most affluent capital owners further by eliminating the gift and estate tax. For these reasons, it is not surprising that the Roadmap contemplates an extraordinarily large redistribution of tax burdens from the affluent to middle-class and lower income Americans. For middle-class families, tax burdens would increase on the order of 50 percent. At the same time, the Roadmap’s reprioritization of government spending also would be regressive in its impact. Proponents of the Roadmap or plans like it must explain how any projected increase in economic growth will compensate the majority of Americans for shouldering more tax burdens while receiving smaller government benefits."</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1345900378781</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 09:12:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345901499239-38</Id><Title>Ryans view on Banking issues</Title><Msg>While former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney is mostly a blank slate when it comes to financial services issues, his running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan, is not. Following are some of the stances Ryan has taken on issues critical to the banking sector: Repeal the FDIC's Resolution Powers Ryan's budget proposal seeks to repeal a part of the Dodd-Frank law that would allow the FDIC to wind down and dismantle a failing banking company. Because the FDIC could borrow money from the Treasury for this purpose, Ryan dubs it a "bailout regime." Others strongly disagree with this characterization. Repeal the Fed's dual mandate In 2008, Ryan authored a bill that would strip the Fed of its statutory responsibility to focus on "employment" in addition to "price stability." Revamp FHA's budget Ryan's budget calls for the use of fair-value scoring for all federal credit programs, such as the Federal Housing Administration. He argues the current budgetary treatment of FHA loans understates their cost Strengthen the Volcker Rule? At a town hall meeting in Wisconsin on May 4, Ryan appeared to support the Volcker Rule, a provision in Dodd-Frank that would ban banks from engaging in proprietary trading. "If you're a bank and you want to operate like some non-bank entity like a hedge fund, then don't be a bank. Don't let banks use their customers money to do anything other than traditional banking." Privatize the GSEs Ryan's budget says Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac should be unwound and privatized, a longtime goal of conservative Republicans. One way to phase them out would be to cap the value of a home that the government-sponsored enterprises can insure.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1345901499239</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 09:31:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345902160214-39</Id><Title>Republican view on womens rights</Title><Msg>The Republican Party Platform is expected to include its usual support for a Human Life Amendment that would effectively ban abortion nationwide, in almost all circumstances, without exception for rape and incest. What every American needs to know right now is that this dangerous platform has been repeatedly endorsed by Mitt Romney (R- Mass.), and reflects the position of his running mate Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.). Just last year, Rep. Ryan teamed up with Rep. Akin to co-sponsor an extreme anti-choice bill, H.R. 3, which would essentially redefine "rape" and prevent certain survivors of rape from accessing abortion services. In fact, when given the chance to apologize for his outrageous comment, Rep. Akin explained that when he said "legitimate" rape, he really meant "forcible" rape -- the new definition put forward in the bill he cosponsored with Rep. Ryan. And what's worse, Ryan has cast 59 votes on reproductive rights legislation, all of them anti-choice. Rep. Ryan also co-sponsored a couple of "personhood" bills, such as the "Sanctity of Human Life Act" that, if passed and enacted into law, would end legal abortion in almost all circumstances with no exception for rape or incest. Make no mistake, the reprehensible views voiced by Rep. Todd Akin echo the true positions of the Romney-Ryan ticket. These men and the Republican Platform Committee have pandered to the extreme positions of a small percentage of American voters, and tonight, they will do it again. American women and their families must be aware that if Romney and Ryan are campaigning toward November 6 on this platform, they have every intention of a continued War on Women.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1345902160214</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 09:42:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345902461007-40</Id><Title>Romneys view of religious diversity in the USA</Title><Msg>"Every religion has its own unique doctrines and history," he said, and "these should not be bases for criticism but rather a test of our tolerance."</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1345902461007</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 09:47:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345902613759-41</Id><Topic><Title>Obama: "Do we go forward towards a new vision of an America in which prosperity is shared?"</Title><Username>dumpobamie</Username><Timestamp>1345902216639</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 09:43:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>do you see or hear - of Obama sharing any of his 13 million with his fellow amecians - why - NO - he just wants everyone else to give theirs away .!! or look to see what percentage - he gave to - charties - he complains abouy everyone else - but fails to live up to his own words Las Vegas - has a word for that - FOUR FLUSHER "</Msg><Username>da23533</Username><Timestamp>1345902613759</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 09:50:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345902946405-42</Id><Topic><Title>Obama: "Do we go forward towards a new vision of an America in which prosperity is shared?"</Title><Username>dumpobamie</Username><Timestamp>1345902216639</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 09:43:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You have been bamboozaled and hoodwinked by Obmama.

After spending three-and-a-half months debating and negotiating about what should go into the document that would govern the land, the framers drafted a constitution that is secular. The preamble of the Constitution invokes the people of the United States. It does not invoke any sort of God. The Constitution forbids any religious test to hold office. A godless person is just as eligible as a godly one! (Article 6, Paragraph 3) In 1773, the Rev. Isaac Backus , the most prominent Baptist minister in New England, observed that when "church and state are separate, the effects are happy, and they do not at all interfere with each other: but where they have been confounded together, no tongue nor pen can fully describe the mischiefs that have ensued." The founding fathers did not mention God in the Constitution, and the faithful often regarded our early presidents as insufficiently pious. George Washington was a nominal Anglican who rarely stayed for Communion. John Adams was a Unitarian, which Trinitarians abhorred as heresy. Thomas Jefferson, denounced as an atheist, was actually a deist who detested organized religion and who produced an expurgated version of the New Testament with the miracles eliminated. Jefferson and James Madison, a nominal Episcopalian, were the architects of the Virginia Statute of Religious Freedom. James Monroe was another Virginia Episcopalian. John Quincy Adams was another Massachusetts Unitarian.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1345903692062</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 10:08:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345904375987-44</Id><Title>IF OBAMA WINS--LOOK FORWARD TO BECOMING ANOTHER EUROPE</Title><Msg>Just like Obama says, "we have to spread the wealth."

It is important to remember that when the Constitution was written, the only possible explanation for the existence of the Universe was special creation. Therefore, all of the delegates at the Philadelphia convention were creationists of one form or another. This is the reason the framers did not create a "secular" state in the modern sense of the term. Indeed, the concept of "secularism" as it is used today didn’t even exist in 1787. It is largely a twentieth-century concept. Since the framers of our Constitution predated Darwin and the theory of evolution, the desire to have a "secular" state would have made as much sense to them as Egyptian hieroglyphics. It is only with the advent of Darwin and an alternative explanation for the existence of the Universe that a secular state becomes necessary. There were atheists in 1787 to be sure, but they lacked a coherent scientific explanation for the existence of the Universe. At the same time, the framers of our Constitution did not want America to become a theocracy. They did not believe in a theocratic state. The framers of our Constitution did not want clergymen to pick the Presidents and set government policy. This is not to say, however, that they saw no role for religion in government. The framers most certainly did believe that religion and religious values should influence the government and its policies. George Washington’s first Proclamation as President made this abundantly clear. On the day that Congress finished its work on the First Amendment, they called on Washington to issue a Proclamation to the people of the United States to thank God for the freedoms we enjoy. A week and a day later the President’s opening paragraph in his Proclamation said: "Whereas it is the duty of all nations to acknowledge the providence of Almighty God, to obey His will, to be grateful for His benefits, and humbly to implore His protection and favor . . ."[2] The words "to obey His will" are fatal to any suggestion that George Washington and the framers of our Constitution believed in "secularism." In America, religious values influence government policy through the vote of the people.</Msg><Username>pooperscoopers32</Username><Timestamp>1345904641723</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 10:24:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345904928471-46</Id><Topic><Title>You have to Watch this movie 2016: Obama's America Starting many cities this weekend</Title><Username>pooperscoopers32</Username><Timestamp>1345888216549</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 05:50:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It is in hundreds of theaters this wkend.

For some people it is the only safe way to manage their money, for others it legitimately saves them being over taxed. What’s more, as we will now demonstrate, offshore banking will never be made illegal. What IS Illegal About Banking Offshore? If we get the illegal side of the argument out of the way, we can concentrate of whether offshore banking is immoral, should be made illegal and whether you should even be contemplating going offshore… So, if anyone holds money, wealth, assets or taxable property offshore without declaring it to the tax authority where they are resident, and/or where they are liable for income, capital gains or even corporate taxation for example, then they could be acting illegally. If you have a reporting obligation to a tax authority, your obligation is absolute. I.e., you cannot selectively report only certain information about your financial status. You have to declare everything and pay all taxes owing. Your reporting and taxation responsibility is a personal one, ignorance of the laws are not an excuse for tax avoidance or evasion.</Msg><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1345918321624</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 14:12:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345918735179-78</Id><Topic><Title>Bain records show Romeny lied about his income tax.</Title><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1345846966298</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 18:22:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A faulty interpretation is not an excuse either and the IRS has yet to rule on some of the methods that Romney and Bain have used to evade taxes.
