The old guard GOP are too cowardly (and know better than) to speak their mind, so they use patsy fools like Cruz as mouthpiece lightening rods to voice their agenda. Later, once Cruz is crucified by the overwhelming moderate voters within both parties, the old guard GOP will disown Cruz as "over-zealous," or some other mildly disdainful adjective, so as not to bruise him too badly since he may be needed to do their bidding again in the future.

You must be one of the 50,000,000 million getting govt. assistance. All the Tea Party and GOP want is fiscal responsiblity. Welfare has doubled under Obozo, debt from 8 trillion to 17 trillion. If you're not smart enough to figure out who is going to pay for that I'll tell you. It's us moron with higher taxes. It's amazing how gullible the American people are. They voted for him once and he didn't deliver and he promised the same things the second time and they still voted for him. Don't blame the GOP and Tea Party for this train wreck. He is no leader.</Msg><Username>jjordan920</Username><Timestamp>1381690966128</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-10-13 15:02:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381692069920-67</Id><Topic><Title>Polls for GOP at an all time historic low.

I shudder to think what things would be like if we didn't have the checks and balances that we do, even as imperfect as they are. Nor can I imagine the chaos and confusion if the entire electorate was called upon to vote upon every single piece of legislation that comes up. You think we have gridlock now.

If you have a valuable job, there is some threat that an important need could go unmet. In paradise, you don't need to worry about your food showing up on time. The leisure economy is a great idea but you can't neglect the fundamentals or try to make heros by making dragons. But no one wanted that, the zero sum game accomplished nothing not even rewarding those who could preidct future wants but only those who could manipulate others it seems according to some cynics. Otherwise, there could have been more homes near oil fields and the trumps could have predicted and prevented the current debate. Although it is good to see that by not working the democracy is working reaosnably well, there is a disagreement and it is progressing. Savaak or a CIA robotic fly with ion channel toxin could have created a lot more unity by now. ROFLMFO. This is what disagreement is all about, so far any way except for some words the spite has been well contained. When of if people act like Plato's stepchildren( the greek solution ROFLMFO) and start wrecking things out of a sense of anger and say it with vandlism , then you have real spite. ROFLMFO. The win-win solution, or for that matter a human battle, requires accurate analysis of the adversary. If you really believe that everyone who disagrees with the indian killers or trumps is a coward, eventually you will act inappropriately and not achieve your objective. All praise the humans. A lot of what you are seeing now is a collapsing ego bubble as credit was used to defer real worth determinations.

Realistically the spending will always be there - not matter who's in office! I doubt things will change - every presidential election requires pointing the finger at the other guy as being the bad guy - you see no one takes responsibility anymore. Its like a broken car - you need to mend it simply to get to work or you get you #$%$ in debt with a new one till that one breaks down - there's always some expense - again and again and again. Just gotta grin and bare!!! :(</Msg><Username>mystocks26</Username><Timestamp>1381722888295</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-10-13 23:54:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message></Date>
