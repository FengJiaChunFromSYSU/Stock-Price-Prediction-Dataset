You cannot reduce the national debt by cutting government programs because the national debt was created by past Republican presidents unfunded wars, military buildups, and misguided reduction of regulations on mortgage protection and the resultant financial death spiral that forced President Bush to jump the national debt during his last year and into the first year of Obama's administration (which is largely caused by the commitments of the prior administration). So what do you think the maximum tax rate should be? I suggest that we have the same rate as under Eisenhower's Republican administration of 92%, which had a higher National Debt to GDP ration than we currently have. Using that rate the National Debt was reduced down to a reasonable level within less than 8 years. That would be a win-win for everyone. Any other policy will just perpetuate the problems of joblessness we currently have.</Msg><Username>reallyyousure</Username><Timestamp>1380980597786</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-10-05 09:43:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380981125617-20</Id><Topic><Title>OBAMA's face @ Mount Rushmore</Title><Username>garyjohnson34231</Username><Timestamp>1380980518937</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-10-05 09:41:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Gary, you demonstrate your heinous racism and irrational fear and hatred of anyone with a abilities greater than the third grade level at which you are stuck.

At least some in Congress are concerned.</Msg><Username>jhitcher2011</Username><Timestamp>1380990779597</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-10-05 12:32:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380991112441-34</Id><Topic><Title>The consequences of NOT signing up for Obamacare</Title><Username>kingofvietnam</Username><Timestamp>1380954287380</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-10-05 02:24:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You are missing the correct answer.</Msg><Username>kevivoe</Username><Timestamp>1380991112441</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-10-05 12:38:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380992069678-35</Id><Topic><Title>9 trillion 462 billion dollars</Title><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1380955694704</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-10-05 02:48:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>At least the yearly deficit has drop from 1.3 trillion to 700 billion since Obama took office, I hope if we do get to a balanced budget we don't get another republican president to destroy it.</Msg><Username>sirifuture</Username><Timestamp>1380992069678</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-10-05 12:54:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380992258766-36</Id><Topic><Title>9 trillion 462 billion dollars</Title><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1380955694704</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-10-05 02:48:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The wealthy don't have enough to pay it off, so guess who they're coming for thweeetie: YOU. :) Not that we weren't tired of employing you anyway........</Msg><Username>day.old_donut</Username><Timestamp>1380992258766</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-10-05 12:57:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380992292767-37</Id><Topic><Title>I got a great idea.

The nearly $6 billion that BO has added in 4.5 years represents a growth rate of 9.5% annually. Debt to GDP ratios, the far more important figure, under Reagan, B1 and B2 were 49.5%, 62.7% and 77.3%, respectively at the end of their terms. BO's is now 100.5% and with the continued multi-billion deficits that ratio will continue to decline. It is widely accepted that any ratio over 90% eats into GDP growth, which is one reason this has been the most anemic recovery since the GD. Growth under BO's term has been 3.2%, and trending down. During Reagan's entire two terms, which included a recession GDP growth was 7.36%. And we have yet to feel the enormous drag the ACA will impose when it kicks in next year.</Msg><Username>jhitcher2011</Username><Timestamp>1380992555490</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-10-05 13:02:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380994083486-39</Id><Topic><Title>9 trillion 462 billion dollars</Title><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1380955694704</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-10-05 02:48:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hitch, at least Obama has revered the trend.

A number of efforts are required. (1) Major entitlement reform including an effort to cut out the welfare cheats. (2) Reduce gov't spending: The GDP/debt ratio of 100% and $700 billion deficits going forward speak volumes about runaway spending. (3) Tax reform - the top-earning 5 percent of taxpayers pay more than the bottom 95 percent. The top 5 percent earned 31.7 percent of the nation's adjusted gross income, but paid approximately 58.7 percent of federal individual income taxes. And the bottom 50% virtually pay no taxes. Everybody should have skin in the game. (4) End the antibusiness rhetoric and Holder and State AGs extorting money from banks and orther companies. (5) Cut the suffocating regulations which have hurt employment growth. Finally, no one has a good idea what the ACA will cost.

Polini expects the bank to earn 22 cents per share vs. a consensus of 20 cents, with a range of between 14 and 27 cents. Bank of America says it has eliminated 31,000 full-time jobs, or just under 11% of its workforce, between the second quarter of 2011 and the second quarter of 2013. "Core expense should decrease on continued benefits from its costs savings program. Credit quality is expected to improve again in 3Q13, and we estimate NCOs and nonaccrual loans to decline 10% and 3% LQ, respectively. We expect the margin to hold up rather well in 3Q13 at 2.44%, equal to the 2Q13 level," Polini writes. Bank of America was spending $3 billion per quarter on what it calls "legacy assets and servicing" at the end of 2012. That figure, which does not include litigation, relates to addressing problem mortgages underwritten during the subprime mortgage boom. The bank expects to bring those costs down to $2 billion per quarter by the fourth quarter of this year, according to a presentation earlier this month by CFO Bruce Thompson. "We'll reduce that another $1 billion a quarter by the end of 2014 and look to have that below $0.5 billion a quarter by the end of 2015," Thompson said at a conference hosed by Barclays. Further cost reductions will come from a cost-savings initiative know as "Project New BAC," which the bank describes in regulatory filings as "a two-phase, enterprise-wide initiative to simplify and streamline workflows and processes, align businesses and costs more closely with our overall strategic plan and operating principles, and increase revenues. Phase 1 focuses on the consumer businesses, including Deposits, Card Services and Consumer Real Estate Services, and related support, technology and operations functions. Phase 2 focuses on Global Banking, Global Markets and Global Wealth &amp; Investment Management, and related support, technology and operations functions not subject to evaluation in Phase 1. All aspects of Phase 1 of Project New BAC are currently expected to be implemented by the end of 2013, with the full cost savings impact expected to be realized in 2014, while Phase 2 is expected to be fully implemented by mid-2015." Despite the expected positives tied to cost savings, Polini sees Bank of America's "core" revenue declining 3% vs. the second quarter, due in part to a slowdown in refinancing activity as interest rates have risen. Bank of America has reportedly cut more than 2,000 jobs in its mortgage division as a result of the slowdown. Other banks, including Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC_), have made similar cuts. Bank of America has not confirmed the size of its cuts. Bank of America is scheduled to report earnings before the market opens Wed., Oct. 16. -- Written by Dan Freed in New York.</Msg><Username>sydneylocks</Username><Timestamp>1381013816653</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-10-05 18:56:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381014270273-83</Id><Topic><Title>The Communist in the Whitehouse</Title><Username>nasa_rss</Username><Timestamp>1380998074477</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-10-05 14:34:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>speaking of communists, you know ted cruz's daddy was a commie fighting for fidel castro? the guy isn't even American, fk ing Canadian stepped up spic</Msg><Username>sydneylocks</Username><Timestamp>1381014270273</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-10-05 19:04:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1381014877416-84</Id><Title>The Lemming Tea Baggers on the Message Board</Title><Msg>Why don't you sack suckers go back to your KKK forum where you can jerk each other off to no end?</Msg><Username>j.farragut</Username><Timestamp>1381014877416</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-10-05 19:14:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381016381997-85</Id><Topic><Title>The Lemming Tea Baggers on the Message Board</Title><Username>j.farragut</Username><Timestamp>1381014877416</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-10-05 19:14:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>keep ur gweer fantasies to yourself</Msg><Username>poor_bashers</Username><Timestamp>1381016381997</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-10-05 19:39:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381021994688-86</Id><Topic><Title>Obama has Made USA Insolvent</Title><Username>poor_bashers</Username><Timestamp>1381016521448</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-10-05 19:42:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nope.

The GOP is targeting the ACA...a Constitutionally-proven LAW. Nothing to negotiate. All the House has to do is pass a spending plan that doesnt include the ACA. Thats it. But Im sure the GOP will use the debt ceiling to hold us all hostage as well.</Msg><Username>erazor111</Username><Timestamp>1381030357177</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-10-05 23:32:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381030448573-105</Id><Topic><Title>Obama has Made USA Insolvent</Title><Username>poor_bashers</Username><Timestamp>1381016521448</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-10-05 19:42:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Which is WHY he told you to learn how to read.

But I doubt the dividend will be raised until BofA says that they have finished their stock buy back program successfully and then at least one more quarter. The earliest would probably the second half of next year.
