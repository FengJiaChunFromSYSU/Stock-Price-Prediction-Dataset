HSBC worked with the Mexican Drug Loards to Laundry massive amounts of money and violated mult. sanctions , all in order to fill their pockets with profit. These actions were taken will full knowledge of the Management of HSBC. No one went to jail and they only had to pay a large fine for their activity. So. consider this if anyone that was not rich or powerful had been caught selling $100 of dope would they have only received a fine? If you were supporting the terrorist nations would you only received a fine? If you activity support the murder of 100's would you have received a fine? It is past time for the SHEEP of this nation awoke to the fact that they are being led to thier own doom by the rich and powerful and neither party has any interest in repersenting them. The issues that the con men utlize to divert you from the realization that your goverment has no real concern for you will never be addressed unless it can be used to increase the wealth of the few. Wake-up, unite and demand election reform that will return the goverment to the people.</Msg><Username>carolyne47</Username><Timestamp>1362926537570</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-10 10:42:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362927943440-24</Id><Topic><Title>Fighting And Dying In Afghanistan For Opium</Title><Username>dean_martin_17</Username><Timestamp>1360003540819</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-04 13:45:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I never said we should not have paid them back.

Best thing to do is to contact your congress person and gripe about the hedge fund shorting this Stock(and others) every time it make any advance. Phone number for the U.S. House switch board is 202-224-3121. Let him or her know you want to see a new UPTICK RULE put back in place,..AND a 1% tax on any short selling. This plus a limit on shares that may be sold short would really help ANY stock achieve its' real value. Some hedgies have over a Million shares of BAC Stock. DO the math and you'll see how quickly a 1% tax would put a screeching halt to the investor damage these hedge funds are doing. BAC is very strong.

Krugman considers raising eligibility age for Medicaid terrible policy and a money drain and he would favor means testing for Medicaid; we feel he might mean "medicare", here. Wassermann Schultz would favor entitlement reforms, if coupled with a “balanced approach”, meaning added revenue by higher taxes, and 'my way or the highway'. Hyphenated names are passing tedious. Past Fla gov J E B Bush considers “sustained economic growth’ the way to deal with the need for added govt income. He feels “coming out of the shadows” is good for illegal immigrants, although it hardly replaces obeying the laws of the country you have invaded. He argues that citizenship should not be granted to illegals ahead of those who have arrived legally. Which kind of means 'never', co Brief mention of the Sen Rand Paul filibuster included the narrator saying “Sen Paul will run for the presidency in 2016.” Brief mention, too, of the Sheryl Sandberg book, with Wassermann Schultz praising her husband (assumed, name ends with Schultz) for his help with her family and career worries,,,her words including praise of his employer.

President Johnson put ss in the general fund but he planed on paying it back 'Pay Back Social Security -- The Government Has Borrowed More from Social Security than any Other Entity or Foreign Government Another argument made by Social Security opponents to raise fear about the national debt is how much our government has borrowed from China. They never mention how much our government has borrowed from Social Security. In fact, the government has borrowed more from the Social Security surplus than it has from any other source in the world, including China. As a result, Social Security now "owns" nearly 18 percent of the federal debt, making it the largest single holder of US debt. The government owes almost twice as much to Social Security as it does to China and Hong Kong. Why aren't the opponents worried about paying back Social Security -- why aren't they talking about repaying this debt to the American people? According to the U.S. Treasury Department's "Monthly Statement of the Public Debt of the United States" (9.30.10), the total debt was $13.562 trillion and was held as follows: US Holders of Debt 42.1 % -- US Individuals and Institutions 17.9 % -- Social Security Trust Fund 6.0 % -- US Civil Service Retirement Fund 2.1 % -- US Military Retirement Fund Foreign Holders of Debt 11.7 % -- Oil Exporting Countries 9.5 % -- China and Hong Kong 6.3 % -- Japan 1.4 % -- United Kingdom 1.3 % -- Brazil 1.6 % -- All other foreign countries</Msg><Username>vinscoot2000</Username><Timestamp>1362941898158</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-10 14:58:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362942209971-57</Id><Title>The Fed’s approval on these banks’</Title><Msg>Banks Triumph Over Stress Test: Bank of America Corp (BAC), Citigroup Inc.

Actually, this confirms the ability of U.S. banking giants to survive under a tremendously difficult economic scenario. Among 18 bank holding companies which submitted their capital plan to the Fed in Jan 2013, the auto lender, Ally Financial, majority-owned by U.S. taxpayers, failed to meet the minimum requirement of 5% Tier 1 common capital ratio. With 1.5% capital ratio, Ally remains unstable, struggling with troubled mortgages and other distressed businesses. However, the remaining 17 banks that have capital ratio above 5% now have the privilege to alter their capital plans within 48 hours from the time of this result release. The Fed’s approval on these banks’ capital plans is expected on Mar 14.</Msg><Username>cmi_or_die</Username><Timestamp>1362942209971</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-10 15:03:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362942914323-58</Id><Title>Can someone remind me...</Title><Msg>How much did Buffet lend BAC, during the crisis a few yeas back.

The following story of Keith And Janet Ritter, who have lived in their Fort Washington, MD $1.29MM, 4,900 square foot McMansion for 5 years (which they purchase with no money down) without ever making a single mortgage payment, and who are not even close to being evicted, may explain much about the way US society currently operates, and why other perfectly responsible and hard-working taxpayers (who do have to pay for their mortgage) continue to fund tens of billions in Fannie and Freddie losses who are first on the hook to absorb the implicit losses by allowing families such as the Ritters to live in perpetuity without paying, and the banks to keep said mortgage on the books at par without any impairments.</Msg><Username>jam9011</Username><Timestamp>1362950844737</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-10 17:27:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362951040311-75</Id><Topic><Title>Can I Default on a BAC Mortgage and Say I Just Forgot?</Title><Username>niles.brinkley</Username><Timestamp>1362950747756</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-10 17:25:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Monday will be up 15%.</Msg><Username>cmi_or_die</Username><Timestamp>1362951040311</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-10 17:30:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362951041818-76</Id><Topic><Title>Can I Default on a BAC Mortgage and Say I Just Forgot?</Title><Username>niles.brinkley</Username><Timestamp>1362950747756</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-10 17:25:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Monday will be up 15%.</Msg><Username>cmi_or_die</Username><Timestamp>1362951041818</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-10 17:30:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362951525560-77</Id><Title>Markets look good here - Opens at $12.29 tomorrow-$$$$$$$$$$</Title><Msg>We should see strong buying on this dip.........................................</Msg><Username>messed_up_2_long</Username><Timestamp>1362951525560</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-10 17:38:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362951836226-78</Id><Title>markets look good here but</Title><Msg>BAC puts look better.

Initial unemployment claims last week dropped to 340,000, a five-year low, down from 347,000 the week before, and better than analyst estimates of 350,000. Continuing claims were also near a five-year low, at 3.094 million. Data on the international trade balance and productivity were roughly in line with expectations. The Federal Reserve also released the results of its stress tests on the nation's largest banks, and said that in the aggregate, the 18 banks hold fewer bad loans than they did a year ago, and are stronger than they've been at any time since the financial crisis. Ally Financial, the former financial wing of General Motors, was the poorest performer. Next week, the Fed will decide if it will approve the banks' plans to return capital to shareholders via share buybacks and dividends. Not surprisingly, Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) reacted well in the run-up to the Fed report, which was released after hours, as it gained 2.9% on the day. The results showed B of A would lose $44 billion, or 2.3% of its total assets, over the next nine quarters under the Fed's worst scenario, which includes the unemployment rate jumping to 12%, and the Dow getting cut in half. According to the test, the bank is capitalized well enough to survive such a scenario. Shares were down 0.6% after hours. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) was also a strong performer on the day, gaining 1.2%. The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) shares also jumped 2.5%, as Ray Conner, the CEO of the manufacturer's commercial airplanes division, said that a solution to the battery fires should come "in weeks, not months." Other reports today showed that the company had considered the risk of a battery fire nearly impossible during the 787's design and production phase. Oddly, shares of the aerospace-maker reached a 52-week high, even as delays in delivery and possible blowback airlines, including one that recently sued The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), could hurt profits.

It would not surprise me if congress tries to have a substantial age increase in SS. Along with cutting off people with incomes exceeding a certain limit. These options have been mentioned as a way to fix SS. Which unless the economy takes off &amp; couples start having sextuplets every birthing is looking more like reality.</Msg><Username>gregory03.alan</Username><Timestamp>1362970927779</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-10 23:02:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362971805357-109</Id><Title>Futures getting greener, BAC is up in Japan!!</Title><Msg>Futures getting greener, BAC is up in Japan!! $12.40 at the open.</Msg><Username>ivaderperswader</Username><Timestamp>1362971805357</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-10 23:16:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362972793280-110</Id><Title>fresh round of share buybacks or increased dividends.</Title><Msg>The tale of the tickers But before we get to the hows and whys of B of A's big week, let's take a quick look at where its peers and the market overall are shaking out for the week: Up by a massive 8.71%, Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) has had an even better week than B of A. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) looks set to finish up just a little more than two percentage points, at 2.29%. Wells Fargo &amp; Co (NYSE:WFC) is up almost three points, currently at 2.78%. All three major indices are in the green, as well: The S&amp;P 500 is up 2.23%. The Dow is up 2.32%. And the Nasdaq is up 2.48%. Fingers more than crossed for buybacks and dividends We have two separate happenings playing into B of A's big performance this week. First, we're in a bull moment right now overall. The Dow hit a new all-time high this week. Investor confidence is obviously strong, and when investors see other investors jumping into the market, they want to follow suit. As indices drive higher, more investors plunk their money down. And as more investors plunk their money down, indices are driven higher, which draw more investors in. Energy -- whether positive or negative -- attracts like energy. The second big happening relates to Federal Reserve stress test results. Bank investors have been on collective pins and needles waiting to see how their banks will perform, and whether or not said banks will engage in a fresh round of share buybacks or increased dividends.</Msg><Username>johnmarch13</Username><Timestamp>1362972793280</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-10 23:33:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362973821417-111</Id><Title>the trust fund was taken by the 1986 demo congress under tip o'n</Title><Msg>always the repubs dems would die for you to save ss you must be watching msnbc</Msg><Username>willie140140</Username><Timestamp>1362973821417</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-10 23:50:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
