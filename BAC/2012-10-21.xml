Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans were killed in the attack, which has become a political hot potato in the presidential campaign with questions over when the Obama administration called the attack an act of terrorism. "Right now, there isn't any intelligence that the attackers pre-planned their assault days or weeks in advance," said a U.S. intelligence official. "The bulk of available information supports the early #$%$ment that the attackers launched their assault opportunistically after they learned about the violence at the U.S. Embassy in Cairo." But the official added that "no one is ruling out that some of the attackers may have aspired to attack the U.S. in Benghazi." Republican lawmakers have seized on U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Susan Rice's comments on Sunday talk shows days on September 16 attributing the deadly Benghazi attack to spontaneous protests against an anti-Muslim film made in the U.S. that had been posted on the Internet. As more information emerged they pointed to the use of mortars and RPG's in the attack as indicating it was not a spontaneous protest as the Obama administration had claimed, but an act of terrorism. Rice's comments were based on talking points she had been provided by the intelligence community. The intelligence official said those talking points were written for members of Congress and senior U.S. officials so they "could say something preliminary about the attacks." The official said they reflected "the early indications of extremist involvement in a direct assault" and that "it wasn't until after the points were used in public that people reconciled contradictory information and #$%$ed there probably wasn't a protest around the time of the attack." On September 28 a spokesman for the Director of National Intelligence's office issued a press release revising the initial #$%$ment that the attack on "began spontaneously following protests earlier that day at our embassy in Cairo." The spokesman said new information indicated it "was a deliberate and organized terrorist attack carried out by extremists." The DNI said it remained unclear if "if any group or person exercised overall command and control of the attack, and if extremist group leaders directed their members to participate. However, we do #$%$ that some of those involved were linked to groups affiliated with, or sympathetic to al-Qaeda." The current #$%$ment is the latest shift in a narrative that has become politicized on Capitol Hill and the presidential campaign. At a hearing before the House Oversight House and Government Reform Committee last week, State Department officials said there had been no protests outside the consulate compound at least an hour before the attack. The official said the #$%$ment evolved once again as "it was clear from the outset that a group of people gathered that evening." He added, "A key question early on was whether extremists took over a crowd or if the guys who showed up were all militants. It took time-until that next week-to sort through varied and sometimes conflicting accounts to understand the group's overall composition."</Msg><Username>j.farragut</Username><Timestamp>1350795900939</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-21 01:05:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350795950662-18</Id><Topic><Title>Liar "suckA*S*S*" is too stupid to check news updates.</Title><Username>j.farragut</Username><Timestamp>1350794272811</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-21 00:37:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>bump it</Msg><Username>j.farragut</Username><Timestamp>1350795950662</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-21 01:05:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350795970734-19</Id><Topic><Title>My empty chair isn't so empty.

But with each submarine costing more than $2 billion, there is skepticism about how to pay for them, even from Representative Joe Courtney, a Connecticut Democrat who in 2007 successfully pushed to have the Navy build two submarines a year instead of one and has been known ever since as “Two Subs Joe.” “You can definitely make a case” to build three submarines a year, said Mr. Courtney, whose district is home to the Naval Submarine Base New London and to General Dynamics Electric Boat, both in Groton.

All told, it has sunk more than 1,200 wells into the Haynesville, a gas-rich vein of dense rock that straddles Louisiana and Texas. Fed by a gold-rush mentality and easy money from Wall Street, Chesapeake and its competitors have done the same in other shale fields from Oklahoma to Pennsylvania. For most of the country, the result has been cheaper energy. The nation is awash in so much natural gas that electric utilities, which burn the fuel in many generating plants, have curbed rate increases and switched more capacity to gas from coal, a dirtier fossil fuel. Companies and municipalities are deploying thousands of new gas-powered trucks and buses, curbing noxious diesel fumes and reducing the nation’s reliance on imported oil. And companies like fertilizer and chemical makers, which use gas as a raw material, are suddenly finding that the United States is an attractive place to put new factories, compared with, say, Asia, where gas is four times the price. Dow Chemical, which uses natural gas as a material for producing plastics, has assembled a list of 91 new manufacturing projects, representing $70 billion in potential investment and up to three million jobs, that various companies have proposed or begun because of cheap gas.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1350819763305</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-21 07:42:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350820317120-30</Id><Topic><Title>Hey What is Obama's Plan for the next 4yrs???

In the 30's, and 40's I was brought up in deep poverty, but we had something that barely exists today. 1.I can't remember one family in our neighborhood that didn't have a mother, and a father, 2.Every one of our parents taught us to respect our teachers. Whether they were wrong or right, we'd better not come home and tell our parents that the teacher was at fault for any trouble we caused. We'd receive double punishment. One at school, and one when we got back home. 3.Learning was first, and everything else was less important. 4.We had one Principal and no stupid psychologists, or social workers to tell our parents about the "root causes" of our bad behavior. We were to behave, and that is all there was to it. 5.The police were not our friends, but someone to be feared if we broke the law. 6.Yes, there are jokes about how if a girl got pregnant she was sent to an uncle or some other made up story. I don't ever remember a girl becoming pregnant, and if they did, we certainly would have known about it Today it is so prevalent, that they have nurseries within schools. There is no shame to becoming pregnant out of wedlock. Hollywood stars took care of that. It is one of the main causes of poverty. 7.Law suits were almost unheard of. Today we sue over anything.You might remember the woman who sued and won over spilling a hot cup of coffee in her lap after leaving McDonald's. I can go on and on, but if society doesn't go back to some sort of positive cultural rules, look for nothing to work in educating our citizens.</Msg><Username>bejupete</Username><Timestamp>1350823931930</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-21 08:52:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350824105413-44</Id><Topic><Title>BAC has had the highest trading volume for quite some time, so</Title><Username>joannab3</Username><Timestamp>1350822567392</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-21 08:29:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Because volume is needed for institutions and large holders to get out without changing the stock price.</Msg><Username>fizora1</Username><Timestamp>1350824105413</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-21 08:55:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350825057201-45</Id><Topic><Title>Benghazi: “They Stood and They Watched and Our People Died”</Title><Username>whitest_white</Username><Timestamp>1350823892322</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-21 08:51:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>PACIFIST SUCK AND INNOCENT PEOPLE DIE</Msg><Username>bury_obama</Username><Timestamp>1350825057201</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-21 09:10:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350825067032-46</Id><Topic><Title>Benghazi: “They Stood and They Watched and Our People Died”</Title><Username>whitest_white</Username><Timestamp>1350823892322</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-21 08:51:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama is Guilty of High Treason</Msg><Username>obama_sucksass</Username><Timestamp>1350825067032</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-21 09:11:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350825099712-47</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Reveals the Attack Lasted for 8 hours but Obama did NOTHING</Title><Username>jackcorso49</Username><Timestamp>1350823539495</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-21 08:45:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama is Guilty of High Treason</Msg><Username>obama_sucksass</Username><Timestamp>1350825099712</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-21 09:11:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350825439954-48</Id><Topic><Title>On November 6 remember Rahm Emanuel's famous quote that started all of the problems with Congress</Title><Username>capapp1</Username><Timestamp>1350795162490</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-21 00:52:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That's what happened, it's a fact.

That is why BAC cracked 9 and stayed there. The 3qrt were not great but BAC is resolving issues and with the fed both buying mortgages and keeping ( or lowering) the rate for the next year BAC will be able to do alot of loans ( that means profit). The real negative is the hyper low interest rates their interest margins are very squezzed. I see BAC crossing 10.00 before end of year and lots of strength in the stock.. Some place between 10-13.00 a share in 2013. That is 30% higher then current price. Big buyers look for 20-25% anual increases and BAC has it. The other issue that runs this to 14.00 is if they increase the div from .01 to .02 per QRT. If they went as high as .04 cents per QRT we would see 15 plus but I just dont see the Fed approving that much of an increase for BAC</Msg><Username>tax1099nc</Username><Timestamp>1350828208453</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-21 10:03:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350828878619-55</Id><Topic><Title>Intel Reveals the Attack Lasted for 8 hours but Obama did NOTHING</Title><Username>jackcorso49</Username><Timestamp>1350823539495</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-21 08:45:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wouldn't it been revealing to be a fly on the wall discovering who in the Obama campaign thought of politics first and American Lives second?

(See tables.) A main reason for the low average for women was that 60% of the lowest-paid full-time staff in 2003 – those earning $25,000 a year or less — were female. By the last year of Mr. Romney’s tenure as governor, 2006, four of the 10 highest-paid staffers were women, and 82% of the lowest-paid full-time staff were, the data show.

The difference is Bush managed the crisis and he handled the job. Obama hasn't. BTW, the only war we are not able to win is the one the Democrats were in favor of. Afghanistan! Another dose of reality, the Clinton surplus the liberals brag about came from that improperly managed tech bubble, that was allowed to careen out control. Combined with off the books borrowing from Social Security, and the neglect and failure to make appropriate expenditures to counter the increasing incidents of terror perpetrated by Al-Qaeda around the world. In other words, it never really existed except on paper. And, how do you have a surplus while you are still running up the National Debt as Clinton was? Bush, upon entering office, immediately called for investigations into Fannie and Freddie that were held up in committee or filibustered at very turn by Democrats and a handful RINOs. Bush continued to call for and urge congress to investigate these GSE’s throughout his entire presidency. No action was taken. Those investigations had the potential to expose the whole mortgage back security scam before it became critical. Thank Barney Frank, Barack Obama and Chris Dodd for leading the opposition to those requested investigations. Bush never had a super majority in congress as Obama was privileged to have for two years, and wasted on the ideological legislation of Obamacare, rather than on fixing the economy. While Obama sat on his hands waiting for Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi to push though his health care nightmare, the economy continued to fall deeper and deeper into despair. Spending reeled out of control with government sinking it’s tentacles deep into the private sector arena with business choking regulations and bailouts for campaign donors of Obama. Had Obama put aside his ideological nonsense and focused on a private sector based recovery plan we would not still be in this dire recession. This is Obama's mess, in all this time as president he and his party still refuse to take responsibility, and he continues to blame everything under the sun but himself. Yet Democrats blame Bush for everything that transpired in his first nine months. Double standard idiocy! Obama is no leader! Obama is without one original cogent idea! Obama has damage hundreds of thousands of families beyond repair. He's just a sniveling whiner! And now he wants to sue the banks! What a feeble ideologically blinded mind this president has! The fact that the Clinton staff vandalized the White House and government computers and offices, and dumped and scrambled files, before leaving tells you the juvenile mind set of that administration. And Bill Clinton used the full power of the oval office and the presidency to pressure a young fat intern into being his human humidor at the expense of the entire country. A despicable self-absorbed old pervert by any measure. I have no respect for this man nor anyone who does.</Msg><Username>carburetorkid</Username><Timestamp>1350850374911</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-21 16:12:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350850651076-131</Id><Topic><Title>AMERICA CAN THANK IT'S LUCKY STARS THAT REPUBLICANS CAN SVAE THE COUNTRY</Title><Username>whitest_white</Username><Timestamp>1350753632622</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-20 13:20:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You can reject the gop...but you can't reject the cashier at the pump or the grocery line...vote the way you want..i'm a farmer i can live like an amishman..i don't need anyone to live...ilmfao</Msg><Username>milesed18</Username><Timestamp>1350850651076</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-21 16:17:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350850799055-132</Id><Topic><Title>REPUBLICANS SACRIFIDED 4500 AMERICANS FOR POLITICAN REASONS AND LIED ABOUT WMD</Title><Username>dextergestapo</Username><Timestamp>1350776556769</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-20 19:42:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Bump!</Msg><Username>giovannijay</Username><Timestamp>1350850799055</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-21 16:19:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350851293683-133</Id><Title>LETS TALK ABOUT THE MARKET...I'M THE FIRST TO ADMIT ROMNEY ISN'T GOING TO WIN..LETS TALK ABOUT THE MONEY LEAVING THE MARKET IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS..</Title><Msg>The democrats won...but goldman sach is taking this market down the next few weeks,,,200 points a day..everyone is going to get a hair cut when obama takes us over the fisial cliff..and believe me he will...</Msg><Username>milesed18</Username><Timestamp>1350851293683</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-21 16:28:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350851789903-134</Id><Title>Super Rich give Huge Amounts to Obama and Democrats</Title><Msg>WASHINGTON -- The top three Democratic super PACs are closing strong with a collective take of $31 million in September. The big fundraising haul was thanks to mega-donors coming through with $1 million checks, according to reports filed with the Federal Election Commission on Friday and Saturday. In a shift from previous months, the three super PACs raised more than their Republican counterparts. Priorities USA Action, Majority PAC and House Majority PAC's haul outpaced the $28.5 million raised by the top three spending Republican groups, Restore Our Future, American Crossroads and Club for Growth Action. Leading the way is Priorities USA Action, a group backing President Barack Obama and run by former White House aide Bill Burton, which raised $15.2 million in September, the most of any super PAC that month and slightly ahead of the $14.8 million raised by the Mitt Romney-allied Restore Our Future. House Majority PAC, a pro-Democratic group that hopes to flip the House of Representatives to Democratic control, raised $5.8 million in September, far surpassing the less than $2 million raised in the past three months by Congressional Leadership Fund and YG Action Fund, the two super PACs connected to the House Republican leadership. House Majority PAC has targeted more than 30 races this fall in hopes of cutting into the Republican majority. While Majority PAC, a Democratic group that's focused on the Senate, does not have a direct Republican counterpart, its $10.4 million was the fourth highest amount raised by any super PAC in September. The group has spent big in recent months to protect Democratic seats in North Dakota, Virginia, Ohio, Wisconsin and Montana while playing offense in Indiana and Arizona. The group announced a big haul of $9.7 million for the first two weeks of October, showing that its strong fundraising streak is continuing. Nearly all of the money raised by the three super PACs came from donors cutting six-figure checks. In many cases the groups shared the same donors. Both media entrepreneur Fred Eychaner and James Simons, the founder of the hedge fund Renaissance Technologies, gave huge amounts to all three groups in September. Simons gave $1.5 million each to Priorities USA Action and Majority PAC and $500,000 to House Majority PAC. Eychaner gave $2 million to Priorities USA Action and $1 million each to House Majority PAC and Majority PAC. The United Auto Workers, meanwhile, made its first big foray into super PAC giving in September, with a $1 million contribution to Priorities USA Action, $700,000 to Majority PAC and $250,000 to House Majority PAC.</Msg><Username>calm_reason</Username><Timestamp>1350851789903</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-21 16:36:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350852169891-135</Id><Title>ARCH COAL $7.91 DOWN $0.44 JUST OFF A 52 WEEK LOW...ALCOA 9.91 DOWN $0.20 AND A 205 DROP IN THE DOW..DOWN 1.66%</Title><Msg>It's your 401k me friend...now the futures are calling for another 224 points drop tomorrow???</Msg><Username>milesed18</Username><Timestamp>1350852169891</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-21 16:42:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350852266255-136</Id><Title>Why should women get paid as much as men?</Title><Msg>Women are not as smart as men.

Bain didn't build that new factory -- the Chinese Government Did October 20, 2012 | Mitt romney has made Obama's out-of-context “you didn't build that” quote a central theme of his campaign. It's ironic, as Mitt Romney is going to profit just before the election when Bain-owned Sensata Technologies moves 170 high-tech jobs from Freeport, Illinois, to a plant in China built for the firm by the Chinese government. Sensata enjoyed record revenues last year – this isn't about making the “hard choices” necessary to save a failing enterprise. The workers in Freeport have been working 24 hours a day, in three shifts. They make $14-17 per hour, with benefits. According to a report by the Institute for Global Labour and Human Rights, one of Bain's first actions after buying Sensata was to set up “12 Sensata/Bain capital funds 'organized under the laws of the Cayman Islands' so as to avoid paying taxes.” They'll get a small tax break for relocating the plant – the one Mitt Romney insisted did not exist during the first debate – and then use those offshore funds to defer taxes on some of the income the company generates. American tax-payers, on the other hand, have paid $780,000 to retrain some of Sensata's laid off workers in Illinois, according to the New York Times . One would be hard pressed to come up with a clearer example of capturing private gains while socializing the costs. Mitt Romney is not directly involved in Bain Capital, but he did build its business model. In 1998, when he was actively running Bain, he personally visited the Global-Tech Appliances plant in Dongguan, China. He witnessed, personally, the horrific conditions the plant's workers were toiling in for .24 cents an hour, and didn't hesitate to invest millions in the firm." -Alternet dot org. "Romney's Bain Capital Is Sending a Bunch of High-Tech Jobs to China on the Day Before the Election. The story of Sensata Technologies is about the hollowing out of America's economy by a rapacious 1 percent. October 16, 2012 | On the day before an election that's supposed to hinge on jobs, taxes and the middle class, Bain Capital, the company Mitt Romney founded, will close the doors of a factory in Freeport, Illinois, and ship 170 good, high-tech jobs to China. The employees of Sensata Technologies were forced to train their Chinese replacements, and the American flag that long flew over the factory was reportedly removed while the Chinese engineers were visiting the site. A group of workers have set up camp across from the factory -- calling it “Bainport” -- and some supporters have tried to block the trucks hauling equipment out of the plant. According to Dave Johnson , there have been several arrests. Sensata workers have asked to meet with Mitt Romney and hoped to enlist his help keeping their jobs in the United States, but he has refused, instead remaining on the campaign trail where he speaks often about “getting tough” with China. The most important part of the story is that Sensata Technologies is profitable operating in Illinois. Net income last year was $355 million, up 16 percent from 2010. The company reported total revenues of $1.8 billion in 2011, up almost 19 percent from the year before. According to a company financial statement , “both 2011 net revenue and adjusted net income represent record levels for the company.” So this has nothing to do with “making hard choices” in the process of turning around a failing business, which is how the Romney campaign describes Bain's corporate raiding. Bain's partners are looking for a modest boost in profits by locating the plant closer to the booming Asian automotive market (Sensata makes high-tech automotive parts). They'll get a small tax break for relocating the plant – the one Mitt Romney insisted did not exist during the first debate – and possibly defer taxes on some of the income the company generates. It takes both capital and labor to make a successful business like Sensata Technologies. In order to make a few more bucks, 170 of the people who helped make the company thrive will be cast aside like so much trash. The layoffs will surely have a ripple-effect in Freeport – a town of 25,000 with a declining population and a poverty rate well above the national average. The move is the epitome of corporate America's lack of patriotism – it's capital unmoored from any sense of responsibility for the people that make the profits or the communities where they live. The city passed a resolution Monday asking Romney to intervene. But the Sensata story has, so far, had little impact on the presidential race, mostly because Mitt Romney has no direct involvement in the operations of the company he established (despite continuing to make millions as a “passive retired partner”). But this is reading the story of Bain Capital too narrowly. Mitt Romney is directly responsible for its business model. As Tom Gaulrapp -- a lifelong resident of Freeport and 33-year employee of Sensata – told the Huffington Post's Amanda Terkel, “They're still using his business model. He's the one who taught them how to do this. These guys were put there by him. So you can say he doesn't run the day-to-day operations, but he's still at blame for the way they do business." Mitt Romney started the firm, and built it up on a strategy of buying firms with little money down, loading them with debt, raiding their pension funds and breaking their unions and then “harvesting them” – in his words – for a profit. Romney is the only person to ever serve as Bain's CEO – since his departure, the firm has been run by a managing committee. The story is bigger than Sensata, and bigger than Bain. The issue is the turn America's corporate culture has taken, and what the consequences of its model are for our economy and, indeed, our society. And it is Mitt Romney's embrace of that model – ravage capitalism that is loyal to no nation-state and blind to every human virtue but profit – that should be disqualifying. In the New York Times , Chrystia Freeland, author of “Plutocrats: The Rise of the New Global Super-Rich and the Fall of Everyone Else,” wrote about the historical tendency of elites to self-destruct by extracting wealth from the broader community to such a degree that the society becomes dysfunctional and mired by social problems. She recalls how the Venetians became the most prosperous society in the world during the 14th century by opening their economy to a broad swath of the population. Then, at the height of its golden age, “the upper class acted to lock in its privileges, putting a formal stop to social mobility with the publication of the Libro d’Oro, or Book of Gold, an official register of the nobility. If you weren’t on it, you couldn’t join the ruling oligarchy.” She then notes parallels to the United States, which featured one of the most egalitarian economies through much of the last century, but is now plagued by rising inequality and decreasing economic mobility. She writes: The 1 percent cannot evade its share of responsibility for the growing gulf in American society. Economic forces may be behind the rising inequality, but as Peter R. Orszag, President Obama’s former budget chief, told me, public policy has exacerbated rather than mitigated these trends. Even as the winner-take-all economy has enriched those at the very top, their tax burden has lightened. Tolerance for high executive compensation has increased, even as the legal powers of unions have been weakened and an intellectual case against them has been relentlessly advanced by plutocrat-financed think tanks. In the 1950s, the marginal income tax rate for those at the top of the distribution soared above 90 percent, a figure that today makes even Democrats flinch. Meanwhile, of the 400 richest taxpayers in 2009, 6 paid no federal income tax at all, and 27 paid 10 percent or less. None paid more than 35 percent... Educational attainment, which created the American middle class, is no longer rising. The super-elite lavishes unlimited resources on its children, while public schools are starved of funding. This is the new [Venice]. An elite education is increasingly available only to those already at the top. Bill Clinton and Barack Obama enrolled their daughters in an exclusive private school; I’ve done the same with mine. Much of this is the result of the 30-year assault on organized labor. It's worth noting that Sensata Technologies is a non-union shop, which is a big reason the firm can move profitable operations abroad without much resistance. Employment, in raw jobs numbers, should not be the defining issue of this election viewed in isolation. We also need to consider what kinds of jobs are being created. A recent study conducted by the National Employment Law Project (NELP) found that while only 21 percent of the jobs lost during the recession were low-paying (with median hourly wages from $7.69 to $13.83), a majority of those created during the recovery – 58 percent – have come with such low wages. These trends are not Mitt Romney's doing, but he is the walking, talking personification of what's been happening in the American economy. Mitt Romney was an innovator in offshoring. He and his family will make a few more dollars as a result of shipping those jobs to China, at the expense of the workers who “built that” in the first place. That's why the story of Sensata Technologies should have an impact in this race. -Endquote. -Alternet dot org</Msg><Username>sunnsailor</Username><Timestamp>1350863778524</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-21 19:56:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350864133940-197</Id><Topic><Title>IAM BETTER OFF NOW THAT 4 YEARS AGO UNDER OBAMA DOW IS UP 7500 POINTS MY IRA UP 150%</Title><Username>chavesagain</Username><Timestamp>1350313911941</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 11:11:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Too bad most Republicans have been buying BAC and C for the past 4 years and missed the huge gains by the educated.

Air Fuel Synthesis in Stockton-on-Tees has produced five litres of petrol since August when it switched on a small refinery that manufactures gasoline from carbon dioxide and water vapour. The company hopes that within two years it will build a larger, commercial-scale plant capable of producing a ton of petrol a day. It also plans to produce green aviation fuel to make airline travel more carbon-neutral. Tim Fox, head of energy and the environment at the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in London, said: "It sounds too good to be true, but it is true. They are doing it and I've been up there myself and seen it. The innovation is that they have made it happen as a process. It's a small pilot plant capturing air and extracting CO2 from it based on well known principles. It uses well-known and well-established components but what is exciting is that they have put the whole thing together and shown that it can work." Although the process is still in the early developmental stages and needs to take electricity from the national grid to work, the company believes it will eventually be possible to use power from renewable sources such as wind farms or tidal barrages. "We've taken carbon dioxide from air and hydrogen from water and turned these elements into petrol," said Peter Harrison, the company's chief executive, who revealed the breakthrough at a conference at the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in London. "There's nobody else doing it in this country or indeed overseas as far as we know. It looks and smells like petrol but it's a much cleaner and clearer product than petrol derived from fossil oil," Mr Harrison told The Independent. "We don't have any of the additives and nasty bits found in conventional petrol, and yet our fuel can be used in existing engines," he said. "It means that people could go on to a garage forecourt and put our product into their car without having to install batteries or adapt the vehicle for fuel cells or having hydrogen tanks fitted. It means that the existing infrastructure for transport can be used," Mr Harrison said. Being able to capture carbon dioxide from the air, and effectively remove the principal industrial greenhouse gas resulting from the burning of fossil fuels such as oil and coal, has been the holy grail of the emerging green economy. Using the extracted carbon dioxide to make petrol that can be stored, transported and used as fuel for existing engines takes the idea one step further. It could transform the environmental and economic landscape of Britain, Mr Harrison explained. "We are converting renewable electricity into a more versatile, useable and storable form of energy, namely liquid transport fuels. We think that by the end of 2014, provided we can get the funding going, we can be producing petrol using renewable energy and doing it on a commercial basis," he said. "We ought to be aiming for a refinery-scale operation within the next 15 years. The issue is making sure the UK is in a good place to be able to set up and establish all the manufacturing processes that this technology requires. You have the potential to change the economics of a country if you can make your own fuel," he said. The initial plan is to produce petrol that can be blended with conventional fuel, which would suit the high-performance fuels needed in motor sports. The technology is also ideal for remote communities that have abundant sources of renewable electricity, such solar energy, wind turbines or wave energy, but little in the way of storing it, Mr Harrison said. "We're talking to a number of island communities around the world and other niche markets to help solve their energy problems. "You're in a market place where the only way is up for the price of fossil oil and at some point there will be a crossover where our fuel becomes cheaper," he said. Although the prototype system is designed to extract carbon dioxide from the air, this part of the process is still too inefficient to allow a commercial-scale operation. The company can and has used carbon dioxide extracted from air to make petrol, but it is also using industrial sources of carbon dioxide until it is able to improve the performance of "carbon capture". Other companies are working on ways of improving the technology of carbon capture, which is considered far too costly to be commercially viable as it costs up to £400 for capturing one ton of carbon dioxide. However, Professor Klaus Lackner of Columbia University in New York said that the high costs of any new technology always fall dramatically. "I bought my first CD in the 1980s and it cost $20 but now you can make one for less than 10 cents. The cost of a light bulb has fallen 7,000-fold during the past century," Professor Lackner said.</Msg><Username>eatmayercooch</Username><Timestamp>1350870124521</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-21 21:42:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350870392986-238</Id><Topic><Title>Libyan Embassy officials asked numerous times for extra security prior to our</Title><Username>stockguru7</Username><Timestamp>1349298610350</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 17:10:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>if the young lady killed was hillary's or obummer's daughter then the great high exalted ruler would have declared war and even contemplared canceling his vegas campaign fundraising.

"The White House's new health-care proposal promises the "largest middle class tax cut for health care in history," which is a creative way of describing a vast taxpayer-subsidized insurance entitlement. Naturally, the fine print goes on to describe one of the largest tax increases for health care in history, too. This new ObamaCare bargain would for the first time apply the 2.9% Medicare payroll tax to "interest, dividends, annuities, royalties and rents," so-called passive income that we are told includes capital gains, though the latter wasn't explicitly mentioned in the proposal. This antigrowth investment tax would apply to singles earning more than $200,000 and joint filers over $250,000 and comes on top of the Senate's 0.9-percentage-point increase in the payroll tax, which would bring the combined employee-employer share to 3.8%. The rate hike on investment income would presumably take effect at the same time the 2001 and 2003 Bush tax cuts are due to expire next year, bringing the top rate to 22.9% as the current top capital gains rate would also rise to 20% from 15%. That's a 52% jump, and the last time investors were slammed with anything comparable was 1986 when the capital gains rate bounced to 28% from 20%—or a 40% increase—as part of the Reagan tax reform that reduced income tax rates. [obama] In part this is a sneaky way of waging the House's war on "the rich" by other means while appearing to compromise. Speaker Nancy Pelosi's 5.4-percentage-point "surcharge" on modified adjusted gross income above $1 million—which also includes capital gains—was supposedly too extreme for the Senate, but the White House is trying to smuggle in its 2.9-percentage-point cousin. Of course, $250,000 is a lot lower income threshold than $1 million, and the rate can always be inched up later once the tax is already in place. The House surcharge is certainly destructive but it is at least above-board. The White House levy muddies up both the tax code and Medicare financing. The Medicare payroll levy was designed as a social insurance program with some connection, however attenuated, between taxes paid and benefits received. When Medicare passed in 1965 it was modelled after Social Security and the tax was supposed to be equivalent to a "premium" for guaranteed health-care insurance for seniors; everyone "contributed" at the same rate. Until 1993, the payroll tax was assessed only on the first $135,000 of wages, until the Clinton Administration and the Democratic Congress lifted the Medicare cap entirely.
