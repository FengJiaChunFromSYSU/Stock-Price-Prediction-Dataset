But there's growing evidence that maggots not only help remove necrotic flesh but that their can also reduce inflammation by suppressing the immune system. "This research advances our understanding of how and why maggot therapy helps wounds heal faster," Ronald Sherman, a pioneering maggot researcher and chair of the BioTherapeutics, Education and Research Foundation, told ScienceNOW. Maggot therapy works essentially by having the larvae consume infected and necrotic flesh, while largely ignoring healthy tissue. Of course, patients are discouraged from attempting the treatment on their own, as it can lead to uncontrolled maggot infestations and infections. The research was published in the latest issue of Wound Repair and Regeneration. In their work, surgical resident Gwendolyn Cazander of Leiden University Medical Center in the Netherlands and her team tested the effects of maggot secretion. They deposited the secretions into donated human blood samples and found that the samples contained lower levels of complement proteins. As ScienceNOW points out, maggots have been part of the medicinal world for centuries. For example, doctors in Napoleon's army used maggots to treat the wounds of injured soldiers. After the invention of penicillin the use of maggot therapy largely tapered off. But in 1989, the practice began making a comeback when Dr. Ronald Sherman established fly breeding facilities at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in California. But it was less than 10 years ago, in 2004, that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Maggot Debridement Therapy as a prescription treatment. Of additional interest, the researchers found that the maggot secretions were highly durable in their tests, even increasing in effectiveness after it was boiled. Any form of clinical treatment is at least several years away. Of course, there are billions and billions of maggots available for current research if you just can't wait.</Msg><Username>f.dollarhyde</Username><Timestamp>1355202402632</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 00:06:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355202693820-2</Id><Topic><Title>telez....</Title><Username>sloanl52</Username><Timestamp>1354671419906</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 20:36:59 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hey Sloan.

The hatred for our children and their future is growing and is being fueled every single day. Stay firm in your convictions. Keep loving your heritage and keep witnessing to others that there is a better way than a war torn, violent, wicked, socialist, new world order. That way is the Christian way - law and order - love of family - love of nation. These are the principles of western Christian civilization. There is a war to destroy these things.

Forty-eight of 49 economists predict the Federal Open Market Committee will purchase Treasuries to bolster an existing program to buy $40 billion in mortgage bonds each month. The panel pledged in October to continue that plan until the labor market improves "substantially." "It's going to be massive and open-ended in size," said Joseph LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. in New York and a former New York Fed economist. Chairman Ben S. Bernanke and his FOMC colleagues will press on with purchases at least through the first quarter of 2014, according to the median estimate in the Dec. 7-10 survey. They are expanding the balance sheet beyond $2.86 trillion in a bid to spur growth and lower an unemployment rate of 7.7 percent. "They view this stimulus as what's needed to sustain the economy" and reinforce improvements in industries such as autos and housing, said John Silvia, chief economist at Wells Fargo &amp; Co., the biggest U.S. home lender. The FOMC gathers today for a two-day meeting in Washington and plans to release a statement on policy tomorrow at around 12:30 p.m. That will be followed by forecasts for growth, unemployment and inflation. Bernanke is scheduled to hold a press conference at 2:15 p.m., after release of the forecasts. Operation Twist The central bank this month is scheduled to end Operation Twist, in which it swaps $45 billion of short-term Treasuries each month for longer-term government debt. That program kept the total size of the balance sheet unchanged, while new Treasury purchases would expand it. The Fed's latest round of quantitative easing will total $1.1 trillion, with about $620 billion in mortgage-backed securities and $500 billion in Treasuries, according to the median estimate in the survey. By adding Treasury purchases, policy makers "would continue to lower mortgage rates and create conditions that would be favorable for a continued recovery in the housing market," said Roberto Perli, a managing director at International Strategy &amp; Investment Group Inc. in Washington. "It would also -- if house prices go up more -- mean more households would be able to refinance their mortgage," said Perli, a former economist for the Fed's Division of Monetary Affairs. "That's just like a tax cut or a pay increase because you have more disposable income in your pocket." Housing Revival Fed purchases of mortgage bonds have helped revive the housing market by pushing down the rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage last month to a record 3.31 percent. New-home sales rose 17 percent in October compared with the prior year, while existing-home sales increased 11 percent. Home prices gained 3 percent from a year earlier in September, according to the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller 20-city home-price index. "Pent-up demand, rising home prices, low interest rates and improving customer confidence motivated buyers to return to the housing market," Douglas Yearley Jr., chief executive officer of Toll Brothers Inc., the largest U.S. luxury-home builder, said in a Dec. 4 earnings call. Homebuilder stocks have risen after a six-year slump. The Standard &amp; Poor's Supercomposite Homebuilding Index (S15HOME) of 11 homebuilders has surged 72 percent this year, compared with a 13 percent gain for the broader S&amp;P 500. Even with the recent improvement, home prices remain 29 percent below their July 2006 peak. ‘Low Side' Policy makers "do not want mortgage rates to climb much higher," said John Lonski, chief economist for Moody's Capital Markets Group in New York. "They will do their utmost to keep long-term borrowing costs on the low side." Bernanke said in a Nov. 20 speech that Fed stimulus shows no sign of fueling consumer-price increases beyond the central bank's 2 percent target. "Inflation over the next few years is likely to remain close to or a little below the committee's objective," he said in New York. The rebound in housing hasn't shown signs of enlivening the labor market. Payroll growth averaged 153,000 in 2011 and 151,000 so far in 2012. Employment climbed by 146,000 in November, the Labor Department said last week. The jobless rate fell from 7.9 percent the month before as the labor force shrank. Economists don't predict growth will take off in 2013. Gross domestic product expanded at a 2.7 percent annual pace in the third quarter, according to Commerce Department data. Economists in a separate Bloomberg survey forecast growth of 2 percent in 2013. Tax Increases Also weighing on the economic outlook are more than $600 billion of tax increases and spending cuts scheduled to take effect next year unless Congress acts. The Congressional Budget Office has said the fiscal tightening would probably push the economy into a recession next year. Treasury purchases would constitute "insurance that if there's a failure to agree between Congress and the president, the Fed is out there to prevent an even bigger downdraft," Silvia said. The FOMC will probably wait until its March 19-20 meeting before adopting thresholds on unemployment and inflation to indicate when it will consider raising the federal funds rate, according to the median estimate of surveyed economists. Forty-eight of 49 economists say the Fed won't set the thresholds tomorrow. The Fed currently says it will keep its main interest rate near zero at least through mid-2015. The Fed hasn't spelled out limits on the duration or size of its current accommodation, which was announced in September. In the first round of quantitative easing starting in 2008, the central bank bought $1.25 trillion of mortgage-backed securities, $175 billion of federal agency debt and $300 billion of Treasuries. In the second round, announced in November 2010, the Fed bought $600 billion of Treasuries. (WHEN IT CRASHES IT IS GOING TO CRASH REALLY, REALLY REALLY........

No doubt the message is lost on the Repub roaches who want and need blue-collar, working-(wo)man votes but kowtow to the business billionaires too cheap and depraved to give a living wage to the real lifeblood of this country. Instead, these sycophants hypocritically and deviously portray ALL unions - which are the ONLY organizations that stand against rapacious corporations turning citizens into disposable slaves, and are led and supported by the WORKERS themselves - as somehow more corrupt or immoral than the very businesses trying to eliminate them for only self-serving reasons. . Well, a very brief look at the news and facts would educate these 'company boys'... massive fines constantly being adjudged against these amoral business 'outfits' who gouge, arm-twist ,brow-beat and betray the very citizens they profess patriotism too. Or, as some undoubtably are, these Repub roaches blindly supporting anti-union measures are just plain stupid....if they're not getting a kickback from the company for their hysterical efforts.</Msg><Username>tinkers_curse</Username><Timestamp>1355251122327</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 13:38:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355251519864-117</Id><Title>DUMPOBAMIE: GO SPRAY YOUR LYING DIARRHEIC FILTH ON THE KKK BOARD</Title><Msg>Extremist goons like you are welcome there.</Msg><Username>d_neo_con</Username><Timestamp>1355251519864</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 13:45:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355252561154-118</Id><Topic><Title>Tea Bag lepers need to be eradicated before they spread their insidious disease</Title><Username>sammysedwat</Username><Timestamp>1345047285699</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 12:14:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's so good to see the Tea Gag movement waning away.

I think their guy was confused. First off, if Detroit is the model for a standard of living, then any Thinking Person (tm) would outlaw unions completely. When we say "right to work", we're not saying you have to get right to work (which would affect their standard of living, because they couldn't sit around and collect welfare), we're saying that you have the right to a job without paying union dues and without having the union sell exclusive-sourcing products like health insurance at 150% markups to the state. Ditching the unions will create jobs, and it will eradicate a lot of red ink.

But you were much nicer about it than I. Kudos. To add, though, when we aren't lining union pockets with unnecessarily expensive sole-source products, we have additional funds to outlay for other projects (euph., investments). Those projects could be capital, or they may be HR-specific, like additional teachers, additional cops, additional firefighters. So yeah, killing collective bargaining for benefits does in fact carry with it the spectre of creating jobs. And so what if the benefits aren't as good. Nobody in the private sector gets the benefits of these unions, but we all have to pay for them.

In many unionized sectors, anybody who's ever though to question their union superior while on the job would have to get their head examined afterward (read: MRI). Union terror does not just exist on the picket line. It exists on the factory line, in the locker room, in your bank account, and at your home. These mobster wannabes are people who were attracted to the job for money and power, and they don't take kindly to being questioned by anybody, and they don't entertain competing agendas or unsolicited suggestions, unless of course the suggestion is to increase union dues (read: welcome suggestion). If those union protesters were out there, it's because they didn't have a good excuse to take a day off (like illness or incarceration). The union bosses were taking attendance, and if you wanted your house to resemble santa's lump of coal, just try not showing up when and where you're told. Obviously, they aren't all exactly like that. In the higher professions (like pilots), it's just as likely that the members will tell the union reps to shove it if they start acting like longshoremen.</Msg><Username>flippant_1</Username><Timestamp>1355276809151</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 20:46:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355276962677-197</Id><Topic><Title>About that full service gas in NJ...</Title><Username>flippant_1</Username><Timestamp>1355266851726</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 18:00:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Jeez, man, just google it -- new jersey + gas station + jet fuel and you'll get about 50 stories from various sources.

But don't expect a corresponding drop in gas prices. 10 largest economies Merrill analysts expect U.S. oil prices to still average about $90 a barrel over the same time period. Global oil prices meanwhile, which more closely dictate the price of gasoline in the United States, are expected to remain high as growth in global oil supplies lags population growth and economic output. The drop in U.S. oil prices would likely be temporary, caused by the difficulty in moving huge amounts of new oil from places like North Dakota's Bakken shale or Texas' Eagle Ford to market. Already, all the new production has led to a glut of oil in the region. "No one expected output to grow by a million barrels per day last year," Francisco Blanche, Merrill's head of commodity research, said at a press briefing in New York. "No one." As a result, oil has been accumulating in Cushing, Okla. -- home to the convergence of several pipelines and dozens of oil storage tankers that acts as the delivery point for the most commonly quoted U.S. oil price, West Texas Intermediate. Related: U.S. closer to being major natural gas exporter The problem for U.S. drivers is that WTI crude accounts for just a small percentage of the oil used to make gasoline in the United States. And prices for other types of oil -- such as Louisiana Light Sweet, Alaskan North Slope or Nigeria's Bonny Light -- remain high. In fact, Blanche said the U.S. government may have to approve exports of WTI if it wants the oil boom in this country to continue, as $50 a barrel is below the cost of production. Merrill also predicted relatively slack economic growth in both the United States and globally in the years ahead. The bank predicts the U.S. economy will grow by 1.5% in 2013 and 2.8% in 2014. Globally, it sees 3.2% growth in 2013 before returning to a more average level of 3.9% the following year. But there is some good news for investors. Continued high prices and low yields on bonds, plus the successful resolution of the so-called fiscal cliff and an improving outlook in Europe, means money should pour into stocks. Returns could run between 9% and 16% in 2013, while the S&amp;P 500 may hit an all time high, the firm predicts. "We are unapologetically bullish for 2013 when it comes to the U.S. equity market," said Savita Subramanian, Merrill's head of U.S. equity research. Sectors the bank likes: tech, energy and industrials. Ones to avoid: telecoms and utilities.</Msg><Username>eatmayercooch</Username><Timestamp>1355286710506</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 23:31:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355287905937-208</Id><Title>Johnny Dirtbag "Movie Star" versus Charlie Sheen</Title><Msg>Sorry Charlie.
