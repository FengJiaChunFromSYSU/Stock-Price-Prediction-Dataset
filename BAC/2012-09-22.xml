I, in my bathrobe With a cat in my lap, Had shut off the TV, tired of political crap. When all of a sudden, There arose such a noise, I peered out my window, Saw Obama and his boys They had come for my wallet, They wanted my pay To hand out to others Who had not worked a day! He snatched up my money, And quick as a wink, Jumped back on his bandwagon As I gagged from the stink. He then rallied his henchmen Who were pulling his cart. I could tell they were out To tear my country apart! 'On Fannie, on Freddie, On Biden and Ayers! On Acorn, on Pelosi' He screamed at the pairs!

(Reference the Texas-American Annexation Treaty of 1848.) And realize that if Texas ever decides to leave, you can bet than many other states will follow. Goodby to the USA as we know it. Don't sit there and say this won't ever happen -- it is an honestly real possibility, given the absolute broken state of politics in the us today. We Texans love y'all, but we'll probably have to take action if Barack Obama wins the election. We'll miss you too. Here is what can happen: 1: Barack Hussein Obama is President of the United States, and Texas secedes from the Union in summer of 2013. 2: George W. Bush will become the President of the Republic of Texas . You might not think that he talks too pretty, but we haven't had another terrorist attack, and the economy was fine until the effects of the Democrats lowering the qualifications for home loans came to roost. So what does Texas have to do to survive as a Republic? 1. NASA is just south of Houston, Texas. We will control the space industry. 2. We refine over 85% of the gasoline in the United States. 3. Defense Industry--we have over 65% of it. The term "Don't mess with Texas," will take on a whole new meaning. 4. Oil - we can supply all the oil that the Republic of Texas will need for the next 300 years. What will the other states do? Gee, we don't know. Why not ask Obama? 5. Natural Gas - again we have all we need, and it's too bad about those Northern States. John Kerry and Al Gore will have to figure out a way to keep them warm.... 6. Computer Industry - we lead the nation in producing computer chips and communications equipment -small companies like Texas Instruments, Dell Computer, EDS, Raytheon, National Semiconductor, Motorola, Intel, AMD, Atmel, Applied Materials, Ball Microconductor, Dallas Semiconductor, Nortel, Alcatel, etc, etc. The list goes on and on. 7. Medical Care - We have the research centers for cancer research, the best burn centers and the top trauma units in the world, as well as other large health centers. The Houston Medical Center alone employees over 65,000 people. 8. We have enough colleges to keep us getting smarter: University ofTexas , Texas A&amp;M, Texas Tech, Texas Christian, Rice, SMU, University of Dallas , University of Houston , Baylor, UNT ( University of North Texas ), Texas Women's University, etc. Ivy grows better in the South anyway. 9. We have an intelligent and energetic work force, and it isn't restricted by a bunch of unions. Here in Texas , it's a Right to Work State and, therefore, it's every man and women for themselves. We just go out and get the job done. And if we don't like the way one company operates, we get a job somewhere else. 10. We have essential control of the paper, plastics, and insurance industries, etc. 11. In case of a foreign invasion, we have the Texas National Guard, the Texas Air National Guard, and several military bases. We don't have an Army, but since everybody down here has at least six rifles and a pile of ammo, we can raise an Army in 24 hours if we need one. If the situation really gets bad, we can always call the Department of Public Safety and ask them to send over the Texas Rangers. 12. We are totally self-sufficient in beef, poultry, hogs, and several types of grain, fruit and vegetables, and let's not forget seafood from the Gulf. Also, everybody down here knows how to cook them so that they taste good. Don't need any food. 13. Three of the ten largest cities in the United States , and twenty- three of the 100 largest cities in the United States, are located in Texas. And Texas also has more land than California, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Maryland, Rhode Island and Vermont combined. 14. Trade: Three of the ten largest ports in the United States are located in Texas. 15. We also manufacture cars down here, but we don't need to. You see, nothing rusts in Texas, so our vehicles stay beautiful and run well for decades. This just names a few of the items that will keep the Republic of Texas in good shape. There isn't a thing out there that we need and don't have. Now to the rest of the United States under President Obama: Since you won't have the refineries to get gas for your cars, only President Obama will be able to drive around in his big 5 mpg SUV. The rest of the United States will have to walk or ride bikes. You won't have any TV as the Space Center in Houston will cut off satellite communications. You won't have any natural gas to heat your homes, but since Mr. Obama has predicted global warming, you will not need the gas as long as you survive the 2000 years it will take to get enough heat from Global Warming. Signed, The People of Texas P.S. This is not a threatening letter - just a note to give you something to think about!

It took a while to parse and convert it into English, because while one can be a pre-payer of taxes, I think what you had in mind was "tax preparer". Taxes come due, but no one ever has to "due" them; one has to DO them. "Tax codes are their...." Their what? Whose what? Oh, you meant "there". Just when the hyphens and choppy syntax had me thinking you were having seizures, you threw a fit....a benifit. Then there's your rather unique interpretation of the rules for punctuation. Here's a little tip for your benefit: when you're pounding your keyboard and a dashed red line appears under a word you've written, it just might be spelled wrong. Now I understand that what YOU mean by "Gibberish" is what other people called "words spelled and used correctly, strung together in a logical sequence to concisely convey a thought, and constructed in accordance with generally accepted rules of grammar and punctuation."

Instead he waited too long wasting precious time to do the nation's important infrastructure rebuilding. While the GOP was shafting him... they also shafted America... just to keep the economy down so that their chances of grabbing power is increased by blaming Obama. The problem is we all saw that too. The OBSTRUCTIONISM prevented most likely several million direly needed jobs. The obtuse party even counted that as another reason for grabbing power. Yes, as an independent Obama indeed failed to live up to my expectations. But I regard the GOP behavior more reprehensible like all other independent decent citizens of our nation! Who does the GOP take us for? Are we blind not to SEE what the GOP did? Wasn't that a TREASONOUS behavior? So the GOP will do ANYTHING just to grab power even going against our best national interests when the nation voted for Obama as president? Should the other party do the same... I bet the GOP would be crying FOUL aloud through the media EVERYDAY exactly telling about that vile behavior of the other party? Too bad the other party is weak in marketing as the GOP is adept in EXPLOITING good slogans, lying and trickery! What's the alternative to Obama? R-Money? The man has nothing more than trying to make a FAST BUCK at any cost! Even in some cases outsourcing U.S. jobs just for bucks! Besides he says he does not give a damn about 47% of voters and lacks understanding of the variety and complexity of our national needs and priorities. How could such a man resolve our nations challenges and problems when he has nothing in his background and experience to show even an understanding to start with let alone the experience necessary! R-Money can only give from what he has... and what he has - MAKING A FAST BUCK - does not meet our nation's needs beside his lack of experience, lack of understanding and compassion. Only President Obama has it at this time.

The U.S. presidential candidate tells ABC News that American voters expect candidates to pay "only what the tax code requires." He says he hasn't calculated what percentage of his income was paid in taxes but says that he's been audited. OK, but now we are treated to his 2011 tax return, and what do you know?! In order to RAISE his tax rate to a still-low 14.1 percent, Mitt claimed only $2.25 million of his $4.021 million of charitable contributions. In other words, he paid more taxes than required. Thanks Mitt! Many of us already knew you were unqualified to be President, but it was kind of you to explain it so clearly to those who haven't yet gotten the message. BTW, don't worry about your sudden attack of altruism; it's just a tax return, and you have 3 more years to file an amendment and reclaim the deduction for the other $1.8 million of contributions.

The current line (-400 Obama, +300 Romney) is a lot worse for Romney than it was then, although I suppose you could argue that long-shots offer a chance to make more money. "Hypocrite" has an 'e' at the end of it; it means 'one who pretends to be better than he really is, or to be pious, virtuous, etc., without really being so.' Here's a classic example of that hypocrisy that also highlights your rampant puerilism: Definition: Democratagogue By mrstan4089 . 1 day 4 hours ago . Permalink A democratagogue or rabble-rouser is a political leader who appeals to the emotions, prejudices and ignorance of the poorer and less-educated classes in order to gain power. Cunning, uncouth, and unprincipled, democratagogues appeal directly to the emotions of the poor and ignorant, pursuing power with ruthless ambition, telling lies to stir up hysteria, exploiting crises to intensify popular support for their calls to immediate action and increased authority.... Hmm, sound familiar? Why, yes it does! Liar libs cornered the market on it! Teflon Obam! Fishy2Smell? Cosmo Sphincter Face? Mrs.Pizzhard? LMAO.... ah, geez, I am having too much fun needling the needle brains. Like shooting fishy in a sphincter full of wizz. C'mon, girls, let's here your best liar responses. I know it is not fair odds, 3 on 1... because you all are unarmed the battle of wits, but there are THREE of you (nyuk, nyuk). So much for attacking the message but not the messenger(s). More than a month has passed, and you're still posting the same pap you posted a month ago. Pardon me if I don't laud your efforts at recycling garbage.
