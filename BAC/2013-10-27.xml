Short range: ibid Long range: waiting for another hit Rationale: I probably have more contact with the working class than most BAC players. The equity price of a company with as large and visible a public presence as BAC is driven by sentiment (as opposed to earnings reports and press releases) a good deal more than an esoteric bio or pharma firm or a low-volume device manufacturer. This brings me to an anecdotal data point collected yesterday while pumping gas into my Lincoln at the local 3rd-world-operated Quickie Mart. It consistently has the lowest gas prices (or within a few cents of them) in my area, and its price for regular has been locked for more than a month at $3.23.9 a gallon. In terms of recent history, this is a bargain-basement sale in the boston suburbs and forever for price stability, especially in light of crude's ups and downs during this period. Used to be an 'instant up, slow down' relationship between crude prices &amp; retail gas prices, but not now. I sense strong headwinds for the big refineries, at least on the domestic end, and a nervousness about the drop in demand. Average joe and josephine are driving less than ever. I mentioned this unexpected but welcome price stability to a woman in her 50s who was gassing a weary 04 Highlander on the opposite side of the island, and she replied: "Thank God for small favors. Everything ELSE is going up, and fast." The 'official' numbers for items like housing and food appear to be stable, but even so the real income of the working class doesn't seem to be keeping up with them. Housing prices &amp; sales are still rising, but if you peek behind those numbers more than half are selling for cash. BAC knows this, and chopped its mortagage operations. Question is: how will BAC fill this hole? More high-risk gambling? ROTF even foxwood's is hurting.</Msg><Username>fish2kill</Username><Timestamp>1382877235835</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-10-27 08:33:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382878113945-16</Id><Topic><Title>BAC Promotional Idea</Title><Username>misterjer2000</Username><Timestamp>1382876497202</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-10-27 08:21:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ROTF whussamattah, tampon praise ain't floatin' your.....boat?

Medicare Benefits should be: Age 65-70=80%, Age 70-75=75%, Age 75-80=70%, Age 80-85=65%, Age 85-90=60%, Age 90-Whatever=50%, No Cancer Testing after Age 80, No Surgery after Age 85, No Machines to sustain life if Brain Dead. Medicare must be run like an insurance company, not a never ending checkbook. Nobody over 80 who does not need doctors care every day should be in a nursing home, their children should be forced to take care of them or Social Security Stops.

I have many philosophical differences but he seems bright and means well but this was not the time for a sophisticated or even manipuiative if you blieve things like fast and furious, politician to try to fix things. The brats really did need someone like ross perot, and not just for the computer help. This had been bubble after bubble trying to get around the fact that ponzi is gone and we have a perrenial trade deficiet. Instead of subsidizing the home flip, they needed to boost values of the people who consume the home with production. Now the great boasts collapse, leading to great anger and little of value. It is too early to tell how the socialized medicine/NSA program goes but with no attempt to increase supply and just insurance you better hope the ( largely gov funded ) research side creates a tricorder so the insurance people can get rich.

That was pretty much what I was getting at: two distinctly different sets of sentiment at work, and opinions expressed on this board IMHO tend to be heavily slanted ed toward the investor/trader viewpoint. Nothing wrong with that, but it's worth acknowledging that a significant number of customers and sideliners with no apparent skin in the game (the 'public', among whom reside those potential FUTURE customers) often have a different one. Another caveat to keep in mind is that as retail investor interest declines and their participation in the trade of BAC declines, so does the overall volume. And as the overall volume declines, the MM's relative influence and ability to manipulate the stock, particularly in the overseas/overnight arena, increases. When I first began tracking BAC I heard 'manipulation!' cries from small subsets of both longs AND shorts, and thought they were crazy considering that the daily volume then was over 150 million shares and BAC was ALWAYS the most actively traded stock on Wall Street. Over time, though, and with a fair amount of chart-watching, I've been convinced that it's true. I'd love to see one of the chartists here plot the relative overnight vs daytrade price movement here, and then using their respective volumes, come up with a 'power number' for each type of trad. I suspect the numbers would show at least a 2 to 1 influence for the dark pool trades, IMHO of course.</Msg><Username>fish2kill</Username><Timestamp>1382910858085</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-10-27 17:54:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1382911382750-73</Id><Title>DEVIL'S OWN BANK.

And if that trend continues, there's concern there won't be enough healthy people buying health insurance for the system to work...The newly insured in some of those states are overwhelmingly low-income people signing up for Medicaid at no cost to them. Matt Salo, executive director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors, said, "We're seeing a huge spike in terms of Medicaid enrollments." He says the numbers have surprised him and state officials. CBS News has confirmed that in Washington, of the more than 35,000 people newly enrolled, 87 percent signed up for Medicaid. In Kentucky, out of 26,000 new enrollments, 82 percent are in Medicaid. And in New York, of 37,000 enrollments, Medicaid accounts for 64 percent...Gail Wilensky, a former Medicaid director, said the numbers are causing concern in the insurance industry, which needs healthy adults to buy private insurance in large numbers for the system to work. "Either the private insurance enrollments come up somewhere around the expected amount or there's going to be a problem. ... You need a volume and you need a mix of people that are healthy as well as high users in private insurance, in order to have it be sustainable," she said.</Msg><Username>tulsaturd</Username><Timestamp>1382930406869</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-10-27 23:20:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382930492519-117</Id><Topic><Title>dumbama.sucks....sucks</Title><Username>trader4me</Username><Timestamp>1382895888489</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-10-27 13:44:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The people from Crete are Cretans.</Msg><Username>kingofvietnam</Username><Timestamp>1382930492519</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-10-27 23:21:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382930621832-118</Id><Topic><Title>Light a candle in the window.

The data center operated by Verizon's Terremark experienced a connectivity issue that caused it to shut down, affecting the federal government's already problem-plagued online marketplace Healthcare.gov and similar sites operated by 14 states and the District of Columbia, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).
