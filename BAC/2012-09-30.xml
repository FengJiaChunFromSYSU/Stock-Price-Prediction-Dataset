Tracking down your response to me asking about your military service was a pain in the neck. Believe it or not, I have a life outside of this message board and sometimes I go days without visiting it. But first thing I got back in town, I looked for your response because I am genuinely interested. I was never in the military. The draft was over by the time I was of age, and due to childhood injuries I would have been 4F anyway. Couldn't have gotten in if I wanted to. I got my respect for vets from my father. He was a service officer for the VFW from the time he got out of the military after WWII until just months before he passed. For about 50 years he helped veterans get the benefits they deserved. He was functionally illiterate but he studied and attended classes on the paperwork and processes of the VA so he could help vets. I have no idea how many. Probably thousands. His office was the dining room table so I saw it. Everytime there was a vet with a missing arm, leg or worse, my dad would comment afterwards that our lives were unimaginably better for that vet's sacrifice. My dad lost his brother in WWII, shot down over Belgium in a flying fortress. He's in a big cemetary over there with about 5,000 other US airmen. My dad named me after him. It's pretty cool that I could go online and get some of the military records. The last report of his plane was that it was turning back toward enemy territory, apparently due to engine trouble that prevented it from making it across the English Channel. His body was found by a Belgian woodsman days later. I was in my early teens when the Vietnam war ended but I watched the evening news every night and I recall the images on TV. I remember the body counts. I remember being concerned all the time that the war would never end and it would take my oldest brother, which it did. So no, you are not going to get a sarcastic response from me about your military service, just thank you. Thank you.</Msg><Username>mrstan4089</Username><Timestamp>1349003242847</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-30 07:07:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349003354676-17</Id><Topic><Title>Will the left wing Obamacraps continue their relentless campaign of class warfare, hate, racism, lies and blame after the election?</Title><Username>dumpobamie</Username><Timestamp>1348977256059</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 23:54:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"You mindless fringe right #$%$ are making progress.

Thank you for saying 'thanks' for my service; you're welcome. I apologize for attaching less-than-noble intentions to your inquiry about my service; given the rather incendiary nature of past exchanges, I'm sure you understand how I jumped to that conclusion. Regrettably, there are few families in this country that haven't suffered the loss of relatives and close friends in the endless string of military conflicts in which our leaders have engaged us. I consider myself fairly fortunate; among the scruffy but close band of brothers with whom I served, none of us were killed in action. The Air Force was pretty good about protecting its expensive aircraft, and due to the nature of our work, my friends and I were rarely far from the planes and spent the vast majority our time under the same umbrella of protection. (Time off for us was as rare and precious as diamonds.). However, over the intervening years I've been saddened by how many of us became victims of collateral damage from the war: divorces and broken families, severe psychological problems ranging from PTSD and insomnia to criminal behavior and full-blown psychoses, and in particular among my comrades and I, an alarming number of cancers, diabetes, respiratory ailments, and other unusual and specific medical issues that are strongly associated with repeated exposure to tactical herbicides. Most Americans know of the use of one such herbicide, "Agent Orange", against the VC and the Ho Chi Minh Trail, but few are aware that similar chemicals were routinely sprayed on our own bases (and troops), not just in Vietnam but in Thailand (the country from which most aerial operations were conducted against the North), Guam, the Philippines, and other tropical locales. This occurred both during the clearing of the jungles to construct those bases, and later on a regular and periodic basis to suppress vegetation growth adjacent to their perimeters and flight line areas. Far greater numbers of returning Iraq and Afghanistan vets suffer from PTSD and physical wounds than we did, and my generation's medical issues resulting from herbicide exposure have been replaced by this generation's medical issues resulting from exposure to depleted uranium shells and other, newer methods for dealing death. The specific horrors change, but the nature of war does not. As an aside, whenever I need to find an older thread, I go to one of my recent posts; click on my ID; and then search my own message history for it. Under 'view' at the top right corner of the header, select "expanded", and just below there, it will offer 'go to topic'. Select that, and it will display the rest of the thread in question. It's obvious to me that you're fully capable of reasonable and rational discourse. What say we both agree to less baiting and accusations and ridicule, and a cooler tone to our discussions? I already credit you for extending an olive branch. Perhaps by summoning our better selves, we might even set something of an example for others regarding the virtues of negotiation and civil exchanges of opinion rather than vilification and war. - Fish</Msg><Username>fish2kill</Username><Timestamp>1349011587290</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-30 09:26:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349011929982-40</Id><Title>GOP= tax middle class more so RICH and BIG oil get more tax breaks,,,VOTE ALL GOP OUT..</Title><Msg>Save our middle class</Msg><Username>webber3240</Username><Timestamp>1349011929982</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-30 09:32:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349011930042-41</Id><Title>GOP= tax middle class more so RICH and BIG oil get more tax breaks,,,VOTE ALL GOP OUT..</Title><Msg>Save our middle class</Msg><Username>webber3240</Username><Timestamp>1349011930042</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-30 09:32:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349011930058-42</Id><Title>GOP= tax middle class more so RICH and BIG oil get more tax breaks,,,VOTE ALL GOP OUT..</Title><Msg>Save our middle class</Msg><Username>webber3240</Username><Timestamp>1349011930058</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-30 09:32:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349013440269-43</Id><Title>Where is SW, a.k.s.

Prime guest Gov (NJ) Chris Christie feels Romney should be truthful, and set forth his vision—5 economic points for the economy, etc, etc. The president, Christie claims, “cannot change the facts”—citing unemployment levels, the national debt’s growth. The president’s ads, according to Christie, have nothing in substance. His final shot—Obama does not know how to negotiate or compromise, both being skills past governor Romney has demonstrated he possesses. Obama strategist David Plouffe says “trickle down” is not a path for Obama, or the nation. GOP voice Matthew Dowd considers the presidential race one with a 5 point lead for Obama, five to drop to two following debate, etc. Democrat Howard Dean asks, “Does candidate care for people like me?”, implying few feel Romney does so care. Dowd feels, at least now, election is not a referendum on Obama, but upon Romney. Past Miss gov Barbour wants focus to be upon policies, upon the loss of jobs, the national debt growth.

Normally, this is done by consumers. However, during this lull period after the last decade of a consumer spending binge, the prudent thing for consumers is to spend less, increase their savings, and pay off their debt. This is what consumers are trying to do, but the news media is screaming about the coming recession/depression. Because of reduced spending by consumers, there is really no need to create new jobs. It appears that the media want consumers to go through another spending binge. In the absence of this spending, the government is compelled to spend more on public projects. It is amazing how many road projects there are just in the Wash DC area. Even military spending is helping the economy (something I don't fully agree with). For those who are upset by the amount of government spending, think of where this country would be if this money had not been spent to keep the economy going.</Msg><Username>tlee22202</Username><Timestamp>1349027432874</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-30 13:50:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349028751689-76</Id><Topic><Title>OBAMA IS AS AMERICAN AS A 3 DOLLAR BILL IS...WE KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THIS STRANGER</Title><Username>valueplay_2000</Username><Timestamp>1348953348566</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 17:15:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Absolutely out!

How many 18- and 19-year olds have you known that were completely dry behind the ears? Do you understand how many of the 'voluntary' enlistments during the Vietnam era were driven by the looming shadow of the draft? Many of us faced the very real possibility of being drafted, which meant two years in the Army, and quite probably wading into rice paddies carrying a gun, enduring a living hell, and good chances for being wounded or killed there in an undeclared war that few of us supported. Self-preservation was unquestionably a major factor in the decision for a lot of volunteers, myself included. Yes, some also enlisted for more idealist reasons. However, none of us fled to Canada, and very few secured deferments or special assignments or duties for themselves through political connections or relatives. Almost to a man, we suffered from plenty of delusions about the military before we went in, but darned few by the time we got out. Among the factors that led to our decision to enlist, most of us thought we had a much better chance of getting some useful education and training and acquiring some skills that might improve our post-miltary employment opportunities and careers. Certainly a few of us ended up in the specialties and locations we had hoped for, but most either did not or had a mixed bag of the good and the bad. Some even ended up making the military their career. I didn't land in one of the specialties I wanted; instead I wound up in a somewhat similar avionics discipline but with duties and responsibilities far more demanding than I ever could have imagined or sought. Less than 300 USAF airmen and sergeants were ever in it; for some perspective on that number, keep in mind that more than 5000 F-4s Phantoms were built; of those, 3100 went to the United States Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps, and some of them remained in active service for 3 decades). As luck and timing would have it, the air war in Southeast Asia exploded just as our little cliques' aircraft troubleshooting and repair skills were coming up to speed, and with little warning my buddies and I were yanked out of other areas of the world, mostly Northern Asia and the American Southwest, and placed on the tip of the spear in the United States' air offensive in Southeast Asia - the very place most of us had hoped we'd avoid by enlisting. For some reason, wars tend to be super-saturated with irony. An F-4 without a tuned and fully-functional radar weapons system is about as useful as a supersonic kitchen table. 80 to 100 of us were assigned to a cramped avionics shop on a small air base in northeast Thailand. From there, spread across three or more staggered and overlapping shifts of 12 hours or more, 6 to 7 days a week (and at the height of operations, 24 on-and-24 off, no breaks) we supported over 140 jet fighter-bombers, and sustained launches of between 300 and 600 combat fighter-bomber missions per day.....almost every day....from a pair of runways...for nearly 8 months. During that time, the operational readiness rate, or "O.R rate" for our avionics systems was 50%; that is, if 10 aircraft were launched, on average 5 of them returned with systems that were either partially or completely inoperative, and required maintenance and/or repair to return them to full mission-ready status. During one week in late 1972, 11 F-4's and some of their air crews were lost during combat operations from our base alone. Believe me, I'm no hero. But doesn't this suggest that I might have more than a passing acquaintance with hard work and perseverance? Or hint at why I get a little rankled when armchair warriors start calling all liberals 'lazy', 'stupid', and so on? ROTFLMAO at my age, I wouldn't survive 4 hours attempting to do what I did practically non-stop for the last 13 months of my hitch.</Msg><Username>fish2kill</Username><Timestamp>1349031338235</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-30 14:55:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349032284829-78</Id><Topic><Title>"My job is not to worry about those people" -- Mitt Romney.

Officially, we were Fire Control Systems mechanics, which doesn't even hint at radar or weapons or electronic systems, does it? Our shop was known as Weapons Control Systems or WCS, and my buddies and I were more colloquially referred to as the WCS Gorillas, probably due to our combination of knuckle-dragging tastes and behavior (we wore hats with a gorilla patch and the motto 'Work Hard, Party Harder...') and our casual attitude toward rendering proper military courtesies or fully complying with orders or regulations.

Romney by character and makeup, by behavior and attitude, by word and body language is NOT FIT for the position of president. He should continue his present work because all those 'qualities' apparently are working for him in making more millions.

Bad poetry and boring travelogs are also welcome, as well as daily diaries of your personal activities and medical history. DO NOT, however, post anything even remotely related to BAC or finance or the markets. Posting any kind of on-topic, BAC or finance or market related posts will get buried by the resident gang crap that has hijacked this forum.

The check-out registers are manufactured by Diebolt, the same company that manufactures so many electronic voting machines. Nearly every time I use the self-checkout registers, I have to ask for assistance because the machine goofs a UPC read or there is some other malfunction. Also, of late, there are just too many stories in the news about problems with existing voter registrations, and complicated new guidelines and rules for new voter registration and voter registration renewal IDs. As if these stories are seeds of eerie subliminal warm-up queues to prepare the dulled masses into compliance for accepting larger and bigger stories to come about the same during and post-Nov.6 this year a la year 2000. The 2000 election was a blatant outright theft. The evidence of the 2004 election fraud was more muddied and hidden form investigation, as if covert lessons had been learned and implemented. We had a break from this in 2008, but we are overdue for the billion dollar dictator of the Republican Party--Karl Rove--to buy off whatever and whoever it takes to steal another one AGAIN!</Msg><Username>oskarmeijer</Username><Timestamp>1349058051183</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-30 22:20:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349058128461-169</Id><Topic><Title>Algo's and HFT's setting it up to drop below $8.80.</Title><Username>highlowsel</Username><Timestamp>1348860288917</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 15:24:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nice Thread, Actually talking BAC not Politics.

Usually I wait after the morning market opening and the action. But both the larger market and BAC are weakening at this time and I think the price has to go down in tandem with the bad news. However, the market can do anything. Bought at $8.88 on Sept. 12, 2012 also on a day limit order. I did not expect price to hit that level but it did but closed above it on that day. Given the bad news, 'smart money' and market operators will squeeze the weaker hands sooner than later, imo. Anyway, it could happen this coming week. I am ready to buy more... should BAC price go below my limit order to buy at $8.62 We shall see. My next purchase would be around $8.40- $8.25 should price drop lower. Looks like the next support area would be about $8.25- 8.40 level. This is exciting and we shall see. My style is to buy in phases as nobody really knows the bottom at such times. What matters is to have a plan and execute that plan. This year I already traded 3 times profitably and will continue to do that as the times and the market are both in favor of trading at this time.</Msg><Username>giovannijay</Username><Timestamp>1349061387320</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-30 23:16:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349061977464-176</Id><Title>The TRUTH....A lot of AMERICANS don't even know what WALL STREET means, but they wonder around talking on their NICE LOOKING FREE GOV'T CELL PHONES.</Title><Msg>Just remember what happened to DUKAKIS....was AHEAD by 12 pts.
