Apparently the GOP cares only what's good for the party. But why that is good for the GOP even though it's bad for America as a whole? It must be greed and selfishness... and being in total control of the nation. It saddens me that in this age of enlightenment there are such groups. Sadly, even religions act in that way too.</Msg><Username>johnmjay</Username><Timestamp>1351224068499</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 00:01:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351224073805-2</Id><Topic><Title>The GOP Fumes As Powell Endorses Obama</Title><Username>giovannijay</Username><Timestamp>1351222155550</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 23:29:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What an endorsement!! Colin Powell is respected by everyone, except the aforementioned extremist fringe bozos like the inbred rabid fools that camp out on this board. Powell is not only a wise, rational, and respected high-ranking former stateman, but as former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, he could not have more credibility. The man is gold. I wish I could have seen Romney's face when he found out. He probably went blank again like he did during the debates when Obama trashed him with the Libya attack slam, and again with the bayonets and horses slam. This sends such a loud and clear message to the intelligent voters that may still be undecided, or who were thinking about voting repug because they think Obama's policies have not worked. Not only did Powell resoundingly endorse Obama, he also said what he thinks of the unqualified and incompetent Mitt. So, where are the resident inbred white trash trolls and their rank stupidity on this? Not a one of them has anything to say about it. I'm sure when mrstan, or dumpbobamie, or zevoter, or one of the other rectal drips has something to say about it, they will label it a race issue.</Msg><Username>mr.whizzard</Username><Timestamp>1351224073805</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 00:01:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351224390867-3</Id><Topic><Title>WILL BAC GO BACK TO THE 8'S?</Title><Username>bejupete</Username><Timestamp>1351221737983</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 23:22:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>it might go down to 6. it was there before :-)</Msg><Username>whatzephuk</Username><Timestamp>1351224390867</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 00:06:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351224545429-4</Id><Title>Why do NONE of the resident fringe right idiots have anything to say about Colin Powell?</Title><Msg>Are you boys still in shock, or are you off tea bagging each other again?

So what is your recommendation for these 20-30 year olds servicemen who barely finish high school. It takes time to recondition their brain to live a normal life for "shovel ready jobs". Don't you think the 'SHOVEL READY JOBS " IS MERELY A PHANTASY. Something an ILLUSION given to AMERICAN PEOPLE.</Msg><Username>urichey</Username><Timestamp>1351251918125</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 07:45:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351252088472-40</Id><Topic><Title>Of course, Fox faux News' professional liars report that Colin Powell's endorsement of Obama is racist</Title><Username>mr.whizzard</Username><Timestamp>1351251335929</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 07:35:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Don't get me wrong sir, I'm not against troops withdrawal............</Msg><Username>urichey</Username><Timestamp>1351252088472</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 07:48:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351252420545-41</Id><Topic><Title>The GOP Fumes As Powell Endorses Obama</Title><Username>giovannijay</Username><Timestamp>1351222155550</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 23:29:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Colin Powell is the most trusted American, he has done so much for this country.

All three states are locked in an accelerating economic, demographic and social decline; all three hope that they can stave off looming disaster at home by exporting the policies that have ruined them to the rest of the country.. ...American liberalism today is in an advanced stage of intellectual decline. Cynical and short sighted interests wrap themselves in the increasingly tattered mantles of sacred ideas. Liberals are right to feel that social justice matters, that the poor should have greater opportunity and that government in a democratic society cannot remain indifferent to the existence of great social evils. But where liberals in America have the freest hand—in states like New York, California and Illinois—we see incontrovertible evidence that the policies they choose don’t have the consequences they predict. California by now should surely be an educational, environmental and social utopia. New York should be a wonder of glorious liberal governance. Illinois should be known far and wide as the state that works. What’s interesting about the governance failures of these states is how comprehensive they are. Other than politicians, union officials and Wall Street investment banks, nobody really benefits from the choices Illinois has made. As the Volker-Ravitch report tells us, even the public sector unions, the architects of many of the state’s most destructive policies, are going to get shafted as a result of the bad policies they’ve supported. " That about sums it up folks. Liberalism and good intentions coupled with an utter failure to understand human behavior have sunk the liberal states. And now they want to bring this same level of misery to a state near you.

Satter, AdvisorOne October 26, 2012 • Reprints New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman began sending out subpoenas to banks over LIBOR rigging in August and coordinating with Connecticut Attorney General George Jepsen on the investigation. Now the list of subpoenaed banks has expanded to a total of 16, including Société Générale and Royal Bank of Canada (RBC), and more attorneys general are coming in on the investigation. Bloomberg reported Friday that a person familiar with the issue said that the joint probe by New York and Connecticut has resulted in subpoenas not just for SocGen and RBC and the seven banks originally subpoenaed in August, but also for Bank of America, Credit Suisse Group, Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, Norinchukin Bank, Rabobank, Lloyd’s Banking Group and West LB, a German lender that no longer operates. Schneiderman and Jepsen are jointly conducting an investigation into the rigging of LIBOR. The Financial Times had reported in August that the two had joined forces to determine whether collusion on the interbank rate had harmed investors and borrowers in the two states. Schneiderman can rely on the 1921 Martin Act to allow him to cross state lines in investigations and to bring cases without having to demonstrate an intent to commit fraud on the part of the defendant. The law was used to notable effect by Eliot Spitzer during his prosecutorial days when he took on Wall Street firms. According to the report, Susan Kinsman, a spokeswoman for the Connecticut attorney general, said in September that the states are coordinating with “a much larger group of attorneys general.” It was also reported that Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi has issued subpoenas to over a dozen financial institutions, including UBS, Deutsche Bank and HSBC Holdings. This is not the first time that New York has taken point on a financial investigation. In August, as previously reported by AdvisorOne, Benjamin Lawsky, head of the New York State Department of Financial Services, surprised other regulators and investigators by ordering Standard Chartered to appear over money-laundering allegations involving Iranian transactions and explain why its charter to operate in the state should not be revoked. The order quoted an e-mail that implied the bank’s London superior had no regard for U.S. money-laundering regulations. advisorone</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1351260785039</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 10:13:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351260799615-71</Id><Topic><Title>ABOUND SOLAR $400 MILLION OBAMA DOLLARS UNDER FEDERAL INVESTIGATION FOR FRAUD</Title><Username>whitest_white</Username><Timestamp>1351259889052</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 09:58:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ABOUND is a big Obama campaign contributor</Msg><Username>whitest_white</Username><Timestamp>1351260799615</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 10:13:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351260917220-72</Id><Title>WE CAN'T LET BAC GO BELOW $9 AGAIN...STOP SELLING PEOPLE</Title><Msg>RIDICULOUS</Msg><Username>bry345</Username><Timestamp>1351260917220</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 10:15:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351260937058-73</Id><Topic><Title>GAME OVER - OH IS GONE, WISCONSIN IS GONE, NV IS GONE.

Granted, a recent survey of 21 countries found higher approval ratings for President Obama than Gov. Romney. In fact, the BBC World Service opinion poll, conducted between June and September, indicated an average 50 percent preference for the current president and just 9 percent for his Republican challenger. However, although a majority of people surveyed in all countries save one preferred that the incumbent win re-election, it turns out that Pakistanis prefer Romney.

The former prime minister is expected to appeal against the verdict. He has faced a number of trials connected to his business affairs, but has either been cleared or cases have run beyond the judicial time limit. In the case for which he was sentenced on Friday, prosecutors alleged that part of the money declared for the purchase of film rights was skimmed off to create illegal slush funds, reducing tax liabilities for Mediaset, one of Mr Berlusconi's companies. The court handed Mr Berlusconi a longer sentence than the three years and eight months requested by prosecutors. It also banned Mr Berlusconi from holding public office, though the ban would only take effect if the sentence is upheld by a higher court, Italian news agency Ansa reported. Mr Berlusconi has dominated Italian politics for most of the last 20 years. He was forced to resign as the prime minister of a centre-right coalition last November, and recently said he had no plans to stand again in elections due next year. The trial began six years ago, and has been subject to repeated delays.

It may well come down to a razor thin margin of a couple thousand votes in one state, or maybe even one or two counties. I think a recount is likely, but in any event we may not know who won until a day or two or more after Nov. 6. if they have to recount an entire state or two by hand including every single vote, including mail-ins, w/two monitors to verify--how long would that take? There is going to be such animosity in the country and between parties no matter which side wins. Ideologies will be further dug in, accusations and recriminations leveled, cheating alleged.

There is NO American foreign credibility with Obama in office. There was a move to a lawless dictatorship in America in 2009 under the Obama junta. These were not civilian demonstrators protesting with guns and rocket-propelled grenades in Libya. Civilians run away when explosions occur, so taking out everything above the height of a worm's balls within a 1-block radius of the compound was prudent, warranted, and demanded. NOTHING is civilized about leaving your citizens to die when they are under attack by terrorists. And leaving them to die for the sake of an election that obama has already lost is either treason or utter political incompetence. Judgement of Americans is complete. Defense's motion for the rest of us to ignore the obvious is overruled.</Msg><Username>flippant_1</Username><Timestamp>1351279670863</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 15:27:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351280230002-186</Id><Title>★★★★★ Ten days until the Re-Election of President Obama ★★★★★</Title><Msg>There will be parties and celebrations all over the world when Obama is re-elected.</Msg><Username>ebonics4gfy</Username><Timestamp>1351280230002</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 15:37:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351280318732-187</Id><Topic><Title>Racist Tea Bagger fools froth at their bungs over Colin Powell endorsement of Obama</Title><Username>mr.whizzard</Username><Timestamp>1351276407546</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 14:33:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Tea baggers are proud of being racists.</Msg><Username>ebonics4gfy</Username><Timestamp>1351280318732</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 15:38:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351280481936-188</Id><Topic><Title>Racist Tea Bagger fools froth at their bungs over Colin Powell endorsement of Obama</Title><Username>mr.whizzard</Username><Timestamp>1351276407546</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 14:33:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I am not a "Tea Bagger" however I don't care what he thinks or any other figures that want to throw their opinion into the debate.

The Federal Housing Finance Agency, the companies' federal regulator, released a report on Friday that estimated they will pay between $32 billion and $78 billion to the U.S. Treasury through 2015. The baseline forecast assumes that the companies would end up costing taxpayers $76 billion by the end of 2015, down from the current tab of $142 billion. Since the companies were placed into conservatorship by the government in 2008, they have drawn nearly $188 billion from the Treasury and paid back $46 billion in dividends. The government assisted the companies to preserve functioning mortgage markets, taking preferred shares of stock in exchange for that support. Last year, the regulator estimated that the tab would drop to $124 billion by 2014. The projections are significantly better than those issued one year ago for two reasons. First, home prices have improved this year, which has boosted the mortgage-finance giants' bottom lines. Second, the Obama administration and the FHFA in August agreed to revamp the way that the companies are required to pay back the government. Beginning in January, the companies will no longer pay a 10% dividend on the total money they have drawn from the U.S. The dividend required Fannie and Freddie to borrow money from the Treasury in several quarters to make the payments. Instead, Fannie and Freddie will send all of their profits to the Treasury in quarters when they turn a profit, and they won't be required to pay a dividend in periods where they report a loss. The regulator's latest forecasts show that Freddie Mac won't require additional government support, even under a "worst case" scenario that envisions further home-price declines. Fannie might need government aid this year to pay the 10% dividend but would only need additional aid in subsequent years if home prices were to fall sharply. Most analysts have assumed that the companies won't be able to fully repay the government. It should be "clear to everyone at this point" that the companies "will not be able to earn their way back to a condition that allows them to emerge" from government ownership, said Edward DeMarco, the acting director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, in a speech last year. Even if Fannie and Freddie ultimately did remit enough in dividends to repay the amounts borrowed from the government, they would still owe the government money. That is because the terms of their government support don't actually provide a mechanism for them to buy back the preferred shares that the government has taken. In that sense, Fannie and Freddie are simply making interest payments on a loan that can't formally be paid off.</Msg><Username>fingr1ikengud</Username><Timestamp>1351295863001</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 19:57:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351296893760-260</Id><Title>Colin Powell endorsed Obama becuase he is black !</Title><Msg>It's gonna be extremely tough to find any black person voting for Mitt Romney.</Msg><Username>kingofvietnam</Username><Timestamp>1351296893760</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 20:14:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351297703100-261</Id><Topic><Title>Obama: 'Not personally aware' of security requests before Libya attack</Title><Username>dumpobamie</Username><Timestamp>1351297114668</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 20:18:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If this is the definition of commander and chief, YOU'RE FIRED!</Msg><Username>parisonr</Username><Timestamp>1351297703100</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 20:28:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351298163747-262</Id><Topic><Title>Obama: 'Not personally aware' of security requests before Libya attack</Title><Username>dumpobamie</Username><Timestamp>1351297114668</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 20:18:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This is nothing more than stone walling.

He knows Romney would have us in a war with Iran within months after taking office. Americans must consider the relationship between Mitt Romney and his old business partner Netanyahu and his propensity in attacking Iran. The same people that worked for Bush will be the same people working for Romney. Romney told Americans he wants an extra $2 trillion dollars for defense spending, other than his plan for war with Iran, why would we need this huge spending increase? Understand some deep reasons why Colin Powell may be voting for President Obama. Knowing Colin Powell was trusted around the world, President Bush used Powell in 2003 to address the U.N., warning the world about weapon of mass destruction in Iraq, that turned out to be a Lie. So Colin Powell could be voting against the same Republicans who deceived him in the past.</Msg><Username>fireundersmoke</Username><Timestamp>1351299182397</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 20:53:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351299284577-268</Id><Topic><Title>Colin Powell endorsed Obama becuase he is black !</Title><Username>kingofvietnam</Username><Timestamp>1351296893760</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 20:14:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Colin Powell is a worthless bigoted traitor.</Msg><Username>obamistan</Username><Timestamp>1351299284577</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 20:54:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351299360476-269</Id><Topic><Title>CIA operators were denied request for help during Benghazi attack,</Title><Username>whitest_white</Username><Timestamp>1351264914006</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 11:21:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama deserves impeachment then hanging for high treason!</Msg><Username>obamistan</Username><Timestamp>1351299360476</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 20:56:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351299436267-270</Id><Topic><Title>CIA operators were denied request for help during Benghazi attack,</Title><Username>whitest_white</Username><Timestamp>1351264914006</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 11:21:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"If this man wins the election, what will happen to our fine Country?" .....

You just don't know how to analyze these things like I do. See, the reason they latched on to the idea that this whole thing was caused by a video is because Obamster was watching a boy p0rn flick with his body man, he couldn't be disturbed for several hours, and all the violence escalated while Obama was "otherwise engaged". Ergo, the event was the reaction to a "disgusting" video. See, the picture always makes sense when you apply some common sense along with an understanding of narcissistic human behavior to the problem. Why else would they have gone looking for some stupid youtube video that was 6 months old with less than 300 hits instead of the one Obama was watching that actually caused the non-reaction that got these people killed?</Msg><Username>flippant_1</Username><Timestamp>1351305056868</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 22:30:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351305167720-300</Id><Topic><Title>Uninstalling Obama......... █████████████▒▒ 90% complete.</Title><Username>flippant_1</Username><Timestamp>1351272029457</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 13:20:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hope he got a massive bump on the head and comes to his senses and votes for ROMNEY!</Msg><Username>obamistan</Username><Timestamp>1351305167720</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 22:32:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351305204802-301</Id><Topic><Title>★★★★★ Ten days until the De-Election of President Obama ★★★★★</Title><Username>flippant_1</Username><Timestamp>1351289878228</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 18:17:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Oops, this needs to go above the stupid one that keeps getting replied to by the mindless minions.</Msg><Username>flippant_1</Username><Timestamp>1351305204802</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 22:33:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351305320240-302</Id><Title>No white man is ever labeled as a racist for endorsing a white candidate.</Title><Msg>The teabagger liars and other fringe sack suckers try to play a race card with Colin Powell's endorsement of Obama.</Msg><Username>j.farragut</Username><Timestamp>1351305320240</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 22:35:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351305383084-303</Id><Topic><Title>★★★★★ Ten days until the Re-Election of President Obama ★★★★★</Title><Username>ebonics4gfy</Username><Timestamp>1351280230002</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 15:37:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Re-election is a given.</Msg><Username>j.farragut</Username><Timestamp>1351305383084</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 22:36:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351305383605-304</Id><Topic><Title>No white man is ever labeled as a racist for endorsing a white candidate.</Title><Username>j.farragut</Username><Timestamp>1351305320240</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 22:35:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No white candidate has ever gotten 95% of the white vote either, idiotass.</Msg><Username>flippant_1</Username><Timestamp>1351305383605</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 22:36:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351305497179-305</Id><Topic><Title>Racist Tea Bagger fools froth at their bungs over Colin Powell endorsement of Obama</Title><Username>mr.whizzard</Username><Timestamp>1351276407546</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 14:33:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No Republican commands more respect from all parties than Colin Powell.</Msg><Username>j.farragut</Username><Timestamp>1351305497179</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 22:38:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351305733574-306</Id><Topic><Title>Obama endorsed by Colin Powell.

Applied critical thinking. This kind of stupidity is nothing more than a marketing/branding job. Nobody really wants an abortion, and everybody can afford their own contraception at $9/month, or less if you make the guy pay for it. So they've sold the MSM on the idea that all women want an abortion for free and contraception for free, and they're all gonna revolt if they don't get their free pills and abortions.
