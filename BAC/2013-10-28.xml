Republicans think someone else is to blame and so they will NEVER be able to solve their problems by looking elsewhere and pointing fingers at everyone else. Republicans ARE their own problem. Their greed, their selfishness, their arrogance, all that and much more has come full circle and has ruined the party. Admitting they are their own problem will be the hardest thing they ever did and so the likelihood of it happening are truly slim to none.

Ironically, although she deserves to be fired for incompetence, it won't happen because TeaParty obstructionism has stopped every Secretary-level appointment Obama has attempted, and he won't let this key position go unstaffed at this critical juncture. Therefore today affords all Americans a chance to watch pure, unadulterad (no adults) Congressional Kabuki Theatre and our fearless elected House Representatives in action (fearless because among their many perks is free blue-chip medical care for life). Leading the charge will be Marsha Blackburn, right-wing nutcase from Tennessee's 7th District (in four different years, the American Conservative Union rated her voting record at 100%). 10 minutes of internet search time, from her wiki bio to her own website, uncovered nothing more than B.S. degree from Mississippi State University. 5 minutes into this search I knew I smelled a rat.....but what a rat it turns out to be! Her B.S. is in......wait for it.....wait for it.....home economics. And her much-vaunted small business background? While in college, she worked summers for Southwestern Company, a company that recruits and trains college student for door-to-door sales of educational books and .....wait for it....software, AND website subscriptions. "The Best and The Brightest" in a cage-match showdown and throwdown, folks! We are doomed. Get the money out of politics, and these kinds of bridge salesmen will be on the street where they belong, wearing signs that say "Willing to work for food" ROTFLMAO.

No one here has ever pirated my ID (though I won't be surprised if it happens sooner rather than later) , nor do I post under multiple IDs, nor have I EVER posted under anything but fish2kill, despite being accused here at least daily of doing and having done both. Do I enjoy playing devil's advocate? You bet your bippy! Am I above using wild flights of fancy to make a point? Simpson's legal team couldn't keep me out of prison if I had to face that charge. Honest to criminy, I write for a living, and this board is the equivalent of a busman's holiday for me....but I STILL follow the market and especially BAC. I stopped playing the ponies years ago because I SUCKED at it, but I'd genuinely like to learn enough to dabble without getting killed. Besides, I also have an huge albatross to lug around....I'm one of those contemptible 'moral' investors who refuses to invest in German lampshade manufacturers even when everything else is making money hand-over-fist with them. Every one of us makes his or her own moral judgements according to their own values. If I try to nudge or beat people into re-examing theirs, well sorry - sue me. In MY view BAC is only 1 small step above the lampshade factories, but I ain't likely to win any converts with MY persuasive style. What offends me above all else though is the paucity of reason and logic on these boards, and the lack of a level playing field in the markets. Believe me or not; that's entirely up to you, but there it is and you're all free to like it or lump it.</Msg><Username>fish2kill</Username><Timestamp>1382976011924</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-28 12:00:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382976326503-76</Id><Topic><Title>$125,000 return on investment with SEEK with its search engine TheDirectory.

At least you've confirmed my premise, if not my conclusion. Inertia accounts for the retention of existing customers (yours truly excepted, and switching banks was indeed a royal pain and my own inertia took a year for me to overcome), and as you stated clearly and I only mentioned in passing, the key to BAC's future lies in adding new customers to its base. I believe that BAC's egregious past behavior, along with its current and well-documented bad behavior and absence of business ethics (its dependence on politically-bestowed tax loopholes, paid lobbyists and purchased legislators, special tax credits, velvet-gloved financial regulations and regulators, bailouts, QE handouts, etc) have soured those customers' perception of this firm (remember that the bulk of them are YOUNG) to the point where BAC is the LAST place on earth they'd ever keep OR invest their own (scarce) funds. The Milennials are in deep financial doo-doo, and pretty united in their assessment of who and what put them there. This is the message I came to BAC with almost 3 years ago, and I've only seen it gaining strength over time. Most of them wouldn't be caught dead pumping gas from a BP station into their 20-year old Tercels, and I don't think all the perks and convenience in the world are going to overcome their thoroughly jaundiced view of this bank. I could be wrong; you could be right, but that's my read.

Lawsuit after lawsuit after 5 years and they are only beginning. Regardless, every empire has its day and the voters will have another day to elect others. Again, this stock is going to $30 for too many reasons to list and I am going to own it regardless of what someone else thinks for I know what this firm is worth even though others do not. You are looking for Traders, and Short Sellers look elsewhere for that is not me. Long and strong and holding to $30, and probably $50.</Msg><Username>nasa_rss</Username><Timestamp>1382987637303</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-28 15:13:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1382987721191-104</Id><Title>Obama Lies People Die</Title><Msg>People everywhere now losing their health care plan some forced into plans with much higher costs.

His wealth and excellent medical insurance allowed him to overcome MAJOR heart problems for many years and to now to enjoy life, due to a Heart transplant. I do not fault him at all for takeing advanage of the resources he had in order to stay alive. i do however ask you to consider that do not all Americans deserve the same in their time of need? In a country where we have no problem spending trillions on nation building wars, do we not have the wrong priority? Should we support those that can only be critical of efforts to provid health care to all and provide no ideas for a better system? Should only the rich be able to obtain high levels of medical care? Before you respond with any of the usual anti-Obama BS, think about if you could not afford or be eligable for medical care that would save your life, the life of your child, spouse, or other loved ones. Should not this Nation establish this as a priority? I have no problem paying extra taxs to ensure you and your loved ones can get the same level of medical care Mr. Cheney enjoyed.</Msg><Username>carolyne47</Username><Timestamp>1382992295759</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-28 16:31:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382992639613-126</Id><Topic><Title>For your consideration</Title><Username>carolyne47</Username><Timestamp>1382992295759</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-28 16:31:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I want the government to buy me a pony</Msg><Username>ralph6741</Username><Timestamp>1382992639613</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-28 16:37:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382992727586-127</Id><Topic><Title>For your consideration</Title><Username>carolyne47</Username><Timestamp>1382992295759</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-28 16:31:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>carolyne47 This unfortunately how the system works.

I don't think they've tried to buy their health insurance yet. A lot of liberals are about to turn conservative when Obama Claus fills their stockings with lumps of coal -- starting with a few lumps this year, and then offloading the freight train into their living rooms in 2016. Sure, the penalty is only $95 in 2014 or 1% of income, but it goes up to $695 or 2.5% of income in 2016 and that's for a single person. And that's a payment in exchange for government "solving their problem" of not having health insurance and giving them none. Never mind that they still don't have it, they have to pay the tax penalty. And woe to those who say the IRS cannot collect. The IRS won't be able to go after anyone in court, true, but they will withhold the past year penalties and interest from any future refunds, so it's a pay-me-now-or-pay-me-later kind of thing that primarily hits those who receive government benefits like the earned income tax credit or refunds for over-withholding. Those kind, caring liberals are really helping folks by soaking poor and middle class families for $2250 a year and not providing any coverage, huh? Oh yeh, the alternative is to buy family insurance (even subsidized) that has a nice deductible over $10,000 along with huge copays. Nice law.

He wrote a paper in June, 2007 entitled "Historic turning points in real estate."

Ask how many pigs have become extremely wealthy under Obama's stock market? Furthermore, Obama can do little to stop robbers like Apple from moving their operations overseas because of cheap labor. Be happy to enjoy giving your profits to Apple and thanked them for the cheap labor they bought overseas. But you being smart probably stayed away from their junk and bought Apple stock in 2009. Yes, under Reagan the debt went up 200 percent, from 1 trillion to 3 trillion. I am sure many tea baggers know that right? This lack of job creation has less to do with Obama, Bush, or Reagan. Neo-liberalism promotes competition and corporations will collect profits from selling goods to Americans, but they will not employ them to manufacture or provide services. They will keep running towards cheap labor, if not ask Walmart and its immoral behavior in Bangladesh.
