In the clip, the Democratic co-chair of President Obama's National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform gives high praises to Paul Ryan's budget plan. "I'm telling you, this guy is amazing. I always thought I was OK with arithmetic. This guy can run circles around me," Bowles tells a class of students at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. "He is honest, he is straightforward, he is sincere. And the budget he came forward with is just like Paul Ryan. It is a sensible, straightforward, honest, serious budget and it cut the budget deficit just like we did by four trillion dollars." The video was shot on September 8, 2011, but was just uploaded to YouTube yesterday. What's striking is that not only does Bowles, a former U.S. Senate candidate from North Carolina, praise Ryan's effort, but he is also highly critical of the budget offered by President Obama.

In case you hadn't noticed, there have been some significant developments on the political scene since that poll was taken. The article you cite mentions that the poll was taken 'in the days leading up to the Ryan announcement.' On the last of those days, Friday August 10th, the Las Vegas odds (money line) were Obama -170, Romney +140. (meaning that to win $100 on an Obama victory, one needed to wager $170; whereas a $100 bet on a Romney victory would result in winnings of $140. In both cases, those numbers are the profit above and beyond the original amount wagered, which is returned to the bettor only if he wins the bet.) Today, those odds have widened in Obama's favor to -200 vs. Romney's +160. Furthermore, a simplistic poll of all voters is all but irrelevant in an election determined not by the popular vote, but by the Electoral College vote. The Romney-Ryan ticket certainly threw red meat to the GOP hard right, but that group was in no danger of voting for Obama anyway. Instead, the outcome of this election will be determined in swing states by swing voters, and it is there that Romney will go down in flames. I can't tell whether you're trying to fool others, or yourself, but no fooling, Romney just committed political suicide, and if you're applauding his choice, I'm delighting to join in with you.

The last 5 sessions have basically been sideways, as a 5 day TA chart clearly shows. This is working off the recent overbought bounce off lows of 20 sessions or so back.

We own our suburban Boston home free and clear, have zero debt and a 798 credit rating and had ~ $60K spread among 5 or 6 BAC accounts. We'd been BofA customers since 1981, and even with our special 'grandfathered' terms and breaks, the cost of doing business with them had steadily risen while the interest paid on our accounts had steadily declined until it was no longer competitive. We completed transfer of the last of our funds (split between a credit union and local S&amp;L) in the first half of January of this year; our credit union's interest rate on those accounts is FOUR TIMES what BofA had been paying, and the local Ma&amp;Pa S&amp;L (literally next-door to our old back) is paying TWICE as much interest with lower minimum balance requirements. Yes, inertia is a powerful force, and we had talked about moving our money for a few years before doing so; the hassle of re-visiting and re-directing all of our automatic deposits and withdrawals was somewhat intimidating and time-consuming, but we overcame those obstacles and are now far happier with our current financial institutions. If you want to keep whistling past the graveyard and pretending that fund flight is not a significant issue for BAC, go ahead. However, if you think it's only 'deadbeats' leaving, you're dead wrong. We have four friends in similar circumstances who've followed our lead since the 1st of this year.

"but it doesn't accurately represent his entire speech. In fact, the video maker cut out the part of the speech where Bowles calls the Wisconsin congressman's 2011 plan for Medicare "pretty radical." (See below for a more complete audio.) Republicans rather focus on these quotes in the clip: "I'm telling you, this guy is amazing," Bowles says of Ryan. "I always thought I was OK with arithmetic, this guy can run circles around me." "The budget he came forward with is just like Paul Ryan," he continued. "It is a sensible, straightforward, honest, serious budget ..." The whole speech is not posted, just clips, so it's hard to tell the complete context of Bowles words. Case in point: later in the speech, Bowles went point-by-point comparing the plan drafted by the deficit commission he co-chaired to Ryan's proposal. What's cut from the video is Bowles discussion of making Medicare a defined contribution plan, instead of a defined benefit plan. "We thought that was a pretty radical change," Bowles said. "And what we said is lets test it in the federal employees health care plan and see if it works. What we would rather do is we cut spending in the health care programs by about $450 billion. And our hope was ... we wouldn't have to do something more drastic like Paul had recommended or a something more drastic like a single payer plan." Listen to all Bowles thoughts on Ryan's plan here.

Without offending anyone......the Farm and drought bill was passed by the house last month and has been submitted by the lower house to the Senate but REID as always let go the Democratic led SENATE and all went on vacation. The same thing he did with the budget for 2011. He did not act on it thinking that it can be acted after the recess but after the election in November 2010, the Pelousy democrat lost the house and the country went on spending spree without a budget. In OBAMAs full term, the country has been operating without a budget. One time ( just to say they have submitted a budget) , that submitted budget did not even attract a single democratic vote. BUT THE MOTTO PERSISTED...BLAME THE GOPs- PEOPLE WILL NOT KNOW THE DIFFERENCE..... ALL RESULTED IN LACK OF LEADERSHIP.</Msg><Username>urichey</Username><Timestamp>1344954878064</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 10:34:38

Face it Obama has no plan and spending on these programs are unsustainable. and tax increases will NOT makeup the shortfalls. According to Obama's tax increase plan only 86 Billion more is brought into the treasury per year when we have 1.5 Trillion dollar deficits. It is not a solution only rhetoric. I am tired of politicians spewing rhetoric for political gain rather than tackling the problem and attempting to seriously solve it.

As the European economy slides deeper into recession, it is none too early for the United States to draw cautionary lessons from Europe's painful budget experience, since the dismal state of the U.S. public finances now bears an uncomfortably striking resemblance to that of the worst performers in the European periphery. And the United States would be ignoring those countries' difficult experiences with addressing high budget deficits at its peril. Control Spending The most common lesson that many observers draw from the recent European experience is that the United States must at all costs avoid the fiscal profligacy of a country like Greece if it is to avoid painful fiscal retrenchment. Sound as that lesson might be, a basic problem is that the United States' train of fiscal recklessness has long since left the station. As a result of unchecked public spending over many years, including the financing of two unfunded wars, together with tax cuts that the country could ill afford, the U.S. public finances are now widely perceived as being on a clearly unsustainable path. According to the latest IMF estimates, the U.S. budget deficit will still be more than 8 percent of GDP in 2012, or little different from that expected in Greece, and more than twice the average European level in 2012. At the same time, the IMF estimates that by the end of 2012 the U.S. general government debt will exceed 100 percent of GDP. Such a level would be some 20 percentage points of GDP higher than the corresponding average public debt level in the euro zone. More disturbing still, there is every indication that this disparity will widen in the years ahead on account of the increased strain on the U.S. budget deficit from its lavish entitlement programs. Watch for Bubbles It is also late in the day for the U.S. to draw the lesson from Europe that excessive credit and housing market bubbles, whose bursting are at the core of Spain's and Ireland's present budget difficulties, can give rise to the need for massive fiscal retrenchment. Though perhaps not on quite the same scale as that in Ireland and Spain, between 2000 and 2006 the U.S. experienced such bubbles in spades. The subsequent bursting of those bubbles was the fundamental underlying cause of the U.S. Great Economic Recession in 2008-2009, which has wreaked havoc with the country's public finances. Remain Ever Vigilant An important lesson that the U.S. can draw from the recent European experience is not to be lulled into a false sense of budget complacency by the extremely low long-term market interest rates at which the U.S. government can presently fund itself. These low interest rates should certainly not be used as by the U.S. as an excuse to delay any further the adoption of a credible program of medium-term budget adjustment. As recently as 2009, the Greek government was still able to fund itself on a long-term basis at a mere 20 basis points above the corresponding rate at which the German government could do so. And it could do so despite growing evidence that the Greek public finances were on a clearly unsustainable path. When markets did finally turn against Greece, they did so in a dramatic fashion, which has highly complicated Greece's task of restoring order to its public finances. Considering the high proportion of the U.S. budget deficit that is financed from abroad, the U.S. would be making a grave mistake not to pay heed to its acute budget financing vulnerability. Another highly relevant lesson from the European experience is how painful budget adjustment has been within the euro straitjacket. That straitjacket has precluded member countries from the use of an independent monetary and exchange rate policy as an offset to the adverse impact of budget tightening on economic activity and employment. As the latest IMF projections suggest, the recessions in Italy and Spain, which are stuck in the euro, are proving to be much deeper than that in the UK, which is also engaged in an aggressive medium-term fiscal consolidation program but which is not similarly constrained by euro membership from actively using monetary and exchange rate policy as an offset to fiscal tightening. This experience would provide support for the view that when the U.S. does embark on a serious program of medium-term fiscal consolidation, it should be supported by a highly accommodating monetary policy stance by the Federal Reserve. Details Matter A further important lesson that the European experience offers is that the speed and composition of budget adjustment does matter. Excessively front-loaded fiscal adjustment programs, such as those in Greece and Portugal, have led to deeper economic recessions than those in countries where budget adjustment has been more back-loaded. Similarly an excessive reliance on tax increases in general, and on indirect tax increases in particular, appears to have proved to be more harmful to economic output and employment than programs more focused on public spending cuts. Europe's present economic difficulties are contributing to historically low U.S. government borrowing rates as investors seek safe havens. The U.S. would do well to take advantage of these low interest rates to start a serious program of medium-term budget retrenchment rather than to allow those low interest rates to lead the country further down the path to fiscal ruin.

He wrote an impressive article titled Four Deformations Of The Apocalypse in the New York times that everyone including those in the media should read carefully. For him to make these statements now shows the fear he has that we may return to the irresponsible supply-side policies of the Republicans over the last 30 years. So said David Stockman and that is the truth. Failure #1: Milton Friedman persuading Republican President Nixon to abandon the Bretton Woods agreement to balance our accounts and printing money not back by anything but faith. Failure #2: The explosion of the debt beginning under President Reagan in 1981. Failure #3: The unabated expansion of the financial sector with a corrupt shadow banking system that brought us corrupt financial instruments like credit default swaps to insure junk securitized mortgages. Failure #4: The avid support of policies (deregulation though he did not say that specifically) that outsourced our jobs, both high and low end. Most importantly the article provides a glimpse of who benefited from these policies as well as illustrated the decaying effect of the gap between the rich and the poor. It is imperative that this paper gets coverage as the narrative being put out is a disservice to every American. It has allowed Republican failed policies to seem plausible though they are devoid of reality.</Msg><Username>giovannijay</Username><Timestamp>1344976446126</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 16:34:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344977555882-187</Id><Topic><Title>Obama and other Ignorant Libtard democrats should really read this...........</Title><Username>tulsaturd</Username><Timestamp>1344972717912</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 15:31:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Anybody above ave. intelligence can inform himself/herself reading Reagan's budget director David Stockman and learn that the GOP was has the primary responsibility of the financial apocalyse brought on the U.S. Namecalling and blaming others... through 'expert marketing' of the previous decades are no more workable and the GOP is heading to a resounding defeat.

Obama is down by at least 5. He'll lose by at least that much, probably closer to 10. These guys have added D+9 to their numbers, inflating Demcong on the basis that if you voted as a Demcong socialist imbecile in 2008, more of you will in 2009. What they fail to realize is that people with brains see the Big ZERO for what he really is -- a marxist idiot narcissist loser. The many morons who voted in favor of abject failure and monumental waste and class warfare and gray propaganda (i.e., the Big ZERO) have lost their enthusiasm. The easiest way to tell is to look at ZERO's fund raising. He's hopelessly behind. All of his supporters are out of work, because let's face it, liberal losers are unemployable in a bad economy. Employers need people with skills, not emotions and good intentions and horrible ideas with other people's money.

With Ryan It's '64 and Goldwater Again</Title><Msg>With Ryan It's '64 and Goldwater Again By Edward Koch Mitt Romney has done this country a great service by selecting Paul Ryan as his running mate. He has changed the nature of the election from one that is about who is the best candidate to lead us out of the aftermath of the Great Recession to one that concerns fundamental party policies and philosophy. He has turned the election into what we had in 1964. President Lyndon B. Johnson was finishing the term of our martyred President Jack Kennedy and running for his own first term against Sen. Barry Goldwater, Republican from Arizona. Goldwater was the leader of the conservative wing of the Republican Party and ultimately the leader of the entire party in that election. The 1964 race became a referendum on whether the United States should jettison the principles of the party of hope — the Democratic party — created by FDR that united the aspirations of the middle class and addressed the needs of the poor and the concerns of women, blacks, Jews, other minorities, and farmers. FDR, a wealthy man, was denounced by many of his peers as a traitor to his class. What FDR gave to our country was the promise of greater fairness for all of its people. One of his greatest contributions, many would say, was the Social Security program that was intended to assist these who had worked all their lives to retire at 65 with dignity. That concept was extended by President Johnson in 1965 with the creation of both Medicare and Medicaid. The former is basically for the elderly and the latter is for the impoverished of all ages. Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid are the very programs that the Republicans and conservatives beginning with Goldwater have been seeking to chip away at and ultimately eliminate. For example, President George W. Bush rightly recognized that Social Security needs to be changed to make it solvent. However, his proposal to privatize the program, making payments dependent on stock market performance, makes no sense, particularly in view of the effects of the Great Recession on the stock market. A better approach would have been and still would be to gradually increase the eligibility age (we fortunately live much longer today than we did in 1935), and apply the current Social Security tax to our entire personal income — it stops now at $110,100 — with such additional fiscal measures as are necessary to bring in more revenue. The program eligibility could also be made subject to a needs basis. Those who are wealthy don't need the employer subsidies which could be added to and used for those who do. There are changes of a fiscal nature short of privatization that could similarly protect Medicare from going bankrupt. Unfortunately, privatizing Medicare is the signature proposal of Paul Ryan and his budget adopted by the Republican House of Representatives. Ryan would give those 55 or younger vouchers to buy health insurance policies to replace the current Medicare entitlement program. Already the Romney-Ryan team is screaming it is unfair to attack Ryan on this his signature proposal. But he cannot run away from it and his philosophy. Listening to the talking heads, I hear a little buyers' remorse setting in. The Republicans, at the urging of Paul Ryan, want to change Medicaid into a limited block grant to be provided to each state to take the place of the existing entitlement program which provides benefits to an unlimited number of eligible beneficiaries. Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, and so many other programs are in great danger if the philosophy of the Romney-Ryan team prevails at the polls. The lack of Romney-Ryan compassion is also highlighted by their support for the Republican House-adopted budget, which slashes food stamps that are provided to poor children and others. And then there is the matter of a woman's right to choose. The Republicans are trying in every state to deprive women of all their rights under Roe v. Wade, seeking to make it more and more difficult for a woman to exercise her right in consultation with her doctor to obtain a legally permissible abortion. The Republicans in many states are seeking to depress the black vote, requiring unneeded identification papers for voting. The effort to roll back citizen rights goes on. The Times this morning summed up the philosophy of Paul Ryan, reporting, "though best known as an architect of conservative fiscal policy, Rep. Paul D. Ryan has also been an ardent, unwavering foe of abortion rights, has tried to cut off federal money for family planning, has opposed same-sex marriage and has championed the rights of gun owners." The Democrats have made their share of mistakes over the years. However, they have recognized them, made needed changes and are willing to make more changes for the good of the country. We Democrats led by President Obama support the "grand bargain" entailing revenue increases and expense reductions. The Republican leadership, on the other hand, is largely interested in cutting spending for social programs, while rejecting revenue increases, particularly if such increases include higher taxes on the rich. I am a proud Democrat but not an ideologue. I have identified myself through the years when I served as a member of Congress and mayor of New York City, as a liberal with sanity. When I thought it appropriate and in the best interest of my country, state and city, I have crossed party lines; for me, the people always come first. I look around and see millionaires and billionaires thriving and while most of us don't resent their wealth, we do object to their not paying their fair share of taxes. We are supposed to have a progressive tax system and instead the Congress bought by their wealthy supporters has provided loopholes that permit the wealthiest corporations and individuals to pay in some cases nothing at all. People who get their income from stock trading, unlike those of us who receive salaries, pay at a rate of 15 percent when a salaried employee receiving the same income could be paying at a 35 percent rate. This is simply not fair. Thank you Mitt Romney for selecting Paul Ryan as your running mate and thereby unwittingly turning this election into a crusade by all Americans who put country first and are willing to join hands across party lines to fight for fairness for all of our fellow citizens.</Msg><Username>giovannijay</Username><Timestamp>1344994222145</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 21:30:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344994227762-258</Id><Topic><Title>Soledad O'Brien has an Obama bumper on her forehead?!</Title><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1344987784303</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 19:43:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Journalists and media types are Obama's most ardent supporters.

Paul Ryan as vice presidential running mate, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Monday. Some 51 percent of those surveyed said the decision did not change their opinion of Romney, a former private-equity executive and Massachusetts governor who will face President Barack Obama in the Nov. 6 election. Another 26 percent in the online poll said they viewed Romney more favorably after he added the 42-year-old Wisconsin congressman to the ticket on Saturday, while 23 percent said they viewed him less favorably. The survey of 508 registered voters was conducted for Reuters from Aug. 11 to Aug. 13. Ryan is a polarizing figure in Washington, where he has led his party's push to cut domestic spending, lower taxes and scale back the size of the federal government as chairman of the House Budget Committee. A hero to conservatives, Ryan has given Romney a jolt of energy on the campaign trail after several difficult weeks marked by gaffes and continued questions about his personal finances. The two men basked in the cheers of thousands of supporters at campaign stops in North Carolina on Sunday. But Ryan remains largely unknown to the wider public. While 80 percent of those surveyed said they had at least heard of Ryan, only 35 percent said they were familiar with him. Some 42 percent said they did not know whether he was qualified or not to be president -- a higher percentage than the 33 percent who said he was not qualified and the 26 percent who said he was. One warning sign for the Romney campaign: By a margin of 44 percent to 29 percent, voters said the incumbent vice president, Joe Biden, was more qualified than Ryan to serve as president if the need arose. "He's fairly unknown in who he is and what he stands for," said Ipsos vice president Julia Clark. "He's a Wisconsin congressman, not a nationally known figure." That is likely to change in the coming weeks as Ryan campaigns across the country to build enthusiasm among grass-roots conservatives while Democrats attack his budget plan as one that would gut programs for the elderly and the poor. The precision of the Reuters/Ipsos online polls is measured using a credibility interval. In this case, the poll has a credibility interval of plus or minus 5.1 percentage points for all respondents. Ryan's signature proposal would change the popular Medicare health plan for the elderly into a voucher program that would give future retirees a fixed amount of money to buy traditional Medicare insurance or competing private plans. Ryan says that approach would rein in spiraling medical costs that threaten the program's solvency in coming decades. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that one version of Ryan's plan, passed by the House last year, would increase retirees' out-of-pocket medical costs by about $6,400 annually. Democrats argue that the plan would end guaranteed medical coverage for seniors, and have made it a centerpiece of their effort to win back control of the House. With Ryan now on the Republican ticket, independent analysts say it could hurt Romney's chances of winning in retiree-heavy states like Florida. But Ryan's plan might not be as toxic as Democrats think. Between 54 percent and 49 percent of voters surveyed in a June 2011 Reuters/Ipsos poll said would support a Medicare voucher plan, depending on how the question was worded, with relatively little difference in support between Democrats and Republicans.</Msg><Username>giovannijay</Username><Timestamp>1344994825077</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 21:40:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344994827190-267</Id><Title>This Administration is incompetant - cant win on record and resorts to pig slop</Title><Msg>I never thought it would come to this.

Bush/Cheney are historical LOSERS! Paul Ryan a detail LOSER! Thank you for choosing Paul Ryan, Mitt Romney! I won't even raise him to the level of Sen. Goldwater. He will be exposed in detail for who this blinded IDEOLOGUE is all about. He simply is inelectable for governance. If the GOP doesn't see it like they did in 2008 with Sara Palin, then they surely deserve another smack down... but with a greater margin this time. The election is mainly on how trusting are the characters of the candidates and not how deep is their IDIOLOGIC ZEAL. The GOP is doomed to lose and they DESERVE IT! Ryan is just an immature and zealot ideologue.. with a dangerously narrow and one sided perspective. As Belzer just said on Piers Morgan Talk Show... "I don't like both parties... but if America was a bus being driven down the cliff... say in 8 years... Romney and Ryan would do it in 4 years... instead of Democrats doing it in 8 years." I'm independent and find faults in Obama... but I trust him more than most of the masquarading characters now in leadership of the GOP at this time!</Msg><Username>giovannijay</Username><Timestamp>1344996225822</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 22:03:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344996299351-283</Id><Title>Obama Refuses to Denounce What Biden Said</Title><Msg>Sad we have a president and vice president that really believes that stuff.

Yesterday was 13 hours. You ever seen a 13 hour work day? And, I actually have a life - you know, kids to take care of, a spouse, go to the gym now and then to stave off father time as best I can. Sorry that my life is not so dominated by OCD posting that I was not immediately available to respond to your response. Additionally in case you had not noticed, there were a lot of robo posts and besides that a high volume of posts. I did check back for quite a while to see if you responded, but like I said, I have better things to do than wait for you and continually check back through an ever growing list of old posts to see if you would accept my offer to engage in intelligent non-insulting debate, but I see that no, you still cannot resist throwing some cheap shots. I admit that I have thrown a few myself, but if you notice, my posting went crazy suddenly and for a relatively short time... because no matter how nicely I ask people to take their political posting to a more appropriate board so I can interract with people interested in BAC, this board remains dominated and clogged by politics. So I decided to give people a taste of their own medicine. I turned their tactics on them, and they didn't like it. Immature brats who can dish it out but cannot take it - if you can't take the heat, then get out of the kitchen and STOP BEING SUCH BIG CRY BABIES!!!

You threw down, and now you can't or won't back up your big talk. As I said, it's only your reputation, so there's not much at risk. I've done months in a row of 24hrs-on/24-off shifts under combat conditions that would probably wilt you like a daisy, so if you want to talk down to me regarding work ethics you'd better get on a very tall ledge. Thanks to a lifetime of the hard work you extoll, most of it in high-tech test engineering, I don't have to do that kind of gig anymore. I can and DO spend a lot of time on the computer, because I write professionally, not as an amateur, and most of my deadlines are self-imposed. My publishers and editors don't lose any sleep worrying about my schedule or output, and I don't either. Jumping onto this board is a welcome relief from the careful crafting of works ranging from 2500-word articles to 130,000-word works of fiction and non-fiction, sort of a 'bus driver's holiday', if you will. But boxing with you? LMAO one can't hope to inflict much damage on a box of soggy tissue that can't even hit back. Your arrogance is not backed up by even a modicum of debating skills or the capacity to focus on an issue without throwing cans of red herring in all directions. You are a hit-and-run cheap-shot artist, not William F. Buckley, Gore Vidal, or even Oprah Winfrey. Go read my response to your 'Dead Heat' thread, and then either refute it, or admit you're not up to the job. Take all the time you want; I've been such a good boy lately, I'm treating myself to a Berkshire fishing trip tomorrow. You'd make a great addition to the Romney/Ryan team...another 'me first-er', full of himself and devoid of much else except a bloated and unsustainably high opinion of his skills and worth and a head full of Ayn Rand pablum.
