Have you nothing better to do?) 1 minute is good for scalping but mainly if you set it up individually for each stock with 9RSI, horizontal lines (preferably green and red) that define ranges of the RSI in intraday uptrends and downtrends it can be quite accurate at showing swing highs and lows and especially extremes--often having to wait for the next leg that will show a bullish or bearish divergence.

You don`t need to know what my personal tax rate is, but it is lower than it would be in the US. I have to pay some US tax too. I happen to live in the Kanton of Zug (and not far from the city of Zug) which has one of the lowest tax rates in Switzerland. You don´t need to know the exact town I live in. I went Skiing last weekend in Engelberg (Brunni to be exact) which is about 1 1/4 hours from where I live. I drive an Audi A6. Here we call it a Kombi. Just had my tires changed to winter tires back in October (in Art/Goldau--which is Kanton Schwyz, but close to where I live and where the dealer and my mechanic are)--it`s the law here. If you have an accident in the winter without your winter tires on, you are at fault and the insurance will not pay. There are a lot of Biltzkameras (speed cameras--literally flash or lightning camera.) It is very rare that anyone is actually pulled over for speeding. Sometimes the police will sit in an unmarked car with a radar carmera. You get all your tickets in the mail. Same with red lights (they cost you 250 CHF no ifs ands or buts). But your insurance rate doesn`t go up unless you are an extreme flagrant repeat offender. If you go more than 50% over the speed limit (with 5KMH grace), you get your license taken away for 3 months (never happened to me, but to people I know). And the fine on these tickets is levied according to your tax returns. There was a guy in Zurich who was fined somewhere between 250 and 500K CHF--don`t remember the exact figure. I have a freind who was fined 10K. The speed limit on the Autobahn is 120, Landstrasse 80 and in most towns 50. That`s KMH, dummm a zzz, not MPH. (And BTW, there are only some parts of the Autobahn in Germany where there is no speed limit, otherwise it`s 130. A warning beep goes off in my Audi at 160KMH--that`s 100mph--200KMH gets a little uncomfortable for me--even in a nice car. Many people will go 240 (150mph) without thinking about it). There are many multi-millionaires in the town I live in. The banks here have become very skittish about the flow of USD. They are under extreme pressure from the US. That aspect has changed a lot since 2008. The corporate tax rate here is not uniform. Big corporations make special deals with the Bundes-Kantonregierung. Always a pleasure dullsauce. Now, I would recommend that when you and Mason are playing together in the bubble bath again, tonight, that you make some kind of pact between each other to work on your character, your sense of propriety and any mental exercises that might perchance strengthen your ability to distinguish one thing from another--rather than just giggling and popping the stink bubbles as they arise. Hope you have enjoyed the attention, but now I take my leave...</Msg><Username>pmmyv</Username><Timestamp>1357907243754</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 07:27:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357908599396-22</Id><Title>WOW- Texas has 8 billion budget surpus..........on top of 10 billion rainy day fund..........no raise in TAXES....NO state TAX</Title><Msg>TEXAS is the SAUDIs of the WEST.</Msg><Username>urichey</Username><Timestamp>1357908599396</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 07:49:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357908843434-23</Id><Title>WOW- Texas has 8 billion budget surplus..........on top of 10 billion rainy day fund..........no raise in TAXES....NO state TAX</Title><Msg>Texas has cut over spending and DEMS legislature will not even vote for it....Texas is the REPUBLICAN SAUDIs of the WEST.</Msg><Username>urichey</Username><Timestamp>1357908843434</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 07:54:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357908964016-24</Id><Topic><Title>Fine Republican's, strip healthcare from everyone except the wealthy that can afford the premiums....</Title><Username>andym_30054</Username><Timestamp>1357902962786</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 06:16:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Worker bees?

He quotes Michelle Obama on Jarrett’s influence over her husband: “She knows the buttons, the soft spots, the history, the context.” No one outside Michelle has the access or power over Obama’s decision-making like Jarrett does. Here’s an odd little fact that gives some insight into what kind of president Obama is: Michelle, Michelle’s mother, and Valerie, and only a few others in Washington, are allowed to call Barack by his first name. After work, Jarrett joins Obama at night in the Family Quarters, where she dines often with the First Family. She goes on vacation with them. “If it wasn’t for Valerie Jarrett, there’d be no Barack Obama to complain about,” starts Klein’s chapter on Jarrett.

The $1 trillion platinum coin saga took a surprising turn as the Central Bank of Mars has expressed interest in buying 100 of the proposed coins. Interpreters are puzzling over the meaning and subtexts of the Martian communique; since Martian is described as an often-ambiguous combination of Fortran and Hungarian, this is no easy task. Opinion on the Martian offer is divided. Some suspect the Martian Central Bank intends to buy the $100 trillion in platinum coins with electronically created quatloos, i.e. worthless currency. These observers believe the Martians intend to claim the $100 trillion in platinum coins constitutes a claim on the entire U.S.A., the purchase of which would effectively give the Martian Central Bank a massive beachhead on Earth. Others believe the Martian Central Bank is simply playing an interplanetary practical joke, showing that any central bank that issues its own currency can magically create phantom money and assets. What better way to illustrate this than to buy $100 trillion in phantom assets with equally phantom quatloos? A smaller cadre of analysts suspect the Martian Central Bank naively believes the fantasy that the arbitrary creation of assets, either via platinum coins or electronic entries in the Federal Reserve's balance sheet, creates actual value. Though this credulity borders on the fantastic, these analysts point to the many commentators in the U.S. who have bought into the platinum coin fantasy. If Paul Krugman et al. have swallowed the fantasy that something of real value can be created from nothing, then why not the Martian Central Bank? WHY $100 TRILLION NOW??? (because there is over $130 TRILLION IN US DEBT with the liabilities included!!!) The $16 TRILLION is the mantra what is being preached to the lame misinformed public to drink the tainted koolaid but it is much much worse than that!!!</Msg><Username>rhinoinchgo</Username><Timestamp>1357919564454</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 10:52:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357919578475-86</Id><Topic><Title>CA shooter, seeks justice for insensitive comments well libs? deterant to being called a non-trump?</Title><Username>ekonprophet</Username><Timestamp>1357911718708</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 08:41:58 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>hey ekon/shutupstella...can you speak English? put down the crack pipe and try to get sober hold the xanex!</Msg><Username>moron_alarm</Username><Timestamp>1357919578475</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 10:52:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357919583106-87</Id><Topic><Title>Do You Think BAC is a BUY, SELL, or HOLD?</Title><Username>kristina.dunn820e</Username><Timestamp>1357685533692</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 17:52:13 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good job.

But if you'd rather enjoy life purchasing relatively inexpensive shares of companies with excellent future earnings prospects and holding them for the long term until you opt to sell them at large profits, maybe yours isn't such great (or relevant) advice. I'm sure that when BAC shares are priced in the $15 - $18 range later this year, I'm not going to have any recollection of whether it popped or dipped in response to its January earnings announcement--because it won't matter one iota. Different strokes for different folks.

A lot of things vary from Kanton to Kanton (or Canton to Canton or county to county if you prefer the English spelling, id-yet). I live here so I say Kanton all the time. Describe to me what the different speed cameras look like in Zürich or in Luzern? How are they situated? What do the old ones look like? The new ones? How are the ones for red lights situated? What color are the lines for public parking on the street? Tell me what you have to do to get a grocery cart in Zürich (or all of Switzerland for that matter). How are the racked? What are two most common grocery markets in Zürich? And the two lesser know ones that every one that lives here would know? Tell me the different methods for paying for parking on the street in Zürich? What make are most of the taxis in Zürich? And number 2? Do you always have to pay for parking on the street? What are the first words out of a shop keepers mouth when they see you? How do you pronounce it? Do they also speak high German in Zürich or only Swiss German? What is the speed limit on all Autobahns as you enter and leave Zürich city limits? I live an hour from Zürich and seldom go there but I can answer all of these questions and more. What is unique about the elevators in the Zürich airport? What do you see played as a virtual image when you ride the underground train in the Zürich airport? What sounds accompany it? BUSTED? Keep on making yourself look like a fool. Some people just can`t stand the embarrassment of admitting tht they have stepped out on a limb and were wrong and the submerge themselves in their ocean of denial rather than have the dignity to simply say “Oops, I was wrong. Sorry, my bad.” You are one of those people. You had your chance in the beginning after I told you who I was. Now you`ve hung on to your errant notions like a bad trade that`s eating you alive and you are denying the writing on the wall. You have been seriously busted. But I have been the bigger fool for even giving you the time of day--in that case, I guess you got what you wanted. Honestly, I don`t know what`s wrong with people like you and what really drives you. I suppose it`s similar to the thrill a vandal gets when he destroys someone`s property. This is the leveling effect of cyber space. You help make the world just a little bit uglier, jaded and cynical.

This is a public service announcement of some new terms and definitions of the Oxford Concise Dictionary. Please read the following and begin to use the new terms defined: "About 400 new words were added to the 12th edition of the Oxford Concise Dictionary, reflecting the ever-changing nature of the English language. The words added are all now in common usage, but may or may not last to the next edition (remember cassette player? it's so old-fashioned, it's not in this dictionary). Some of the words are well-known to those who follow the news, such as sexting (sending sexual text messages or pictures) and cyberbullying (harassment over the Internet). Others are a bit specialized, such as noob (properly spelled n00b, a shortened form of "newbie" or somebody who's new to a game or forum; usually used in a derogatory sense). The Oxford Concise Dictionary is a much shortened form of the Oxford English Dictionary, which stands as the self-proclaimed exhaustive dictionary of the English language with 600,000 words. The Concise dictionary has "only" 240,000 entries and tries to eliminate words no longer in current usage. In this edition, words that were shown the linguistic door included S-VHS, script kiddie, and brabble (a noisy quarrel). Words that were welcomed include the following: Retweeting: resending somebody's tweet using Twitter Mankini: a one- piece bathing suit for men, with a T-back (think Borat) Jeggings: tight trousers for women that look like denim jeans. Woot: (typically spelled "w00t") an on-line way to say "hooray," typically in a celebratory manner ("w00t! I fragged your n00b butt!") Upcycle: to recycle into something worth more that the original. Masonberry - More common vernacular currently in use - previously "Dingleberry". din·gle·ber·ry (dnggl-br) n. Vulgar Slang 1. A piece of dried feces caught in the hair around the #$%$. 2. An incompetent, foolish, or stupid person. Larryberry - See above definition of Masonberry. Warrenberry - Also see above definition of Masonberry. Stanberry - Also see above definition of Masonberry." Later...
