It was just not being met and people were suffering from not being able to obtain the care they need. It is not just an economic problem. There are other issues in the word besides money. The supply will grow in the private sector to meet the demand now that there will be reward for it. Most other modern industrialized nations have already dealt with this problem. Those who "religiously" care for themselves eventually need care too. You aren't getting out of this world alive. Then you have the hard living, hard drinking, you don't approve of that may out live you even if you didn't approve of their lifestyle. Then there are those that take risk for fun or profit who suffer injury or health problems providing goods, services or entertainment you want.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1367075173597</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-27 11:06:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367075277131-16</Id><Topic><Title>Obamacare increases the demand for healthcare services without</Title><Username>longon2007</Username><Timestamp>1367070086283</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-27 09:41:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Not for the doctors.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1367075277131</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-27 11:07:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367075474299-17</Id><Title>CAN WE TRADE INFO ON ===BAC=== THE COMPANY ???
