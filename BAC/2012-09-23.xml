Peggy Noonan, the Wall Street Journal columnist and former speechwriter for President Ronald Reagan, hasn't been shy about voicing her concerns about Mitt Romney's campaign, but in a Friday column she stepped up her critique. "The Romney campaign has to get turned around," she wrote. "This week I called it incompetent, but only because I was being polite. I really meant 'rolling calamity.'" Noonan is one of several conservative pundits who in recent weeks have spoken out about the Romney campaign's perceived missteps, such as its response to the crisis in Libya and the lack of policy details put forth. The Romney campaign has largely dismissed the criticism, telling the conservative National Review that being unpopular in Washington is more of an advantage than a disadvantage. In her column, Noonan said Romney has the opportunity to gain momentum during the presidential debates. The month between the first debate and Election Day is enough time for a "healthy spiral" to begin, she said. The columnist suggested the campaign should look to James Baker III, who served as chief of staff in both the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations, for inspiration and insight into how to run a campaign. "Mr. Baker's central insight: The candidate can't run the show," Noonan writes. "He can't be the CEO of the campaign and be the candidate. The candidate is out there every day standing for things, fighting for a hearing, trying to get the American people to listen, agree and follow."</Msg><Username>mr.whizzard</Username><Timestamp>1348401339071</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-23 07:55:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348401479816-29</Id><Topic><Title>Have you seen Paul Ryan in the Koch brothers documentary from Netflix?</Title><Username>buckydoodle_5</Username><Timestamp>1348397937297</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-23 06:58:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He said, "only serious responses."</Msg><Username>mr.whizzard</Username><Timestamp>1348401479816</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-23 07:57:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348401632029-30</Id><Topic><Title>Man qualifies to be appointed as a Czar over the United States Forestry Service</Title><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1348401161751</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-23 07:52:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>SW rectal drip aliases are known for their stupidity, so your post is typically stupid.</Msg><Username>mr.whizzard</Username><Timestamp>1348401632029</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-23 08:00:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348401802984-31</Id><Topic><Title>Hypocrite Mitt the Chickenhawk</Title><Username>f.dollarhyde</Username><Timestamp>1348393494190</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-23 05:44:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Mitt was following a family tradition.

The Country of Texas Before you read this, please note that Texas is the only state with a legal right to secede from the Union . (Reference the Texas-American Annexation Treaty of 1848.) And realize that if Texas ever decides to leave, you can bet than many other states will follow. Goodby to the USA as we know it. Don't sit there and say this won't ever happen -- it is an honestly real possibility, given the absolute broken state of politics in the us today. We Texans love y'all, but we'll probably have to take action if Barack Obama wins the election. We'll miss you too. Here is what can happen: 1: Barack Hussein Obama is President of the United States, and Texas secedes from the Union in summer of 2013. 2: George W. Bush will become the President of the Republic of Texas . You might not think that he talks too pretty, but we haven't had another terrorist attack, and the economy was fine until the effects of the Democrats lowering the qualifications for home loans came to roost. So what does Texas have to do to survive as a Republic? 1. NASA is just south of Houston, Texas. We will control the space industry. 2. We refine over 85% of the gasoline in the United States. 3. Defense Industry--we have over 65% of it. The term "Don't mess with Texas," will take on a whole new meaning. 4. Oil - we can supply all the oil that the Republic of Texas will need for the next 300 years. What will the other states do? Gee, we don't know. Why not ask Obama? 5. Natural Gas - again we have all we need, and it's too bad about those Northern States. John Kerry and Al Gore will have to figure out a way to keep them warm.... 6. Computer Industry - we lead the nation in producing computer chips and communications equipment -small companies like Texas Instruments, Dell Computer, EDS, Raytheon, National Semiconductor, Motorola, Intel, AMD, Atmel, Applied Materials, Ball Microconductor, Dallas Semiconductor, Nortel, Alcatel, etc, etc. The list goes on and on. 7. Medical Care - We have the research centers for cancer research, the best burn centers and the top trauma units in the world, as well as other large health centers. The Houston Medical Center alone employees over 65,000 people. 8. We have enough colleges to keep us getting smarter: University ofTexas , Texas A&amp;M, Texas Tech, Texas Christian, Rice, SMU, University of Dallas , University of Houston , Baylor, UNT ( University of North Texas ), Texas Women's University, etc. Ivy grows better in the South anyway. 9. We have an intelligent and energetic work force, and it isn't restricted by a bunch of unions. Here in Texas , it's a Right to Work State and, therefore, it's every man and women for themselves. We just go out and get the job done. And if we don't like the way one company operates, we get a job somewhere else. 10. We have essential control of the paper, plastics, and insurance industries, etc. 11. In case of a foreign invasion, we have the Texas National Guard, the Texas Air National Guard, and several military bases. We don't have an Army, but since everybody down here has at least six rifles and a pile of ammo, we can raise an Army in 24 hours if we need one. If the situation really gets bad, we can always call the Department of Public Safety and ask them to send over the Texas Rangers. 12. We are totally self-sufficient in beef, poultry, hogs, and several types of grain, fruit and vegetables, and let's not forget seafood from the Gulf. Also, everybody down here knows how to cook them so that they taste good. Don't need any food. 13. Three of the ten largest cities in the United States , and twenty- three of the 100 largest cities in the United States, are located in Texas. And Texas also has more land than California, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Maryland, Rhode Island and Vermont combined. 14. Trade: Three of the ten largest ports in the United States are located in Texas. 15. We also manufacture cars down here, but we don't need to. You see, nothing rusts in Texas, so our vehicles stay beautiful and run well for decades. This just names a few of the items that will keep the Republic of Texas in good shape. There isn't a thing out there that we need and don't have. Now to the rest of the United States under President Obama: Since you won't have the refineries to get gas for your cars, only President Obama will be able to drive around in his big 5 mpg SUV. The rest of the United States will have to walk or ride bikes. You won't have any TV as the Space Center in Houston will cut off satellite communications. You won't have any natural gas to heat your homes, but since Mr. Obama has predicted global warming, you will not need the gas as long as you survive the 2000 years it will take to get enough heat from Global Warming. Signed, The People of Texas P.S. This is not a threatening letter - just a note to give you something to think about!

GM would have gone through a bankruptcy reorg, according to the laws that fairly govern reorganizations... not by government officials violating the laws that investors have relied upon for decades to decide how much risk they want to take in their investments (common stock vs preferred stock vs trust preferred stock vs various types of debt). It is a total falacy to say that GM would have gone out of business had it went through bankruptcy. Just another Obama and liar lib campaign lie.</Msg><Username>mrstan4089</Username><Timestamp>1348417200386</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-23 12:20:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348417520343-112</Id><Topic><Title>Where is Obama's grades</Title><Username>value_lnvestorr</Username><Timestamp>1348414880756</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-23 11:41:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama is trying to get a statement from his third grade teacher rather than releasing his grades - he's going to convince the liar libs that's the same as an audit letter from one of the world's most prominent CPA firms.</Msg><Username>mrstan4089</Username><Timestamp>1348417520343</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-23 12:25:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348417629418-113</Id><Topic><Title>Democratagogue: Cunning, uncouth, and unprincipled, democratagogues appeal directly to the emotions of the poor and ignorant, pursuing power with ruthless ambition, telling lies to stir up hysteria, exploiting crises to intensify popular support for their calls to immediate action and increased authority.</Title><Username>mrstan4089</Username><Timestamp>1348416484446</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-23 12:08:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Exactly;...it's the way "commies" take control over the ignorant masses.

Libs would rather re-elect a loser that will destroy the country than admit that they are misguided. Obama speaks with the tone and cadence of an evangelical preacher. Dems at the convention looked at him with drunken zomby gaze like he was a messiah. If he wins, we're headed for a disaster and a big job for the next (Republican) president to clean up.
