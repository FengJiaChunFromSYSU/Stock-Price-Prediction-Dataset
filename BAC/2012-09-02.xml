The american dream for a democrat is a level playing field where even a working man knows he is paying his fair share and so is the guy he is working for. The American dream for an illegal immigrant is the chance to come here and prove he has some value to the society and hope that it is recognized and he is allowed to stay. The American dream promises that your religion nor lack of a belief has no bearing on your place in society and neither does your choice of sex partners, skin color or gender. All men created equal, not just those that agree with your ideas. Democrats have fought in large numbers to perpetuate this dream far and wide while the elite of recent years found ways to avoid the perils of war for themselves and their families. That includes fighting chinese in both Korea and Vietnam. It was your mentor Nixon that opened the door with China and Reagan and Bush that sold them the nation to finance trickle down economics so their friends could have tax cuts. Only your broadened definition of socialism which is normally defined as government ownership of all business allows you to think of the safety net that has protected our seniors and made us the most prosperous nation in the world from 1947 to 2008 as socialism.

Carney made his comments while berating reporters for not realizing that “the rate of spending — federal spending — increase is lower under President Obama than all of his predecessors since Dwight Eisenhower, including all of his Republican predecessors.” He cited as his source an article by Rex Nutting, of MarketWatch, titled, “Obama spending binge never happened,” which has been the subject of lots of buzz in the liberal blogosphere. But we are talking about the federal budget here. That means lots of numbers — numbers that are easily manipulated. Let’s take a look. The Facts First of all, there are a few methodological problems with Nutting’s analysis — especially the beginning and the end point. Nutting basically takes much of 2009 out of Obama’s column, saying it was the “the last [year] of George W. Bush’s presidency.” Of course, with the recession crashing down, that’s when federal spending ramped up. The federal fiscal year starts on Oct. 1, so the 2009 fiscal year accounts for about four months of Bush’s presidency and eight of Obama’s. In theory, one could claim that the budget was already locked in when Obama took office, but that’s not really the case. Most of the appropriations bills had not been passed, and certainly the stimulus bill was only signed into law after Obama took office. Bush had rescued Fannie and Freddie Mac and launched the Troubled Asset Relief Program, which depending on how you do the math, was a one-time expense of $250 billion to $400 billion in the final months of his presidency. (The federal government ultimately recouped most of the TARP money.) So if you really want to be fair, perhaps $250 billion of that money should be taken out of the equation — on the theory that it would have been spent no matter who was president. Nutting acknowledges that Obama is responsible for some 2009 spending but only assigns $140 billion for reasons he does not fully explain. (Update: in an email Nutting says he attributed $120 billion to stimulus spending in 2009, $5 billion for an expansion of children’s health care and $16 billion to an increase in appropriations bills over 2008 levels.) On the other end of his calculations, Nutting says that Obama plans to spend $3.58 trillion in 2013, citing the Congressional Budget Office budget outlook. But this figure is CBO’s baseline budget, which assumes no laws are changed, so this figure gives Obama credit for automatic spending cuts that he wants to halt. The correct figure to use is the CBO’s analysis of the president’s 2013 budget, which clocks in at $3.72 trillion. So this is what we end up with: 2008: $2.98 trillion 2009: $3.27 trillion 2010: $3.46 trillion 2011: $3.60 trillion 2012: $3.65 trillion 2013: $3.72 trillion Under these figures, and using this calculator, with 2008 as the base year and ending with 2012, the compound annual growth rate for Obama’s spending starting in 2009 is 5.2 percent. Starting in 2010 — Nutting’s first year — and ending with 2013, the annual growth rate is 3.3 percent. (Nutting had calculated the result as 1.4 percent.) Of course, it takes two to tangle — a president and a Congress. Obama’s numbers get even higher if you look at what he proposed to spend, using CBO’s estimates of his budgets: 2012: $3.71 trillion (versus $3.65 trillion enacted) 2011: $3.80 trillion (versus $3.60 trillion enacted) 2010: $3.67 trillion (versus $3.46 trillion enacted) So in every case, the president wanted to spend more money than he ended up getting. Nutting suggests that federal spending flattened under Obama, but another way to look at it is that it flattened at a much higher, post-emergency level — thanks in part to the efforts of lawmakers, not Obama. Another problem with Nutting’s analysis is that the figures are viewed in isolation. Even 5.5 percent growth would put Obama between Bill Clinton and George W. Bush in terms of spending growth, but that does not take into account either inflation or the relative size of the U.S. economy. At 5.2 percent growth, Obama’s increase in spending would be nearly three times the rate of inflation. Meanwhile, Nutting pegs Ronald Reagan with 8.7 percent growth in his first term — we get 12.5 percent CAGR — but inflation then was running at 6.5 percent. One common way to measure federal spending is to compare it to the size of the overall U.S. economy. That at least puts the level into context, helping account for population growth, inflation and other factors that affect spending. Here’s what the White House’s own budget documents show about spending as a percentage of the U.S. economy (gross domestic product): 2008: 20.8 percent 2009: 25.2 percent 2010: 24.1 percent 2011: 24.1 percent 2012: 24.3 percent 2013: 23.3 percent In the post-war era, federal spending as a percentage of the U.S. economy has hovered around 20 percent, give or take a couple of percentage points. Under Obama, it has hit highs not seen since the end of World War II — completely the opposite of the point asserted by Carney. Part of this, of course, is a consequence of the recession, but it is also the result of a sustained higher level of spending. We sent our analysis to Carney but did not get a response. (For another take, Daniel Mitchell of the Cato Institute has an interesting tour through the numbers, isolating various spending categories. For instance, he says debt payments should be excluded from the analysis because that is the result of earlier spending decisions by other presidents.) UPDATE: The Associated Press also dug into the numbers and came to the same conclusion as we did. “The problem with that rosy claim is that the Wall Street bailout is part of the calculation. The bailout ballooned the 2009 budget just before Obama took office, making Obama’s 2010 results look smaller in comparison. And as almost $150 billion of the bailout was paid back during Obama’s watch, the [Nutting] analysis counted them as government spending cuts,” the AP said. “It also assumes Obama had less of a role setting the budget for 2009 than he really did.” The Pinocchio Test Carney suggested the media were guilty of “sloth and laziness,” but he might do better next time than cite an article he plucked off the Web, no matter how much it might advance his political interests. The data in the article are flawed, and the analysis lacks context — context that could easily could be found in the budget documents released by the White House. The White House might have a case that some of the rhetoric concerning Obama’s spending patterns has been overblown, but the spokesman should do a better job of checking his facts before accusing reporters of failing to do so. The picture is not as rosy as he portrayed it when accurate numbers, taken in context, are used.</Msg><Username>tulsaturd</Username><Timestamp>1346599293895</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 11:21:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346600033673-67</Id><Topic><Title>Did Mitt Ronmey show his taxes yet,,what is he hiding??</Title><Username>webber3240</Username><Timestamp>1346590876788</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 09:01:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Capitalism is the unequal distribution of wealth," Capitalism is the creator of wealth.

If your only measurement for growth is dollars spent then you have a poor grasp on economics. In the first place it is the responsibility of the government to step in and spend during recessions or depressions to promote recovery. So anytime there is a downturn you will see increased spending be it Reagan, FDR GWB or Obama. Growth of government would be new agencies more hiring and government payroll. That has been sharply curtailed under Obama. It is nice that you point out that only by trying to push all of the Bush spending as an Obama responsibility is it possible to make the claims so frequently made about the amount Obama has spent. Still the missive above wants to downplay the seriousness of the economic condition that Obama found himself saddled with by the previous administration as though it somehow could be alleviated in 6 to 8 months. We are still suffering with the product of Bush tax cuts and deficit spending that built a massive debt that every president now has to pay debt service on in addition to trying to provides for the basic legitimate economic needs of the country. Now are we going to talk about growth of government or government spending? They are not the same.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1346600423491</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 11:40:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346600461089-71</Id><Title>Oil prices aren't right due to too much oil in the market</Title><Msg>Oil prices aren't right due to too much oil in the market. 28-August-12 07:23 am Many analysts say oil prices aren't right due to too much oil in the market. “The economic price for (West Texas Intermediate) oil is in the $50-$60 range,” said Mickey Cargile, managing partner at Cargile Investments, basing his estimate on where he sees supplies locally and in Cushing, Okla., the delivery hub for Nymex oil. “Our range valuation suggests a 20%-30% risk premium price d for potential supply disruption from Iran,” he said.

"There has been no shortage of oil in the market. Producers have been able to meet consumer needs," Abdullah al-Badri told an energy conference. "We also see this as being the case for the rest of 2012 and the foreseeable future." Oil prices surged in March to $128 a barrel, the highest level since 2008, because of concern about possible supply shortages. Prices have since fallen back and brent crude was trading around $118 on Thursday. "Today the price continues to be driven by excessive speculation," Badri said. OPEC at a meeting in December set a target to produce 30 million barrels per day, settling an argument which broke out in 2011 after Iran and other members opposed a Saudi-led plan to raise OPEC's production ceiling. Output has remained above the target all year as Libyan supply recovered after being virtually shut down during the 2011 uprising against Muammar Gaddafi's rule. The extra oil is filling gaps caused by an unusually large number of supply outages globally, which have also helped support prices. Supply breaks were running at nearly 1.3 million bpd as of early April. The additional supply has also offset a decline in exports from Iran, which is facing stiffening western sanctions over its disputed nuclear energy program. Iranian oil exports were running at between 200,000 and 300,000 barrels per day below last year's level, Maria van der Hoeven, head of the International Energy Agency, told Thursday's conference. Iranian officials have said the country exported an average of 2.2 million barrels a day last year. July supply from the 12-member Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ran at 31.75 million barrels per day (bpd), the high est since September 2008, which was shortly before it agreed to a series of supply curbs to combat recession and collapsing demand, based on Reuters surveys</Msg><Username>fairvalue23</Username><Timestamp>1346600510420</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 11:41:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346600560590-73</Id><Title>"There has been no shortage of oil in the market"</Title><Msg>"There has been no shortage of oil in the market" OPEC Says Supply Ample, Speculation Driving Price , | 28 August 2012 | 06:18 AM ET Oil supply will be more than sufficient to meet demand this year and beyond, OPEC's Secretary General said on Thursday, but added the price of fuel is being driven higher by speculation.

Naimi Says Brent Oil Should Drop to $80.00 as Supply Tops Demand By Ben Sharples - June 03, 2012 Crude prices should fall because global supply is outweighing demand, according to Saudi Arabia’s oil minister, Ali al-Naimi. “We want a lower price than where it is now,” al-Naimi said in Adelaide today. “We need to get the price to a level of around $80” a barrel for London’s Brent crude, he said. Saudi Arabia is the world’s biggest oil exporter. Brent, a benchmark price for more than half the world’s crude, has dropped 6 percent this month amid concern Europe’s debt crisis will worsen and curb fuel demand. OPEC is working to bring prices down, the group’s Secretary-General, Abdalla el- Badri, said May 3. The producer group, scheduled to meet next month, is pumping 8.3 percent more crude than it considers necessary this quarter, figures from the Vienna-based group show. Brent crude for June settlement dropped 0.8 percent in the week to May 11 to $112.26 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. West Texas Intermediate oil for June delivery slid 2.4 percent to $96.13 a barrel. At $100 a barrel for London’s Brent crude, that equates to around $80.00 a barrel for West Texas Intermediate oil. The average price for gasoline in the U.S.A would drop to $2.80 per gallon. Oil supply outweighs demand by 1.3 million to 1.5 million barrels a day, al-Naimi said today.

ABC News reports that the event, which did not appear on any public calenders, was meant to thank those who have already contributed more than $1 million to Romney’s campaign. Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell was scheduled to speak to the roughly 50 guests, including energy billionaire Wilbur Ross, elite Republican fundraiser Mel Sembler, and Romney’s older brother, Scott. Presumably, no “nails ladies” were invited. Several other guests covered their name tags as they exited the yacht to prevent ABC News from identifying them. The luxury yacht, called “Cracker Bay,” is registered in the Cayman Islands and flies the British territory’s civil ensign. This raises an uncomfortable comparison for Romney, who has at least 12 accounts worth up to $30 million in the Cayman Islands. Cracker Bay was almost certainly registered in the Caymans for the exact same reason that Romney has stashed his money there: To avoid paying taxes on it. The episode is a potential messaging disaster for Romney. As Republicans inside the convention try to convince a skeptical public that they are committed to protecting the middle class, their standard-bearer hosts a party for millionaires on a tax-free luxury yacht just outside. That image will certainly be comign soon to a Democratic attack ad near you.</Msg><Username>giovannijay</Username><Timestamp>1346605695324</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 13:08:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346606238770-83</Id><Title>Where is the SHOVEL READY JOBS</Title><Msg>Where did THE STIMULUS MONEY go????????</Msg><Username>urichey</Username><Timestamp>1346606238770</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 13:17:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346606335229-84</Id><Topic><Title>What Africans think of mrstan</Title><Username>lying_teabag_sakkk_sukkker</Username><Timestamp>1346595056911</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 10:10:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Oh, wow, you are SO CLEVER!

Obama stopped the Keystone pipeline for two reasons: one to make his best friend Warren Buffet richer (Buffet's railroad would loose some oil hauling business) and two, to get the EPA vote. Obama decided to throw the middle class under the bus by killing potential jobs as well as supporting increased gas prices that translate to higher food prices. 2. Obama is the first president in US history to lose AAA via a reckless fiscal policy. 3. Obama is thankful to Bernake for buying $2.3 trillion of US debt/Treasury Bonds (which is one US govt branch buying the debt of another US branch) to enable Obama’s insatiable spending on the likes of Solyndra (bankrupt), GM (losing about 50% of our taxpayer money to purchase GM at its peak stock price), C and AIG (we still own about 60% of AIG) that have turned out to be awful investments. Now we are stuck with an extra $2.3 tril national debt. 4. In Obama's best judgment of character, he selected Corzine to manage the $1 trillion stimulus. Now Corzine and his hedge fund company are on trial for potentially using client’s funds in an illegal manor. Where did this stimulus money go? 5. In Obama's best judgment, he appointed a chief employment advisor from the private sector who's company paid $0 taxes on tens of billions in profits offset by Obama tax breaks. Shortly after accepting this appointment, Obama's chief employment advisor closed a US plant, layed off US workers and built a plant overseas to outsource US jobs. 6. Bernake claims he created 2 million jobs by spending $4.3 trillion on treasury bonds and unwanted bank mortgages. That equates to a cost of $2.1 million per job. Obama also claims creating the same jobs. So who is lying about who really created the jobs? Plus who wants to claim this result when it took when it took $2.1 million to create each job? 7. Obama admits failure on the "shovel ready" projects that were NOT "shovel ready". Where did the money go? 8. Obama a flip-flopper or just plain deceptive? Obama firmly supports gay marriage to get their vote but won’t discuss this as part of his re-election campaign because he is worried about losing moderate voters. 9. In 2008 Obama campaigned on open communications to the public. Why is Obama holding "off site" meetings so those discussions won’t be part of the Whitehouse records? One can only assume he is doing something that would be deemed at the least unpresidential or maybe even illegal that he does not want in the Whitehouse records. 10. How does Obama explain the disconnect of a stock market that is higher now than before the financial crisis, yet unemployment is still over 8% and housing prices have not rebounded for the same period? Obama claims to be for the middle class, but under his administration he has created record Wall Street millionaires and billionaire offset by a record number of people on welfare, all paid for by the schmuck middle class via higher prices at the pump and higher food prices related to QE1, QE2, Operation Twist and potential QE3.</Msg><Username>raebeht</Username><Timestamp>1346606839347</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 13:27:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346606923847-88</Id><Topic><Title>Romney's Millionaires Donors Party On Cayman Islands Yacht</Title><Username>giovannijay</Username><Timestamp>1346605695324</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 13:08:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>.....yet there are still multitudes eager to vote against their own best interests.

"I think you're going to see a lot more legislative action and suggestion aimed at reducing the size and compensation of that federal workforce and retirees." Connolly said the notion that federal government is over sized is misplaced. "Facts be damned: There's a lot of rhetoric on the other side about the growth of the federal workforce, but it's about the size it was under the first President Bush," he said. "There hasn't really been a lot of net growth in the federal workforce when you compare it to say, 1990. It's not like it's gotten out of hand, it's true." Is it really? According to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, in 1990 total government employment -- including all branches and uniformed military personnel -- was 5.23 million. By 2009, that number dropped to 4.43 million. If we exclude military personnel, the number fell from 3.128 million in 1990 to 2.84 million in 2009. After years of decline, those workforce numbers did begin to rise in 2008. To get a more current read, we turned to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which has preliminary figures as recent as November 2010. According to BLS data, total federal government employment was 3.103 million in January 1990. Preliminary numbers for November 2010 are 2.837 million.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1346610394460</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 14:26:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346610573340-117</Id><Title>BAC'S CREATIVE ACCOUNTING WILL LAST ONLY SO LONG!!!

When he took office in January 2009, there were about 2,064,000 federal workers, excluding the Postal Service. Last month may2012, there were 2,202,400 such federal employees, an increase of 6.7 percent. Read more: Obama denies presiding over 'bloated government' - Washington Times The fact is government spending of 24% of gdp is too high even democrats agree it needs to get down to the post WW2 average of 20% or it along with all the debt increases the likelihood of a debt panic. Obama on the other hand proposed more government spending to "create" jobs. I guess that is all he knows but the government is broke. Deficit spending by the government when the balance sheet is perilous at best is actually more destructive than doing nothing. In other words you can't solve debt with more debt.

So I decided to give them a taste of their own medicine by posting equally stupid rants in the other direction. Then came the stupid political rants clogging up the board. I asked nicely for people to take that elsewhere, but it remained. So now I am doing the same thing with that, not ever expecting it to go away, but at least I thought I could raise the idiots' blood pressures and have some fun mocking them.

Looking at only direct federal employment is not a good judge of the size of government either when you have so many businesses and organizations receiving subsidies and aid from the government. End the aid and the job vanishes. This practice has increased markedly under Obama. There are more people dependent on big government aid in terms of welfare, food stamps, unemployment compensation and the like. Again hardly small government.

No amount of appearing with there rich wives or elderly mothers will solve it. Hogue CNn "Then, in a deluge of red, white and blue balloons, the pretty show ended and the workers began to dismantle the Mirage, leaving the harsh sunlight of the day-after to reveal the intractable reality of what a Romney-Ryan presidency would mean for American women. Women voters care most about the economy and jobs. But with a critical caveat: nine out of 10 women say that a candidate must "understand women." To do that requires an acknowledgment of two things: that women's economic security -- by almost every measure -- still lags behind that of male counterparts and that their economic security is inextricably tied to their ability to control their health, including reproductive choices. And on those points, no illusions and tradesman's tricks can obscure the fact that the GOP agenda fails the test. A July National Women's Law Center report showed that the 2007 Bush recession cost nearly 7.5 million jobs and recovery has been slow to reach women workers. Public sector job loss drives this disparity. While Romney's jobs plan is still notoriously vague, with little to offer other than a regressive nod to trickle-down economics, Paul Ryan has been frighteningly clear that his top priority is essentially dismantling our government -- a fixation projected to result in a whopping 4.1 million lost jobs over two years. Even the lucky few women who hold or get jobs under a Romney-Ryan administration are likely to be paid far less for equal work. In the aggregate, women are paid on average 77 cents on the dollar to men, but Romney still refuses to support the Lilly Ledbetter Pay Check Fairness Act."</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1346628230274</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 19:23:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346628607965-183</Id><Title>Paul Ryan offers mrstan a job</Title><Msg>(ring-ring) mrstan: "Hello?"

Four years later in that same area, mines are closed, people are out of work, and Obama pandered to the environmentalists, saying that he would bankrupt anybody that tried to start a new coal mining operation.

Oh, that's right data doesn't count unless it is in your favor. Give it up. No one is accepting your cherry picked time period that forces Obama to accept responsibility for the Bush debacle. For little z, that is net jobs. Employment has gone up and mostly in the private sector for over the past two years even if it is barely keeping up with worker population growth.

In fact, the opposite is true: While the Obama administration and the EPA may be taking a harder look at mountain top removal mining permits, a quick look at coal mining employment in West Virginia reveals that since Obama took office in the winter of 2009 coal mining employment has grown by over 1,500 jobs or by 7.4%. If we measure from the end of the national recession in June 2009 (or the 2nd Quarter of 2009) to the third-quarter of 2011 (the latest available data), employment in the coal mining industry has grown by 3,100.

Defense is by far the largest employer among cabinet-level agencies, making up 40% of all federal employees. Second, the growth in the size of the federal workforce is concentrated in just a few agencies, with Defense, Veterans Affairs, and Homeland Security seeing the largest increases in staffing. Other agencies, such as the departments of Agriculture, Housing and Urban Development, and Treasury, have seen much slower growth in staffing levels; the Agriculture staff, for example, has seen a growth in staff of just 0.96% since 2007. Viewed from this perspective, the federal workforce has remained remarkably stagnant over the past decade: both in September 2001 and in September 2011, federal workers represented 1.26% of the total civilian labor force. In sum, the data on recent trends in federal employment show that while the size of the federal workforce is growing, its proportion of the total civilian labor force is not. Federal employees have remained at or around 1.2% of the total labor force for at least a decade and, given the hiring freeze that has been in place in many agencies, are unlikely to grow much higher. Furthermore, the increases in staffing that we have seen are largely concentrated in just a few agencies. At the very least, this suggests that a one-size-fits-all approach to reducing the federal workforce could have disproportionate effects on some agencies more so than others.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1346634302166</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 21:05:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346634338424-223</Id><Topic><Title>mrstan can't answer right now.

The project was financed with $1.5 billion from J.P. Morgan. Then in April 2010, the BP-operated Deepwater Horizon rig in the Gulf exploded while drilling a well into a previously unexplored reservoir. In response, the Obama administration ordered moratoria on deep-water drilling and barred consideration of new permits. As a result, the ATP operation was shut down. ATP has now struck back by filing a lawsuit alleging that the Interior Department “improperly and illegally suspended all deep-water offshore drilling activities and imposed two illegal moratoria on the deep-water drilling permit application process and then unreasonably and unlawfully delayed the issuance of drilling permits after the lifting of the formal moratoria.” ATP is essentially asserting that the government breached its offshore leases with ATP by violating the Administrative Procedure Act in two ways, according to the Heritage Foundation report written by Hans von Spakovsky and Nicolas Loris: “By issuing overbroad moratoria, and by manipulating seven experts from the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) to bolster a recommendation for the moratoria.” They also point out that all seven NAE experts denied supporting moratoria recommendations, and a previous court case concluded that a White House official had changed the report used to justify the moratoria. The authors write: “ATP’s lawsuit provides a revealing glimpse into the capital-intensive oil and gas industry where unfair and illegal actions by a government agency can cost companies (and the U.S. economy) enormous sums of money.” Opening the outer continental shelf to drilling, they add, “would generate hundreds of thousands of new jobs, generate hundreds of billions of dollars in government revenue, and bring more oil to the world market, thereby lowering gas prices.”</Msg><Username>obamistan</Username><Timestamp>1346643311307</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 23:35:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346643577564-250</Id><Topic><Title>Lawsuit: Obama Is ‘Illegally’ Thwarting Offshore Drilling</Title><Username>obamistan</Username><Timestamp>1346643311307</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 23:35:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>THat was very messy with that oil spilll...

They threw one of their own under a bus over a stupid gaffe. First, they condemned Akin, and then they attacked him. First, Mitt sent errand boy Ryan to ask Akin to step down. That did not work. Then the GOP monied elite took away all of Akin's campaign funds. That did not work. Then the old school republican heavy-weights piled on to arm twist Akin into dropping out. That did not work. Then Mitt piled on. And, that did not work either. The republicans are inept cowards that would rather eat their young rather than take a chance on losing THE senate seat that MAY give them a senate majority. Lots of "ifs" had to line up with the planets. Instead of chastising Akin, and then moving on, they tried to "murder" (Karl Rove's expression) him. What a bunch of pathetic, inept cowards.</Msg><Username>frankmangus</Username><Timestamp>1346643901613</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 23:45:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346644127439-255</Id><Topic><Title>Lawsuit: Obama Is ‘Illegally’ Thwarting Offshore Drilling</Title><Username>obamistan</Username><Timestamp>1346643311307</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 23:35:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>sorry gentleman I didn't mean to use the b word- historical context here only</Msg><Username>franklincarter95</Username><Timestamp>1346644127439</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 23:48:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346644315539-256</Id><Topic><Title>Draft Dodger.

So, he was telling us that Harvard Lawyer Obama is a bad choice but Harvard Lawyer Romney who also happens to be tax cheat would make good president. 2. Obama did not learn from Russia's war with Afghanistan. So, am I supposed to believe that Obama started Afghanistan War? Thank you Mr. Eastwood. You Made my day by talking to Invisible Obama.
