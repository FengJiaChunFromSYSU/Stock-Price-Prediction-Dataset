Read this Article about Disney World</Title><Msg>"It's being reported as the one percenters behaving 100 per cent despicably. Wealthy New York parents are reportedly hiring people with disabilities to pose as family members so theycan jump queues at Disney World. The New York Post reports that "black-market Disney guides" cost $130 an hour or $1040 for an eight-hour day. Disney allows each guest who needs a wheelchair or motorized scooter to bring up to six guests to a “more convenient entrance.” The Post quotes one overprivileged - but unnamed - mother who boasted of queue jumping after hiring a disabled guide through Dream Tours Florida. "My daughter waited one minute to get on 'It's a Small World' — the other kids had to wait two and a half hours. "You can't go to Disney without a tour concierge," she sniffed. "This is how the one percent does Disney."""""</Msg><Username>bubba836</Username><Timestamp>1368594243849</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 01:04:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368594689131-4</Id><Topic><Title>Our taxes used recklessly In Israel</Title><Username>pat_buchanan62</Username><Timestamp>1368563250424</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 16:27:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>pat_buchanan62 is the same guy a MF #$%$ the mosaad is already after him, they will get him soon,</Msg><Username>stevens1958</Username><Timestamp>1368594689131</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 01:11:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368594957180-5</Id><Title>Do You Think the Vatican's Bank is used for Money Laundering?</Title><Msg>Does the mafia control the Vatican's bank?</Msg><Username>bubba836</Username><Timestamp>1368594957180</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 01:15:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368595481482-6</Id><Title>BAC will not go higher</Title><Msg>It is time to think about bear</Msg><Username>shirazi2001us</Username><Timestamp>1368595481482</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 01:24:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368599870056-7</Id><Topic><Title>BAC will not go higher</Title><Username>shirazi2001us</Username><Timestamp>1368595481482</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 01:24:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you will say that no matter what price it is. as you are probably a short, or new to this and think just because it reached 52week high means it will start tanking. this is still trading far below book value at like 0.65x $13.34 is still a bargain and time is on our side. as more and more lawsuits are untangled, settled, their is no limit of this stock going back to $20s</Msg><Username>frankkuorch</Username><Timestamp>1368599870056</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 02:37:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368599967307-8</Id><Topic><Title>BAC will not go higher</Title><Username>shirazi2001us</Username><Timestamp>1368595481482</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 01:24:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wang Dang.

Merrill Lynch now expects gross domestic product in 2013 to expand by 7.6% from 8%. Merrill Lynch held off on cutting its forecasts after weak data in March and in the first quarter, but after "recalibrating base effects and taking into account sluggish external demand, we have changed our minds," wrote economists led by Ting Lu in a report Tuesday. They said they see "continued headwinds for China-related asset prices on flattish (or slightly falling) year-over-year growth." Merrill Lynch also reduced its 2014 GDP projection to 7.6% from 7.7%, and noted its forecasts are below consensus of around 7.8% to 8% for this year and next.</Msg><Username>sp500crash</Username><Timestamp>1368610818784</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 05:40:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368612698554-22</Id><Title>BAC.....Can not go HIGHER ?</Title><Msg>If anyone think that BAC can not go higher , go ahead SHORT IT ....and ready for margin call !</Msg><Username>quatluu</Username><Timestamp>1368612698554</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 06:11:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368613601961-23</Id><Topic><Title>BAC.....Can not go HIGHER ?</Title><Username>quatluu</Username><Timestamp>1368612698554</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 06:11:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I would like to see a pull back to add more.....</Msg><Username>annett_sit_stain</Username><Timestamp>1368613601961</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 06:26:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368614318552-24</Id><Topic><Title>Gold will always be gold... what will your paper stock certificates ever be but paper!</Title><Username>andym_30054</Username><Timestamp>1368585126390</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 22:32:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I have a gold bar and you have a BAC stock certificate....see which is more fungible when the bubble gets popped!

They have stupidly passed control on gun rights to possess therein leaving only the criminals with guns. Further, in places where there is a right to carry gun crime is down over 69% which is only a national average. One city in Georgia has a mandate that each household must own a gun, and their gun crime is down 100%! One very effective way to control gun violence is to pass a "stop and search" law . This would allow police to take guns away from punks in the inner-cities where there is so much violence. Those who doubt this are libs seeking votes and others suffering from"severe cranial rectal insertion",..a disease common to most libs anyway.</Msg><Username>dfaduke</Username><Timestamp>1368622957165</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 09:02:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368623130389-48</Id><Topic><Title>The hypocrisy of Benghazi is that more people are dying in the USA daily</Title><Username>reggie.thoma</Username><Timestamp>1368584734714</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 22:25:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Let me see...

If "investigation" meant making up "facts" and omitting truth, then that was what investigative journalism was from 2002-2008. At least a lot of it. The slant went from detectable to blindingly obvious. It was so incredibly over the top that useful idiots like yourself were caught up in the fervor and are now deranged. Everything Bush did was under scrutiny. And then came obama. Suddenly, nothing could be asked, reported, or exposed no matter what he did, no matter how bad it looked, no matter the demonstrated incompetence or ill intent, no matter how much it hurt the country. Everything was to be whitewashed to keep the 21st century's dirtiest political thug looking clean, even with the worst-ever case of dry rot just under the surface. Again, that was for benefit of the useful idiots.

Detestable.</Msg><Username>cconstantinl</Username><Timestamp>1368638101741</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 13:15:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368639138200-112</Id><Topic><Title>$20 within next 3 months</Title><Username>bncm123</Username><Timestamp>1368634130763</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 12:08:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I don't think you're going to get that close to book value. If you took the cue from C, trading at about 82% of book, this stock at the same levels would be a little over $16.50. If you used JPM as your guide, it could trade up to $19.79. But it has to get out from under the mortgage mess. Would be awesome if it could trade more like WFC - under that price/book the shares would be at $28.

CCUR's EPS has been ramping up faster than any other small-cap technology stock with their quarterly GAAP EPS rising over the past year on a quarter-to-quarter basis from $0.02, to $0.04, to $0.08, and to $0.11. CCUR is currently only $7.09 with 8.75mm o/s, a market cap of $62.07mm, cash of $22.37mm, an enterprise value of $39.7mm, and revenue of $63.23mm. CCUR is the pay-TV industry's #1 VOD and multi-screen technology company with clients including Time Warner Cable, Cox, Charter, Bright House, and Virgin Media. CCUR's new CDN technology allows pay-TV operators to combine their classic VOD infrastructure with their new IP-based networks to deliver VOD content to tablets, smartphones, and other IP connected devices, while quickly and cost effectively expanding the number of on demand videos they can offer. CCUR's CDN technology is now delivering VOD content to the iOS and Android smartphones/tablets of Time Warner Cable's 12mm subscribers! CCUR's closest rivals are Seachange (SEAC), which has gross margins of 52% and an enterprise value/revenue ratio of 1.65, and Harmonic (HLIT), which has gross margins of 46% and an enterprise value/revenue ratio of 0.90. CCUR has much higher gross margins of 59% and is insanely undervalued with an enterprise value/revenue ratio of only 0.63. CCUR now has record high trailing GAAP EPS of $0.25 while SEAC and HLIT have trailing GAAP EPS losses. CCUR needs to hit a new 52-week high of $9+ to match HLIT's multiple and $14.47 to reach SEAC's multiple!</Msg><Username>goodwe212</Username><Timestamp>1368671403266</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 22:30:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368672169654-224</Id><Title>Nothing to Justify 90 day $30 billion runup or 1 Day $5 billion Run-up -Crash Tonight</Title><Msg>Will be down 4,000 points in a day soon.</Msg><Username>updownbuysell</Username><Timestamp>1368672169654</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 22:42:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368674017334-225</Id><Topic><Title>$20 within next 3 months</Title><Username>bncm123</Username><Timestamp>1368634130763</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 12:08:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Unfortunately I have to agree. The worst is over but this stock has left a trail of disappointment over the last 5 years for anyone expecting a sprint to high levels.
