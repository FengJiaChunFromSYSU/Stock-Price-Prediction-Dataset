I thought I was watching two organized crime syndicates wage a bloody turf war while making no effort to limit civilian casualties. The usual bleating from the sheep has already begun......"Vote out all incumbents!" "Strict term limits!" "Congress sux!" Thank goodness The Donald is still around to straighten everyone out. Did you catch the little human interest piece in the Times this morning, "4 ex-NSA officials meet with Snowden, praise his efforts to unmask NSA information gathering"? ROTFLMAO Anonymous continues to impress me with their operational capabilities and reach. Combined with the gridlock in DC, the war in Syria, and the Nobel prize Kabuki show, this latest dog-and-pony show should provide enough distractions (and lend enough credibility to our Igloo doppelganger) to allow the Staggerwing and its precious cargo to flee Russian airspace before Snowden's dad shows up and blows the lid off the ersatz Igloo. Vlad the Inhaler was kind enough to issue special transit papers for the freshly-painted Model 17, which now sports Russian medical aid markings and desert camo over its SR71 radar-absorbent paint and Jolly Rogers. Permission was granted for an exit from the Georgian Republic into Turkish airspace, ostensibly for a two-pronged diplomatic mission: the return of important Turkish historical and cultural artifacts to the Turkish government (those vintage virgin meerschaums), and a humanitarian relief flight into Syria. The end game draws near. After reaching Eskisehir, the Beech will once again divert from its filed flight plan (which is getting to be either a habit or S.O.P.). ROTFLMAO let's just say won't be visiting Damascus anytime soon.

Can't you find other message boards for talking politics? Here are a few of my questions about investing in BAC: 1. How will the lawsuits settled last month and the millions$$ that BAC will pay for racial discrimination affect stock price in the upcoming months/years? 2. Did anyone read the articles today on shorting BAC and buying JPMorgan? Thoughts? 3. Anyone read the earnings report and grow concerned or encouraged? I'm LONG BAC myself and considering buying more at this price. This board offers little to no actual help in discerning real issues related to BAC stock.</Msg><Username>new2nvesting</Username><Timestamp>1381504614053</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-11 11:16:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381504633113-83</Id><Topic><Title>Any of the banks are tough money right now</Title><Username>apostle_air</Username><Timestamp>1381331314929</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-09 11:08:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>clear sailing</Msg><Username>apostle_air</Username><Timestamp>1381504633113</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-11 11:17:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1381504680222-84</Id><Title>Seems only yesterday,</Title><Msg>that all the silly posing &amp; posturing was about battling O'care.

MULLIGAN A new wave of redistribution will arrive in America on Jan. 1, primarily thanks to the Affordable Care Act. The president's health-insurance plan forces those who hire, work and produce to pay full price for health care, while creating generous discounts for practically everyone else. This second redistributionist wave of the Obama era will follow a first wave of tax hikes, additional unemployment benefits, food-stamp expansions, waived work requirements for welfare benefits, etc. These measures were supposed to be temporary, intended to help people cope with the recession. The recession officially ended in mid-2009, but many of the administration's measures continue. Regardless of whether redistribution is achieved by collecting more taxes from families with high incomes, levying employment taxes on businesses, providing more subsidies to families with low incomes, or all of the above, an essential consequence is the same: a reduction in the reward for working. In a National Bureau of Economic Research paper issued in August, I quantify the combined effect of the two redistribution waves and higher payroll taxes on the financial reward for working. Enlarge Image Close...The chart nearby shows an index of marginal tax rates for non-elderly household heads and spouses with median earnings potential. The index, a population-weighted average over various ages, occupations, employment decisions (full-time, part-time, multiple jobs, etc.) and family sizes, reflects the extra taxes paid and government benefits forgone as a consequence of working. The 2009-10 peak for marginal tax rates comes from various provisions of the "stimulus" programs in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and the extension of unemployment benefits to 99 weeks in some states. At the end of 2012, the marginal tax rate index reached its lowest value since 2008: 43.9%. A little over a year later (January 2014), the index will be close to 50%, driven up by the expiration of the payroll tax cut and multiple provisions of the Affordable Care Act. The ACA employer penalty, delayed until 2015, adds more than a percentage point in that year alone, while other ACA provisions strengthen their disincentives for the various reasons cited above. Enlarge Image CloseReuters The Affordable Care Act signup page on the HealthCare.gov website .By 2016, the index exceeds 50%, which is at least 10 percentage points greater than it was in early 2007. The 50% rate is even higher than the rates that prevailed when the so-called Recovery and Reinvestment Act's redistribution was at its peak. Without new federal legislation and a departure from the strategy of forcing workers and employers to finance everyone else's health care, the new 50%+ rate will not be a peak, but rather a new normal for tax rates. To appreciate the added burden that the two redistribution waves put on the labor market, look at what people keep, on average, when they decide to retain or accept a job, or to take on a longer work schedule. Before the recession, a decision to work would benefit public treasuries by an amount equal to 40% of the compensation from the job. The worker and his family got the other 60%. In the years 2015 and beyond, full-time workers with median incomes will keep only half of the compensation created by their decisions, with the other half going to the government in the form of additional taxes and savings on subsidy payments. By keeping 50% rather than 60%, workers will find that the reward for holding a job will have fallen a damaging 17%. Advocates of redistribution try to perpetuate the income-maximization fallacy that business continues as usual as long as tax rates are less than 100%, because receiving even 1% of your compensation is supposedly better than getting no compensation at all. But even if full confiscation were the only way that taxes would depress the labor market, recall that the nearby chart is just an average: The average rate rising to 50% and above involves millions of people with rates far higher. America absolutely must have taxes and safety-net programs, even though they reduce the reward for working. But advocates for the recent program expansions have failed to acknowledge that redistribution necessarily increases marginal tax rates and contracts the labor market. Don't be surprised if the second redistribution wave coincides with a recessionary double-dip. Mr. Mulligan is a professor of economics at the University of Chicago and the author of "The Redistribution Recession" (Oxford, 2012).</Msg><Username>bjspokanimal</Username><Timestamp>1381518750190</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-11 15:12:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381518851034-171</Id><Topic><Title>Market up.....

What the results show is how moderate and balanced Obama has been as president and, unfortunately, how ignorant, biased, and closed minded his opposition has been.</Msg><Username>whyduyouask</Username><Timestamp>1381519945554</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-11 15:32:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1381519987545-179</Id><Title>Democrats hold the country's financial future hostage because $7 TRILLION in added Federal debt is not enough !!</Title><Msg>Democrats blame others for their own failure !</Msg><Username>pfswsucks</Username><Timestamp>1381519987545</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-11 15:33:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381519995663-180</Id><Topic><Title>ObamaCare's Impact on the American Work Ethic</Title><Username>bjspokanimal</Username><Timestamp>1381518750190</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-11 15:12:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good piece, spot on.

Look what's happening with unemployment now-a-days, 2 years worth! These people are doing what people do, taking the easy way until they can't get it anymore.

That's irresponsible. It's unpatriotic." Fact Check: During the eight years George W. Bush was in office, our national debt increased by $4.9 trillion, due primarily to the economic consequences of 9/11 and the funding of two major warfronts in response. Yet in just five years since Obama took office, his faux "economic recovery plan" has piled $6.1 trillion onto the nation's debt. Yes, No. 44 added $6.1 trillion "by his lonesome," so that we now have nearly $17 trillion of debt burden -- more than $54,000 for every American man, woman and child. That's irresponsible. That's unpatriotic. And last, given that the current brouhaha began with a Republican strategy to force Democrat votes on ObamaCare "defund" and "delay" measures, it is worth recalling Obama's promise, "We'll lower premiums by up to $2,500 for a typical family per year. We'll do it by the end of my first term..." Well the results are in and according to the latest budget research on Obama's nationalized health care scheme, it will result in a per capita increase of insurance costs.</Msg><Username>doncassel365</Username><Timestamp>1381533362930</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-11 19:16:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381533437311-234</Id><Topic><Title>Republican's sure pulled a "Boehner" with this Gov. shutdown stunt!</Title><Username>andym_30054</Username><Timestamp>1381523745023</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-11 16:35:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I knew you were talking champagne :) Don</Msg><Username>doncassel365</Username><Timestamp>1381533437311</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-11 19:17:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1381533534980-235</Id><Title>$15 COMING.

Next year $125.</Msg><Username>bond69holder</Username><Timestamp>1381534183617</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-11 19:29:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381534193162-239</Id><Topic><Title>Socialist Red States need the goverment the most !</Title><Username>sirifuture</Username><Timestamp>1381458976339</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-10-10 22:36:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If your in a red state except Texas your on welfare.</Msg><Username>sirifuture</Username><Timestamp>1381534193162</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-11 19:29:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1381535046372-240</Id><Title>Socialist Detroit Went Bankrupt</Title><Msg>Amazing example of Democrat Ruin</Msg><Username>pooperscoopers32</Username><Timestamp>1381535046372</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-11 19:44:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381535893105-241</Id><Topic><Title>▂ ▃ ▄ ▅ ▆ ▇ █ GOP is DEAD █ ▇ ▆ ▅ ▄ ▃ ▂</Title><Username>j.farragut</Username><Timestamp>1381479206781</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-11 04:13:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sic semper tyrannis</Msg><Username>sebedeciste</Username><Timestamp>1381535893105</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-11 19:58:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381536746198-242</Id><Topic><Title>Republican/ Tea Party shutdown keeps death benefits from fallen troops' families</Title><Username>sammysedwat</Username><Timestamp>1381348312667</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-09 15:51:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>lying sack of #$%$</Msg><Username>dawgeeeeedawg</Username><Timestamp>1381536746198</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-11 20:12:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1381536768404-243</Id><Title>(((((( OBAMACARE IS HORSE MANURE )))))))</Title><Msg>------LOL-------</Msg><Username>fdr_fdr_fdr_fdr</Username><Timestamp>1381536768404</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-11 20:12:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381536907335-244</Id><Topic><Title>(((((( OBAMACARE IS HORSE MANURE )))))))</Title><Username>fdr_fdr_fdr_fdr</Username><Timestamp>1381536768404</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-11 20:12:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>LIAR</Msg><Username>dawgeeeeedawg</Username><Timestamp>1381536907335</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-11 20:15:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381537124448-245</Id><Topic><Title>(((((( OBAMACARE IS HORSE MANURE )))))))</Title><Username>fdr_fdr_fdr_fdr</Username><Timestamp>1381536768404</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-11 20:12:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You signed up? lol</Msg><Username>fdr_fdr_fdr_fdr</Username><Timestamp>1381537124448</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-11 20:18:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381537177100-246</Id><Topic><Title>Remove the Tea Bagger tumor of sub-human waste before it metastasizes</Title><Username>take_out_the_white_trash</Username><Timestamp>1381466631900</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-11 00:43:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>sounds like a plan</Msg><Username>kra88zee</Username><Timestamp>1381537177100</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-11 20:19:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1381537480160-247</Id><Title>Obama Should Fire Sebillus</Title><Msg>Couldn't have had a more disastrous start to Ocrapcare</Msg><Username>fdr_fdr_fdr_fdr</Username><Timestamp>1381537480160</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-11 20:24:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381537557403-248</Id><Topic><Title>Common lies teabaggers post</Title><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1380849919208</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-10-03 21:25:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Republicans did not want income tax, unions, social security, unemployment compensation, workman's comp, and on and on and on.

For emphasis, that is more than 1.9 times higher than the industry average. Now notice they didn't show any other banks for comparison, just the average. If you include properties that Bank of America owns due to foreclosure, the picture doesn't get any better. Non-current loans plus these bank-owned properties represent 3.71% of total assets at Bank of America versus just 1.85% of total assets on average for the industry. Notice now, they compare JPM and Chase to this number (don) Narrowing the peer group to other U.S. mega banks, Bank of America still under performs, although not nearly as badly. Wells Fargo reported 5.44% of loans were non-current, and JPMorgan Chase reported 4.56%. So JPM and Chase are worst here. Where did they compare to the first set of numbers. The numbers that the main story was about. What if they were worse too? What if they weren't? Regardless, shouldn't the title have been: The 1 Reason Bank of America, JPM &amp; Chase Investors Should Run (Not Walk). I really would like to punch them in their face for bias or stupidity. I'm not picky, Don</Msg><Username>doncassel365</Username><Timestamp>1381545920107</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-11 22:45:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381546021546-281</Id><Topic><Title>Most blacks have way too many kids I feel like their Uncle Tom</Title><Username>tom.foolery2</Username><Timestamp>1381545100899</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-11 22:31:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You better check White republicans first, like Santorum, 7 living kids and one that died, Romney with 5 boys, they must of flushed the girls.
