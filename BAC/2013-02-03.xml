It is not beyond TNS to mimic himself or to create conversations with himself posing as several posters. Nothing posted by Kingofvietnam, vallecookie or zevoter whether real or mimic is of any importance anyway so just ignore them all. There is no Mason posting on this board and has not been for over two years now and any reference to him is only the posters paranoia.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1359868511608</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-03 00:15:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359875885857-2</Id><Topic><Title>BAC is HEADED to 3.59 by AUGUST 2013!!!!

But he has also been known to create hundreds of multiple IDs centered around my Sarcasm-Witticism ID alias network of alias and mimic IDs. Over the last several years we have tried various methods to placate and nullify Mason. He has proven his point that he can always crash the party and make a pest of himself. He demonstrates a limitation or asset of the Internet, depending on how you want to view it. He demonstates that unpopular opinions cannot be effectively suppressed or censored. While I consider that a good thing, he is quite tiresome in his repetitious, unimmaginative behavior My guess is that he has a very low esteem of himself. Probably quite lonely and desparate for any human interaction. He probably thinks that he has high ideals but is childishly self-centered. Perhaps a invalid, perhaps wheelchair bound living on SIA I'm afraid that we are stuck with him until he dies or looses access to the internet. If either of those happen, he will not be missed. He is a jerk. How to deal with him? Best thing to do is to ignore him. Put him on ignore so that you are not even aware that he has posted. He feels that he wins if he can get you to respond in ANY manner to his posts. He is a classic sadomasochist with his desire to hurt and be hurt. He will probably even get some satisfaction from this post. Makes him feel important that we take any time to discuss him. Another thing you can do is change your ID to one that he will not recognize. Want to get rid of the xxxscum IDs? Then stop using the xxx IDs that he has recognized. He feeds off of the desire for people to be recognized. Eliminate the desire to be recognized and you eliminate him until he catches on and then you simply immediately change to a new randomly selected new ID. If you don't want to change IDs, use a very short ID that will allow the #$%$ to be displayed, making it obvious it is not you. Also never use the same ID that you check your portfolio on Yahoo with the one that you use to post. He has also conducted campaigns of banning IDs. Yahoo has implimented changes that make it more difficult for him to do that but he can still do it if he gets worked up enough. It takes more time to ban IDs but he has a lot of time on his hands. Hope these suggestions help.

The occasion was our 15th anniversary and I was looking for a little something extra for my wife Julie. What I came across was a 100,000-volt, pocket/purse-sized Tazer. The effects of the Tazer were supposed to be short lived, with no long term adverse affect on your assailant, allowing her adequate time to retreat to safety...?? WAY TOO COOL! Long story short, I bought the device and brought it home... I loaded two AAA batteries in the darn thing and pushed the button. Nothing! I was disappointed. I learned, however, that if I pushed the button and pressed it against a metal surface at the same time, I'd get the blue arc of electricity darting back and forth between the prongs. AWESOME!!! Unfortunately, I have yet to explain to Julie what that burn spot is on the face of her microwave. Okay, so I was home alone with this new toy, thinking to myself that it couldn't be all that bad with only two AAA batteries, right? There I sat in my recliner, my cat Gracie looking on intently (trusting little soul) while I was reading the directions and thinking that I really needed to try this thing out on a flesh &amp; blood moving target. I must admit I thought about zapping Gracie (for a fraction of a second) and then thought better of it. She is such a sweet cat. But, if I was going to give this thing to my wife to protect herself against a mugger, I did want some assurance that it would work as advertised. Am I wrong? So, there I sat in a pair of shorts and a tank top with my reading glasses perched delicately on the bridge of my nose, directions in one hand, and Tazer in another. The directions said that: A one-second burst would shock and disorient your assailant; A two-second burst was supposed to cause muscle spasms and a major loss of bodily control; and A three-second burst would purportedly make your assailant flop on the ground like a fish out of water. Any burst longer than three seconds would be wasting the batteries. All the while I'm looking at this little device measuring about 5" long, less than 3/4 inch in circumference (loaded with two itsy, bitsy AAA batteries); pretty cute really, and thinking to myself, 'no possible way!' What happened next is almost beyond description, but I'll do my best. I'm sitting there alone, Gracie looking on with her head cocked to one side so as to say, 'Don't do it stupid,' reasoning that a one second burst from such a tiny lil ole thing couldn't hurt all that bad.. I decided to give myself a one second burst just for heck of it. I touched the prongs to my naked thigh, pushed the button, and... HOLY MOTHER OF GOD. WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. WHAT THE... !!! I'm pretty sure Hulk Hogan ran in through the side door, picked me up in the recliner, and then body slammed us both on the carpet, over and over and over again. I vaguely recall waking up on my side in the fetal position, with tears in my eyes, body soaking wet, both nipples on fire, testicles nowhere to be found, with my left arm tucked under my body in the oddest position, and tingling in my legs! The cat was making meowing sounds I had never heard before, clinging to a picture frame hanging above the fireplace, obviously in an attempt to avoid getting slammed by my body flopping all over the living room. Note: If you ever feel compelled to 'mug' yourself with a Tazer, One note of caution: There is NO such thing as a one second burst when you zap yourself! You will not let go of that thing until it is dislodged from your hand by a violent thrashing about on the floor! A three second burst would be considered conservative! A minute or so later (I can't be sure, as time was a relative thing at that point), I collected my wits (what little I had left), sat up and surveyed the landscape. • My bent reading glasses were on the mantel of the fireplace. • The recliner was upside down and about 8 feet or so from where it originally was. • My triceps, right thigh and both nipples were still twitching. • My face felt like it had been shot up with Novocain, and my bottom lip weighed 88 lbs. • I had no control over the drooling.. • Apparently I had #$%$ in my shorts, but was too numb to know for sure, and my sense of smell was gone. • I saw a faint smoke cloud above my head, which I believe came from my hair. I'm still looking for my testicles and I'm offering a significant reward for their safe return! PS: My wife can't stop laughing about my experience, loved the gift and now regularly threatens me with it! If you think education is difficult, try being stupid!!!!</Msg><Username>garyjohnson34231</Username><Timestamp>1359935848269</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-03 18:57:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359937356494-36</Id><Topic><Title>Predictions on what price Bac will be at by end of year if all goes well?
