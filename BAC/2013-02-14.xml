Gross domestic product fell 0.6 percent in the fourth quarter from the previous three months, the European Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg said today. That’s the most since the first quarter of 2009 in the aftermath of the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and exceeded the 0.4 percent median forecast of economists in a Bloomberg survey. The data capped a morning of releases showing that the economies of Germany, France and Italy all shrank more than forecast in the fourth quarter. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said last week that confidence in the 17-nation bloc has stabilized and the ECB sees a gradual recovery beginning later this year, though the situation is “fragile.” “The outlook for 2013 remains subdued,” said Peter Vanden Houte, an economist at ING Group NV in Brussels. “While a gradual improvement of the world economy is likely to support European exports, domestic demand is bound to remain very weak as fiscal tightening and rising unemployment will take their toll on household consumption.” The euro extended its decline against the dollar after the data were released. It fell 0.9 percent to $1.3328 as of 10:34 a.m. London time. The single currency also weakened versus the pound and the yen. European stocks erased gains, U.S. equity- index futures fell, and German bunds advanced. Japanese Surprise The European data chimed with statistics in Japan, where the economy unexpectedly shrank last quarter as falling exports and a business investment slump outweighed improved consumption. GDP fell an annualized 0.4 percent, following a 3.8 percent fall in the previous quarter.

Roosevelt promised that participation in the Program would be completely voluntary (it’s not). He also promised that the participants would only have to pay1% of the first $1,400 of their annual incomes into the Program. They now pay 7.65% ! The Social Security Act also provided that the money the participants elected to put into the Program would be deductible from their income for tax purposes each year. Of course, today the tax is no longer deductible! The original Program also provided that the money the participants put into the independent ‘Trust Fund’ rather than into the general operating fund, and therefore would only be used to fund the Social Security Retirement Program, and no other Government program. However, under President Lyndon Johnson, the money was moved to the General Fund! The original Social Security Act also provided that the annuity payments to the retirees would never be taxed as income.

A bank can ask and if the fed has issue the bank can addres them and or reduce what they ask. This is all private and negioted. Not the old way with banks getting PR screwed with a public no. I expect BAC to ask for .05 per QRT and get .04 per QRT. That puts a floor of 10.00 on the stock. Also 2014 I see div increased to .05-07 per QRT. This exptations will send BAC past 16.50 a share later in 2013. Also expecting EPS in 2013 of 1.00 ( .25 per QRT) with a one time charge of .10-.20 to sett private label and MBIA suits. I doubt we see a buy back at al in 2013. Payouts will NOT exceed 40% of EPS.

And He said to that man who wrote before Him, being one of those seven white ones, and said unto him: ' Take those seventy shepherds to whom I delivered the sheep, and who taking them on their own authority slew more 23 than I commanded them.' And behold they were all bound, I saw, and they all stood before Him. 24 And the judgement was held first over the stars, and they were judged and found guilty, and went to the place of condemnation, and they were cast into an abyss, full of fire and flaming, and full 25 of pillars of fire. And those seventy shepherds were judged and found guilty, and they were cast 26 into that fiery abyss. And I saw at that time how a like abyss was opened in the midst of the earth, full of fire, and they brought those blinded sheep, and they were all judged and found guilty and 27 cast into this fiery abyss, and they burned; now this abyss was to the right of that house. And I saw those sheep burning and their bones burning. 28 And I stood up to see till they folded up that old house; and carried off all the pillars, and all the beams and ornaments of the house were at the same time folded up with it, and they carried 29 it off and laid it in a place in the south of the land. And I saw till the Lord of the sheep brought a new house greater and loftier than that first, and set it up in the place of the first which had beer folded up: all its pillars were new, and its ornaments were new and larger than those of the first, the old one which He had taken away, and all the sheep were within it.

Jobs suck. I spent 13 years of my life working in various jobs, and I never felt right about it. Not once did I feel like I was doing my life’s work. There was always a little voice in the back of my head telling me “you’ll never be happy working for someone else. When are you going to get the balls to try working for yourself?” In 2006 I found those balls. After 13 years of working on #$%$ I didn’t care about, after the boredom, the depression, after all the #$%$ I endured from bosses who expected 60 hour weeks and still gave me a hard time about taking a week off here or there, after feeling like there MUST be more to life than Corporate America™… I decided to ditch my well-paying but mind-numbingly-boring job and find out for myself if being self-employed was the answer to all my prayers. I always knew my life would be incomplete until I at least tried working for myself. To see if I could do it and find out what life without the rules everyone else lives under. For some reason, it took me 13 years and 5 jobs to finally take the plunge. Finally I looked myself in the eye and asked, “why the #$%$ should I spend close to 50% of my waking hours during the most healthy and vibrant period of my life at a job, doing something I couldn’t care less about, contributing far less than my true potential to the world?” I decided I wanted my life to be about more than powerpoint slides and meetings. Why the hell did it take me so long ask this question and own up to what I felt was my destiny? Mostly it was fear. Fear and comfort… Why You Should Never Work a Job Again Listen, if you like your job, that’s cool. I know there are some people out there who are fulfilled by their jobs. (although I suspect you might not be totally satisfied if you’re still reading this) Most people I know pretty much hate their jobs. They complain about the work, the people, the commute, the pay, the hours, the lack of vacation time and control over their lives. They talk about dreams and hobbies and “some day” as if it just isn’t in the cards for them. That version of life is for someone else, someone with better luck and fewer responsibilities. 99.9% of these people will work a job until they retire or die. Most just accept that having a job is something you simply do in life. You’re born, you grow up, you work at a job, you retire and enjoy yourself for a few years or a decade, you get old, and then you die. Some of the poor and middle class complain about corporate control of wealth and power, and yet most of us work for those companies, buy what they sell us, watch what they create and accept their vision of the world as our reality. But don’t get me started on that… This isn’t about society or what other people do. It’s about you. It’s about asking yourself what you want your life to be all about. Do you want the next 30 years to go by, only to feel like you never tested yourself? Like you never stretched your limits and capabilities and experienced everything you possibly could in life? Like you wasted your potential because you lived under some invisible set of rules your whole life? I’m not saying you should quit your job tomorrow (although you would probably be just fine if you did), but if you have the entrepreneurial bug like I did, you’ll never be completely satisfied until you try working for yourself. If you feel like your job is keeping you from living the life you really want to live, here are three reasons you should never take a job again. Working a job gives someone else control over the majority of your life. These aren’t feudal times. If you live in the free world, there is no reason you have to work for someone else. The freedom to pursue happiness and live the life you desire is the greatest gift of modern society, yet most of us #$%$ that opportunity away. When you work a job, someone else is ultimately in control of what you work on, what you’re responsible for, when you work, when you take time off and how much you earn. If you absolutely love your job, perhaps giving up that amount of control is worth it. For most people, it seems insane to accept those conditions. Working a job is dangerously comfortable. When you work for someone else, life is just comfortable enough to keep you from asking the really important questions. Sure, you feel like your soul is being crushed every day at work, but at least you get a paycheck, right? How much of that paycheck is spent on vices and entertainment just to make yourself feel better or to cover up the fundamental lack of fulfillment you feel? Fear is what keeps most people from doing extraordinary things in life. Most people choose to stay in jobs they hate because they’re scared #$%$less of the alternative. They’re afraid they don’t have what it takes, that they’ll fail miserably and become homeless embarrassments. The truth is, if you get past the fear and laziness, there’s no reason you can’t accomplish anything you want. Jobs keep you just comfortable enough so you never have a strong enough reason to confront those fears and start living your life’s purpose. Working for yourself is one of the most challenging and rewarding things you will ever do. As a kid growing up in the Pacific Northwest, I spent a fair amount of time fishing with my dad. I used to see this phrase on t-shirts and bumper stickers a lot: “The Worst Day Fishin’ is Better than the Best Day at Work.” The same is true of working for yourself. During the worst days of working for yourself, you’ll be terrified, worried, anxious and full of self-doubt. You’ll think you made a huge mistake and you’ll convince yourself that you don’t have what it takes. But even that day will be better than the best day of working for someone else. Maybe not on the surface, but deep-down there is still a sense of purpose and satisfaction that can only come from pursuing self-reliance in it’s highest form. — There’s no better time than right now to start working for yourself. How do I know this? You’ll never be younger, and you’ll never be fully prepared. The perfect day to commit to your dream will never come. There is no such thing as being fully prepared. There are things you can never learn or prepare for except by actually doing them. Working for yourself takes a tremendous amount of courage and energy. Every day you let go by makes it less likely you’ll ever pull the trigger, and less likely you’ll persevere if you do decide to quit. If you’re feeling brave enough, here’s a challenge to consider: Make your current job the last one you ever take. Commit to making self-employment the only alternative to the job you have right now. Don’t give yourself the option of finding another job. Ever. If you get sick of your job and want to find another, use that drive to go freelance or build your own business. Don’t give in and take another job. If you get laid off or fired, use that as a sign that it’s time. Take your unemployment benefits or savings and buy your freedom by jumping into self employment. But don’t wait around until you have no job, or until get so sick of your current job that you have no other option. Instead, commit to yourself that you’ll quit your current job by a certain date. After that date, you’ll never work a regular job again. You’ll do whatever it takes to support yourself through your own creativity and perseverance. If you’re reading this and you don’t have a job right now, #$%$ looking for one. How long will you spend looking for a job that you’re going to hate in six months anyway? Use that time instead to build a life of freedom and fulfillment. Live on your parents’ couch or live off your spouse’s earnings for as long as it takes. Convince your supporters that this is the greatest gift they could ever give you, and then don’t let them down. Don’t accept this challenge lightly. Take a weekend by yourself to really think about this challenge. Go away for a couple of days and ask yourself life’s hard questions. Ask what you really want your life to be about. What do you want to try, to experience, to accomplish? If you decide that working for yourself should be a big part of your future, give yourself some time to put a plan together. Then, don’t be shy about telling people your plan. Once you set a date, the world will conspire to help you make your dream happen. And remember, the worst that can happen probably isn’t all that bad. The journey won’t be easy, but at least you’ll be growing and pushing yourself. You’ll be testing your limits. That’s one of life’s greatest gifts. Whatever you decide, be honest with yourself. You don’t have to accept your current reality as how you’re “supposed” to live, or as what you really want. Start having this conversation with yourself today, because it’s one of the most important things you can do. You owe it to yourself to live the life you know deep down you were meant to fulfill. You know it’s there. Making it happens all starts with admitting to yourself what you want.</Msg><Username>marketneutral1001</Username><Timestamp>1360876713801</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 16:18:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360877635001-117</Id><Topic><Title>3 reasons not to have a job</Title><Username>marketneutral1001</Username><Timestamp>1360876713801</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 16:18:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>blah blah blaw what? was there a point i missed there other than what could have been said in one sentance?</Msg><Username>arhummel</Username><Timestamp>1360877635001</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 16:33:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360879985979-118</Id><Topic><Title>3 reasons not to have a job</Title><Username>marketneutral1001</Username><Timestamp>1360876713801</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 16:18:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>1. you got fired 2. you got laid off 3. you quit to pursue your dreams or whater ever the heck you said</Msg><Username>gamblin09</Username><Timestamp>1360879985979</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 17:13:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360880055010-119</Id><Topic><Title>Bank of America Corporation CHARTS!</Title><Username>paratuberculousjoann</Username><Timestamp>1360877819056</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 16:36:59 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yes!</Msg><Username>gamblin09</Username><Timestamp>1360880055010</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 17:14:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360881539238-120</Id><Title>Better have a strong stomach a lot of volatility ahead of Stress Test result in March</Title><Msg>IMHO will go back to test 11 maybe more likely 11.50</Msg><Username>greenpoint21</Username><Timestamp>1360881539238</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 17:38:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360881638208-121</Id><Topic><Title>Bank of America Corporation CHARTS!</Title><Username>paratuberculousjoann</Username><Timestamp>1360877819056</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 16:36:59 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks for giving out this article for free.</Msg><Username>oraidemelody</Username><Timestamp>1360881638208</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 17:40:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360881721933-122</Id><Topic><Title>With 99pct of punters BULLS of BAC...MM will test their rsolve by driving BAC sharply lower to 11-11.50</Title><Username>greenpoint21</Username><Timestamp>1360867326088</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 13:42:06 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>1 unlikely but 11 11.50 possible...yes IMHO</Msg><Username>greenpoint21</Username><Timestamp>1360881721933</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 17:42:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360881738175-123</Id><Title>BAC Earnings Potential</Title><Msg>All I have to say is that any shares acquired in the past year and even today will be a gift to long shareholders.
