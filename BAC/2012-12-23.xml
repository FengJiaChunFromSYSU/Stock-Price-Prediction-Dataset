While looking around at the exotic merchandise, he noticed a very lifelike, life-sized, bronze statue of a rat. It had no price tag, but was so incredibly striking the tourist decided he must have it. He took it to the old shop owner and asked, "How much for the bronze rat ?" "Ahhh, you have chosen wisely! It is $12 for the rat and $100 for the story," said the wise old Chinaman. The tourist quickly pulled out twelve dollars. "I'll just take the rat, you can keep the story". As he walked down the street carrying his bronze rat, the tourist noticed that a few real rats had crawled out of the alleys and sewers and had begun following him down the street. This was a bit disconcerting so he began walking faster. A couple blocks later he looked behind him and saw to his horror the herd of rats behind him had grown to hundreds, and they began squealing. Sweating now, the tourist began to trot toward San Francisco Bay . Again, after a couple blocks, he looked around only to discover that the rats now numbered in the MILLIONS, and were squealing and coming toward him faster and faster. Terrified, he ran to the edge of the Bay and threw the bronze rat as far as he could into the Bay. Amazingly, the millions of rats all jumped into the Bay after the bronze rat and were all drowned. The man walked back to the curio shop in Chinatown . "Ahhh," said the owner, "You come back for story ?" "No sir," said the man, "I came back to see if you have a bronze Democrat." --------------------------------------------------------------------------------</Msg><Username>mike_van_der_slut_irvin19</Username><Timestamp>1356277930834</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 10:52:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356279630038-15</Id><Topic><Title>stock trading analysis</Title><Username>noreenseylerlgwovzej3844</Username><Timestamp>1306984401000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2011-06-01 23:13:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I will take a look at this.</Msg><Username>davidsamuel572</Username><Timestamp>1356279630038</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 11:20:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356279874822-16</Id><Topic><Title>does CA have a law on dem or religious conversion yet?

Hutchinson argues that gun control is not the solution. Cost of gun bearing persons, ah that was not discussed. D Minn Sen Amy Klobuchar says guns cannot be taken away from hunters, nor should they be. She argues for background checks re possible gun owners and greater attention to “mental health” matters We had a clip of the president stating, “There is no reason for taxes to increase for the 98 per cent” WSJ’s Peggy Noonan points out, GOP has yielded some re tax increase, where are the Democrats re lower expenses? Grover Norquist of “no tax increase” pledge pointed out “House has passed a budget (Ryan proposal), the Senate has not” BAAAD, of course, bad Senate! ABC’s Matthew Dowd says “we must meet in middle”. Journalist Katrina van den heuvel claims “mental health” matters are being used to delay action on gun control.

Ban all guns is not, was not and will never be an objective of the Democratic party and anyone with more than one brain cell knows that, of course this does eliminate Tpublicans and RoButts. The current discussion concerns a ban on Mags that have expanded capicity, Ammo type, and so called assult weapons. In other words those items that have only one purpose, killing as many people as can be accomplished in the shortest time frame. While the Preppers, end of the world freaks, and those with major mental problems object and cry that this infrenges on their rights, most people with more than one brain cell knows that the right to bear arms fails to define type, Etc. and no infringment of rights is present when type, Etc. is banned.. A person with more than one brain cell also realizes that additional actions are also necessary [ ex. revamp of the mental health system]. Those with less than one brain cell [ ex. Teapublicans in Congress], when faced with a real problem always return to their dogma and refuse to act as an adult, much less a leader to enter into serious discussions on what actions must be taken and to move quickly to enact rational actions.</Msg><Username>carolyne47</Username><Timestamp>1356319052054</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 22:17:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356319409760-72</Id><Topic><Title>Obama: “every day, families sacrifice to live within their means – they deserve a government that does the same.”</Title><Username>dumpobamie</Username><Timestamp>1356311951591</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 20:19:11 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>To bad you did not have your boy Bush Jr. do this, then we would not have been in this mess to start with ............ , but on the bright side his rich buddies made billions and it only cost the rest of America, Jobs, security and their sons and daughters lives.</Msg><Username>carolyne47</Username><Timestamp>1356319409760</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 22:23:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356319717526-73</Id><Topic><Title>OBAMA HAS DONE NOTHING but perpetuate class warfare ! ! !</Title><Username>dumpobamie</Username><Timestamp>1356312124500</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 20:22:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Vs the dynamic Teapublicans who just said NO to everything ensureing no progress would be made and this would ensure Obamas defeat ...........Seems like the MAJORITY of Americans are a lot smarter than the Teapublicans and while the Teapublicans have yet to realize it , they have now actualyaccomplished one thing ......THE ELIMINATION OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AS A POLITICAL FORCE.
