Drilling and production increased during Obama's term due to more development on PRVATE land, not public. Drilling on public land decreased under Obama. You nut job liberals need to understand that just because something happens during a President's term does not mean he caused it. It's the I stepped on a spider and it rained, therefore stepping on spiders causes it to rain fallacy. Oh, and could it be possibly that the increased production was due to the aftermath of a booming economy prior to Obama? He wants to blame Bush for the bad things he inherited but he wants to take credit for the good things he inherited.

More than 100 million people in the United States of America get welfare from the federal government. 100 million. According to the Weekly Standard, Senate Republicans say that the federal government administers nearly "80 different overlapping federal means-tested welfare programs." This figure of 100 million people does not include those who only receive Social Security or Medicare. The most popular welfare programs are food stamps and Medicaid, with the number of recipients in both these programs skyrocketing in the last decade. Food stamp recipients alone jumped from 17 million in 2000 to 45 million in 2011. And these 100 million people on welfare include citizens and non-citizens. In fact, a new report by the Center for Immigration Studies finds that 36% of immigrant-headed households get at least one form of welfare. That's compared to 23% of native-born American households. Immigrants from some countries rely on welfare more than others: more than half of those coming from Mexico, Guatemala and the Dominican Republic get welfare. Meanwhile, Mitt Romney is accusing President Obama of loosening welfare requirements. A new ad charges the president with gutting the 1996 welfare reform law that requires recipients to work in order to collect benefits.</Msg><Username>jack_ste56</Username><Timestamp>1344702496519</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 12:28:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344702510712-85</Id><Title>ROMNEY &amp; RYAN CAN ACTUALLY DELIVER HOPE AND CHANGE</Title><Msg>In a positive way</Msg><Username>whitest_white</Username><Timestamp>1344702510712</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 12:28:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344702546037-86</Id><Topic><Title>Give a man a fish and feed him for a day, teach a man to fish and feed him for life, be a liberal and take fish from the fisherman and eat for life for free!</Title><Username>mrstan4089</Username><Timestamp>1344664662292</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 01:57:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Lol...

Liberals would rather have the whole country in poverty so there would be no disparity in living standards, than to have an upper and middle class that is industrious and builds economic value for America so it can afford to pay a safety net to those who need it. But the safety net has been changed into a leather lounge chair for those who have no earned it, and that has prompted more and more to seek the easy chair, which in turn has put too big a burden on the on the earnings power of this country.

Teflon Obam has gotten us deeper into debt that all other previous administrations combined. I'll concede that some of it was necessary to keep the economy from falling off a cliff. However, the permission to spend to revive the economy was seen as an opportunity to piggy back more social spending on top of it, naively believing that the small portion of the spending that would really help the economy would be enough to turn things around. Now the US has once again consumed what it should have spent on investment and we have our backs to the wall, running out of options, because we are so deep in debt. Teflon Obam squandered our last big wad of cash that could have been spent in ways to really boost the economy, like infrastructure spending that has throughout history proven to increase economic vitality. It's like we maxed out our credit cards on one last big expensive meal when we should have instead gone on a diet, now people are starving and there is no more money to help them.... unless you take it from those who create jobs, which continues the downward spiral Telon Obam started. If you really want people to be put back to work more than you want to push a liberal agenda, then Teflon Obam has to go.</Msg><Username>mrstan4089</Username><Timestamp>1344714843705</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 15:54:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344714874388-122</Id><Topic><Title>When George Romney, Mitt's father, ran for president, he set a standard by releasing 12 years of his tax returns.

Their lies are apparent instantly in our modern age of instant availability of the facts. The tide is too big to overcome for those who rely on lying and deceiving. I voted for them having been deceived for several years... until I get my info from many sources to check the validity of what each politician/party is saying. The last time I voted GOP was in 2000 for GWB.... and it seems they will never get my vote if they persist in the same path of lying and sloganeering to be the party of "high moral and family values" and "budget control" when they actually ARE just the OPPOSITE!!!!</Msg><Username>johnmjay</Username><Timestamp>1344743375309</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 23:49:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344743532323-251</Id><Topic><Title>Fish2kill busy shooting Ryan bait-BAC still in hammerhead stall?</Title><Username>f_bird55</Username><Timestamp>1344740137820</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 22:55:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>but you have to figure that if it made James Carville the happiest butthead in North America, it couldn't have been too good for the GOP, especially considering that Jimmy's still married to Mary Matlin.
