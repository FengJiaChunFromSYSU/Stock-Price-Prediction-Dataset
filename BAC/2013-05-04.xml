You just keep telling yourself how much safer you'll be. Better yet, you should walk through Central Park or anywhere in Chicago at midnight with a wad of 20's hanging out of your pocket and a rolex on your wrist and see how safe you feel then. They've already got gun control like you want. It must work, huh?

Also, other items in there you would agree to, so you must stipulate that you will NOT accept maybe .03 per share to LOAN them to a hedgie.

Is he a bit monotone in media appearances? Perhaps. A smidge boring? Sure. But inept? Certainly not. Since taking the helm in 2010, Moynihan has adroitly navigated the bank through arguably the most treacherous legal battles ever waged against a company that wasn't in the throes of bankruptcy. He's overseen multi-billion-dollar settlements with the U.S. Justice Department, state attorney generals, banking regulators, the Securities and Exchange Commission, former shareholders of Merrill Lynch, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and the Federal Trade Commission. Before Moynihan can declare victory in its ongoing legal war, however, he must first navigate the bank past a series of lawsuits by private investors in Countrywide Financial's mortgage-backed securities and a particularly litigious bunch of monoline insurance companies. Putting the monoline claims into perspective If the number of lawsuits filed against B of A resembles an unsolvable puzzle, here's a simple framework to keep in mind. The bank faces liability under three legal theories: 1.Breach of contract 2.Securities fraud 3.Malfeasance in mortgage servicing The breach of contract claims can be further broken down into: •Those involving mortgages sold by Countrywide to government-sponsored agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. •Those involving private institutions which invested in Countrywide's mortgage-backed securities (MBS). •And, those involving monoline insurance companies that insured particular tranches of the private-label MBSes. What we're concerned about here are the claims in the third category -- the vast majority of which are tied up in a New York state court.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1367681092434</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 11:24:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367682575967-35</Id><Topic><Title>Guantanamo burns through $900,000 a year per inmate</Title><Username>madmoneycramer</Username><Timestamp>1367633106166</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 22:05:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Only three places left to cut medicare fraud the military and goverment pay , which will never happen heck congress just gave themselfs a raise !</Msg><Username>sirifuture</Username><Timestamp>1367682575967</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 11:49:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367682708139-36</Id><Topic><Title>South Carolina bill would make it a crime to implement ObamaCare</Title><Username>starkdirt</Username><Timestamp>1367628575955</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 20:49:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Better yet, learn to read the Supreme Court's interpretation of the Constitution.

You've got paranoia down to an art; every gun is out to get you, so you gotta have a law that makes it a crime to sell to criminals, forgetting for the moment that there is already a law that makes it a crime for a convicted felon to possess a gun. If that law was so useful and designed to ensure the public safety, why do we need another law that will accomplish nothing more, and why do so many convicted felons own guns? Because they can get them legally? Naahhhh, you're really stretching your strawman so thin, you're liable to have it snap back and take your head off with it. Face it, every argument you use is just fodder for other emotional train wrecks, and has no impact on normal people.</Msg><Username>anotherobamafailure</Username><Timestamp>1367714330441</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 20:38:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367714623144-70</Id><Topic><Title>Obama says U.S. watching 'crackdowns' on Venezuela opposition</Title><Username>starkdirt</Username><Timestamp>1367677107106</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 10:18:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Opposite is also true -- They could get some ideas from him or one of his terrorist friends/sponsors.</Msg><Username>anotherobamafailure</Username><Timestamp>1367714623144</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 20:43:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367714758555-71</Id><Topic><Title>Guantanamo burns through $900,000 a year per inmate</Title><Username>madmoneycramer</Username><Timestamp>1367633106166</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 22:05:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Goverment pay should be tied to private sector jobs and or min wage, how can burger flippers cover the cost of the largest military in the world ?</Msg><Username>sirifuture</Username><Timestamp>1367714758555</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 20:45:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367715145852-72</Id><Topic><Title>Charlie Munger has it right but the SEC won't listen nor the FED!</Title><Username>andym_30054</Username><Timestamp>1367675476268</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 09:51:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Liar loans had to have liar homeowners doing the lying. Bankers didn't sign the note or force the homeowner to apply or close on it. You're missing a critical step in the process -- the one called thinking. And you seem to be forgetting that the regulators threatened every bank that didn't make enough low-income (aka, Liar) loans with government fines/sanctions/exclusions. The banks never would have gone out and purposely made lousy loans if they hadn't been forced to. Countrywide sprang up from the dungheap of regulation to take advantage of the rules that required bad loans to be made and the secondary markets facilitation that got them off the books quickly. And that is a fact. Regulation of the kind promulgated by the Democrat party is what caused this, and the rest was just the efficiency of capitalism within the context of ill-considered govt regulation. And what, exactly, is a "bankster"? It sounds like some kind of kids toy, like a tricycle.</Msg><Username>anotherobamafailure</Username><Timestamp>1367715145852</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 20:52:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367716561872-73</Id><Topic><Title>Obama: "I will continue to do everything in my power to pass common-sense reforms that keep guns out of the hands of criminals"</Title><Username>dump.obamie</Username><Timestamp>1367617944974</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 17:52:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Soooo....youre STILL against background checks to purchase a firearm?
