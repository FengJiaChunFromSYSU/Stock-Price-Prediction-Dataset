He can pretend to be a President out in Hollywood, like he's been pretending to be one in Washington. I agree Romney was totally different than in the GOP primaries. He was much better tonight.

If you don't know how to run an equal Poll, Don't Do A Poll. So the crooked Polls from GARBAGE CNN mean nothing. First Debate where Romney was 54% likable before the debate, Fox Poll found the same results, No Democrats in Poll Number 1. The Second debate and results of GARBAGE CNN Poll, CNN said there were 8% more Republicans. The Third debate and results of GARBAGE CNN Poll, CNN said there was more Republicans in the Poll but would not say how many more there were. CNN should not have any debates on their worthless channel in the future, even Fox has more credibility than the worthless people working at CNN.

The meat-eating, chest-thumping tough guys of the primary season have somehow 'evolved' into Mother Teresa and June Cleaver; the fiscal conservatives of May have turned into the candy men of Halloween. Last night Romney promised to balance the budget in 10 years.....after screaming for 2 years that Obama should have done it in four years. What's hysterical is how he's managed to bring the neocon base along for his ride to ObamaLand. After all those months of tough talk on Iran, Syria, and Libya, his averred foreign policy now boils down to "Whatever Obama has done and is doing, except I'd do it better and faster and use more money to accomplish it". ROTFLMAO there isn't a voter in America who knows what Romney stands for, but approximately 1/2 of them are ready to pull the handle for him anyway.</Msg><Username>fish2kill</Username><Timestamp>1351002523524</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 10:28:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351002626390-185</Id><Topic><Title>Hot Stock Picks!</Title><Username>shavonitu85646</Username><Timestamp>1350998274079</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 09:17:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Great share.

That means even the very best savers in that 60% group only have $25,000 saved. 60% of American voters are not voting on behalf of their 401K balance because they pretty much don't have one. 40% of Americans have less than $500 saved in the bank. So instead you have 47 million Americans on Food Stamps, 23 million unemployed, millions more underemployed, and how many living on Social Security alone? That's a big block of Obama voters (w/some obvious overlaps in the group). Add to them 97% of African Americans, 75-80% of Hispanics and it will be tough the defeat Obama .Ironically, almost all of those constituencies will be severely hurt by a second Obama term, particularly if the Fiscal Cliff is not resolved; even if it is resolved, they will be hit moderately. When you only have $500 in the bank--it is very tough to take even a moderate hit.</Msg><Username>roboklerk</Username><Timestamp>1351002708222</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 10:31:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351002787255-187</Id><Title>LOADING UP AS IT DROPS...EASY MONEY</Title><Msg>VERY EASY</Msg><Username>bry345</Username><Timestamp>1351002787255</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 10:33:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351002847010-188</Id><Topic><Title>Bank of America Corporation(BAC)</Title><Username>leafdnw29386</Username><Timestamp>1350999374629</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 09:36:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nice one, I will subscribe now.</Msg><Username>gladiscdddu73052</Username><Timestamp>1351002847010</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 10:34:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351002878316-189</Id><Title>Amazing that CA, PA, NY, NJ and Illinois will vote Obama</Title><Msg>Just how well have things been going in those states?

Bid now $9.32. Looking at a 10day chart shows $9.30 as support, and if that breaks it could test the $9.20 area quickly. So I'm splitting the difference waving a bid at ~$9.25. I'm staggering additional "gets" at ~10penny increments here during this sell side run... Regardless, from a 30 day 30min TA chart point of view I'd drawn an uptrend line off the ~$8.75 area that was touched back in Sept 26. That uptrend line, interestingly enough, is now being bounced off of....and it looks like that line should close the day at ~$9.34. Add to this the Fib retracements (using $8.75 to ~$9.60 shows the 38% retracement line sitting just north of $9.25. So that's the zone....it'll either bounce off or break back thru to the downside. Bid now $9.33. Let's see how it plays out.</Msg><Username>highlowsel</Username><Timestamp>1351007990596</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 11:59:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351008222650-232</Id><Title>Buy on the dips..this pig is headed to 12</Title><Msg>time to cash in !</Msg><Username>buckman2777</Username><Timestamp>1351008222650</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 12:03:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351008256232-233</Id><Topic><Title>Bank of America Corporation(BAC)</Title><Username>leafdnw29386</Username><Timestamp>1350999374629</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 09:36:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Cool!

Ms. Rothstein, who was ranked No. 2 on Barron's annual list of top women financial advisers in 2012, has joined Merrill Lynch's private banking and investments group in Beverly Hills, Calif. , along with her 11-member team. The team manages approximately $2.5 billion in assets. A spokesman for Merrill Lynch said that Ms. Rothstein and her team joined the firm on Friday. A spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley (MS) confirmed Ms. Rothstein's departure but declined further comment. Ms. Rothstein had been with Morgan Stanley since 2009, and previously was with Citigroup Inc. (C), according to Financial Industry Regulatory Authority records. For the past several months, the retail brokerage industry has had its collective eyes on Morgan Stanley after the firm completed a computer-system conversion for the majority of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management financial advisers. The conversion had some clear benefits, but there have also been some glitches. Some brokers have complained that problems stemming from the change have hurt their ability to serve clients. Some recruiters and advisers in the industry have anticipated a sizeable exodus from Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. But according to the firm's third- quarter results released last week, the retail brokerage so far had avoided massive defections. The number of advisers at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management did decline to 16, 829 as of Sept. 30 , down a net 105 from the end of the prior quarter. But average productivity among its ranks, reported in annualized revenue per adviser, rose to $790,000 , a 2% increase from the previous quarter. Some recruiters say more big departures may still be coming, as deals often take months to negotiate. Competing firms continue to circle Morgan Stanley advisers, too, attempting to woo top-producing advisers away with big pay packages. "For someone like this, of this caliber and size, it takes months," said recruiter Danny Sarch , referring to Ms. Rothstein's departure. Mr. Sarch, who did not work on Ms. Rothstein's deal, said he expects more defections to be announced in the coming months, and that they will likely show up in Morgan Stanley's fourth- and first-quarter adviser headcount and productivity numbers. "If people are unhappy, people are going to make a decision and move with their feet," he said. (Street Moves chronicles the migration of executives on Wall Street , with a particular emphasis on financial advisers with more than $1 million in annual production and who manage more than $100 million in client assets.)</Msg><Username>unc1ebenrice0roni</Username><Timestamp>1351015538028</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 14:05:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351015552862-302</Id><Title>IF REPUCAN POSITIONS ARE SO POSITIVE WHY DID MITTEN ROMNEY TURN INTO JETRO</Title><Msg>the last two debates.

If Obama wins, money will also be quickly transferred out of estates to take benefit of the $5.1 million exclusion per individual this year and passed to children and grandchildren. Lower and middle incomes will not have that financial flexibility--and will face a very tough road ahead. The only way to blunt that is to institute a tax on UNREALIZED capital gains, some sort of annual asset-based tax, and a value-added tax which taxes everyone on purchases of anything. A VAT is very regressive, but it would inhibit the rich from avoiding all taxes. The rich pay people (accountants and tax lawyers) what amounts to a small fee to deal w/things like an Obama second term.</Msg><Username>roboklerk</Username><Timestamp>1351016029171</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 14:13:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351016131123-305</Id><Topic><Title>BOFA takin brokers</Title><Username>unc1ebenrice0roni</Username><Timestamp>1351015538028</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 14:05:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You mean salesmen?

Obama has demonstrated that in-spite of the nonsense that the Republicans have thrown at him he has kept us safe, got the economy moving forward and jobs are being created. Just think where those seeking employment would have been had there been some cooperation from the the congress. When Romney ran in 2008 all the Republicans were against him. Same thing in in 2012. Now he is actually trying to mimic Obama and they are now for him.. The Republicans main object is to get back in, screw the middle class with further, mess with women's right and mess up the the economy again big time. Same thing all over again. LIKE GEORGE W.

Then look to see where the 2nd ban came in, was taken off and when all was done who was gone and who remained. Yet here we are some 4 years later ignoring CAUSE AND EFFECT. Bottom line is you are 100% correct. Now if we could just get those who are responsible to enforce. But don't hold your breath. The big picture is too vulnerable to actually enforce and cause buy ins. So we do it a wittle here and there and as we do watch those that survived make their way back up. BUT don't forget there are those that still need relief so expect some forced selling. LVS, WYNN, MGM and many others should see some downside pressure.

I went in pretty heavy again, as usual, many times too soon in BAC. Many of my buy points have worked out, but I always seem to have to average down big in BAC to make them work out well. I guess that is nothing new. Average down really seems to kill you only when a stock goes bankrupt or catastrophe hits the stock. Congratulations on the 7 Jan 14 calls if you are in really cheap.

It's a GOOD thing. And yes things are turning. Yet even so there are things to be done to help those exposed. Remember over the past few years many that were exposed were COUNTRIES. And as much as some might have wanted to CRUSH them, that was not in the best interest for the long term view. Good news BAC which by the way should get a medal for doing their part to save the system. And then became a punching bag for those who didn't want to take responsibility for their NO VOTE on 9/29/2008. Yet had ol BAC not stepped up, taken Mer things would have really been in the toilie. And although the gang of dimwits foeced Lewis out. Monyihan stood his ground, Buffet came in and the rest is now being written. When this is all said and done, WFC/JPM/BAC.. will do very very well. Although I also own JPM I wonder what they will do to keep up with BAC and the MER challenge. Fact is 8 months ago when I visited a BAC many of the MER offices within were quiet. Lately as I visit those same offices are BUSY. Hello tea leaves. Hang tough and relax. The time to worry was 4/2009.</Msg><Username>mewing39</Username><Timestamp>1351023035890</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 16:10:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351023449848-357</Id><Title>Sloan.

I was continuing to shout from the rooftops at the time as to what needed to be done. I don't presume to be an expert but some things are just too obvious to overlook. I am getting excited for something to light a boost under BAC's shares finally one of these days. They certainly were as you say, the punching bag for the rest of Wall Street and the general populace. Headquarters in North Carolina made them the "outsider" for the Wall Street crowd. Merrill will not be one that is easily wrested from their ownership now. No way will it be easy.Merrill is NYC legend so it's no longer Mr. Outsider for the financial district for BAC. BAC Merril sounds good to me.

Mitt Romney's Stunning turnaround in these past 3 debates Obama has lost support among Jewish women voters. Most Jews are Turn Against Obama across the 50 states, A Jewish Women Focus Group of 7,890 on October 22, 2012 President Obama Was arrogant, angry, disrespectfully, condescending and much to aggressive, did not look very presidential at all. Governor Mitt Romney looked much more presidential, ready to be commander-in-chief. America he said, needs a strong economy in order to have a strong military for our National Security now and in the future. We came away from this debate with a very good impression of Mitt Romney, in that he would be a “ a safe pair of hands.” We feel he’s tough enough to do what’s necessary, but laid-back enough not to do too much and get us into another war. Romney did not attack President Obama's policies, he simply pointed out a few improvements in a respectable way. During the debate Governor Mitt Romney seemed more like the president and Barack Obama more like the candidate and challenger. Governor Mitt Romney was calm, thoughtful, relaxed, steady and looked very presidential. He looked and acted ready to take the job as commander-in-chief. Expressed his views on Iran's Nuclear threat and the USA support of Israel, our good friend and ally. He impressed us tonight, in that a vote for him is a vote for American security, peace and safety, a strong economy, a strong military, millions of higher paying jobs, prosperity and quiet peaceful life for us and our families. The world is much to scary these days; Americans aren’t looking for a scary weak president. Tonight we came away with the feeling that President Obama is more the scary one, in America's weaken relationship with Israel, a closer to Nuclear Iran, our weak economy and the huge 16 Trillion Dollars in Debt, that in itself Threatens our National Security. We can not afford four more years of president Obama's spending and borrowing another 5 or 6 trillion dollars from countries like China. Our jewish women's focus group therefore endorse Governor Mitt Romney for the next president of the United States of America. Obama's Re-Election is very questionable.

And yup it was not a fun moment to those who didn't understand BAC wasn't going bye bye. It was just those trying to coerce them into doing things they didn't want to do. The bad guys lost and BAC won. Re the leaps. Before the 7's I had the Feb 2013 9's and kicked them out for 100%. Why..TIME.. With this stock one wants to have TIME so they do NOT catch you on the downside and it takes 8-10 weeks to run the clock. Just as it take 13 days to run the REG SHO clock. So here and now. 9.72 is a pivot. Until we close above that and HOLD it convincingly. BAC will be a buy on dips. Could it dip into the 7's. Well it does have a major float. So it's possible. But I am not expecting that and just the pull back to fill the gap. NOW could it turn to get above 10 to challenge 11. Sure. BUT I'll still be expecting them to fill that gap up. Until that is done I'm very positive being LONG. I just know this is BAC and like any stock that can be pushed ol BAC qualifes. I've not posted for awhile. NO reason to do so. But I may begin again now that we are closer to the end of the gang that was trying to impose their agenda on a great company. They pulled that crap with C when they stripped it of Smith Barney and THEN gave it to MS. OH REALLY. So hang tough. Just as GE just touched 23 and fillig gaps so too will BAC fill gaps. First the downs and then the UPS. Those ups as you know are higher.</Msg><Username>mewing39</Username><Timestamp>1351024566860</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 16:36:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351024585807-363</Id><Topic><Title>Hot Stock Picks!</Title><Username>mariannazvn308</Username><Timestamp>1350651314223</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 08:55:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Women Review Debate 3, Governor Mitt Romney Pasted The Test, Ready to Lead USA By USA_Jewish_Women 10 22 2012 Debate 3: Women's Review: President Obama Was Arrogant, Disrespectfully Angry Condescending to Governor Mitt Romney on Oct 22, 2012.

The polls are a joke and one can poll to suit the desired result. The FACT is that the MAJORITY of Women, Blacks, Hispanics, the age 30 and under, and Asian Americans will be voting for Obama. It doesn't cut for Romney even knowing that ALL Republicans (+ the fringe) and most Christian fanatics are for Romney. They are in the Minority. Furthermore, ACCORDING to Romney, anyway a large percentage (47%?) will be on Obama's side. Only politically blinded won't see the real picture that Obama will be re-elected. One BIG CAVEAT I have is that the GOP (in desperation) COULD STEAL this election by rigged electronic voting machines... in several CRITICAL STATES. These machines leave no trace behind. The hatred against Obama is so extreme that the GOP fanatics are indeed capable of the greatest mischief! Any wonder why some of the Polls KEEP TOUTING WITH SO MUCH EMPHASIS that Obama and Romney are even! That help the GOP steal the election with psychological preparation of the citizens. Never underestimate the 1% super rich owners of America! Romney is their MAN! candidate! They have the POWER/MONEY. And power is never given... it must be taken!</Msg><Username>giovannijay</Username><Timestamp>1351029517107</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 17:58:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351029899570-387</Id><Topic><Title>FB beat earnings, stocks will go higher tomorrow !!!</Title><Username>kds5862</Username><Timestamp>1351027154204</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 17:19:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Probably correct</Msg><Username>icsammis</Username><Timestamp>1351029899570</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 18:04:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351029925988-388</Id><Topic><Title>AFTER YESTERDAY'S DEBATE, WHO EXCEPT OBAMA HATERS WILL VOTE FOR ROMNEY</Title><Username>farawaylife</Username><Timestamp>1351028766330</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 17:46:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>tied or leeding in most polls...Romney</Msg><Username>milesed18</Username><Timestamp>1351029925988</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 18:05:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351030115613-389</Id><Topic><Title>Bank of America Corporation(BAC)</Title><Username>leafdnw29386</Username><Timestamp>1350999374629</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 09:36:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I got it for free.

The rough count based on the FACTS above clearly says... A Landslide Win for Obama! I have one big caveat. The GOP could steal this election. In critical states where it matters, the desperation can easily make them to rig the software in those electronic voting machines that leave no trace behind. This is serious. Knowing the above FACTS, several polls TOUTING that the race is even in many critical states is of great concern. POLLS can always be 'used' to produce the desired end... twisting the methodology or even fabricating the polls. This even race thing is not good news. The facts do not support it. But it could be deliberately staged in preparation to steal an election... without angering the majority. It smells like psychological preparation to make it believable when the stealing follows. We should be highly aware of that and every vote should be properly identifiable. I will hold Democrats responsible for this. An an independent I have no power to check on thieves. This is very serious. What happened in 2000 in Florida was a terrible thing.. and it was let go... but as a consequence... we as a nation paid a big price- 911 Tragedy, Two Wars and a Financial Disaster! We have already seen and experienced that the GOP is totally UNFIT for LEADING our nation! They act irresponsibly and obstruct even our collective national good... just for selfish party reasons.

The change from yesterday’s Post-ABC tracking poll, which showed the race 49 to 48 percent the other way, is statistically insignificant, and the numbers do not include any public reaction to the third and final presidential debate Monday night. Almost all of Monday’s interviews were conducted before the debate started. But there are fledgling signs of a fresh advantage for the challenger. Asked whom they trust on the economy, 50 percent of likely voters say Romney while 45 percent side with the president. That’s the first time this fall that either candidate has had even an apparent edge on the clear No. 1 issue on voters’ minds. Political independents break for Romney by a 12-percentage-point margin on the subject, a high for the campaign.</Msg><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1351041388408</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 21:16:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351041410250-423</Id><Topic><Title>Idiot Obama should quit along with Joe Biden</Title><Username>kingofvietnam</Username><Timestamp>1346303591613</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 01:13:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"This is deadly earnest," Biden said.

Todd Akin, the anti-abortion congressman who infamously asserted that women don't get pregnant from "legitimate rape." "The only exception I have to have an abortion is in the case of the life of the mother," said Mourdock, the Tea Party-backed state treasurer. "I struggled with it myself for a long time, but I came to realize life is that gift from God. I think that even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape, that it is something that God intended to happen." Mourdock unseated veteran Republican Sen. Richard Lugar in the May primary, and has battled Donnelly for the longtime senator's supporters since. Abortion has been a touchy issue for the candidates, with Mourdock accusing Donnelly of lacking strength on the issue because Donnelly backed the health care reform law. Donnelly has criticized a requirement that ensures women can get birth control, even when their employer objects to contraception. "I believe in pro-life," Donnelly said, carving out somewhat more moderate anti-abortion stance. "I believe that life begins at conception. The only exceptions I believe in are for rape, incest and the life a mother." Horning argued that the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision was unconstitutional, and that abortion issues should be state matters.</Msg><Username>fingr1ikengud</Username><Timestamp>1351047312042</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 22:55:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351047312657-451</Id><Title>The idiot tea bagger fools provide low-brow juvenile entertainment, but that's all.</Title><Msg>They are SO ignotant, backward, uneducated, and just plain stupid that nothing they say can be taken seriously.

Americans are abandoning support for a man who has talked a good game, but failed to provide good jobs, affordable energy and a strong economy that Americans expect. Even worse, Obama’s foreign policy chickens are coming home to roost. September 11th is the when the tide formally turned for President Obama in 2012. Our embassy consulate in Libya was attacked and gutted in a terrorist attack by al-qaeda muslim savages (capitalization intentional). Not only did the Obama administration lie to the American people, claiming the murder of our Ambassador, a diplomat and two former Navy SEALs was the result of a savage islamic protest, but they then blamed a YouTube video for the supposed protests for almost two weeks. To make matters worse, the justice department sought the arrest of the man responsible for that YouTube video in question, “Innocence of muslims” (again, capitalization intentional) – a production so bad that it was funny to watch. Many across America were stunned that the man who created this pathetic YouTube video was effectively arrested because of some “protests” by muslim extremists half a world away. What happened to free speech in America? Arresting film-makers here in America after “protests” allegedly over their film is not the America Americans know and love. To make matters worse, over one month has passed since the murder of our ambassador in Libya without any meaningful response from the Obama administration. All we’ve gotten from the White House is talk. They talk that we’ll bring those responsible to justice, but a few days later we find out the Obama administration has waited 17 days for VISAs to be issued to investigative personnel to enter Libya so they may go to the scene of the attack and look for evidence. What kind of farce is this? Americans are upset. We don’t want to bring those responsible to justice. We want to bring justice to those responsible. Just when the Libya debacle was winding down, President Obama calls the incident “not optimal”, once again ginning up American anger at the ineptitude with which Obama’s team has handed the attack and its follow-up. Most Americans recognize the murder of an ambassador and embassy staff isn’t “not optimal”, instead it is an act of war. But the September 11, 2012 attack was just the first and perhaps largest single issue of a cascade of problems for Obama and company. His disastrous first debate performance hurt him badly. Romney got his first opportunity to be seen alongside President Obama and Romney wasn’t the cold-hearted monster the mainstream media has painted him these last six-plus months. Americans saw first-hand and un-edited Romney’s calm and steady demeanor and his presidential appearance. Romney was human and likeable. Obama was cold and distracted, as if his mind was on his later plans with his wife on their 20th Anniversary instead of the debate. The Vice-Presidential debate gave us old Uncle Joe, the pompous jerk who seemed more like a slimy used-car salesman (no offense to car salesmen) than a Vice-President of the United States. Romney’s VP pick, the staunchly pro-gun Paul Ryan, held his own and didn’t get distracted or unnerved by Biden’s repeated interruptions and snickering. The second Presidential Debate saw Obama do better, but he still couldn’t match Romney’s juggernaut. Romney slashed Obama’s record in two minutes and left Obama stammering to change the subject. In another answer, he told Americans “it doesn’t have to be like this” referring to high gas prices, high unemployment and trillion-dollar deficits. Another key moment was Candy Crowley picking a gun control question as a “gotcha” moment against Romney. It turned out to be a huge “gotcha” for President Obama, who has successfully kept a very, very low profile on the gun issue for the last four years, instead telling voters he won’t take their guns time and time again. Obama’s answer contradicted four-years of sleight of hand by Obama. He basically affirmed his desire to see a ban on America’s favorite rifle, the AR-15, and tens of millions of similar guns and maybe even bans on affordable handguns as well. Romney? Romney said he opposes further gun control laws or banning certain guns. Period. Point Romney. It was worse than that though. The mainstream media trumpeted Obama’s call for banning semi-automatic rifles and many of his gun-owner supporters started asking themselves if President Obama was going to ban their hunting rifles and shotguns, along with guns they depend upon to defend their families from potential predatory criminals. Poll numbers continued to shift towards Romney in this time. States Obama previously expected to win are leaning Romney and Obama’s campaign team is triaging to staunch the bleeding of electoral votes. It continues to rain bad news at the White House and the Obama campaign headquarters. More recently, we find the Republicans are trouncing the Democratic Party in fundraising. In fact, the DNC is nearly 15 million in the red, basically relying on bank loans to subsidize their operation with over two weeks to go before the election. Obama has taken a 15 million loan from Bank of America in the past few days, apparently needing that money to pay their staff and campaign expenses. The Republicans, on the other hand, enjoy nearly $100 million in the bank, and they’re going to use that money to bury the Democrats in key races and states in the last couple of weeks before November 6th. At this point, if this trend doesn’t change quickly for Obama and crew, it’s not a matter of whether or not he’s going to lose, but the only question is how badly will it be and how much will be be in debt when it’s over. Get out and vote on November 6th. Help make this a reality for America. This entry was posted on October 20, 2012 at 1:35 pm and is filed under Blog.

Body language of blinking: When reading the body language or nonverbal communication of others one of the items that may identify deceit, lies, stress or even medical conditions is blinking. The action of blinking happens naturally and you can easily make mistakes when it comes to interpreting what blinking means. There are some actions that people really cannot control that perform necessary functions and blinking is one of them. This action keeps the eyes moisturized but also protects the eyes from debris and bright lights. The average person blinks every 3-12 seconds and that can work out to 8-10 blinks per minute unless under stress or medical conditions. Under stress, while fabricating or while lying the rate of blinking may increase. Body language of blinking and lying One common mistake that people make when reading the body language of a boyfriend, girlfriend, husband or wife is that they are too quick to believe that excessive blinking is a definite sign of lying. One of the signs of deception and or lying can be excessive blinking and through plenty of misinformation it’s an automatic belief in some it means lying. Now it may also be that the man or woman is under stress. You will have to be careful and baseline the person that you are examining to look for traits that would lead you to understand if it is a lie that is causing the blinking or jest the stress of being questioned. You will also want to take a look at the micro expressions that a man or woman has because if the person does not know about the accusations they should show surprise. As a man or woman lies they may have a cluster of body language actions that happen when they start to deceive or fabricate. There may be touching of the face, excessive licking of the lips, a change in the breathing patterns, lack of eye contact, a long rub or stroke of a body part like the arm or leg. With these clusters you may notice that the blink rate would increase. This is where you would want to start questioning the story of what is going on if there is a combination of these items going on. It could be either be the stress of the encounter or the fact that the man or woman is lying and in some instances it could be both. Just take your time before you make a judgment.</Msg><Username>aholewad</Username><Timestamp>1351050006502</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 23:40:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351050336920-464</Id><Title>Does the Romney Family Now Own Your e-Vote?</Title><Msg>Does the Romney Family Now Own Your e-Vote? Friday, 19 October 2012 09:12 By Gerry Bello, Bob Fitrakis and Harvey Wasserman, The Free Press Will you cast your vote this fall on a faulty electronic machine that's partly owned by the Romney Family? Will that machine decide whether Romney will then inherit the White House? Through a closely held equity fund called Solamere, Mitt Romney and his wife, son and brother are major investors in an investment firm called H.I.G. Capital. H.I.G. in turn holds a majority share and three out of five board members in Hart Intercivic, a company that owns the notoriously faulty electronic voting machines that will count the ballots in swing state Ohio November 7. Hart machines will also be used elsewhere in the United States. In other words, a candidate for the presidency of the United States, and his brother, wife and son, have a straight-line financial interest in the voting machines that could decide this fall's election. These machines cannot be monitored by the public. But they will help decide who "owns" the White House. Also see: Will Bain-Linked E-Voting Machines Give Romney the White House? They are especially crucial in Ohio, without which no Republican candidate has ever won the White House. In 2004, in the dead of election night, an electronic swing of more than 300,000 votes switched Ohio from the John Kerry column to George W. Bush, giving him a second term. A virtual statistical impossibility, the 6-plus% shift occurred between 12:20 and 2am election night as votes were being tallied by a GOP-controlled information technology firm on servers in a basement in Chattanooga, Tennessee. In defiance of a federal injunction, 56 of Ohio's 88 counties destroyed all election records, making a recount impossible. Ohio's governor and secretary of state in 2004 were both Republicans, as are the governors and secretaries of state in nine key swing states this year. As we have previously reported, H.I.G. Capital has on its board of directors at least three close associates of the Romney family. H.I.G. Capital directors John P. Bolduk and Douglas Berman are major Romney fundraisers. So is former Bain and H.I.G. manager Brian Shortsleeve. H.I.G. employees have contributed at least $338,000 to Romney's campaign. Fully a third of H.I.G.'s leadership previously worked at Romney's old Bain firm. But new research now shows that the association doesn't stop with mere friendship and business associations. Mitt Romney, his wife Ann Romney, and their son Tagg Romney are also invested in H.I.G. Capital, as is Mitt's brother G. Scott Romney. The investment comes in part through the privately held family equity firm called Solamere, which bears the name of the posh Utah ski community where the Romney family retreats to slide down the slopes. Unlike other private equity firms, Solamere does not invest in companies directly. Instead, Solamere invests in other private equity funds, like H.I.G. Capital. Solamere calls them partners. These partners, like H.I.G., then invest in various enterprises, like Hart Intercivic, the nation's third-largest voting machine manufacturer. As reported by Lee Fang of The Nation, Solamere was founded by Tagg Romney and Spencer Zwick, Papa Romney's campaign finance chair. Ann Romney and Mitt's brother G. Scott Romney are also invested. Mitt himself threw in $10 million "seed money" to get the fund going, and spoke personally to its first full investors conference. Solamere's public web presence has been reduced to a front page only, so a complete list of it's partners can not be found. But reportage by the New York Times, Boston Globe, Esquire and the Nation have slowly given us a partial picture of which funds are being funded by Solamere. Some $232 million has been raised so far, according to SEC filings and industry publications. In addition to Romney's finance chair Spencer Zwick, Solamere has also provided the campaign with its finance director, Richard Morley, and a western regional finance coordinator, Kaitlin O'Reilly. O'Reilly is listed as an executive assistant at Solamere, and also at SJZ LLC, which was founded by her boss Spencer Zwick. The SJZ LLC campaign finance consulting firm has billed Mitt's campaign over $2 million this election cycle as well as doing another $9,687,582 in billing to various Congressional Campaigns. The host of the private fundraiser at which Romney made his infamous "47%" speech was Marc J. Leder, co-CEO of Sun Capital, another "partner" of the Solamere fund. As in virtually every close presidential race, Ohio may well hold the key to the Electoral College decision as to who will become the nation's next chief executive. The presence of Hart Intercivic machines in Hamilton County, home to Cincinnati, means there is a high likelihood the votes that will decide the presidency will be cast on them. Major media like CBS have begun reporting that Cincinnati could be "ground zero" in this year's election. But these Hart machines are deeply flawed and widely know to be open to a troubling variety of attacks and breakdowns. There is no legal or other means to definitively monitor and re-check a tally compiled on Hart or other electronic voting machines. Ohio's current governor and secretary of state are both Republicans. Does this mean the Romney investment in Hart Intercivic through H.I.G. Capital and Solamere will yield it not only financial profits but the White House itself? Tune in during the deep night of November 7, when the electronic votes in swing state Ohio are once again opaquely reported to the nation and the world, without meaningful public scrutiny or legal recourse. Note: I posted in another post that Obama will win in a landslide but with a Caveat. That caveat was based on this article. I am concerned about this and GOP hatred of Obama can drive that ugly party doing anything, even worse than stealing this election!</Msg><Username>giovannijay</Username><Timestamp>1351050336920</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 23:45:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351050570513-465</Id><Title>j.farragut farthead, aka, cosmo_vitelli, aka Sakkk Sukkker, who is the coward using multiple aliases, has anal obesssive disorder</Title><Msg>because he was born with his head up his #$%$.

It could happen this year. Based on Greg Palast and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.'s investigative reporting for Rolling Stone and BBC television, Billionaires &amp; Ballot Bandits: How to Steal an Election in 9 Easy Steps might be the most important book published this year--one that could save the election. Last week Billionaires &amp; Ballot Bandits debuted on the NYT Bestseller list at #10 in paperback nonfiction. Billionaires &amp; Ballot Bandits names the filthy-rich sugar-daddies who are super-funding the Super-PACs of both parties--billionaires with nicknames like "The Ice Man," "The Vulture" and, of course, The Brothers Koch. Told with Palast's no-holds-barred, reporter-on-the-beat style, the facts as he lays them out are staggering. What emerges in Billionaires &amp; Ballot Bandits is the never-before-told-story of the epic battle being fought behind the scenes between the old money banking sector that still supports Obama, and the new hedge fund billionaires like Paul Singer who not only support Romney but also are among his key economic advisors. Although it has not been reported, Obama has shown some backbone in standing up to the financial excesses of the men behind Romney. Billionaires &amp; Ballot Bandits exposes the previously unreported details on how operatives plan to use the hundreds of millions in Super-PAC money pouring into this election. We know the money is pouring in, but Palast shows us the convoluted ways the money will be used to suppress your vote. The story of the billionaires and why they want to buy an election is matched with the nine ways they can steal the election. His story of the sophisticated new trickery will pick up on Palast's giant New York Times bestseller, The Best Democracy Money Can Buy.</Msg><Username>giovannijay</Username><Timestamp>1351050851341</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 23:54:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351050933657-469</Id><Topic><Title>What will all of these repug tea bagger fools do after Obama is re-elected?</Title><Username>j.farragut</Username><Timestamp>1351045049522</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 22:17:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>... they won't be creating jobs because of the Obama hostility/stupidity toward job creators, and the economy will remain in the crapper.</Msg><Username>mrstan4089</Username><Timestamp>1351050933657</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 23:55:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351051023997-470</Id><Topic><Title>Obama Looked Constantly Irritated</Title><Username>roboklerk</Username><Timestamp>1350996494761</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 08:48:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you read it correctly.

But his greatest trick off all was raking in millions from the auto rescue he opposed. In a stunning exposé published Thursday in the The Nation – with support from The Investigative Fund — reporter Greg Palast reveals how key donors to Romney’s campaign made more than a billion dollars off the restructuring of General Motors by holding a key player in the supply chain hostage to their demands during the heart of America’s worst jobs crisis in 50 years. Delphi Automotive is an auto parts maker that used to be part of General Motors and remains essential for auto production. Without Delphi, there would be no American automotive industry. And unfortunately for America, it ended up being controlled by Elliott Management. Elliott Management is run by  Paul Singer, a massive Republican donor and “defender of the 1 percent.” Ann Romney’s so-called blind trust invested at least a million dollars in Elliott before the fund began buying Delphi at vulture prices—about 20 cents on the dollar—during the worst of the Great Recession. When the hedge fund managers were told that they should save as many American jobs as they should, they refused and forced a judge to hold an auction for the company’s stock. Elliott eventually took over the entire company for 67 cents a share. Two years later Delphi shares were selling at $22 each, an astounding profit even for Mitt Romney. How did Delphi undergo such a remarkable turnaround? They took federal bailout funds, slashed worker pensions, fired union workers and sent American jobs overseas. Greg Palast explains, “The bottom line: the hedge funds’ paydays were made possible by a generous donation of $12.9 billion from US taxpayers.” We have no idea how much the Romneys made from the auto bailout, but knowing that he was the only national figure who opposed the rescue, saying that it would destroy the industry, it’s safe to say that even one cent would be too much.</Msg><Username>giovannijay</Username><Timestamp>1351051167438</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 23:59:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
