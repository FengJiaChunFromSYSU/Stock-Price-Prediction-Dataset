Soon after, several decisive actions by the president demonstrated his determination to show that lines had been crossed. One came in August with the firing of striking air traffic controllers. Another came Nov. 20, when Reagan vetoed an appropriations bill that did not achieve at least half of his proposed reduction of $8.4 billion in domestic spending. In the absence of appropriations, the administration shut down the government for four days. That shutdown ended with the passage of a “clean” continuing resolution that provided appropriations through Dec. 15, during which time a deal was negotiated for funding the remainder of the fiscal year. But on Oct. 1, 1982, a battle over spending levels again resulted in a shutdown. After two days, Congress passed a short continuing resolution. When that expired Dec. 17, another shutdown ensued, lasting five days. It ended with an agreement in which Democrats dropped their demand for a hugely expensive “jobs bill” and Reagan gave up funding for the MX missile program. A year later, in November 1983, it was deja vu all over again. O’Neill and other House Democrats voted to increase education by a billion dollars beyond the president’s request and made deep cuts in defense. A short-term continuing resolution expired, and a five-day shutdown began. It ended with a compromise in which education funding increased by just $100 million and the MX missile was funded. In the presidential election year of 1984, Democrats insisted on a massive increase in funding for water projects and a civil rights legislative package. Republicans attached to the continuing resolution a crime bill that Reagan had proposed. A brief shutdown ensued on Oct. 1, just a month before Election Day. The parties agreed to a temporary extension to keep negotiating, but that too expired before Democrats dropped their water-project funding and civil rights legislation, after which Reagan signed</Msg><Username>us.debt_crisis</Username><Timestamp>1381292483235</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-09 00:21:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381292530983-20</Id><Topic><Title>Is Obama's Plan to Default and then Declare Martial Law?</Title><Username>frankster1955a</Username><Timestamp>1381262626766</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-08 16:03:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>a one-year continuing resolution. Later, in Reagan’s second term, there were two more shutdowns: in October 1986 and December 1987. In none of these instances did the world come to an end. In each of them, the president engaged in good-faith negotiations to resolve the impasse. Reagan never refused to talk seriously with O’Neill and House Democrats. Each side approached shutdowns as an “action-forcing event,” in which hard bargaining would take place. Both sides recognized that the power of the purse was the most important power that Congress wielded and that a great deal of policy was made through spending decisions. They understood that it was perfectly legitimate for both a president and Congress to use spending fights as a forum for the resolution of policy disputes.</Msg><Username>us.debt_crisis</Username><Timestamp>1381292530983</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-09 00:22:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1381294711786-21</Id><Title>No more excuses for this fraud.

Once it did, that bill would retroactively fund the spending gap. But in 1980, Jimmy Carter's last year as president, then-attorney general Benjamin Civiletti issued a legal opinion saying government work cannot continue until Congress agrees to fund it. Civiletti later clarified the law to mean only "essential" government services could continue without a spending bill. During Ronald Reagan's presidency from 1981 to 1989, shutdowns were relatively common, but none of them lasted more than three days, and many occurred over a weekend. Shutdown costs The longer a shutdown lasts, the more it costs. The Office of Management and Budget estimated the cost of the two government shutdowns of 1995 to 1996 at more than $1.4 billion. The Pew Research Center says that would be equal to $2.1 billion now, when adjusted for inflation.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1381297617884</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-09 01:46:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381298004486-24</Id><Topic><Title>Is Obama's Plan to Default and then Declare Martial Law?</Title><Username>frankster1955a</Username><Timestamp>1381262626766</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-08 16:03:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think the APE is being setup for impeachment!</Msg><Username>zelmo0007</Username><Timestamp>1381298004486</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-09 01:53:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1381299031256-25</Id><Title>Obama Didn't Sound Like a Nobel Peace Prize Winner</Title><Msg>He needs to show his expertise.

What is happening is stagnation in the major indices. This happens when the large derivative players are shifting their positions. They are now moving money and are going to bet against both markets. In the past this is when large corrections take place (over 10 percent). The large derivative players are the ones that run the indices. For example look at Warren Buffet; he is a heavy derivative player that has, over the last five years, substantially decreased his position in stocks and gone the derivative route. Smart, rich player. Derivative are an easy way to hide money.......so large losses can be covered up. The SEC does not understand this and they cannot track this. The result is no regulation. It will only take one major, dishonest derivative player to send our financial systems into ruin.</Msg><Username>geraldmcginty2</Username><Timestamp>1381327320578</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-09 10:02:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381327341993-58</Id><Topic><Title>Two very large, dishonest derivative players will bring down the world financial markets</Title><Username>geraldmcginty2</Username><Timestamp>1381327320578</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-09 10:02:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Keep looking and connect the dots. If this helps I will add some credibility: 1. In 1988 I wrote a paper at Ohio State University about satellite TV to a Dr Jeff Rodgers; I still have the graded paper and the 3 1/2 floppy to prove this. Satellite TV was supposedly discovered in 1990. 2. I bought a brand new 2006 Toyota Prius just before gas prices rose sharply and stayed at elevated levels. 3. Four months before Hurricane Sandy hit the East cost I lowered my deductible on my Home Owners insurance from $1500 to $500. I live in NJ, but I was lucky and no damage occurred to my home. 4. Two years before the LIBOR manipulation occurred I knew about it and talked about it openly when my passsengers plane was up in maintenance in Hartford, CT to Dave Popowich and at a pool party on Long Island.

Renowned Economist Harry Dent Dow Jones to Drop to 3,300 The Man Who Predicted Japan’s Lost Decade… The Recession of 1990-92… The Biggest Bull Market Run in U.S. History… and Most Recently, the 2008 Credit Crisis and Stock Market Crash… Now Predicts: Yes, today the Dow Jones Average may be near historic highs… but it won’t be for long! The Dow will drop. My name is Harry Dent. For the past 30 years, I’ve used the Science of Demographics to predict major economic and market shifts with uncanny accuracy… decades ahead of time. Many investors are making the mistake of thinking the downturn is over, and Dow stocks will continue to roar upward. But that’s not what my research indicates. Not even close. I see the Dow Jones Average winding down, week after week… falling through the 12,000 mark… below 10,000, then 9,000, 8,000… to 6,440 – where it’s likely to rally briefly… before ultimately dropping as low as 3,300. And there’s nothing you or I, or any politician or government, or any team of monetary experts can do to stop the Dow Jones Index from dropping. But here’s the good news, extraordinary wealth can be made by knowing the future. In Survive &amp; Prosper, my free e-letter, I’ll show you my economic analysis and demographic research that proves the DOW is about to make a historic drop. But that’s just the beginning, you’ll also learn: • How to predict the economic future! Imagine if you knew when to buy stocks like Microsoft during the tech bubble for $.85 a share after factoring in splits – and watched it rocket to over $58, a better than 67-to-1 windfall. I will show how predicting and profiting from the future is a SCIENCE and is easier than you might have imagined. • How to retire in luxury, with enough money to live like a millionaire and leave a “legacy of wealth” to your children and heirs… by using the same strategies the Kennedy, Melons, and Carnegie families used to build lasting wealth</Msg><Username>fairvalue23</Username><Timestamp>1381343453437</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-09 14:30:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1381343486933-129</Id><Title>Critical warning: Dow 5000 crash of 65%; Former Goldman Sachs trader....</Title><Msg>Critical warning: Dow 5000 crash of 65%; Former Goldman Sachs trader.Critical warning: Dow 5000 crash of 65%; Former Goldman Sachs trader..Critical warning: Dow 5; 000; crash of 65%; Former Goldman Sachs trader.Critical warning: Dow 5; 000; crash of 65%; Former Goldman Sachs trader Terry Burnham is right to warn that the sucker's bull market of 1928 is repeating; writes Paul Farrell Less Less Less Less</Msg><Username>fairvalue23</Username><Timestamp>1381343486933</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-09 14:31:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1381343540369-130</Id><Title>Goldman Sachs Charles Nenner Dow eventually hitting 5000 in 2013..........</Title><Msg>Goldman Sachs Charles Nenner Dow eventually hitting 5000 in 2013.......Goldman Sachs Charles Nenner Dow eventually hitting 5000 in 2013......

OPEC Says Supply Ample, Speculation Driving Price , | 03 Oct 2013 | 06:18 AM ET Oil supply will be more than sufficient to meet demand this year and beyond, OPEC's Secretary General said on Thursday, but added the price of fuel is being driven higher by speculation. "There has been no shortage of oil in the market. Producers have been able to meet consumer needs," Abdullah al-Badri told an energy conference. "We also see this as being the case for the rest of 2012 and the foreseeable future." Oil prices surged in March to $128 a barrel, the highest level since 2008, because of concern about possible supply shortages. Prices have since fallen back and brent crude was trading around $118 on Thursday. "Today the price continues to be driven by excessive speculation," Badri said. OPEC at a meeting in December set a target to produce 30 million barrels per day, settling an argument which broke out in 2011 after Iran and other members opposed a Saudi-led plan to raise OPEC's production ceiling. Output has remained above the target all year as Libyan supply recovered after being virtually shut down during the 2011 uprising against Muammar Gaddafi's rule. The extra oil is filling gaps caused by an unusually large number of supply outages globally, which have also helped support prices. Supply breaks were running at nearly 1.3 million bpd as of early April. The additional supply has also offset a decline in exports from Iran, which is facing stiffening western sanctions over its disputed nuclear energy program. Iranian oil exports were running at between 200,000 and 300,000 barrels per day below last year's level, Maria van der Hoeven, head of the International Energy Agency, told Thursday's conference. Iranian officials have said the country exported an average of 2.2 million barrels a day last year.

Next a cemetery (with an e) is not vital and neither are parks or memorials. Benefits have not been cut off. Benefits for someone killed is pretty funny. Actually that is the death benefit for the family that has been delayed. The dead soldier isn't too worried about his benefits. Every day 2000 more VA benefit claims are not being processed because the GOP has shut down the government. The government was clearly shut down by the GOP. They haven't even allowed a vote on a clean funding bill. This is what happens when irresponsible Congress people hijack the government for an ideological, dispute. I guess you know the GOP is now trying to change the subject and claim it is spending and the deficit they want to talk about, not Obamacare. They are trying to hide the egg on their face with a new subject. Too late. They haven't been willing to negotiate the budget with the senate for 6 months now they whine that no one is talking to them. They also have a bunch of nut jobs running around saying "Oh defaulting won't be so bad, lets try it."</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1381360055027</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-09 19:07:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381360903174-193</Id><Topic><Title>Debt Ceiling - A Peculiar Phenomenon Exist Only In The U.S.</Title><Username>loomanddoom</Username><Timestamp>1381266771328</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-08 17:12:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>pf-suckhole, You have an excuse because I beieve you are stupid!

I wonder how many memorials could have been kept open if BO gave Air Force One a rest. Small wonder his approval rating is now down to 41%. Maybe his little ploy has backfired.

According to whom? None other than the Pew Research Center, a left-of-center organization. Moreover, Pew’s latest survey only reaffirms previous surveys demonstrating the same result. In fact, the results weren’t even close. In a scientific survey of 1,168 adults conducted during September and October of last year, respondents were asked not only multiple-choice questions, but also queries using maps, photographs and symbols. Among other subjects, participants identified international leaders, cabinet members, Supreme Court justices, nations on a world map, the current unemployment and poverty rates and war casualty totals. In a 2010 Pew survey, Republicans outperformed Democrats on 10 of 12 questions, with one tie and Democrats outperforming Republicans on just 1 of the 12. In the latest survey, however, Republicans outperformed Democrats on every single one of 19 questions.</Msg><Username>fevoter</Username><Timestamp>1381369234618</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-09 21:40:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381369255216-223</Id><Topic><Title>After 3 Yrs and Billions of Dollars We have a Non Functioning Obamacare</Title><Username>pooperscoopers32</Username><Timestamp>1381368819318</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-09 21:33:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Rewind to January 2009...after 8 years and TRILLIONS of dollars...GW Bush FINALLY is out of office.

While I understand GDP to debt, it's not the best measure. Not only that, your numbers most likely reflect nominal GDP and not real GDP. Investopedia explains 'Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP)' Unlike nominal GDP, real GDP can account for changes in the price level, and provide a more accurate figure. Let's consider an example. Say in 2004, nominal GDP is $200 billion. However, due to an increase in the level of prices from 2000 (the base year) to 2004, real GDP is actually $170 billion. The lower real GDP reflects the price changes while nominal does not. The fact remains, our GDP is limping along. In 2012, it grew to 2.2%, from 1.8% the previous year. But that's still a long way off, from what is needed to grow our economy.

It's the youth against the adults. It always has been. It's all about which party can grab the middle of the two, and also get their base to vote. Dems won that battle these last 2 times. I was actually hoping he would do well, just so we would do well. Nov. 2014 should be interesting. We'll actually understand ACA by then.
