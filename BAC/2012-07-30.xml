Miss you over the weekend. It looks like you're back bashing BAC. My daily accrued interest has dropped because the banks are paying off their debts. Barclays Bank just payoff their 5% corporate note, making me find another. Found a Morgan Stanley Corporate Note a little over par at 6.375%, an increase of over $700. That's over the $2600 Barclays Bank had been paying me. Morgan Stanley's note will be callable in the year 2042. It's hard to find bank corporate bonds at par value any more. I'm sitting with a pile of cash getting .05% with no place to put it. This is why my $106 accrued interest has drop to $98.98 a day. Some of the notes lost due to being called were 6.2%, 6.65%, 6.05%, 6.52%, 6.3%, 6.1% and 6.2%. Six of which were called by BAC, one by Bank New York and the one by Barclays Bank. Bought another BAC note a little over par on Friday at 6%, which I believe will be called in March of next year. However, I'll still make a profit on the buyback.</Msg><Username>m.inally</Username><Timestamp>1343652778745</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 08:52:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343654196645-6</Id><Topic><Title>traderx and brazentrader are the same person...</Title><Username>kds5862</Username><Timestamp>1343168605369</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 18:23:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>everyone knows Traderx and brazentrader is the same guy, also he is other people too.

Actually, there are quite a few:As chairman of the Illinois Health &amp; Human Services Committee beginning in January 2003, then-Senator Obama oversaw activities of the Health Facilities Planning Board that granted permits required for proposed hospital expansions. The Board had a long bipartisan history of corrupt practices dating back to previous administrations of two Republican governors who appointed members in exchange for kickbacks. Governor Blago was certainly no exception. Tony Rezko was his deal-arranger, and also a big Blago and Obama campaign contributor.Levine testified as the star witness in the Operation Board Games corruption trial and pled guilty to avoid a life sentence. After jury selection began, the questionnaire list of possible witnesses who might be called included Barack Obama. According to trial records, a June 2003 e-mail exchange shows that Obama was one of eight officials who received names of new Board nominees in advance from David Wilhelm, who had headed Blago's 2002 campaign for mayor. Many or all of the successful new appointees were contributors to campaigns of then-presidential hopeful Blagojevich and U.S. Senate hopeful Obama.There can be no doubt that Obama knew of Rezko's strong connection to Blago. This is evident since, even as a state senator, he went through Rezko to have his and Michelle's close friend Dr. Eric Whitaker appointed by Blago to high positions at the Chicago Medical Center.Thomas (formerly Bernard Barton), wearing a wire, conducted surveillance of numerous visits of Blago, Obama, and other public officials, including Chicago Housing Authority Chairman Marty Nesbitt, to Rezko's near north side real estate office. Although the Chicago Tribune was already aware of Thomas' role in May 2006, Fitzgerald intervened to prevent the paper from releasing an article about this because the editors were told that such a release would derail the investigation and put people in danger.Obama was still chairman of the Illinois Health &amp; Human Services Committee when lawmakers learned that the feds were investigating the Illinois Health Facilities Planning Board schemes in the spring of 2004...a year before Obama entered into a scandalous real estate deal with Rezko. In December 2009, World Net Daily reported that "Obama's senatorial office engaged in six months of negotiations with a company controlled by Rezko to lobby the U.S. government to push through a nixed contract to train Iraqi security personnel at a site in Chicago." The contract was signed on April 18, 2005, one month before Alsammarae left his government post prior to his arrest. His replacement later aborted the deal. Alsammarae had also awarded another Rezko-controlled operation a $150-million contract to construct a 250-megawatt electricity plant in Iraq. After Rezko was arrested on various corruption charges, Alsammarae posted more than one-third of Rezko's jail bond, putting up surety of his $1.9-million Chicago home and two other properties totaling $2.7 million. He also contributed to Obama, giving the maximum allowable presidential campaign donation of $2,300 during 2008. Obama later decided to give that "tainted" money to charity.From that time on, Barack Obama, strongly advocated by power-broker David Axelrod, became their man for the job. But this time, Tony Rezko wasn't there to help. Following a period of solitary confinement in a Chicago lockup, he was reportedly transferred to a secret location somewhere in Wisconsin, where he currently resides. The feds are still keeping him under tight wraps.</Msg><Username>tulsaturd</Username><Timestamp>1343668408196</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 13:13:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343669238132-32</Id><Title>Bank of Cuba</Title><Msg>Headquater Havana</Msg><Username>joeschoft</Username><Timestamp>1343669238132</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 13:27:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343669429376-33</Id><Topic><Title>BAC will get the settlement done and BAC will be over $8 soon</Title><Username>king_kim_1</Username><Timestamp>1343658039053</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 10:20:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Unfortunately, they won't have much of a case against the homeowners who lied about their income.

Instead, all they do is cry like babies and act like they are the victims (more like victims of self induced stupidity).</Msg><Username>fbi4hire</Username><Timestamp>1343669429376</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 13:30:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343670170890-34</Id><Title>Funny!</Title><Msg>"Obama doesn't have a clue about business — he wouldn't know how to run the Bunny Ranch.

You have helped much with BAC floor. When would you like it to see BAC return to near or above Intrinsic value?</Title><Msg>Warren Buffett has helped to put the essential low 7's floor here. I wonder how long he wants to wait before he does something publicly to get this headed back toward 10 or 15 dollars. He likes to buy at 2/3 of the intrinsic value of a company. So he must think this is at least worth a solid 10 dollars or higher. He doesn't change his safety factor buy in points much. He may have even seen it as a higher intrinsic value and bought at where he is willing to hold at and that is usually holding until you lose nearly 50 percent of current stock price. If that were the case then low 7's may reflect him thinking BAC has a solid intrinsic value of 14 dollars a share or so. The market may be waiting on you to make a statement or indicate a move on the BAC share price. Thank you very much again for last year's August purchase of BAC position that has YOUR name written on the purchase this time, not just an associate's name.

Nevertheless, Iraq and Afghanistan went on to ring up human, financial, diplomatic and strategics costs almost as if they were the Real Deal. How much? According to a study released yesterday by Brown University's Watson Institute for International Studies titled 'The Costs of War', "In the 10 years since U.S. troops went into Afghanistan to root out the al Qaeda leaders behind the September 11, 2001, attacks, spending on the conflicts [in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan] totaled $2.3 trillion to $2.7 trillion. Those numbers will continue to soar when considering often overlooked costs such as long-term obligations to wounded veterans and projected war spending from 2012 through 2020. The estimates do not include at least $1 trillion more in interest payments coming due and many billions more in expenses that cannot be counted." The report also notes that "In human terms, 224,000 to 258,000 people have died directly from warfare, including 125,000 civilians in Iraq. Many more have died indirectly, from the loss of clean drinking water, healthcare, and nutrition. An additional 365,000 have been wounded and 7.8 million people -- equal to the combined population of Connecticut and Kentucky -- have been displaced." The report underlines the extent to which war will continue to stretch the U.S. federal budget, which is already on an unsustainable course due to an aging American population and skyrocketing healthcare costs. It also raises the question of what the United States gained from its multitrillion-dollar investment. And what is Romney's proposed solution to this untenable drain on our nation's resources? Double the Defense budget and start a few new wars. If this is any indication of Romney's business genius, he needs to be told in no uncertain terms to take it back to the hotdog stand where it belongs.</Msg><Username>fish2kill</Username><Timestamp>1343694246297</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 20:24:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343694617377-96</Id><Topic><Title>Oh Great ............</Title><Username>drcwls</Username><Timestamp>1343684725024</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 17:45:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>have you been talking to him back-channel, or do you just jerk things out of your underwear and try to stick them in other peoples' mouths?

The First Lady's fashion "cost more than the average American family makes in a month," blogger site Gateway Pundit posted, citing that the average American family earns $4,284 a month. The wife of President Barack Obama is often hailed by fashion critics for her style choices. Her coat Friday was designed by J. Mendel, and Mrs. Obama paired the garment with sliver heels.</Msg><Username>sista_twistak</Username><Timestamp>1343698646793</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 21:37:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343698729196-107</Id><Topic><Title>RRRRRRRRRRomney 2012 !!</Title><Username>zip_i_t_do_da</Username><Timestamp>1343696169386</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 20:56:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Oh he is going down...the only way he could win is if romney falls on his face..ilmao</Msg><Username>milesed18</Username><Timestamp>1343698729196</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 21:38:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343698885523-108</Id><Topic><Title>Democrats for Romney</Title><Username>concerned_democrat_32</Username><Timestamp>1343688661295</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 18:51:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>AND MY VOTE KILLS YOURS..ILMAO</Msg><Username>milesed18</Username><Timestamp>1343698885523</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 21:41:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343698963830-109</Id><Topic><Title>TraderX and other aliases</Title><Username>jburke2133</Username><Timestamp>1343324809230</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 13:46:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Tell us about your short with STLD!</Msg><Username>m.inally</Username><Timestamp>1343698963830</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 21:42:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343699068066-110</Id><Title>ROMNEY OPENING UP A 4% LEAD NOW!!!

And when a sluggish republic hinders progress, it's time to act. Just ask Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who advanced an astonishing argument the other day on the Senate floor: The president, explained Reid, is free to unilaterally craft immigration policy because we've tried to do that for years, and we can't because they won't let us. Ah, they. For those of you who have forgotten, in "The Federalist," Paper 51, Publius writes: "In a republic, all the power surrendered by the people is submitted to the administration of a single government; and the usurpations are guarded against by a division of the government into distinct and separate departments. ... Then again, if 'they don't let you,' well, feel free to disregard the previous 900,000 words." Today's Democratic logic goes like this: If Congress is unable to pass progressive agenda items with a simple majority of legislators (and thankfully, that's the case), the vote of a single person will do just fine. President Obama is, after all, on his "We Can't Wait" tour. " We can't wait for Congress to do its job," Obama told supporters on a recent campaign stop. "So where they won't act, I will. We're going to look every single day to figure out what we can do without Congress." That's the spirit! One might forgive a little autocratic hyperbole in the heat of a campaign season, but Obama isn't joking. He can't wait. Only recently, he circumvented Congress on college loans and mortgages; he directed the Justice Department to stop defending the Defense of Marriage Act; through rulemaking, he empowered the Environmental Protection Agency to effectively institute legislation that Democrats could not pass; he involved the United States in military action in Libya (the right kind of warring, apparently) without congressional consent; he installed four recess appointments without a recess; and that's just for starters. This week he couldn't wait again. Even if you agree substantively with Obama's decision to grant 800,000 young illegal immigrants a reprieve from deportation -- as I do -- having a president undo a perfectly legitimate legislative deadlock by simply ignoring the law is a precedent that should alarm everyone. So should Obama's invocation of executive privilege in the Fast and Furious gunrunning investigation regarding a document that he supposedly knew nothing about. No, Obama isn't the first president to issue oodles of executive orders or expand and abuse the power of the presidency. Far from it. Yet, onlookers supposedly horrified by executive overreach a few years ago are doing a terrible job rationalizing it now. A few months back, The New York Times editorial page editor Andrew Rosenthal rationalized Obama's abuse of executive power by deploying an age-old excuse for abuse: "Context and intent make all the difference." No, they make no difference. That's why we have embedded constitutional safeguards, safeguards that should be in place even if abuses are sanctioned by New York Times editorial board members. The left claims there is an unprecedented level of obstructionism in Washington (failing to note that perhaps there is an unprecedented level of terrible legislation in need of obstruction) that necessitates alternative methods. Hey, maybe some of us believe that "do nothing" Congresses are the most productive. At the very least, Americans should be more comfortable with obstructionism than with executive unilateralism no matter what the outcome.

Romney isn't even winning the argument he's been having with himself (his selves?), so there's every reason to expect that his debate performance against Obama will turn things around for the Dems. By the same token, if Obama doesn't take off his gloves real soon and strangle Romney with the Bain and Stericycle ropes, he might as well take a dive. This is a race to the bottom between two world-class horse's #$%$ and regardless of how they finish, there won't be more than a browneye of separation between them. Just try not to think about how much money it took to field this pair of supposed show horses, and how much better off we'd all be if we dispatched both of these nags to the glue factory instead of pretending that either one of them is a thoroughbred. BTW, Romney's photo op at the Wailing Wall was brilliant! ROTFLMAO imagining how natural he'd look hamming it up for the paparazzi in an Abrams tank.</Msg><Username>fish2kill</Username><Timestamp>1343706440971</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 23:47:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
