Huge Hurdle President Is Now Facing With just days left until the election, President Obama has been thrown a challenge that could determine whether he gets reelected. Risky decision he was forced to make .................................................................... WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama has spent months trying to balance his re-election bid with running the government. Now, just when his campaign needs him the most, with little more than a week before the election, his official job is beckoning. But as president, it's Obama who oversees the federal government's preparations for the looming storm and it's Obama who will bear the responsibility for any missteps. With that in mind, Obama scrapped campaign events Monday night and Tuesday morning. He planned to return to the White House late Monday to monitor the storm and the government's response. "This is an example, yet again, of the president having to put his responsibilities as commander in chief and as leader of the country first, while at the same time he pursues his responsibilities as a candidate for re-election," Josh Earnest, a White House spokesman, told reporters traveling with Obama to a campaign event Saturday in New Hampshire.</Msg><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1351500786245</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-29 04:53:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351500919310-13</Id><Topic><Title>McCain: Worst cover-up I've ever participated in</Title><Username>obamammxii</Username><Timestamp>1351467865696</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 19:44:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Timely good call.

And if you can go even further, and send it back to the private sector, that’s even better. Instead of thinking, in the federal budget, what we should cut, we should ask the opposite question, what should we keep?…” John King: “Including disaster relief, though?” Romney: “We cannot — we cannot afford to do those things without jeopardizing the future for our kids.

That seemingly sounds positive, but since its “election season,” we need to delve deeper into the data to get the real story. When you pull back the curtain, you of course see Mr. Wizzard manipulating the numbers. Because of the 2.02% annualized increase in GDP, over one third, or 0.71 %( compared to a deduction of -0.14% in Q2), was contributed by "Government Consumption." This was the biggest rise in government spending in 3 years, and only the first contribution by Uncle Sam to its own GDP print since Q2 2010. So in much the same way as the September jobs print soared courtesy of government employee hiring, this same government is padding its own numbers to make itself look better. The real question is what the second and third Q3 GDP revisions will show, which both come, luckily, after the election. Recall that Q2 GDP initially came out at 1.5%, then was revised to 1.7%, until finally coming to rest at 1.25%. It’s Oz economics. We put on the ruby slippers, click our heels three times and say, “There’s no place like home.” Of course, home is underwater from bad loans, but that’s another story for another day.</Msg><Username>rhinoinchgo</Username><Timestamp>1351527108018</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-29 12:11:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351527273199-67</Id><Topic><Title>A riminder to those impacted by Sandy</Title><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1351522350085</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-29 10:52:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yeah, but on what DAY did the interview take place?

He also said that he was going to get equal pay for women and did not even sign the bill that came on his desk.. He did not even get the Health care bill passed. You and your family many not need it now but I will be there for you if you need it and many others could benefit from it. Not to mention that this can provide so many meaningful jobs if implemented right. The economy is bouncing back, the market has trended back to almost where it was before the mess the Republicans got us in. Yes, lie to yourself and believe it saying Obama did nothing if it makes you feel better you ungrateful so and so. He saved your #$%$. Yes, we would have have like the economy to be just"roaring" back at 90 miles an hour but think of where we were in 2008 when were hurling to hell in a hand basket at warp speed.</Msg><Username>reggie.thoma</Username><Timestamp>1351535647069</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-29 14:34:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351535697050-91</Id><Topic><Title>Another Obama FLIP-FLOP .....</Title><Username>dumpobamie</Username><Timestamp>1351534531150</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-29 14:15:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Calling Flipper a lier is not name calling, its just the truth, which is something I realize you , as a RoBUTT, have no experience with</Msg><Username>carolyne47</Username><Timestamp>1351535697050</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-29 14:34:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351535701509-92</Id><Topic><Title>Russian ship with 700 tons of gold ore missing</Title><Username>mashiach</Username><Timestamp>1351535472791</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-29 14:31:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>never mind... they found it in Romneys backyard pool.</Msg><Username>invrader72</Username><Timestamp>1351535701509</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-29 14:35:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351535922143-93</Id><Topic><Title>A riminder to those impacted by Sandy</Title><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1351522350085</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-29 10:52:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Interesting that using the spin word "evolving" does not really hide the the fact that Flipper has NO lasting values</Msg><Username>carolyne47</Username><Timestamp>1351535922143</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-29 14:38:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351536154406-94</Id><Title>Romney, Federal disaster relief "immoral"</Title><Msg>I realize most believe only a nut would say this, but googling that phrase shows Romney said it.

But if Mitt Romney were president, disaster relief would be up to the states. Stands behind “disband FEMA” comment The Romney campaign said early Monday morning that Romney stood behind a statement first made during a 2011 Republican debate, in which Romney said that the Federal Emergency Management Agency should be disbanded, and its powers either privatized or given to the states. “Every time you have an occasion to take something from the federal government and send it back to the states, that’s the right direction. And if you can go even further, and send it back to the private sector, that’s even better,” said Romney in 2011. Asked by debate moderator John King if that included cutting disaster relief, Romney said, “We cannot — we cannot afford to do those things without jeopardizing the future for our kids.” Given the chance to back away from the statement, the Romney campaign instead told the Huffington Post that Romney meant what he said. “Gov. Romney wants to ensure states, who are the first responders and are in the best position to aid impacted individuals and communities, have the resources and assistance they need to cope with natural disasters,” the campaign said. Sandy Could Impact Fourteen States Romney’s paean to states’ rights ignores the very important role of FEMA in coordinating disaster relief in events that transcend state boundaries. Hurricane Sandy is expected to impact fourteen states and the District of Columbia; its impact stretches from Maine to North Carolina, and from West Virginia to Massachusetts. Furthermore, FEMA manages disasters on scales beyond the capacity of states to manage them. Hurricane Katrina did over $100 billion in damage to Louisiana in 2005. The entire annual budget for the state is about $25 billion. Simply, states that are hit by devastating natural disasters are usually in no position to manage the crisis by themselves. As for Romney’s suggestion that disaster relief could be privatized, it’s almost impossible to conceive of a way that would be possible. Disasters generally require a huge outlay of funds to help wounded communities get back on their feet. Some of that is covered by private insurance, but much of it is not — especially the immediate response to the crisis. Republicans Have Targeted Disaster Aid Before It’s not surprising that Romney has opposed federal spending on disaster aid. His running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., has proposed a budget that would require drastic cuts to federal aid programs, including FEMA. Ryan is not alone. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., initially argued that disaster aid in the wake of Hurricane Irene should be offset by spending cuts, though he was later forced to walk that back after public outrage. Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, has also called for the elimination of FEMA. The targeting of disaster aid is part and parcel of the current Republican mentality. More and more, the Republican party is pushing a worldview that says, in effect, that we’re all on our own. In times of crisis, if you can’t pull yourself up by your bootstraps then you’ll just have to stay down on the ground. FEMA has an imperfect track record, of course — its response to Hurricane Katrina was woefully inadequate. That error, though, was not one of doing too much, but doing too little. Under the Obama administration, FEMA has generally earned plaudits, especially for its response to an outbreak of tornadoes in the south and midwest. When supported adequately, FEMA has been a vital and valuable agency that has provided aid to states in the wake of disasters across the country. In many ways, Mitt Romney’s opposition to federal disaster relief programs is what the election is about. President Barack Obama supports using government to help those in a crisis get back on their feet. Mitt Romney believes that government has no role in helping people who are dealing with disaster. Those two very different views of America’s future are on the ballot next week. Note: May be it's the GOP method of fighting overpopulation.

A true believer. That is what is threatening peace in the world now. In case you're willing also to kill for your God, you're NO DIFFERENT THAN A JIHADI MOSLEM! You certainly are not practicing love when you post "Jesus a Republican Be Here Soon" (dated Dec. 19, 2011)! FANATICS miss the FACT that we ARE ALL CREATED BY THE SAME UNIVERSAL INTELLIGENCE... and EXPLOIT and ABUSE religion to divide humanity. MOST ALL ORGANIZED and MAN MADE RELIGIONS TEND TO DO THAT! That is why I reject them all... NO MATTER WHAT THEIR PROJECTED GODS TELL THEM. In this age of growing enlightenment and scientific progress you and your kind only DIVIDE what is connected by creation and is diverse using religion. ALL the things you believe in without any questioning only STOP your growth in spirit and expand to embrace the humanity. It is sad. But if you also have VIOLENCE deep in your faith... you are no different than those radicals in all other man made religions. Quoting verses from your holy book does no good for you... and issuing threats using such quotations is no sign of being 'saved'. What you BLINDLY follow in the name of GOD and RELIGION that makes you willing to resort to violence has nothing to do with faith but with INTOLERANCE and HATE... towards others' VIEWS &amp; VIEWPOINTS. These man made religions is only an INTERPRETATION made by humans! Only the weak minded follow those blindly if it is not backed with a deeper understanding of humans are all created by one CREATOR and religions only make interpretations. Nobody has a monopoly on the CREATOR because of any written books by claiming that it is holy and written by the God they project!</Msg><Username>giovannijay</Username><Timestamp>1351550074111</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-29 18:34:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351550196668-181</Id><Topic><Title>CEO to Workers: I May Fire You if Obama Wins</Title><Username>big_saciccio</Username><Timestamp>1349878510563</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 10:15:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>*****</Msg><Username>dons_st</Username><Timestamp>1351550196668</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-29 18:36:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351550506137-182</Id><Topic><Title>Democrats Attack God and Jerusalem.

The problem has been EXACERBATED by CONGRESSIONAL REPUBLICANS who have supported the needs of the rich while attacking middle-class and low-income programs. Here are some of the results of their work. 1. We are close to having the WORST WEALTH INEQUALLITY in the entire world. Out of 150 countries, we have the 5th-highest wealth disparity. We have a greater wealth gap than the countries traditionally viewed as unequal, such as those in Africa and South America. We fare a little better on income inequality, although with regard to developed (OECD) countries, we have the 7th highest income gap among 34 nations. 2. Just FIVE MEN together made MORE MONEY than the ENTIRE U.S. foreign aid budget last year. Our "winner take all" mentality allows -- indeed, encourages -- the richest Americans to take billions of dollars that could be used to support the needs of our society or the people of the world. The richest 5 Americans increased their estates by a total of $34 billion last year. Official Development Assistance (ODA) was a little over $30 billion. This amount represented just 1/5 of 1% of our GDP, the 5th lowest giving rate of 23 OECD countries. The same distorted allocation of wealth is evident within our own borders. In 2011 each ONE of the 10 richest Americans made, on average, as much as the entire budget for theNational Cancer Institute. 3. The men TAKING BILLIONS did not earn it through HARD WORK and INNOVATION. 60 percent of the income for the Forbes 400 came from capital gains. Much of the rest came from carried interest, performance-related pay, stock options, and deferred compensation. The RICH DON'T innovate. Market watch estimates that over 90% of the assets owned by millionaires are held in a combination of low-risk investments (bonds and cash), the stock market, and real estate. According to economist Richard Wolff, about half of the assets of the richest 1% are held in unincorporated business equity (personal business accounts). The Mendelsohn Affluent Survey confirmed that the very rich spend less than two percent of their money on new business startups. Other studies from the Treasury Department andAmerican Progress said the same. 4. The rich get almost as much from tax expenditures as Americans get from Social Security and Medicare. The common complaint from the wealthiest Americans is that entitlements cause the deficit. But according to the Tax Policy Center, tax deferrals and deductions and other forms of tax expenditures, which largely benefit the rich, are worth about 7.4% of the GDP, or about $1.1 trillion. In comparison, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities reports that about $1.2 trillion is spent on Social Security and Medicare. 5. After all this, the rich have multiplied their wealth -- TAX-FREE -- overseas. The Tax Justice Network estimates that up to $32 trillion is hidden offshore, with about 40% of it, or $12.8 trillion, owned by Americans. This is close to the annual U.S. GDP of $15 trillion a year. Inequality, it can reasonably be concluded, is worse than we thought. The policies of people like Milton Friedman and Ronald Reagan and George Bush made it happen. Congressional Republicans intensified it. Ralph Nader says, "Has there ever been a more crazed, cruel, anti-people, corporate-indentured, militaristic and monetized Republican Party in its 154-year history?" No, we've never seen anything like this before. AND A VOTE for R-Money WILL MAKE IT EVEN WORSE! Note: IF you're middle class or lower in income, VOTING TO GOP CANDIDATE M-MONEY is VOTING AGAINST YOUR OWN INTEREST! NEVER BE FOOLED BY LABELS AND EXPLANATIONS SPREADING FEAR ABOUT COMMUNISM OR SOCIALISM by the GOP in DOZENS OF ADS that are indeed insulting and HAS NO RELATIONSHIP OF WHAT WE HAVE AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION! JUST FOR YOUR OWN INTEREST AND OUR NATIONS BEST INTEREST IS TO VOTE FOR OBAMA! Please DO NOT LET THE POLITICAL NOISE confuse you! THIS IS TYPICAL GOP STRATEGY by throwing smoke and MAKE most voters to vote AGAINST their own interest! NEVER LET THAT HAPPEN AGAIN! THEY ARE TRICKSTERS AND LIARS!</Msg><Username>giovannijay</Username><Timestamp>1351553578619</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-29 19:32:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351553786823-194</Id><Topic><Title>FIVE FACTS About INEQUALITY for ANYONE VOTING REPUBLICAN</Title><Username>giovannijay</Username><Timestamp>1351553578619</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-29 19:32:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Inequity is killing innocent life that can't speak for itself</Msg><Username>faith_laced</Username><Timestamp>1351553786823</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-29 19:36:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351554034283-195</Id><Topic><Title>Have they loaded the telepromter for obma's concession speech?</Title><Username>zevoter22</Username><Timestamp>1351553927175</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-29 19:38:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thousands of your posts LOUDLY proclaim you are an ASH HOLE!

Saturday Night Live couldn’t have thought of anything better. When I read this headline, I had to make sure it wasn’t coming from The Onion. President Obama actually said that in his second term, there could be a “Secretary of Business.“ That's right, he knows he has a problem with American business and naturally, he thinks there is a government solution. This shows how tone-deaf he is, how ignorant he must be of how business works in America and what American businesses want from Washington. Anyway, if Obama is reelected, support for private business from the government is on the way. What could go wrong? Obama is going to use his own business savvy to redraw parts of the government organization chart to make a new Department of Business. The new department could be staffed with the community organizers, labor leaders and Occupy rejects who are currently doing field work for his campaign, along with assorted philosophy and political science majors from the president’s favorite universities, and a retired professor or two. The new Department of Business could have things like a “Bureau of Business Assistance” that reviews business plans to make sure they comply with the Obama worldview. Ha! Or maybe “The Office of Fair Hiring and Fair Pay Encouragement” will be knocking on your door. What business owner wouldn’t appreciate this ”help”? Obama’s business liaison has been viewed as a joke and as an enemy of American business. He has had to hide from the honorable private sector leaders he appointed to his defunct jobs council. His previous Commerce Secretary was sent to China and no one noticed. His current Commerce Secretary couldn’t be picked out of a lineup with the Spice Girls. Mitt Romney could have some fun with this.</Msg><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1351557008552</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-29 20:30:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351557213400-211</Id><Topic><Title>REPUCANS HATE GOVERNMENT SO MUCH YET THEY ASK GOVT TO HELP DURING HURRICANE</Title><Username>farawaylife</Username><Timestamp>1351554992558</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-29 19:56:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Daddy, Daddy, Mr. Fartaway.

The polls, taken after last week’s third Obama-Romney debate, continue to show that the contest is a virtual dead heat. The ABC News/Washington Post daily tracking poll, which saw Mitt Romney move to a 50-47 percent lead last week, on Monday showed the two candidates tied at 49 percent apiece. In eight so-called “Battleground” states, Obama was at 49 percent to 48 percent for Romney. Romney is ahead among independents. Obama leads when voters were asked which candidate will work to favor the middle class. A new Politico/George Washington University “Battleground Tracking Poll” finds Obama with 49 percent and Romney 48 percent, a three-point swing in Obama’s direction in the past week. The President leads by 53-45 percent among Americans who have already cast early ballots or voted absentee. After the so-called gender gap had narrowed to just six points, Obama was back in the lead 54-43 percent among women voters. Romney is ahead among men by a 55-43 percent margin. In assessing the slight swing in the direction of the President, the Politico/GWU poll concluded: “The President is now closer in standing to where he’s been in the past few months, and the swing is due to female support. On every issue and the question of character, women now favor Obama over Romney.” Exactly 50 percent of the thousand voters surveyed approve of the job Obama is doing as president, while 51 percent view him favorably on a personal level. The poll showed Obama most popular in urban areas, less popular in the suburbs, and unpopular and trailing Romney by a wide margin in rural areas. A third poll, from Pew Research, put the candidates even nationally at 47 percent apiece. Pew had put Romney ahead by a 49-45 percent margin earlier this month. The Pew poll noted the increase in Romney’s personal ratings after he dominated the Denver debate with Obama. In the latest poll, Obama’s personal “favorables” are at 52 percent, Romney’s at 50 percent. NOTE: I don't need polls. I know Obama will win. That's all I need to know. Lies and liars will have the biggest challenges in their lives in this information age that makes finding the facts and communications so easy and accessible. The gullible folks excepted, of course.</Msg><Username>johnmjay</Username><Timestamp>1351565407763</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-29 22:50:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351565470739-253</Id><Topic><Title>I heard that the Republicans are accusing Obama of creating hurricance Sandy</Title><Username>reggie.thoma</Username><Timestamp>1351562383491</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-29 21:59:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>My Dear Rush Limbaugh CC: John Sununu, Donald Trump, Karl Rove, Shaun Hannity, Anne Coulter and all other Obama haters to numerous to mention.
