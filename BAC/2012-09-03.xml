I just saw him on the news today at a rally, telling people: "I said we would get Bin Laden, and we did." Hello, "WE" didn't do anything. Bush started the hunt, it was the intelligence agencies with years of work preceeding Obama, and the Seals who did the job. All Obama did was what any president would have done - said go to something uncounted others prepared, planned, coordinated and executed. What is so stupid about it is that he ego so totally gets in his way, he does not realize that he would sound much more presidential if he minimized his role and talked up what the others did.

The 2008 financial meltdown is a direct result of the Republican Wall St. de-regulation propaganda pushed through the Congress during the Clinton administration and the constant erosion of even, modest fiscal oversight throughout the Bush administration. The Banksters finally blew up the world and left the current mess! Now all the FED can do is QE which drives down the value of the dollar and increases commodity prices. Look at the price of oil? It is not costing you $3.85 a gallon because there is not enough oil in the world, or refining capacity. It is costing you $3.85 a gallon because oil is denominated in dollars and as the dollar value cheapens, the oil producers just keep getting more dollars per barrel. Supply and demand is right out the window! Romney, Obama have no answers but not understanding the root of the problem is the problem. Go ahead and elect Romney and see if anything changes other than he will let his croonies loose on Wall St.! Face facts, consumer debt fueled the profits of the 1% the last 30 years and believe me, there is no appetite for more debt out here on the fruited plain!

But Grogan said that it was fairly common for lawyers who didn’t intend to continue practicing law to go on inactive status. It was actually one of the reasons, he said, that the rule was changed so that lawyers wanting to switch to inactive status no longer had to petition the Illinois Supreme Court to do so. In 2011, more than 12 percent of the state’s 87,943 registered attorneys were on inactive status (see Chart 2), according to the ARDC’s annual report for that year. In addition, prior to June 5, 2012, the Obamas would have been required to pay an annual fee of $289 (now $342), and take classes to satisfy the state’s Minimum Continuing Legal Education requirement, in order to keep their licenses active. Lawyers on retirement status, however, don’t have to pay an annual fee or take classes. And lawyers on inactive status also don’t have to take classes, but they do have to pay an annual fee of $105."</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1346684319804</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 10:58:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346684355257-47</Id><Title>Romney Wears that Funny LDS Underwear: Temple Garments.</Title><Msg>He thinks Halloween is everyday of the year.</Msg><Username>nameno203</Username><Timestamp>1346684355257</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 10:59:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346684535084-48</Id><Title>Romney Believes in Fairy Tales: The Book of Mormon</Title><Msg>We do not need a president who believes in fairy tales.</Msg><Username>nameno203</Username><Timestamp>1346684535084</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 11:02:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346684606156-49</Id><Topic><Title>Obamacrats planning to pack the house for Obama .....</Title><Username>dumpobamie</Username><Timestamp>1346684236376</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 10:57:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And then they will go out and vote for him and launch voter registration drives.

"There has been no shortage of oil in the market. Producers have been able to meet consumer needs," Abdullah al-Badri told an energy conference. "We also see this as being the case for the rest of 2012 and the foreseeable future." Oil prices surged in March to $128 a barrel, the highest level since 2008, because of concern about possible supply shortages. Prices have since fallen back and brent crude was trading around $118 on Thursday. "Today the price continues to be driven by excessive speculation," Badri said. OPEC at a meeting in December set a target to produce 30 million barrels per day, settling an argument which broke out in 2011 after Iran and other members opposed a Saudi-led plan to raise OPEC's production ceiling. Output has remained above the target all year as Libyan supply recovered after being virtually shut down during the 2011 uprising against Muammar Gaddafi's rule. The extra oil is filling gaps caused by an unusually large number of supply outages globally, which have also helped support prices. Supply breaks were running at nearly 1.3 million bpd as of early April. The additional supply has also offset a decline in exports from Iran, which is facing stiffening western sanctions over its disputed nuclear energy program. Iranian oil exports were running at between 200,000 and 300,000 barrels per day below last year's level, Maria van der Hoeven, head of the International Energy Agency, told Thursday's conference. Iranian officials have said the country exported an average of 2.2 million barrels a day last year. July supply from the 12-member Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ran at 31.75 million barrels per day (bpd), the high est since September 2008, which was shortly before it agreed to a series of supply curbs to combat recession and collapsing demand, based on Reuters surveys</Msg><Username>fairvalue23</Username><Timestamp>1346684915231</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 11:08:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346684943602-58</Id><Title>I JUST DON'T SEE HOW ROMNEY CAN WIN</Title><Msg>1/3 of all the households in America are receiving some kind of subsidies from the U.S. Government.

The average price for gasoline in the U.S.A would drop to $2.80 per gallon. Naimi Says Brent Oil Should Drop to $80.00 as Supply Tops Demand By Ben Sharples - June 03, 2012 Crude prices should fall because global supply is outweighing demand, according to Saudi Arabia’s oil minister, Ali al-Naimi. “We want a lower price than where it is now,” al-Naimi said in Adelaide today. “We need to get the price to a level of around $80” a barrel for London’s Brent crude, he said. Saudi Arabia is the world’s biggest oil exporter. Brent, a benchmark price for more than half the world’s crude, has dropped 6 percent this month amid concern Europe’s debt crisis will worsen and curb fuel demand. OPEC is working to bring prices down, the group’s Secretary-General, Abdalla el- Badri, said May 3. The producer group, scheduled to meet next month, is pumping 8.3 percent more crude than it considers necessary this quarter, figures from the Vienna-based group show. Brent crude for June settlement dropped 0.8 percent in the week to May 11 to $112.26 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. West Texas Intermediate oil for June delivery slid 2.4 percent to $96.13 a barrel. At $100 a barrel for London’s Brent crude, that equates to around $80.00 a barrel for West Texas Intermediate oil. The average price for gasoline in the U.S.A would drop to $2.80 per gallon. Oil supply outweighs demand by 1.3 million to 1.5 million barrels a day, al-Naimi said today. Saudi Arabia increased output last month to the highest in more than three decades, according to data it provided to OPEC.</Msg><Username>fairvalue23</Username><Timestamp>1346685062625</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 11:11:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346685088882-64</Id><Topic><Title>Obamacrats planning to pack the house for Obama .....</Title><Username>dumpobamie</Username><Timestamp>1346684236376</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 10:57:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Finally, a national Republican Party office holder, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), is stating the obvious about race and politics in the U.S.: “The demographics race we’re losing badly. We’re not generating enough angry white guys to stay in business for the long term.” Although there is recognition of an obvious truth here, for Graham, the “solution” to this “problem” is a matter of numbers – demographics – of “generating enough” white people to match, if not counter altogether, the surging black and brown masses set to minoritize “white America” within less than a generation. Graham also recognizes that not just freshly generated, ordinary white folks will do the trick, though. These newly generated white folks must be of a very specific type: “angry white guys,” who will have been properly socialized to strengthen and extend their four-century vice grip on power and all the other desirable aspects of life that come along with being power holders. Implicit in Graham’s statement is also the recognition that the old, tried and true means of race-baiting, of frightening white people to the polls in support of Republican Party agendas, are about to become passe´. For example, look at the recent Republican television ad against President Obama’s supposed position on welfare: “Under Obama’s plan, you wouldn’t have to work and wouldn’t have to train for a job. They just send you your welfare check and ‘welfare to work’ goes back to being plain old welfare.” Of course, this ad is an out-and-out lie. It is reminiscent of President George H.W. Bush’s “Willie Horton” (black criminals raping/murdering white women) ad, of the late Senator Jesse Helms’ “white hands” ad crumpling up a pink slip because an affirmative action beneficiary (black male) just took their job; of Reagan’s Cadillac-driving “welfare queen,” of Nixon’s “Southern Strategy” and constant call and drumbeat for “law and order.” Likewise, though false on its face, the Romney/Republican ad against welfare will enthuse, stimulate, generate some “angry white guys.” The refreshing thing about Graham’s statement is that he realizes that such tactics will not generate enough “angry white guys” to continue to make a difference in election outcomes. Graham can count. Plain, old and simple third grade arithmetic will no longer allow Republican Party, heterosexual white men (angry or not) to continue to lord it over everybody else. This November may be the very last election wherein these folks can eke out, by hook or by crook, if necessary, a final last hurrah for their kind of “leadership.”</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1346685088882</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 11:11:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346685104970-65</Id><Title>Sanford Bernstein Oil Value should be $60.00 to $50.00 a barrel</Title><Msg>Sanford Bernstein Oil Value should be $60.00 to $50.00 a barrel Based on Sanford C.

Every one gets taken care of from womb to tomb. Meanwhile the country has $16 trillion debt, which equates to $50,000 for every man, woman, child, and baby in America, and he's increasing it by another $1.2 trillion per year.

From CP Entertainment: "During a recent conservative radio talk show that he participated in, Molen said a caller went on a long rant in which he said that the movie was primarily all about "trashing Obama." After letting the caller go on for a while, Molen interjected to ask if he had seen the film, to which the caller said, "No." "It's that kind of thing – that people are judging without having any substance to their argument – that's occurring regularly," Molen told CP. (hmmm, sounds a lot like the liar lib postings on this board) "It seems the left in America can only define something they don't understand, something that frightens them, something so truthful it hurts or something they have no real response to that leaves them grasping for any kind of answer that comes with the hope that maybe it will just go away … and if it doesn't, do all possible to destroy it."

The San Antonio, Texas-based company suspended refining operations in March at the Aruba refinery, which processed heavy, sour crude and once had a capacity of about 275,000 barrels a day. It said it stopped producing gasoline and other fuels at the site due to high oil prices and "unfavorable refinery economics." But on Monday, Valero announced that it had decided to reorganize the unprofitable site into a storage terminal on the Dutch Caribbean island of just over 100,000 inhabitants. For years, Valero has been trying unsuccessfully to sell the Aruba refinery, which the company says is still ready to re-start if a buyer can be found.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1346695601432</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 14:06:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346696202972-108</Id><Topic><Title>By the time Bush Republicans were done, the economy was losing 600,000 jobs per month</Title><Username>dexter.galileo</Username><Timestamp>1346687058064</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 11:44:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Didn't Bush try to implement regulations with Fannie/Freddie and the Dems did it their way resulting in the most foreclosures in US history causing a domino effect that included many homeowners who got traditional loans and then lost half their equity?

It boasts a tangible book value/share of $14.18, and microscopic price/book (0.6) and price per sales (0.8) as well as astounding Cash per Share of $11.48! The problem with Bank of America is twofold: 1. Investor distrust of BAC's asset valuations as a carryover of the mortgage meltdown, and 2. Worries over legal liabilities from the mortgage meltdown, worry over the robo-doc-signing issue and especially over Bank of America's dealings with AIG Insurance (AIG) and Countrywide Mortgage. The first point is that after three years of write downs, most, if not all of the toxic debt has been written off at Bank of America. Loan loss provisions fell from over $12 billion to just over $10 billion, a clear sign that the asset base at Bank of America is quickly stabilizing. Even more importantly the company reached an agreement in March 2012 to write down the mortgages of over 200,000 home owners which should end most negative problems of Bank of America's direct exposure and for at least this analysis the first worry over asset valuations seems to be baseless. The kicker is the legal liabilities over AIG and Countrywide Mortgage. Bank of America has salted away over $12 billion in reserves to handle any problems, but stated in their most recent quarterly report that worst case scenarios could mean the total hit could reach $4 billion more. Commentators have generally agreed that the future depends on Bank of America's attempt to throw out the legal suits involved with AIG. If the liabilities there are lowered or even thrown out, Bank of America will be in great shape to break out. With the stock price below both the book value and the cash value, Bank of America has very little downside but a huge upside.</Msg><Username>valueplay_2000</Username><Timestamp>1346697184630</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 14:33:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346697998185-115</Id><Title>zevoter22 posted: "Chris mathews needs to find a job he can do."</Title><Msg>heh heh heh ...I'm not sure what kind of job is available out there.......For sure FOX will not take him</Msg><Username>urichey</Username><Timestamp>1346697998185</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 14:46:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346698346554-116</Id><Topic><Title>zevoter22 posted: "Chris mathews needs to find a job he can do."</Title><Username>urichey</Username><Timestamp>1346697998185</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 14:46:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>As what Clint Eastwood said....someone has to know his limitation</Msg><Username>urichey</Username><Timestamp>1346698346554</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 14:52:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346698783655-117</Id><Topic><Title>zevoter22 posted: "Chris mathews needs to find a job he can do."</Title><Username>urichey</Username><Timestamp>1346697998185</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 14:46:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>My SHELTIE is better....he knows the word NO and knows the word overspending.</Msg><Username>urichey</Username><Timestamp>1346698783655</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 14:59:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346699121220-118</Id><Title>REPUCANS REMINDS ME OF A GUY THAT BURNT DOWN YOUR HOUSE DURING WINTER</Title><Msg>then offered you a place in the garage for the night because he felt sorry for you.

The Republican party was formed because a group of politicians didn't think it was ever appropriate for states or territories to vote for slavery. The Republican party was formed based upon the belief that slavery was wrong under ALL circumstances, and Abraham Lincoln was the first Republican president. Bet many of you didn't know that. The Democratic party has always been the party where racism resides. They owned most of the slaves, their governors were the ones that enforced segregation and fought against equal rights, most of the KKK were members of the Democratic party, less Democratic members voted for the civil rights legislation of the early 1960's than Republicans (e.g. Al Gore's daddy voted against the legislation), Democrats believe affirmative action is necessary because unlike every other nationality or race they don't believe blacks are smart enough to make it on their own without special help (Republicans strongly disagree and believe all men and women are created equal regardless of nationality/race/gender/etc), and Democrats vehemently fight against school vouchers which would give inner city kids who have no access to quality education a chance to get out of the ghetto (Democrats want to keep them trapped in poor schools and uneducated so that they'll need to be dependent upon gov't and Democrats for welfare and they can get the corrupt NEA union dues for their political war chest). The Democrats bought them on the block 200 years ago, and continue to buy them today with affirmative action and welfare which is a complete disgrace and insulting. How else do you explain that over 95% vote for Democratic party other than affirmative action and welfare? Unemployment and poverty is much higher under Obama, yet they continue to overwhelmingly support him. Is it because food stamps have increased from 33 million when Obama took office to 48 millions today, and Obama has make it much easier to get them as well as disability benefits? Hmmmmm?

It will be tough for a man with an estimated $250 million net worth to relate to the American public who are still rebounding from the economic crisis that began under the leadership of George W. Bush. But the problem with Mitt Romney isn’t that he is incredibly rich. It’s that if he becomes President, his policies would mostly benefit the wealthy — a sentiment 71% of Americans feel. And it’s not too hard to see why. If you look at Mitt Romney’s platform, it looks like it was bought and paid for by the richest 1%. And that is largely in part because IT IS! Mitt Romney supports repealing Wall Street reform, so bankers who tanked our economy can run free with abandon. He supports keeping massive tax breaks for big oil and allowing oil companies to drill on our beautiful natural parks but he opposes wind tax credits that will help bring our economy into the future. His plan to help college students is to tell them to borrow money from their parents4 and his plan to struggling homeowners is to let the foreclosure process run it's course and hit the bottom. Social Security? He’ll privatize it. And Medicare? He’ll end it as we know it. But the Bush tax cuts for the ultra-rich? You bet he’s still keeping them in place!!</Msg><Username>johnmjay</Username><Timestamp>1346714420587</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 19:20:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346714666387-159</Id><Topic><Title>Let's Clean Up Our Message Board!</Title><Username>take_out_the_white_trash</Username><Timestamp>1346674387594</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 08:13:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What's a neegar?

Hardly any one I talk knows that their share of the national debt is $50,000 and that Obama is adding $4,000 each year to every citizen with no end in sight. Hardly any one I talk to knows that food stamp usage has increased from 33 million to 48 million since Obama was elected, largely because Obama administration loosened requirements and began to aggressively advertise and recruit new welfare recipients. Hardly any Americans know that Great Society programs have been a complete waste of money and poverty levels are same now as in 1960's when LBJ signed them. Hardly any one knows that Social Security was promised never to exceed 2% of wages when passed back in the 1930's, and now is around 14% when you count employers contribution in addition to employee. No one knows that when Carter created Dept of Education that we've spent billions of dollars on education, but test grades remain the same or slightly worse than they were before the cabinet position was created. Same with Dept of Agriculture and Commerce. All have been a complete failure and waste of money, but we keep spending and our media never covers these stories.

The GOP has the same mindset as in the 50's and apparently they live from election to election using distortions, lies, and depending on the short political memory of the voter. However, the independents are growing fast thanks to the Tea Party (GOP) obstructionism in trying to knock down the economy as their strategy to make Obama a one-term president. I think this time they will fail as their hatred of Obama and obstructionism was too apparent over a 4 year period. That can't be easily forgotten. If I was betting on the outcome of this election, I would not bet on Romney to win. Furthermore, they can only get at most 40% women's vote. Obama will not get as high a vote as he got those under 30 of age... Last time he got almost 90%. Pew research said it dropped to 65% Obama will get 65%-70% of independents. He has my vote already. God save the GOP from itself- its fanaticism, its regressive ideology, and its intent to cut taxes to the 15 wealthiest 1% minority! That alone can cost them the election! No such millionaire has won the presidency before. The last person who tried and lost was N. Rockefeller! So will be Mitt Romney. God bless his soul!</Msg><Username>johnmjay</Username><Timestamp>1346722228463</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 21:30:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346722482839-196</Id><Topic><Title>GOP versus Dem - Long Term Capital Gains</Title><Username>greekmonster101</Username><Timestamp>1346696777448</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 14:26:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>.</Msg><Username>spock_has_spoke</Username><Timestamp>1346722482839</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 21:34:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346723405569-197</Id><Topic><Title>Why Obama running away from hope &amp; change ?</Title><Username>kingofvietnam</Username><Timestamp>1346719431460</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 20:43:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>CLOS INOUGH!

Pastor who endorsed Perry on Friday says Romney is a cultist By Chris Moody | Dr. Robert Jeffress, the influential pastor of a Dallas-based megachurch, offered his formal endorsement of Texas Gov. Rick Perry Friday at the Values Voter Summit in Washington, D.C. Friday, shortly before he explained why Perry's opponent atop the GOP field, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, is a cultist. Jeffress introduced Perry before he addressed the annual gathering for social conservatives, making a special point to emphasize Perry's Christian faith--as opposed to Romney's, who a Mormon, which Jeffress said was a "cult." "We understand Mormonism is not Christianity and thus the difference between somebody who's moral and good like Mitt Romney and a true born-again follower of Christ," Jeffress said after Perry's speech, adding that Perry had welcomed his endorsement. "I really think the decision for conservative evangelical Christians right now is going to be, do we prefer somebody who is truly a believer in Jesus Christ, or somebody who is a good moral person but he's a part of a cult." "It's not politically correct to say, but it's true. Mormonism is a cult. And for those reasons, besides Governor Romney's lack of consistency on social issues, I think Rick Perry is the most electable choice among Christian conservatives," he went on. Jeffress' views, however, do not reflect Perry's, his campaign spokesman told The Ticket. "The governor does not believe Mormonism is a cult," Perry Communication Director Mark Miner said in an email. Labeling Mormonism as a cult does not put Jeffress outside of the Southern Baptist mainstream. The denomination officially recognizes Romney's church as a cult, and has done so for years. Jeffress's views also should not come as a surprise to Perry's camp, since the preacher has publicly called Mormonism a cult in the past. "The Southern Baptist Convention has officially labeled Mormonism as a cult, so this is not some right-wing extremist view. It's a view of the largest Protestant denomination in the world," he said. "I think there are a lot of people who will not publicly say that's an issue because they don't want to appear to be bigoted, but for a lot of evangelical Christians, that is a huge issue, even if it's unspoken.</Msg><Username>jbhdallas2000</Username><Timestamp>1346727854480</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 23:04:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346727863593-227</Id><Topic><Title>MITT ROMNEY IS MORMON... vs. OBAMA IS CHRISTIAN</Title><Username>jbhdallas2000</Username><Timestamp>1346211738375</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 23:42:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Pastor who endorsed Perry on Friday says Romney is a cultist By Chris Moody | Dr. Robert Jeffress, the influential pastor of a Dallas-based megachurch, offered his formal endorsement of Texas Gov.

"I really think the decision for conservative evangelical Christians right now is going to be, do we prefer somebody who is truly a believer in Jesus Christ, or somebody who is a good moral person but he's a part of a cult." "It's not politically correct to say, but it's true. Mormonism is a cult. And for those reasons, besides Governor Romney's lack of consistency on social issues, I think Rick Perry is the most electable choice among Christian conservatives," he went on. Jeffress' views, however, do not reflect Perry's, his campaign spokesman told The Ticket. "The governor does not believe Mormonism is a cult," Perry Communication Director Mark Miner said in an email. Labeling Mormonism as a cult does not put Jeffress outside of the Southern Baptist mainstream. The denomination officially recognizes Romney's church as a cult, and has done so for years. Jeffress's views also should not come as a surprise to Perry's camp, since the preacher has publicly called Mormonism a cult in the past. "The Southern Baptist Convention has officially labeled Mormonism as a cult, so this is not some right-wing extremist view. It's a view of the largest Protestant denomination in the world," he said. "I think there are a lot of people who will not publicly say that's an issue because they don't want to appear to be bigoted, but for a lot of evangelical Christians, that is a huge issue, even if it's unspoken.</Msg><Username>jbhdallas2000</Username><Timestamp>1346727863593</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 23:04:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346727904207-228</Id><Topic><Title>"deafeatsocialism" keeps asking, 'Why is Yahoo censoring me?'
