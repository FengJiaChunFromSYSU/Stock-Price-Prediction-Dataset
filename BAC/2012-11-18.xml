The rest of their industry will follow too. Even Twinkies letting go of 18k due too excessive union demands. You can't actually have companies make a profit under socialist Obama. To top it off hundreds of thousands are now losing their jobs due to Obama's socialist policies. Now the young you voted for Obama get nice welfare benefits after graduating from college because there is no way they will find a job under Obama's socialism. Yes they moved Forward alright right into the front of the unemployment line. Lost? I think the Republicans won. Obama is a failure.

Americans are weary of Afghanistan, they have in mind the exit in 2014. Such being the case, the ultimate sacrifices of five in the USA military—two from Calif, one Oregon and nearby Washington, the other North Carolina, ages 20s and one past 35—were mentioned but not stressed. Earlier, queries about Benghazi and Petraeus. The general’s “mistake” was a personal one, not impeding USA security. The talking points given the UN ambassador were, well, “given’ to be used, not scrutinized by the ambassador. Context from Sen Levin of Mich, and GOP’s questioning King of N Y S. Discussion of “fiscal cliff” past speaker of House Nancy Pelosi responses. Matter more serious than 18 months ago, if president says the affluent should pay a ”fair share” higher tax rate, well such is his party’s position. Roundtable, Dem House leadership Xavier Becarra stated “peace process” Israel’s best defense. Past speaker Newton Gingrich considers Petraeus to have been in a difficult position and the head of the CIA must show good judgment. Re fiscal cliff Becarra stresses “all” is on the table. Gingrich fears tax increases will be voted, but spending cuts delayed and finessed—baad development, of course. He called the Mitt Romney quote to GOP governors about Democratic “gifts” winning the election unwise (OK paraphrase). Sponsors, mostly the same, the two BP ones repeat of the same ad, two different IBM ones, ditto the Dell ads. Yes natural gas pressure group, and somewhat analogous one from Chevron.

Under Ryan's budget, non-defense discretionary spending, which includes State Department funding, would be slashed nearly 20 percent in 2014, which would translate to more than $400 million in additional cuts to embassy security. For fiscal 2013, the GOP-controlled House proposed spending $1.934 billion for the State Department's worldwide security protection program -- well below the $2.15  billion requested by the Obama administration. House Republicans cut the administration's request for embassy security funding by $128 million in fiscal 2011 and $331 million in fiscal 2012. (Negotiations with the Democrat-controlled Senate restored about $88 million of the administration's request.) Last year, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton warned that Republicans' proposed cuts to her department would be "detrimental to America's national security" -- a charge Republicans rejected.</Msg><Username>mixtli_speaks</Username><Timestamp>1353272232211</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-18 15:57:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353272417967-73</Id><Topic><Title>impossible to deal with brain dead democraps</Title><Username>zevoter22</Username><Timestamp>1353264116273</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-18 13:41:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Democrats were the winners....the nut cases, like you, LOST AGAIN ........

Next year, 30 states will be run by Republicans — the highest number for either party in more than a decade. Those 30 chief executives include Jindal and Christie, who are already getting major 2016 buzz, and also New Mexico’s Susana Martinez, the first Hispanic woman elected governor from either party, and Nevada’s Brian Sandoval, a Hispanic former federal judge. Both are likely to play leading roles in the party’s attempts to court Latino voters. And then there are the other 26 governors who all will have real opportunities to rebrand the Republican Party based on how they choose to govern between now and 2016. (Keep an eye on Indiana’s Mike Pence, who has designs on a national candidacy down the line.) Remember that when the Democratic Party found itself in the political wilderness after the 1988 election, it turned to its governors — including the boy wonder from Arkansas — for ideas on how to remake itself. And we know how that turned out.</Msg><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1353287830492</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-18 20:17:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353287945327-125</Id><Topic><Title>Anyone remember Red Dawn the original?</Title><Username>ekonprophet</Username><Timestamp>1353273601944</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-18 16:20:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Jill Kelly hasn't made a mortgage payment to Bank of America since 2009...she has stiffed BAC for over $300k...lol.</Msg><Username>vieweroutrage</Username><Timestamp>1353287945327</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-18 20:19:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353288631370-126</Id><Topic><Title>Republican Senators/Congressmen are going to spend the next 4 years talking about Benghazi</Title><Username>reggie.thoma</Username><Timestamp>1353282546476</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-18 18:49:06 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Talk about stupid your a right wing parrot, but since your to young to remember those lines you have time to change .</Msg><Username>sirifuture</Username><Timestamp>1353288631370</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-18 20:30:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353288754968-127</Id><Topic><Title>Mitt Speaks out</Title><Username>carolyne47</Username><Timestamp>1353272141511</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-18 15:55:41 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Mitt who?</Msg><Username>jefatkinson</Username><Timestamp>1353288754968</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-18 20:32:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353289452855-128</Id><Title>Middle East about to explode &amp; DOW futures way up!</Title><Msg>I just saw the DOW futures up as much as +40.
