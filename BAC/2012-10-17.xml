Explore his record as Governor. Don't just accept what he says about it. He isn't going to solve problems by cracking down on China without causing a trade war to someone we owe a trillion dollars to. His promise to create 12 million jobs in 4 years has already been shown to be a pipe dream. His education plan is the same as Obama offers except he is going to do it without funding. His energy plan is a continuation of what Obama is already doing only without concern for the environment. His tax plan has been debunked by every agency who has examined it. Obama has put the nation on the road to recovery and deserves 4 more years to finish what he started. Romney just wants to get in position where he can take credit for the results of what Obama has already got underway.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1350448648264</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 00:37:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350448665993-15</Id><Title>yep. the shoe shine m/\\onkey boy is done for. the fat lady has sung.</Title><Msg>.....................</Msg><Username>big_triceratops</Username><Timestamp>1350448665993</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 00:37:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350448698049-16</Id><Topic><Title>Mitt busted 4 trying 2 score points off Steven's killing--just like the bagger trolls here try to do!</Title><Username>frankmangus</Username><Timestamp>1350445091893</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 23:38:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Romney's shameless attempt to spin Obama's Rose Garden speech about the four killed Americans into something it was not during the debate is worse than when he tried to score points on it when the tragic event happened.

"In an op-ed written for the New York Times, Romney argued that the auto companies should undergo a managed bankruptcy process, cutting dead weight to emerge leaner and more competitive going forward. However, he also argued that the government should not loan money to the beleaguered companies, saying that private money should be provided to help them stay afloat during restructuring. He even argued that a federal auto bailout would ultimately kill the companies by forestalling the hard decisions necessary to save the industry, saying that if the government loaned money to the big three, we could "kiss the American automotive industry goodbye." However, the opposite may be true: if the government did not loan money to the auto companies, they may not still exist in their current form. As has been documented by many analysts, at the time of the auto bailout, there were no private financiers willing to step in and loan money to the auto companies -- it simply was not a safe investment for banks and other lenders who were still struggling through a credit crunch. The government, recognizing itself as the lender of last resort, stepped in to prop up the companies while they regrouped. Without the infusion of government cash, a "managed bankruptcy" may have more closely resembled a liquidation process in which each company was broken into constituent pieces and sold to the highest bidder, effectively killing the American auto industry as we recognize it today." So when President Obama claimed that Romney would have forced them into bankruptcy "without providing them any way to stay open," he was correct - and Romney's own words prove as much.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1350451983158</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 01:33:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350452012046-52</Id><Topic><Title>Obama's reference to Mitt's 47% brought the curtain down on the debate, AND on Romney.</Title><Username>pres0bamax2</Username><Timestamp>1350451659723</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 01:27:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That was also good because it blended right into R-Money's talk and I was glad Obama made that point very clear in a measured and clear tone.

As previously reported, the third quarter of 2012 was negatively impacted by $1.9 billion of debit valuation adjustments (DVA) and fair value option (FVO) adjustments related to the improvement in the company's credit spreads, $1.6 billion for total litigation expense, including a charge for the previously announced settlement of the Merrill Lynch class action litigation, and a charge of $0.8 billion related to the repricing of certain deferred tax assets due to a reduction in the U.K. corporate tax rate. Together, these three items totaled a negative $0.28 per share. The year-ago quarter included $6.2 billion in positive DVA and FVO adjustments, $0.6 billion in total litigation expense and $0.8 billion related to the repricing of certain deferred tax assets due to a reduction in the U.K. corporate tax rate. Together, these three items totaled a positive $0.27 per share in the third quarter of 2011. In addition, the year-ago quarter included, among other significant items, a $3.6 billion pretax gain on the sale of a portion of the company's investment in China Construction Bank (CCB), partially offset by $2.2 billion of net losses related to equity and strategic investments other than CCB. Relative to the year-ago quarter, the results for the third quarter of 2012 were driven by improved credit quality across most major portfolios, increased sales and trading revenue (excluding impact of DVA), higher mortgage banking income and increased investment banking income. "We are doing more business with our customers and clients: Deposits are up; mortgage originations are up; we surpassed 11 million in mobile customers; small business lending is up 27 percent year over year; loans to our commercial clients rose for the seventh consecutive quarter; and our corporate clients made us the second-ranked global investment banking firm," said Brian Moynihan, chief executive officer. "Our strategy is taking hold even as we work through a challenging economy and continue to clean up legacy issues." "Our focus on strengthening the balance sheet continued this quarter," said Chief Financial Officer Bruce Thompson. "We ended the quarter with record Tier 1 common capital ratio of 11.41 percent and an estimated Basel 3 Tier 1 common capital ratio of 8.97 percent, up from 7.95 percent as of the second quarter of 20121. With these gains, we have turned our attention to driving core earnings."

The time has come to stop Gang Obama and their looting and ransacking. 16Trillion$$$plus debt. Trillion$$$plus deficits to the horizon and beyond. QE3...$40 Billion per month to infinity. Over 100 million on some kind of welfare scheme. Record numbers on food stamps. Record numbers on the poverty roll. Record numbers not looking for work. Record numbers receiving disability assistance. Obama unemployment rate above 8% longer than any other President since 1948 (adjusted down below 8% the other day since there are now even fewer looking for work). And, Barry's "Kill your Health" scheme has already started with its looting and controlling and its meddling, tinkering, intruding and interfering in every aspect of our lives, our children, our families, our schools, our churches, our doctors, our hospitals, our faith, our farms, our energy sources, our communities, our private property, our health-care and our businesses. Debbie Wasserman Schultz said that they, the Democrats/Progs, own it. Yes indeed, they own it! Proof positive that Democrats should never be in charge of anything! November 6, 2012.

Obama believes that. Communists believe big businesses should be owned by the State. Obama believes that. Communists believe any businesses that escape outright State ownership should – in a mendacious proxy for ownership – be regulated down to the tiniest light bulb. Obama believes that. Like Muslims, communists believe women should be the common property of men. The only man to whom Barack Hussein (two Muslim names) bows is the king of fanatically Wahhabist Saudi Arabia, where women are treated as mere chattels. Unlike Muslims, communists believe human life is so unimportant that little children in the womb can be tortured, torn limb from limb and killed, without even an anesthetic. Barack Herod Obama believes that. Communists believe Western democracies should have ever-weaker defenses. America is going down. The central failure of the Republicans – some of whom understand the size of the debt problem – is that they have not found the courage to confront it and squarely to admit that those who pay taxes will have to pay more and those who get sweeties will have to get less, that the budget must be balanced immediately, all debt to China and other alien regimes repaid, your nation’s sovereignty restored, and national bankruptcy and collapse pre-empted. The USA's #1 Community Agitator/Occupier has no business being POTUS. November 6, 2012. the American people need to serve The WH Occupier with an eviction notice to vacate the premises. And, they need to FIRE every Democrat across the USA; stop empowering traitors; get it done!</Msg><Username>dons_st</Username><Timestamp>1350481123535</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 09:38:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350481138832-195</Id><Topic><Title>I don't understand.

Even granting that a deliberate attempt to mislead the public with the anti-film protest story actually occurred, it's still quite a leap to presuming motive. Kiddies, this is the world of diplomacy and international relations, where the only version of a story that you can be SURE is false is the official one. For example, pointing at the wrong suspect might very well have served the intelligence community's effort to track and eliminate the real perpetrators. In fact, there have been reports that soon after the incident, the CIA captured conversations in which the attackers boasted to their foreign handlers of their success. ROTFLMAO the neocon mindset demands that a satisfying conclusion be drawn first and fast, and then a case, preferably one unencumbered by facts, be constructed post hoc to support the conclusion, .</Msg><Username>fish2kill</Username><Timestamp>1350502283396</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 15:31:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350502398595-416</Id><Topic><Title>BAC back to $20 by next year?

Check out the fortress balance sheet on that bank. BofA is now the best-capitalized bank with Tier 1 Capital Ratio of 8.97%--better than all of its big bank rivals. Surprised? Many are. Not long ago BofA had the worst capital levels among its big bank peers but today the bank reported a Basel III Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.97%–beating JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup. With an estimated Basel III capital ratio approaching 9% BofA bests JPM’s Basel III ratio of 8.4%.

The net income numbers were horrible. Bank of America lacks the ability to adjust operating expenses to meet operating income. The decline in operating income isn't a one quarter event, it is a trend. The operating segment financial performance on a revenue basis isn't good. The short-term valuation may be a bit extended. While the economic data is improving, Bank of America's operations aren't. I maintain a neutral rating for investors.

Thus, the nation is expected to become party to endorsing the Chinese currency, the renminbi, as the currency of trade in emerging markets. This means getting a renminbi-denominated bank account, in addition to a dollar account, could be an advantage for African businesses that seek to do business in the emerging markets. The move is set to challenge the supremacy of the US dollar. This, experts say, is the latest salvo in the greatest worldwide currency war since the 1930s. In the 30s, several nations competitively devalued their currencies to give their domestic economies an advantage over others. And this led to a worldwide decline in overall trade volumes at the time. The north will be pitted against the entire south in a historic competitive currency battle – whose terrain has moved to the Indian capital New Dehli – where the Brics (Brazil, Russia, India China and South Africa) nations will assemble next week. China seeks to find new markets for its currency and to lobby to internationalise it throughout the Brics states. For China this is not a new game. In 2009, senior Chinese banking officials issued a statement that the international monetary system was flawed owing to an unhealthy dependence on the US dollar and called for a “super-sovereign” international reserve currency. Experts say Beijing’s first step is to internationalise its currency (by expanding its reach beyond China), liberalise it (to allow its value to be determined by the market instead of actively managing it as they currently do) and then make it a reserve currency for many nations in the developing world. Africa’s largest bank, Standard Bank, says in a research document: “We expect at least $100 billion (about R768 billion) in Sino-African trade – more than the total bilateral trade between China and Africa in 2010 – to be settled in the renminbi by 2015.” The bank anticipates that the use of the renminbi will lower transaction costs in Africa, thus lowering the barriers to doing business. It also says that the Chinese will be more successful in transacting in renminbi in Africa than anywhere else because most currencies are weak and somewhat localised. Not only will the US dollar be challenged, but also the entire international financial regime – led by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund – which has been dominant since the end of World War II. South Africa’s place in the emerging international financial regime is set to be enhanced. Zou Lixing, vice-president of the Institute of Research of the China Development Bank, told the Brics preparatory meeting recently that “although the economic aggregate of South Africa is small relative to the Brics, South Africa provides a gate for the Brics to get access to the huge African market”. The five-member nations have collectively called for an end to the tacit agreement between the US and Europe that ensures that the head of the World Bank is an American citizen, and the International Monetary Fund head is European. They have proposed that an emerging market candidate be fielded when the term of the current World Bank head, Robert Zoellick, expires in three months. Fundacao Vargas, a member of the Brazilian delegation, said Brics could confront “existing governance structures”, and seek to strengthen the blocs’ influence in established institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, while creating alternatives. The demand for greater political say in international affairs dovetails with China’s expected rise as a financial superpower in the next eight years. Vargas showed the preparatory meeting projections indicating that China’s economy will have eclipsed that of the US by 2020, hence the promotion of the renminbi as the preferred currency of the south. The renminbi has traditionally traded at a deliberately lower exchange rate, which gave a huge boost to China’s domestic economic sectors and enabled its booming industrialisation and growth. The US and other trading partners have long accused China of being a “currency manipulator”. Last week, Brazil declared its commitment to keep its own currency – the real – low. Its finance minister, Guido Mantega, reiterated his November 2010 declaration that a global currency war has broken out. He said: “We do not want to lose our manufacturing sector. We will not sit back and watch while other countries devalue their currencies.” Brazil and China cried foul last year when, through a slew of initiatives dubbed QE2 – Quantitative Easing Two – the US indirectly devalued its currency by pumping about $600 billion into its economy to protect the economy from sliding back into recession. South African economists were in two minds about the moves to extend the influence of the renminbi. Economist and academic Peter Draper told City Press recently that the decision to establish a Brics development bank and to enlarge the renminbi's sphere “is political and related to the current political dynamics within the World Bank” and the established international financial system. Tom Wheeler of the South African Institute of International Affairs said developments in New Delhi (India) were “giving substance to the previously (and) loosely arranged economic block”. - City Press</Msg><Username>hbarackdolf</Username><Timestamp>1350513664460</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 18:41:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350513752442-519</Id><Title>We want no longer the US$ as trade currency (China,Europe,Asia and Russia)</Title><Msg>The US$ is worthless</Msg><Username>hbarackdolf</Username><Timestamp>1350513752442</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 18:42:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350514297256-520</Id><Topic><Title>We want no longer the US$ as trade currency (China,Europe,Asia and Russia)</Title><Username>hbarackdolf</Username><Timestamp>1350513752442</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 18:42:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thank the GOP for that and their deliberate obstructionism for the past year.

TIANJIN, China — The Binhai New Area in the municipality of Tianjin looks like a cross between a desolate stretch of the New Jersey Turnpike and the bottom of the ocean. Half-built residential high-rises shimmer in the sun-baked distance, so far apart that even thinking about walking between them is exhausting. Construction workers in yellow hard hats cross the road gripping sledgehammers; they look like schools of weary-eyed fish.

Pei-style glass pyramid through the window of her silver Audi A6. "This is a cruise port," she said later, pointing at a curvy postmodern edifice many miles down the highway. "That over there will be a Hilton." Dong is a manager of San'Ai Business Exchange Co., a private organization that takes investors and government officials on driving tours of the area. On a hot day in early July, I was her only client. "This place is a kind of miracle," she told me. "It shows that our government can accomplish whatever it wants." Welcome to Tianjin, China's sixth-most populous city and perhaps its biggest property bubble. A half-hour train ride from Beijing, a 200-mile-an-hour straight shot through open farmland and industrial sprawl, Tianjin was long known as a shipping hub with uncommonly tasty steamed pork buns. It is now considered a "dual-core city." Its old quarter is quaint and tree-lined, sprinkled with European and American architecture built in the late 19th century, when the city first opened up to foreign trade. Its other "core" is the Binhai New Area, an 876 square-mile swath of salt pan, wetlands, and old fishing villages now home to 2.48 million of the city's 11 million inhabitants. Binhai's scope is difficult to fathom. The area is home to the largest cargo airport in northern China and the fourth-busiest seaport in the world. Slightly inland is the 12 square-mile Tianjin Eco-city, a $22 billion Sino-Singaporean joint venture where the area's white-collar workers will live in wind- and solar-powered homes. Along Binhai's 95-mile coastline is a $3.82 billion Israeli-made desalinization plant and an artificial beach, its sand imported from the southeastern province of Fujian. Docked nearby is the Kiev, an old Soviet aircraft carrier that has been converted into a theme park and a five-star hotel. Three yacht marinas are under construction. The Binhai New Area "is already the country's third engine of economic take-off after the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone and the Shanghai Pudong New Area," one high-level Binhai official stated in a promotional pamphlet last year. Binhai officials have borrowed upwards of $64 billion to finance their vision, and their strategy seems to be working. Tianjin's GDP officially grew by 16.4 percent in 2011, the highest in China (tied with the municipality of Chongqing) and faster than any country in the world except Qatar. Much of this growth was driven by Binhai. Tianjin's per capita income is now close to Beijing's, a major coup for the city that has long been considered Queens to Beijing's Manhattan. But shady accounting schemes could mask major financial risks lurking just beneath the surface. "If you look at the local debt to local revenue ratio, one of the largest and worst debt bubbles exists in Tianjin," Victor Shih, an expert on Chinese financing, said in an interview with the bank Credit Suisse in March. In 2008, the central government issued a $586 billion stimulus program to help China weather the global financial crisis, and local governments were suddenly awash in easy credit. They splurged on subways, airports, luxury condominiums, and five-star hotels -- anything that would boost short-term GDP growth. According to China's National Audit Office, local governments had amassed about $1.7 trillion of debt by the end of 2010, about 27 percent of the country's GDP -- but other estimates put the number at almost twice that. Tianjin took out more loans than any other Chinese city in 2009, increasing its outstanding debts by 47.2 percent, far above the national average. Like other local governments, Tianjin officials typically borrow money through shady financing companies to skirt borrowing regulations, making the city's balance sheets difficult to #$%$. Tianjin officials insist that their companies -- often called "local government financing vehicles" -- are on solid financial ground. Last September, Vice Mayor Cui Jindu said that the city's financing vehicles had paid off over 80 percent of their loan principle due in 2011. He added that Tianjin should be able to clear its debts, with one caveat: "If we end up not getting a single new loan, there could be problems," he said. China's financial system might well weather an explosion of defaults, even as the country enters into its worst economic slowdown since 2008. Yet loads of bad debt could also result in inflation, a prolonged economic slump, or even a financial meltdown. "You don't know where debt risk is going to rear its head," said Patrick Chovanec, a professor of economics at Tsinghua University in Beijing. He mentioned Cui's remarks as possible evidence of pandemic check kiting, a type of fraud. "You basically keep the game going by writing more and more bad checks," he explained, "which disguises the fact that you have nothing in your bank account."</Msg><Username>A Yahoo!

The latest seven-day tracking poll of likely voters shows Romney at 51 percent and Obama at 45 percent, up from 50-46 on Tuesday and 49-47 on Monday. Romney has steadily gained in the Gallup poll in recent weeks, turning what had been a growing deficit in September into a growing lead since his strong first debate performance. And when Gallup shifted its voter model from registered voters to likely voters last week, Romney’s numbers improved even more (among registered voters, the race is at Romney 48, Obama 46). The new numbers, of course, don’t include much or any data collected after Tuesday night’s debate. It will take days to determine what effect that might have had. Gallup continues to show a better picture for Romney than most other pollsters. A Washington Post-ABC News poll released Monday showed Obama at 49 percent and Romney at 46 percent, while a Politico-George Washington University poll showed Obama at 49 percent and Romney at 48 percent. In addition, Democrats have cast doubt on Gallup’s likely-voter model, with the Obama campaign releasing an entire memo on it earlier this week when Gallup showed Romney opening up a similar lead in the 12 most competitive states in the country.</Msg><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1350516317532</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 19:25:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350516493414-533</Id><Topic><Title>THERE IS NO ONE LIKE CHRIS MATTHEWS</Title><Username>bellacooz</Username><Timestamp>1350516055329</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 19:20:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In 2005 Media Matters named him as Misinformer Of The Year</Msg><Username>bejupete</Username><Timestamp>1350516493414</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 19:28:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350516534224-534</Id><Topic><Title>Voting for Obama is like voting for a donkey</Title><Username>kingofvietnam</Username><Timestamp>1350514523182</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 18:55:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Bet you spent all day thinking of a witty post, but like flipper, TOU FAILED AGAIN!</Msg><Username>carolyne47</Username><Timestamp>1350516534224</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 19:28:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350516703441-535</Id><Title>EVER NOTICE</Title><Msg>Battle grund states: gas prices riseing red states: gas prices decreaseing looks like big oil is afraid they are going to lose their investment in hlipper and are trying something else to $crew the public.</Msg><Username>carolyne47</Username><Timestamp>1350516703441</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 19:31:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350516734295-536</Id><Topic><Title>THERE IS NO ONE LIKE CHRIS MATTHEWS</Title><Username>bellacooz</Username><Timestamp>1350516055329</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 19:20:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Naturally, he works for MSNBC.

Being energy independent is not going to reduce the price of crude unless demand all over the world drops. If we buy oil from Saudi Arabia, Canada or Mexico it makes no difference in our open market. The only thing that makes a difference is hedge funds driving the price up by curtailing supply or the oil companies themselves colluding to keep prices high and production low. They do that. OPEC sets supply to maintain oil prices over 80 dollars a barrel. Gasoline prices are also a function of refinery capability. No new refineries have been built in the USA for years even with the republicans controlling all branches of government. In fact one near the Canadian border was recently closed. This shortage of production facilities allows the producers to keep the prices high by curtailing supply. Another refinery was recently shut down in Aruba affecting supply of refined crude in this hemisphere. Oil companies are an oligopoly and do not function like a capitalist market. The charade put on by Romney about opening federal land to more drilling will have no effect on pump prices. Fuels from federal lands cost the same as other fuels. It may help the government revenue with royalty payments but that is nullified by subsidies to these companies. This whole issue of drilling on federal land is only a ruse for those ignorant that think we are somehow get cheaper oil prices on domestic production or oil from government land. We don't. The real advantage is we would not be faced with energy shortages if war broke out in the middle east or oil exporting counties decided to boycott or cut our supplies. For this reason we have stratigic reserves and buy oil from foreign nations even when we have enough onshore to meet demands. Our oil lands in Alaska have oft been thought of as undeveloped reserves. With present technology to produce abundant crude in other places now there is no need to raid those areas.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1350518232648</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 19:57:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350518484304-556</Id><Topic><Title>A MAN OF VALUES</Title><Username>carolyne47</Username><Timestamp>1350516807033</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 19:33:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I've previously commented on Romney's remarkable flexibility.

On September 12, the day after the attack that killed four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens, Obama said in comments in the Rose Garden that he had learned about the attack on the consulate the night before. Fact Check: What about the security in Benghazi? "Our country is only as strong as the character of our people and the service of those both civilian and military who represent us around the globe," he said. "No acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation, alter that character, or eclipse the light of the values that we stand for. Today we mourn four more Americans who represent the very best of the United States of America. We will not waver in our commitment to see that justice is done for this terrible act. And make no mistake, justice will be done." Opinion: Do facts even matter? On September 13, at a campaign event in Las Vegas, Obama vowed to bring the killers to justice. He then added, "No act of terror will dim the light of the values that we proudly shine on the rest of the world, and no act of violence will shake the resolve of the United States of America."

To be fair, both boys were doing a lot of fancy dancing to avoid directly answering the original question, which if I recall correctly was "What can/will you do to bring down the cost of gasoline?" In my view, the game looks like this: domestic demand for gasoline is far below current refinery capacity, and the world is awash with crude at less-than-exorbitant prices. However, US refineries are EXPORTING record amounts of refined petroleum products, including aviation and marine fuel, home heating oil, diesel, asphalt, specialty lubricants and solvents, etc., especially to European customers. Last year, export sales of refined petroleum products generated more foreign income and profits than any other US sector. The refineries, particularly those in the Gulf region, are in a win-win-win situation: abundant and cheap domestic crude gets refined and sold abroad at higher margins; some 'skim' lands in offshore coffers and shelters, and the poor refineries then righteously complain that they're already running at full capacity, but the mean EPA won't let them build any new refineries. Presto: domestic gasoline prices rise. Wouldn't it be great to build that Keystone pipeline so they can further expand foreign shipments and further restrict domestic supply? Neither Obama or Romney showed much inclination to kill a goose that produces so many golden eggs. What do you think they're more inclined to put a dent in: foreign trade revenue, oil company profits, or the wallet of a guy who drives a Hyundai?</Msg><Username>fish2kill</Username><Timestamp>1350523264039</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 21:21:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350523805270-577</Id><Title>Now that we have established there are more Oil leases than in 2007</Title><Msg>on public land, lets talk about what difference it makes. If we had nationalized oil companies then the government could set the oil price in the USA but we buy our oil on the world market. Being energy independent is not going to reduce the price of crude unless demand all over the world drops. If we buy oil from Saudi Arabia, Canada or Mexico it makes no difference in our open market. The only thing that makes a difference is hedge funds driving the price up or the oil companies themselves colluding to keep prices high and production low. They do that. OPEC sets supply to maintain oil prices over 80 dollars a barrel. Gasoline prices are also a function of refinery capability. No new refineries have been built in the USA for years even with the republicans controlling all branches of government. In fact one near the Canadian border was recently closed. This shortage of production facilities allows the producers to keep the prices high by curtailing supply. Another refinery was recently shut down in Aruba affecting supply of refined crude in this hemisphere. Oil companies are an oligopoly and do not function like a capitalist market. The charade put on by Romney about opening federal land to more drilling will have no effect on pump prices. Fuels from federal lands cost the same as other fuels. It may help the government revenue with royalty payments but that is nullified by subsidies to these companies. This whole issue of drilling on federal land is only a ruse for those ignorant that think we are somehow get cheaper oil prices on domestic production or oil from government land. We don't. The real advantage is we would not be faced with energy shortages if war broke out in the middle east or oil exporting counties decided to boycott or cut our supplies. For this reason we have strategic reserves and buy oil from foreign nations even when we have enough onshore to meet demands. Our oil lands in Alaska have oft been thought of as undeveloped reserves. With present technology to produce abundant crude in other places now there is no need to raid those areas. There is also no reason to pipe dirty oil sand oil from Canada to Texas to be refined. It saves us no money at the pump. where that oil is sold will affect the world price by increasing supply wherever it is sold whether to us or China. The same oil rigs that are used on private land are used on public land. There are only so many and the oil companies have them working where it is most to their advantage. Having more public land leased changes nothing about that.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1350523805270</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 21:30:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350523909019-578</Id><Topic><Title>The facts on oil leases on public land</Title><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1350451524175</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 01:25:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Here is a fact.

Has he done much with that? Romney's plan says no taxes on interest, dividends, and capital gains unless you make over $200K a year. How cool is that? You can make $200K a year in the stock market before you have to pay any taxes! That is about the best plan I've ever heard in my life. Think how all this money saved will go back into and stimulate the economy? Romney is a genius!</Msg><Username>healthycyberguy</Username><Timestamp>1350529311467</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 23:01:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350530038262-609</Id><Topic><Title>OBAMA IS BURNING THROUGH TRILLIONS AND TRILLIONS TO EXPAND THE WELFARE STATE</Title><Username>broke.obama55</Username><Timestamp>1350479500370</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 09:11:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>the biggest threat is the obama debt bubble</Msg><Username>broke.obama55</Username><Timestamp>1350530038262</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 23:13:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350530154795-610</Id><Title>All four "Moderators" for the three Presidential debates and the VP debate are Liberal Democrats.
