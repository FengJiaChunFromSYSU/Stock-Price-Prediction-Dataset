(That is ok, but it is putting it very mildly and sugar-coating the real situation that he is lying- or simply a liar!) President Barack Obama turned his opponent's name into an ailment on Friday, accusing rival Mitt Romney of suffering from "Romnesia" for emphasizing moderate positions rather than the conservative ones he put forward in the Republican primary race. Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, has closed a gap in opinion polls with the Democratic incumbent after giving a strong performance in the first presidential debate on Oct. 3, during which he sounded a moderate note on healthcare reform and the need for government regulation — highlights of Obama's platform. After a lackluster appearance in that debate, the president has given fiery retorts since then, both in the second debate on Oct. 16 — which many observers said Obama won — and on the campaign trail. Obama told a crowd of some 9,000 in the battleground state of Virginia that Romney was backtracking on his conservative-leaning promises. "He's forgetting what his own positions are, and he's betting that you will, too. I mean, he's changing up so much and backtracking and sidestepping, we've gotta ... name this condition that he's going through," Obama said. "I think it's called Romnesia," he said to hoots and applause from the crowd. Obama took the riff on amnesia to great length, describing "symptoms" that coincided with Romney's positions on abortion and taxes for the wealthy. "If you say you'll protect a woman's right to choose, but you stand up at a primary debate and said that you'd be delighted to sign a law outlawing ... that right to choose in all cases — man, you've definitely got Romnesia," he said. "If you say earlier in the year you're going to give tax cuts for the top 1 percent, and then in a debate you say, 'I don't know anything about giving tax cuts to rich folks,' you need to get a thermometer, take your temperature, because you've probably got Romnesia." Romney's campaign shot back that Obama, who has focused a lot of attention on women voters since the debate, had promoted policies that hurt women particularly. "Women haven't forgotten how we've suffered over the last four years in the Obama economy with higher taxes, higher unemployment, and record levels of poverty," said Virginia lawmaker Barbara Comstock in a statement sent by the campaign. "President Obama has failed to put forward a second-term agenda — and when you don't have a plan to run on, you stoop to scare tactics," she said. Obama has lost his large lead in polls in several swing states since the first debate, but a Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll out on Friday shows the Democrat ahead in Iowa by eight points and Wisconsin by six points. Reuters/Ipsos polling data shows Obama ahead among likely women voters nationally by 48.5 percent to 42.1 percent, down from a lead of almost 12 percentage points in the week to Sept. 23.</Msg><Username>giovannijay</Username><Timestamp>1350710422589</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-20 01:20:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350713814173-7</Id><Title>odumba has reached the end of the rope.</Title><Msg>guess what happens next.</Msg><Username>big_triceratops</Username><Timestamp>1350713814173</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-20 02:16:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350719228456-8</Id><Title>How is it that none of you small minded uptight republicans don't get that Obama has won?</Title><Msg>Do none of you understand how the electoral college vote determines who wins the presidency?

Yeah, yeah, I know; in many states you will not be allowed to vote in either party's primary elections (though as a registered independent in Massachusetts, I can vote in either primary but not in both). However, regardless of the primary rules in your particular state, every voter who switches from Republican or Democrat to 'Independent' puts additional pressure on both parties to present primary candidates who appeal to a broader segment of likely voters, rather than to extreme, party-faithful loyalists and activists. Imagine the impact this would have on party fundraising, candidates, and platforms. As their identifiable base shrinks, each party would face a greater and greater conundrum: whether to go with an extreme candidate backed by a few deep-pocket donors and special interests, or put forward a more centrist candidate and platform and seek campaign funds from a larger population of donors. The current primary process reliably produces only two outcomes: political gridlock, or a tsunami of one-sided legislation and court decisions - i.e, political vendetta. No matter which side you're on, over the long haul you're all but guaranteed to get hit in the endless crossfire. Think of registering as an independent as 'discouraging' the RNC's and DNC's use of automatic weapons and 'limiting' the size of clips they can buy without resorting to an outright ban on either one. ROTFLMAO or just hand them two starting pistols full of blanks and tell each that the other one just said something nasty about his mom.</Msg><Username>fish2kill</Username><Timestamp>1350738637893</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-20 09:10:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350738662898-45</Id><Title>another battery plant to close, lg chem in holland mi</Title><Msg>more egg on the face of the president 151 million in tax payer money and ZERO batteries sold!!!! will close after the vote</Msg><Username>tjnelis</Username><Timestamp>1350738662898</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-20 09:11:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350738958823-46</Id><Topic><Title>google up mitt romney made millions from auto bailout...the nation....hot off the press</Title><Username>hwardeinhorn</Username><Timestamp>1350737654313</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-20 08:54:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It may surprise many voters to learn that Mitt Romney made at least $15 million from the auto industry bailout he attacked in 2008.

You do it by persuading yourself that what is in your own personal self-interest is in the interests of everybody else. So you persuade yourself that, actually, government services, things like spending on education, which is what created that social mobility in the first place, need to be cut so that the deficit will shrink, so that your tax bill doesn't go up. And what I really worry about is, there is so much money and so much power at the very top, and the gap between those people at the very top and everybody else is so great, that we are going to see social mobility choked off and society transformed.[26] ” Nobel Prize winning economist Joseph Stiglitz says, “ Of all the costs imposed on our society by the top 1 percent, perhaps the greatest is this: the erosion of our sense of identity, in which fair play, equality of opportunity, and a sense of community are so important. America has long prided itself on being a fair society, where everyone has an equal chance of getting ahead, but the statistics suggest otherwise: the chances of a poor citizen, or even a middle-class citizen, making it to the top in America are smaller than in many countries of Europe. The cards are stacked against them. It is this sense of an unjust system without opportunity that has given rise to the conflagrations in the Middle East: rising food prices and growing and persistent youth unemployment simply served as kindling. With youth unemployment in America at around 20 percent (and in some locations, and among some socio-demographic groups, at twice that); with one out of six Americans desiring a full-time job not able to get one; with one out of seven Americans on food stamps (and about the same number suffering from “food insecurity”)—given all this, there is ample evidence that something has blocked the vaunted “trickling down” from the top 1 percent to everyone else. All of this is having the predictable effect of creating alienation—voter turnout among those in their 20s in the last election stood at 21 percent, comparable to the unemployment rate."[27]</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1350739754506</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-20 09:29:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350739814064-51</Id><Topic><Title>Help Obama Tax the Rich.

It is installed as the operating system for the new “SURFACE” tablet Microsoft has recently introduced. Windows RT will not run any desktop Windows applications beyond the applications that are bundled with the operating system. Bundled applications include virtually every single desktop application found in Windows 8—Paint, WordPad, etc.—except for Windows Media Player. It also includes a fully-functional and full-featured version of Office 2013 called Office Home &amp; Student 2013 RT. This suite includes Word, Excel, OneNote, and PowerPoint. For the umpteenth time, it does not include Outlook. Windows RT will not run any desktop applications beyond the applications that are bundled with the operating system. This means it will not run Windows Essentials 2012, Microsoft Outlook (any version), Microsoft Office (any version, beyond what’s included with RT), Adobe Photoshop or Photoshop Elements, or any other Adobe desktop application. It will not run the SkyDrive desktop application (which is part of Essentials 2012, yes, I know), meaning you cannot sync SkyDrive data to your RT device’s storage. You can only use the SkyDrive Metro app, which lets you access SkyDrive only when connected … just as with any other mobile device. It will not run iTunes. It will not run any desktop Windows application beyond what’s bundled with the OS. Windows RT is not a computer operating system. Windows RT is an operating system for mobile devices. Surface with Windows RT is not a computer. It is mobile computing device, like an iPad. It is a tablet, a hybrid device that bridges the gap between real PCs and media tablets, where you can work and play.</Msg><Username>wallysworld18</Username><Timestamp>1350747436782</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-20 11:37:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350747462398-77</Id><Topic><Title>c Iam'a w h o r e defends crowley, tells democraps crowley gave obama cover, they need to give her cover</Title><Username>zevoter22</Username><Timestamp>1350744627557</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-20 10:50:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ah yes once again little z engages in the degradation of women as has been his MO for years.

Romney has lived in Utah, Michigan, and Massachusetts. Utah: SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Utah's largest newspaper has endorsed President Barack Obama for a second term in office. The Salt Lake Tribune said in an editorial Friday that the incumbent is a competent leader who has guided the country through catastrophe, against tough odds, and earned a second term. The newspaper noted Republican nominee Mitt Romney's warm welcome in Utah, saying his rescue of the 2002 Olympics in Salt Lake City made him the "Beehive State's favorite adopted son." Utah is a largely Mormon, Republican state. But the newspaper says the once pragmatic and inclusive Romney has "skedaddled and is nowhere to be found." Michigan: Mitt's enthusiastic endorsement of euthanasia for Detroit and the auto industry has left him bucking strong headwinds there in his race to occupy the Oval Office. The revelation that his wife's "blind trust" generated a $15 million windfall from an investment in auto parts supplier Delphi, primarily due to their rescue via the auto industry bailout Mitt opposed, isn't winning many converts either. Just hedging his bets, I suppose, like any good businessman. Massachusetts: the voters of this state elected Mitt Romney to serve as their governor in 2002. How happy were they with his performance? Current polls show Obama with about 60% support from Mitt's former constituents. OK, but Romney chose a running mate who could be expected to bring some of his own regional strength to the party, right? Ryan was born and raised in Janesville, Wisconsin and graduated from Miami University in Ohio, which ought to bring two other key states into the Republican fold; after all, he's the current US Congressman from Wisconsin's 1st District. However, polls show his ticket trailing by 4-6% in Wisconsin. Meanwhile, his stance against the auto industry bailout and his recent shameless invasion of an Ohio soup kitchen to wash a clean pan and mug for the cameras while pandering to school children (You were born and raised here? That's great....I grew up in a small town just like yours!") do not appear to be garnering widespread support from Ohio voters. The lesson is clear: get to know these guys a little better, and ROTFLMAO you may find yourself reaching for your own varmint gun.</Msg><Username>fish2kill</Username><Timestamp>1350747684292</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-20 11:41:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350747759859-79</Id><Topic><Title>The Tampa Bay Times, Florida's leading newspaper, has STRONGLY endorsed Obama...</Title><Username>dextergestapo</Username><Timestamp>1350745288165</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-20 11:01:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Been to Tampa lately?

Would like to know his success to failure rate. But this doesn't bug me as to what's happening with a company named Sensata. The company will close down and all the jobs will be outsourced to China. It's closing isn't for reason that it's losing money, just the opposite. It's profits were close to 500mil per year. It doesn't employ thousands just a few hundreds but that doesn't matter. It's the ideal or greed that has me concerned because this can happen anywhere so if you think you're safe, think again. Bain owns 51 percent of Sensata and Romney is a modest holder in Sensata. Now Romney probably isn't that much aware of it but it stems from the policy or the mind set of Bain which was nurtured by Romney,It's his only core belief to maximize profits at any cost for his elite partners. Nothing wrong in that, we just don't want that mindset for the Presidency. They need to see the whole picture not just the elite. This belief will carry over into his presidency if elected. You will see more companies move oversea for the sake of hugh profits. Obama was correct when he retorted back to Romney, “You're the last person to get tough on China”. Romney's mind set isn't on small businesses, he wants the big fish in the pond. In reality there isn't much difference in policy regarding small business between Obama and Romney. It's just the bigger companies that I'm worried about.</Msg><Username>acerdaprod</Username><Timestamp>1350749508165</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-20 12:11:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350749847256-82</Id><Title>Egyptians turning sympathetic toward Iran, want nuclear weapons too</Title><Msg>way to go Obama!</Msg><Username>bury_obama</Username><Timestamp>1350749847256</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-20 12:17:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350749886576-83</Id><Topic><Title>at what time will obama give his concession speech?</Title><Username>zevoter22</Username><Timestamp>1350749291271</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-20 12:08:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sounds good......it will happen.</Msg><Username>drwstring</Username><Timestamp>1350749886576</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-20 12:18:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350753046292-84</Id><Title>Another Republican POS in The House Of Congress, William Joseph Walsh</Title><Msg>William Walsh is another Worthless Republican working on destroying this country after he destroyed his family. who voted for this low life POS????, Who can believe this dead beat dad with a record that looks worse than those behind bars..

With the recent emergence of a U.S. housing recovery, Roberge highlights that the price and earnings cycle of U.S. homebuilders lead that of U.S. banks by about a year. The lagged relationship is consistent with housing fundamentals taking longer to filter through banks’ balance sheets. In other words, unsold home inventories must first be depleted before banks originate new mortgages. The good news is that real estate lending has the potential to add a sizeable contribution to banks’ earnings in 2013. Indeed, for a second quarter in a row, real estate lending is up year-over-year, and the NAHB Housing Index points to stronger mortgage lending activity for the next few months. Also, with yields on mortgage-backed securities falling like a rock (~3%) after QE3, banks are currently originating loans at much higher rates (~3.4%). Banks can then turn to the Fed to dump their repackaged loans and thus pocket juicy spreads. All things considered, calling for U.S. banks in 2013 to mimic the price and earnings performance of U.S. homebuilders in 2012 is not a far-fetched possibility, in Roberge's view."</Msg><Username>tlee22202</Username><Timestamp>1350766159651</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-20 16:49:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350766199774-113</Id><Title>RIGHT WING NUTS ARE SIMPLE MINDED BABOONS - COMPLAINING ABOUT GREEN JOBS</Title><Msg>First technology is new, so it is expected that most of the ventures will fail.

It is a sign that the US Government cannot pay its own bills. It is a sign that we now depend on ongoing financial assistance from foreign countries to finance our Government's reckless fiscal policies. Increasing America's debt weakens us domestically and internationally. Leadership means that, "the buck stops here.' Instead, Washington is shifting the burden of bad choices today onto the backs of our children and grandchildren. America has a debt problem and a failure of leadership.

If those 99 seekers go off of unemployment, they are no longer counted in the process--every month, hundreds of thousands of workers fall into that category making the workforce smaller and making any improvements in numbers look better than they actually are. If you want a more realistic number of unemployment &amp; underemployment, you should track the U6, and that number is not improving as dramatically as the U3. Even the U6 is not counting "all" of those they consider--"giving up looking for work." But if you are so smart, then how does the country lose 388,000 jobs for a month, hire less than that number for the month, and have the unemployment number go down? Must be Democragic-magic.

Two independent financial firms say the Marcellus isn't just the biggest natural gas field in the country — it's the cheapest place for energy companies to drill. One of the reports adds that the Marcellus reserves that lie below parts of Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio and New York are far larger than recent government estimates, while another said the powerful combination of resource, cost and location is altering natural gas prices and market trends across the nation. The Marcellus could contain "almost half of the current proven natural gas reserves in the U.S," a report from Standard &amp; Poor's issued this week said. Another recent report from ITG Investment Research, a worldwide financial firm based in New York, found that a detailed analysis of Marcellus well production data suggested that federal government estimates of its reserves "are grossly understated," according The new information increases the likelihood that natural gas will be used for more and more energy needs, such as city buses, industrial use, and electric power generation, according to Manuj Nikhanj, the head of Energy Research at ITG. And though low wholesale prices have squeezed drilling companies' revenue, the S&amp;P report says the Marcellus has the lowest production cost of any natural gas field in the nation, adding to the likelihood of a continued boom. "The amount of resource that's available at relatively low cost is fairly enormous," Nikhanj said. The Marcellus is a gas-rich formation thousands of feet below much of the four states, but current production is centered in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Earlier this year, the federal Energy Information Administration sharply lowered its estimates of Marcellus reserves, from 410 trillion cubic feet down to 141 trillion cubic feet. That adjustment was widely reported, including by The Associated Press. But that lowered estimate doesn't correspond with actual well production, said Nikhanj. He said their analysis shows that the Marcellus contains about 330 trillion cubic feet of gas, more than double the size of the next largest field in the nation, the Eagle Ford in south Texas.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1350782026335</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-20 21:13:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350782086756-174</Id><Topic><Title>"BLACK MONDAY" looking for minus -500 to -700 pts on DOW !</Title><Username>purple_man91</Username><Timestamp>1350778658773</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-20 20:17:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Fine with me.

The revelation came as new documents suggested internal disagreement over appropriate levels of security before the attack, which occurred on the 11th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terror attacks on the U.S. Briefing reporters ahead of a hotly anticipated congressional hearing Wednesday, State Department officials provided their most detailed rundown of how a peaceful day in Benghazi devolved into a sustained attack that involved multiple groups of men armed with weapons such as machine guns, rocket-propelled grenades and mortars over an expanse of more than a mile. But asked about the administration's initial — and since retracted — explanation linking the violence to protests over an anti-Muslim video circulating on the Internet, one official said, "That was not our conclusion." He called it a question for "others" to answer, without specifying. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak publicly on the matter, and provided no evidence that might suggest a case of spontaneous violence or angry protests that went too far. The attack has become a major issue in the presidential campaign, featuring prominently in Republican candidate Mitt Romney's latest foreign policy address on Monday. He called it an example of President Barack Obama's weakness in foreign policy matters, noting: "As the administration has finally conceded, these attacks were the deliberate work of terrorists." The administration counters that it has provided its best intelligence on the attack, and that it refined its explanation as more information came to light. But five days after the attack, Obama's ambassador to the United Nations, Susan Rice, gave a series of interviews saying the administration believed the violence was unplanned and that extremists with heavier weapons "hijacked" the protest and turned it into an outright attack. She has since denied trying to mislead Congress, and a concurrent CIA memo that was obtained by The Associated Press cited intelligence suggesting the demonstrations in Benghazi "were spontaneously inspired by the protests at the U.S. Embassy in Cairo" and "evolved into a direct assault" on the diplomatic posts by "extremists." Alongside defining the nature of the Benghazi attack, Congress is looking into whether adequate security was in place. According to an email obtained Tuesday by the AP, the top State Department security official in Libya told a congressional investigator that he had argued unsuccessfully for more security in the weeks before Ambassador Chris Stevens, a State Department computer specialist and two former Navy SEALs were killed. But department officials instead wanted to "normalize operations and reduce security resources," he wrote. Eric Nordstrom, who was the regional security officer in Libya, also referenced a State Department document detailing 230 security incidents in Libya between June 2011 and July 2012 that demonstrated the danger there to Americans. Nordstrom is among the witnesses set to testify Wednesday before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. According to the panel's chairman, Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., and the head of a subcommittee, Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, the State Department refused repeated requests to provide more security for U.S. diplomats in Libya. "You will note that there were a number of incidents that targeted diplomatic missions and underscored the GoL's (government of Libya) inability to secure and protect diplomatic missions," Nordstrom's email stated. "This was a significant part of (the diplomatic) post's and my argument for maintaining continued DS (diplomatic security) and DOD (Department of Defense) security assets into Sept/Oct. 2012; the GoL was overwhelmed and could not guarantee our protection. "Sadly, that point was reaffirmed on Sept. 11, 2012, in Benghazi," he added. Nordstrom said the incidents demonstrated that security in Libya was fragile and could degrade quickly. He added that Libya was "certainly not an environment where (the diplomatic) post would be directed to 'normalize' operations and reduce security resources in accordance with an artificial time table." Nordstrom also said diplomats in Libya were told not to request an extension of a 16-member special operations military team that left in August, according to an official of the Oversight panel. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and thus spoke only on the condition of anonymity. The State Department has said it never received a request to extend the military team beyond August, and added that its members were replaced with a security team that had the same skills. Democrats on the Oversight committee were sharply critical of Issa, the chairman, calling his investigation "extremely partisan." "The chairman and his staff failed to consult with Democratic members prior to issuing public letters with unverified allegations, concealed witnesses and refused to make one hearing witness available to Democratic staff, withheld documents obtained by the committee during the investigation, and effectively excluded Democratic committee members from joining a poorly-planned congressional delegation to Libya," a Democratic memo said. It said in the previous two years, House Republicans voted to cut the Obama administration's requests for embassy security by some $459 million. The Democratic memo said Nordstrom told committee investigators that he sent two cables to State Department headquarters in March and July 2012 requesting additional diplomatic security agents for Benghazi, but that he received no responses. He stated that Charlene Lamb, the deputy assistant secretary for international programs, wanted to keep the number of U.S. security personnel in Benghazi artificially low and that Lamb believed the Benghazi facilities did not need any diplomatic security special agents because there was a residential safe haven to fall back to in an emergency. Issa had a phone conversation Monday with Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton about the committee's investigation. The FBI is still investigating the attack. Clinton also has named a State Department review panel to look into the security arrangements in Libya.</Msg><Username>frankster1955a</Username><Timestamp>1350782597489</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-20 21:23:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350782615693-176</Id><Topic><Title>at what time will obama give his concession speech?</Title><Username>zevoter22</Username><Timestamp>1350749291271</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-20 12:08:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>capapp... hmm...

More than a hundred scientists and economists signed a letter to both presidential candidates warning about the dangers of rising sea levels in Florida. The presidential candidates may not be talking about rising sea waters, but South Florida residents are. This week, higher than normal tides flooded Miami's South Beach, swamping streets, people and businesses. "It has been like a high tide coming in," said one person,"but there's no explanation, it hasn't really been raining." Top scientists say in the future, climate change will make flooding much worse. They drew up a map to illustrate the expected flood risk along Florida's coastline in 2060. The color red means "underwater". And Professor Ben Kirtman,of the University of Miami,says the long-term projections look much worse. "By 2100, when sea level rise has been a full foot, I would say that 10 to 15 million people in Florida would have to be relocated," he said. That's why Florida's top scientists and environmentalists sent a letter to both presidential candidates asking them to address the issue. "I think that this is probably the single greatest problem that the world is facing today," said Kirtman. "I'm concerned that partisanship has made it difficult for us to be pragmatic to try to figure out pragmatic solutions."</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1350786268263</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-20 22:24:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350786539284-200</Id><Topic><Title>IF THESE DIRTY LIAR LIBS BELIEVE IN THEIR CAUSE WHY TRY SO HARD TO GET ILLEGAL VOTES?</Title><Username>mrstan4089</Username><Timestamp>1350773489237</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-20 18:51:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Prove it if you can.

Well, Obama can shout his anger to the rooftops, but that doesn’t relieve him of accountability for his handling of the Benghazi incident. The U.S. ambassador there and three other Americans are dead. The account of what happened and why offered by administration officials was obviously wrong virtually from day one. This should be an important area for full discussion — prompted not just by Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney’s questions but from moderator Bob Schieffer too — in Monday night’s final debate, which is devoted to foreign policy. Ads by Google Military History Master'sOnline, Accredited, Top Ranking. Get Started Today, Free Brochure. MilitaryHistory.Norwich.Edu Obama’s defenders cling to a general remark Obama made the day after the Sept. 11 attack — “no acts of terror will ever shake resolve of this great nation . . . ” — to maintain that he tagged Benghazi as a terrorist attack. But a CBS News examination of Obama’s statement concluded: “You can make the case that the president was referring to the Libya attacks as well as other ‘acts of terror,’ since he made the comment in the course of a statement about those attacks. But the stronger case would seem to be that the president did not specifically refer to the attack as an act of terror — as Romney said.” Furthermore, if Obama’s position was so clear, why did U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice and his spokesman Jay Carney for days after claim that the attack was not a pre-planned terrorist assault but sprang from a spontaneous demonstration over a little-seen Internet video clip disparaging Islam? Why did Obama himself time and again refer to the obscure video and avoid asserting it was a terrorist attack until two weeks later? We now know that the State Department had real-time communications with Benghazi during the attack and knew there was no demonstration proceeding it. A State official told reporters the department never blamed the video for what happened. So, for all the White House’s attempts to blame the intelligence agencies for not knowing what occurred — there was plenty of accurate, reliable information available from State. The great loss for the nation, and for Obama, is that this atrocity should have been a cause for the country to come together and rally around the White House. Though administration officials said the video was no justification for the attack, blaming the video for it suggested otherwise — undermining cause for a national rally around the flag. Why not have come out from the start and say Benghazi was a calculated terrorist attack? Either the administration was incompetent. Or it worried that calling Benghazi what it was would lay bare the unraveling of a central Obama foreign policy claim — America’s standing in the Muslim world is better than ever and “al-Qaida is on its heels.” News reports noted Wednesday that Obama dropped from his stump speech the reference to al-Qaida being on the run. A full discussion of Benghazi won’t preclude other important foreign policy issues: Iran’s pursuit of nuclear weapons, relations with Israel, Syria’s civil war and the failed “reset” with Russia, to name a few. But Libya encompasses important questions about the administration’s policies and transparency with the American people — issues voters need to consider as they go to the polls. That’s more crucial than whether Obama is offended by the questions.</Msg><Username>frankster1955a</Username><Timestamp>1350788066794</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-20 22:54:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350788283110-208</Id><Topic><Title>We had real time communications during the Attack and even a drone present toward the end of the attack</Title><Username>frankster1955a</Username><Timestamp>1350787127939</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-20 22:38:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Just fall in line and pledge allegiance to Obama don't bother with inquiry.
