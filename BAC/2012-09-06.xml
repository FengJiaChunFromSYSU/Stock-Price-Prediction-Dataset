The fox is in the hen house people, it is about time you woke up and realized it. This Congress has been the biggest failure and has gotten nothing done, except either vetoing or not even considering any measure that would get this country back on track. Bush Inc. put us were we are today, period! Now the Republicans drop logs into the road of progress and then spew their lies and discontent about how Obama is not acting fast enough, so let's replace him. This is the biggest Republican frame up of all time, they caused the mess and now they won't let anyone fix it, instead they want to return everything to the rich through more tax cuts for them and more deregulation, which is exactly what got us here in the first place!!! Vote out every Republican you see, they are traitors to this nation and to progress out of the sewer they threw us (the middle class) into with their insatible greed!

"There has been no shortage of oil in the market. Producers have been able to meet consumer needs," Abdullah al-Badri told an energy conference. "We also see this as being the case for the rest of 2012 and the foreseeable future." Oil prices surged in March to $128 a barrel, the highest level since 2008, because of concern about possible supply shortages. Prices have since fallen back and brent crude was trading around $118 on Thursday. "Today the price continues to be driven by excessive speculation," Badri said. OPEC at a meeting in December set a target to produce 30 million barrels per day, settling an argument which broke out in 2011 after Iran and other members opposed a Saudi-led plan to raise OPEC's production ceiling. Output has remained above the target all year as Libyan supply recovered after being virtually shut down during the 2011 uprising against Muammar Gaddafi's rule. The extra oil is filling gaps caused by an unusually large number of supply outages globally, which have also helped support prices. Supply breaks were running at nearly 1.3 million bpd as of early April. The additional supply has also offset a decline in exports from Iran, which is facing stiffening western sanctions over its disputed nuclear energy program. Iranian oil exports were running at between 200,000 and 300,000 barrels per day below last year's level, Maria van der Hoeven, head of the International Energy Agency, told Thursday's conference. Iranian officials have said the country exported an average of 2.2 million barrels a day last year. July supply from the 12-member Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ran at 31.75 million barrels per day (bpd), the high est since September 2008, which was shortly before it agreed to a series of supply curbs to combat recession and collapsing demand, based on Reuters surveys</Msg><Username>fairvalue23</Username><Timestamp>1346931185379</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 07:33:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346931232358-27</Id><Title>"There has been no shortage of oil in the market"</Title><Msg>"There has been no shortage of oil in the market" OPEC Says Supply Ample, Speculation Driving Price , | 28 August 2012 | 06:18 AM ET Oil supply will be more than sufficient to meet demand this year and beyond, OPEC's Secretary General said on Thursday, but added the price of fuel is being driven higher by speculation.

The average price for gasoline in the U.S.A would drop to $2.80 per gallon. Naimi Says Brent Oil Should Drop to $80.00 as Supply Tops Demand By Ben Sharples - June 03, 2012 Crude prices should fall because global supply is outweighing demand, according to Saudi Arabia’s oil minister, Ali al-Naimi. “We want a lower price than where it is now,” al-Naimi said in Adelaide today. “We need to get the price to a level of around $80” a barrel for London’s Brent crude, he said. Saudi Arabia is the world’s biggest oil exporter. Brent, a benchmark price for more than half the world’s crude, has dropped 6 percent this month amid concern Europe’s debt crisis will worsen and curb fuel demand. OPEC is working to bring prices down, the group’s Secretary-General, Abdalla el- Badri, said May 3. The producer group, scheduled to meet next month, is pumping 8.3 percent more crude than it considers necessary this quarter, figures from the Vienna-based group show. Brent crude for June settlement dropped 0.8 percent in the week to May 11 to $112.26 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. West Texas Intermediate oil for June delivery slid 2.4 percent to $96.13 a barrel. At $100 a barrel for London’s Brent crude, that equates to around $80.00 a barrel for West Texas Intermediate oil. The average price for gasoline in the U.S.A would drop to $2.80 per gallon. Oil supply outweighs demand by 1.3 million to 1.5 million barrels a day, al-Naimi said today. Saudi Arabia increased output last month to the highest in more than three decades, according to data it provided to OPEC.</Msg><Username>fairvalue23</Username><Timestamp>1346931496597</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 07:38:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346932391902-34</Id><Title>FROM THE WALL STREET JOURNAL</Title><Msg>From the Wall Street Journal Elizabeth Warren UR absolutely correct... “Republicans say they don’t believe in government.

Embarrassingly, convention chairman Antonio Villaraigosa, the mayor of Los Angeles, had to ask for three voice votes, and each time the nays got louder. He eventually ruled that there was two-thirds support for the changes, despite the clear lack of such a majority. The snafu led to a series of embarrassing TV interviews for Democratic National Committee Chairman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who told CNN there was “no discord” during the vote, only to have Anderson Cooper mock her comments as belonging to “an alternate universe.”</Msg><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1346933117126</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 08:05:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346933161442-37</Id><Title>anyone notice bill clintons hands shaking during speech</Title><Msg>looks like bill has parkinsons to me.</Msg><Username>tjnelis</Username><Timestamp>1346933161442</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 08:06:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346933163747-38</Id><Topic><Title>FOUR MORE YEAR!!!!!!!!!!!!

Compromise? That's the other guy's problem. But when former President Bill Clinton took the stage at the Democratic National Convention on Wednesday, he portrayed President Barack Obama as a pragmatic compromiser who has been stymied at every turn by Republicans. There was no mention of the role that the president and the Democrats have played in grinding compromise to a halt on some of the most important issues facing the country. That was among the lines by the former president and others Wednesday that either cherry-picked facts or mischaracterized the opposition.

The average price for gasoline in the U.S.A would drop to $2.80 per gallon. Naimi Says Brent Oil Should Drop to $80.00 as Supply Tops Demand By Ben Sharples - June 03, 2012 Crude prices should fall because global supply is outweighing demand, according to Saudi Arabia’s oil minister, Ali al-Naimi. “We want a lower price than where it is now,” al-Naimi said in Adelaide today. “We need to get the price to a level of around $80” a barrel for London’s Brent crude, he said. Saudi Arabia is the world’s biggest oil exporter. Brent, a benchmark price for more than half the world’s crude, has dropped 6 percent this month amid concern Europe’s debt crisis will worsen and curb fuel demand. OPEC is working to bring prices down, the group’s Secretary-General, Abdalla el- Badri, said May 3. The producer group, scheduled to meet next month, is pumping 8.3 percent more crude than it considers necessary this quarter, figures from the Vienna-based group show. Brent crude for June settlement dropped 0.8 percent in the week to May 11 to $112.26 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. West Texas Intermediate oil for June delivery slid 2.4 percent to $96.13 a barrel. At $100 a barrel for London’s Brent crude, that equates to around $80.00 a barrel for West Texas Intermediate oil. The average price for gasoline in the U.S.A would drop to $2.80 per gallon. Oil supply outweighs demand by 1.3 million to 1.5 million barrels a day, al-Naimi said today. Saudi Arabia increased output last month to the highest in more than three decades, according to data it provided to OPEC.</Msg><Username>fairvalue23</Username><Timestamp>1346956502416</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 14:35:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346956551775-181</Id><Title>OPEC Says Supply Ample, Speculation Driving Price</Title><Msg>OPEC Says Supply Ample, Speculation Driving Price , | 28 August 2012 | 06:18 AM ET Oil supply will be more than sufficient to meet demand this year and beyond, OPEC's Secretary General said on Thursday, but added the price of fuel is being driven higher by speculation. "There has been no shortage of oil in the market. Producers have been able to meet consumer needs," Abdullah al-Badri told an energy conference. "We also see this as being the case for the rest of 2012 and the foreseeable future." Oil prices surged in March to $128 a barrel, the highest level since 2008, because of concern about possible supply shortages. Prices have since fallen back and brent crude was trading around $118 on Thursday. "Today the price continues to be driven by excessive speculation," Badri said. OPEC at a meeting in December set a target to produce 30 million barrels per day, settling an argument which broke out in 2011 after Iran and other members opposed a Saudi-led plan to raise OPEC's production ceiling. Output has remained above the target all year as Libyan supply recovered after being virtually shut down during the 2011 uprising against Muammar Gaddafi's rule. The extra oil is filling gaps caused by an unusually large number of supply outages globally, which have also helped support prices. Supply breaks were running at nearly 1.3 million bpd as of early April. The additional supply has also offset a decline in exports from Iran, which is facing stiffening western sanctions over its disputed nuclear energy program. Iranian oil exports were running at between 200,000 and 300,000 barrels per day below last year's level, Maria van der Hoeven, head of the International Energy Agency, told Thursday's conference. Iranian officials have said the country exported an average of 2.2 million barrels a day last year. July supply from the 12-member Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ran at 31.75 million barrels per day (bpd), the high est since September 2008, which was shortly before it agreed to a series of supply curbs to combat recession and collapsing demand, based on Reuters surveys</Msg><Username>fairvalue23</Username><Timestamp>1346956551775</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 14:35:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346956609143-182</Id><Title>"There has been no shortage of oil in the market"</Title><Msg>"There has been no shortage of oil in the market" OPEC Says Supply Ample, Speculation Driving Price , | 28 August 2012 | 06:18 AM ET Oil supply will be more than sufficient to meet demand this year and beyond, OPEC's Secretary General said on Thursday, but added the price of fuel is being driven higher by speculation.

Mitt was born a boss... and he has no understanding of the hard work it takes to achieve. He was interested in becoming a governor without the interest to the work itself. But that's what often riches produce. They like to have titles as they don't care about the money of which they already have abundantly and they cover their insecurity by opening Swiss and Cayman island accounts. What can you expect from most who are born at the top? He sure is a PUPPET of the 1%! We have no need for that man in leadership!

The gushing emotionalism that boils over into stupidity and mass acceptance of the false premise of liberalism. That anything that a man can imagine from the propaganda he hears is suddenly made real, and at that point the consequences are certain (slightly modified quotation). You people amaze me. You call yourself caring, yet you don't care enough to act with intelligence and common sense. You're supposedly giving, but only when it comes to other people's money. You love the planet, but you hate everyone on it. You call yourself tolerant, and you will tolerate no dissent from your inane ideas, including from your enemies within who venture to disagree with you. You call yourselves diverse, yet you are race-baiters who see the color of everyone's skin as a pre-existing condition.

Bracketing your opponent’s convention is normal. Setting up your own clubhouse to shoot spitballs isn’t. Reince Priebus is in Charlotte with all the Republican usual suspects saying the same terrible things about the president that haven’t changed the polls in months. It’s big business’ version of Occupy. 2. A sure sign of something failing is Republicans embracing it. On Friday, the world got into #Eastwooding – taking pictures of empty chairs — to mock the ribald rant by the great actor/director. Two days later, conservatives got into the act. They posted chairs and invective. And in a sure sign of desperation, Sarah Palin joined in. 3. Paul Ryan used to have an undeserved reputation for truth telling. He’s since lost that reputation faster than Mitt lost his bounce. Now there’s a desperate attempt for him to win back his legitimacy by going on all the network morning shows Tuesday and explicating his misleading statements. Inspiring! 4. In August of 2008, America lost 592,000 jobs. Osama bin Laden was alive. The Iraq War seemed endless. And apparently the GOP wants to remind us of this by constantly asking Ronald Reagan’s classic question “Are you better off now?” They can cherry pick statistics that make their case. But find me one American who wants to go back to the shock of the financial crisis and fear that came from knowing the same INCOMPETENT guys who planned the IRAQ War were now dealing with a global economic meltdown! THAT OBAMA EVER STOPPED LOSING JOBS IS A MIRACLE! Bill Clinton's analogy was a hit. The GOP in leadership CREATED the HUGE MESS. Obama is cleaning THAT GOP MESS. And now the GOP is saying... we want the leadership back! They say Obama did not clean up the mess fast! The fact is that NOBODY could clean the HUGE MESS THEY LEFT at the end of GWB's just in short 4 years! And OBAMA has proven to TURN AROUND the situation but we need another 4 years of hard work to bring the nation out of the ravages cause by the REGRESSIVE and OBSTRUCTIONIST GOP!

Not a shred of truth to that tired refrain, but that's because you clearly don't understand business, you don't understand turnarounds, you don't understand bankruptcy, you don't understand anything except what the liberal hollywood crowd tell you is how it works, which is a complete fantasy. And you think it's all real. Never trust your own lying eyes, right? Someday, maybe if you're incredibly lucky and a little bit alert between the bong hits, the cluebat of doom will hit you between the eyes and knock some reality and common sense into your conscious being. Then you will wonder why you wasted so much of your life putting all of your faith into a false propaganda machine that never gave you anything except more misery. But don't fixate on that. With the Great Awakening you can start living like you should have been all along. Not acting out against your parents and authority figures like you're doing now, but really living. That means taking responsibility, taking some small risks with payoffs, maybe even formulating your own opinions based on your own accurate observations -- rather than letting someone else's falsehoods guide you into seeing what they want you to see. Right now, with the kind of parroting you just demonstrated, you must be in a real mess.</Msg><Username>flippant_1</Username><Timestamp>1346970440580</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 18:27:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346970494802-228</Id><Topic><Title>$$$...Obama to talks about growth tonight???</Title><Username>flashcrashcoming</Username><Timestamp>1346960326995</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 15:38:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Don't expect any changes in the employment number for the next 6 years. In these years, baby boomers will be retiring, however they won't be leaviing their jobs until interest rates start climbing and they feel their saving will be enough to support their retirement. If all 75 to 90 million retire, where does the income tax come from to support our government and Social Security? There isn't enough people to fill those jobs. Therefore, government can't let the interest rate rise. This will cause large numbers in inflation which is another problem. This will be the real financial cliff. Ask yourself, why is the baby boomer's figures not in the equation when they talk about unemployment? When did our financial problems start? Answer: 2008, the first year baby boomers started retirement.</Msg><Username>m.inally</Username><Timestamp>1346970494802</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 18:28:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346970588319-229</Id><Topic><Title>the last 60.5 days of the failure called obama</Title><Username>zevoter22</Username><Timestamp>1346970401555</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 18:26:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Minor clarification, if I may.
