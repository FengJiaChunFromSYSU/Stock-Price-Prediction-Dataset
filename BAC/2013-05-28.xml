Did you miss the 20% gain on Friday May 24 on no news? No problem, there will be many more on DRAM's inevitable rally to double digits. But the longer you wait to invest in it the less you will potentially gain. Do a serious DD on this one. Go to the Dataram website to discover more about the AMD manufacturing deal and other new technologies the company is expanding into in addition to the current and future memory business windfall due to exploding memory prices (DRAM's core business). Remember, the float is only 1.4 million shares and because of this it could gain several dollars in one day with increasing volumes due to high expectations and a bullish future for this tiny but well respected company in business since 1967.</Msg><Username>dianakibsion</Username><Timestamp>1369743212624</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 08:13:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369743671888-24</Id><Title>Europe’s Banks Sell U.S. Subprime Debt for Salvation</Title><Msg>With rate low for too long......you will see another subrime Bubble... 53% gain on subrime by Euro banks ??? Europe’s Banks Sell U.S. Subprime Debt for Salvation While European banks and governments need to sell assets to raise capital or repay taxpayer-funded rescues, investors are seeking riskier, potentially higher-paying securities as central banks globally push down yields on safer debt. With U.S. home prices rising at the fastest pace in seven years, that has turbocharged demand for non-agency bonds, with subprime-backed debt returning 12.7 percent this year after rallying more than 41 percent in 2012, according to Barclays Plc data.</Msg><Username>madmoneycramer</Username><Timestamp>1369743671888</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 08:21:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369743799327-25</Id><Topic><Title>Traderdave / Traderx</Title><Username>toothpaste2013</Username><Timestamp>1369404788396</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-24 10:13:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Another depressing day for TrollTraderX/TraderDaver.

At this point in the cycle I think it shows that markets are healthy. It's not the subprime debt itself that is bad, it is excess that mortgage companies went to in order to originate subprime loans that was bad. Higher risk loan securities have always been out there.

Everyone moving to north dakota? It seems that volatility creates trading revenue much like manic depression creates jobs for psychiatrusts. As long as they can print money by buying mortgages the bubble can probably be sustained for a while but what do all those trumps do in homes with no nearby productive jobs? The reason regan could out spend the communists was the US productive capacity, now the signals that tell people to get rich by investing in north dakota have become stifled. Why think critically and make sure that even part time workers can live well in north dakota helping produce oil for eveyone else when you can manipulate others into printing tira masu for youi? ROFLMFO. all praise the humans, the only evil was shutupstellas. maybe I''m insane but I'll bet the country would be better off putting ND burger flippers into mcmansions rather than putting mcmansions in places where there are no jobs and no one can afford the homes only because someone will pay you for that.

They have programs for ever penny of a stock performance in either direction. AT present , after having the MBIA suit behind them BAC is still holding in the 66-67% of book value! Why? Obviously so the manipulators can continue to "CONTROL" more shares by their own doing! Keep the PPS down therein control more shares to buy,sell short, buy, sell short. A casino game of sorts, only ones hurt are the retail investors. Hedgies are in Vegas every weekend living large on investor money. Let's give Mary Jo White at SEC a bit more time to see what, if any action She will take on this serious issue of computerized manipulation. BAC is a very strong Company now, just being held down by the above and govt.(commie) over regulation,i.e., Dodd-Frank.

The 40 branches hold approximately $1B in deposits and could likely sell for between $20M and $30M. Since Brian Moynihan took over Bank of America as CEO in 2010 he has focused on optimizing the bank’s branch count from 6,000 to around 5,000. According to its latest report, BAC has 5,389 branches currently. Moynihan’s move to reduce brick and mortar branch locations is directly tied to the trend of more customers turning to mobile banking services. The trend is currently running at a rate of 10,000 customers daily. Potential buyers for the rural banking branches could be FNB Corporation, Community Bank System, National Penn Bancshares, or smaller banks with less than $25B in assets.</Msg><Username>adspatz</Username><Timestamp>1369757087021</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 12:04:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369758511616-76</Id><Topic><Title>Sucking farts is GOOD for your health !</Title><Username>kingofvietnam</Username><Timestamp>1369701551541</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-27 20:39:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>where are all these mimics coming from?

Roughly halfway through the trading session, shares of Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ) are up by 1.3%, slightly lagging the broader KBW Bank Index (DJINDICES: ^BKX ) which is higher by 1.7%. Bank of America stock has struggled over the last few years after the floor fell out from under the housing market and the nation's second largest lender, along with many of its peers, was forced to realize billions of dollars' worth of losses related to subprime lending. To be fair, most of the losses came about as a result of Bank of America's now-lamentable decision to acquire Countrywide Financial in 2008, but at the end of the day, losses are losses. The good news is that the housing market appears to have bottomed out at the beginning of last year and has since mounted an impressive reascent. Investors got a taste of this last Wednesday when the National Association of Relators reported that existing-home sales hit the highest rate last month since November 2009. This was followed up on Friday by the Commerce Department's announcement (link opens PDF) that new home sales in April had followed suit, increasing by 29% on a year-over-year basis.</Msg><Username>cchaker</Username><Timestamp>1369765210476</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 14:20:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369765256288-90</Id><Topic><Title>Fake Housing Numbers</Title><Username>kid_dynomite_65</Username><Timestamp>1369761129309</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 13:12:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well, aren't you special.</Msg><Username>tigger.redux</Username><Timestamp>1369765256288</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 14:20:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369766333184-91</Id><Title>Tanking into the close</Title><Msg>Options ??</Msg><Username>chiti888</Username><Timestamp>1369766333184</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 14:38:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369766525938-92</Id><Title>Sell financials and short big take Wall Sgtreet games down</Title><Msg>They always pump their ow n stocks of their companys.

Stock should be at least book by now. Book hovering around 20.63 at last DD. Others as Posted are at book or better. One serious flaw with BAC is BAC was ALLOWED to be "controlled" as soon as Dodd-Frank was imposed by this administration. Yes, PPS was way down first, but Bill has had a lot to do with it. O.K. With a low PPS the hedge funds moved in, and were permitted to do so by SEC apathy. The hedge funds have literally controlled the Stock since then. Pennies on strength, short selling, keeping the PPS low so as to control more shares. After judges ruling we will see a spike, but the hedgies will take it off the top again! Beginning to think maybe money best used elsewhere. This thought after 23 years of ownership. SEC may not be strong enough to stop this without congressional passage of a new UPTICK RULE. A tax added to each short sale as well.

Syria could proved to be hot spots that will eventually affect your pot folio. The Russsians wanted to sell Assad anti missiles defenses. The Israelis already warned they will bomb any of that shipments. John McCain was there too. Maybe this senator needs to lose some weight. His tummy is like a happy Buddha. At Yellowman Investment Group (YIG) we constantly watch out for events that might severely affect our clients pot folio. The other day Mr. Obama declared GWB war on terror is over. But have you noticed the level of terror that already happened right here in America ? Like I said IF you want to make love really good, just bad mouth Obama for about 10 minutes before sex.</Msg><Username>kingofvietnam</Username><Timestamp>1369795470869</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 22:44:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369795795296-152</Id><Topic><Title>Badmouthing Obama is GOOD for your sex life !</Title><Username>kingofvietnam</Username><Timestamp>1369795470869</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 22:44:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Mr. King Boy, You sound like dumb fruitcake.</Msg><Username>ariad_lnvestor</Username><Timestamp>1369795795296</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 22:49:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369796004090-153</Id><Topic><Title>Obama joining France &amp; England with no fly zone</Title><Username>jpotatohart</Username><Timestamp>1369793810702</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 22:16:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Mr. zevoter Boy: OK i blow it out my obama.......but why you leave smegma on you momma hymen?</Msg><Username>ariad_lnvestor</Username><Timestamp>1369796004090</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 22:53:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369799269446-154</Id><Topic><Title>Badmouthing Obama is GOOD for your sex life !</Title><Username>kingofvietnam</Username><Timestamp>1369795470869</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 22:44:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Don't know about you guys but whenever I have sex I always think about Obama</Msg><Username>kingofvietnam</Username><Timestamp>1369799269446</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 23:47:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
