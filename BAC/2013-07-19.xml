Increased our debt by $6 trillion and your kids thank you for it. Increased taxes on the seniors making $25,000 or more. Took away your freedom of choice by forcing ObamaCare on everyone. Etc, etc, etc, and etc -Afganistan- where we should have been in the first place fighting the Taliban not Iraq, right? of course I am right! 6 trillion- that money would not have been spent if, it were not for the Bush administration and his cronnies gross miss management of our counrty wealth. GW came in with a surplus of cash, thanks to CLINTON! Gorgie boy took us to the brink of almost no return. Money had to been spent to simulate the economy, period. Obama Care!- Did you know that under the current system if you had zero cent in your pocket and you got cancer they would let you die, litterally. YES they would. Under the new system everyone pays something and billions of $$$ will be generate for this program and everyone is covered. No taxpayer money will be going into Obama Care once it get going. It's a win, win in every respect! The Bush's, father and son, have been the 2 worse presidents EVER! Especial son. What a disgrace he was, he made a mockery of our country. Are you kidding. At your age you should know better and had learned something. The Republican party stands for war, the rich, big oil and bigatry, period!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You could take that to the bank BAC :-)</Msg><Username>jvcre8sart</Username><Timestamp>1374206656892</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 00:04:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374206784710-2</Id><Topic><Title>BAC Massive move coming!</Title><Username>stockmr</Username><Timestamp>1368830097823</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 18:34:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>NFKD</Msg><Username>jesse.43260</Username><Timestamp>1374206784710</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 00:06:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374207005138-3</Id><Topic><Title>Obama's actions have brought BAC from $5 to $15.

If the judge approves the settlement amount, then there may be a slight relief rise, but not that much. The settlement has been "baked" into the price for a long time. However, if the judge doesn't approve the settlement, then there will be a substantial hit since that will be a big surprise for most and everyone will start worrying about how much more BAC could be forced to pay.</Msg><Username>tigger.redux</Username><Timestamp>1374242553286</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 10:02:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374242560672-80</Id><Title>Major Upgrade for Bank of America Corporation.

They are the ones that made the settlement with BAC as the trustees of the bonds and that is what AIG is challenging. AIG's basic charge is that BNY Mellon failed in their fiduciary duties in their settlement with BAC. That being said, $.50 is probably a good range for the stock to go up when approved. $1.00 may be a bit much since everyone's been expecting this for a long time. The biggest impact would be if the judge doesn't approve.</Msg><Username>tigger.redux</Username><Timestamp>1374243047606</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 10:10:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374243069631-85</Id><Topic><Title>Major Upgrade for Bank of America Corporation.

My name was Antonio West and I was the 13-month old child who was shot at point blank range by two teens who were attempting to rob my mother, who was also shot. A Grand Jury of my mommy's peers from Brunswick GA determined the teens who murdered me will not face the death penalty...too bad I was given a death sentence for being innocent and defenseless. My family made the mistake of being white in a 73% non-white neighborhood, but my murder was not ruled a Hate Crime. Nor did President Obama take so much as a single moment to acknowledge my murder. I am one of the youngest murder victims in our Nation's history, but the media doesn't care to cover the story of my tragic demise, President Obama has no children who could possibly look like me - so he doesn't care and the media doesn't care because my story is not interesting enough to bring them ratings so they can sell commercial time slots. There is not a white equivalent of Al Sharpton because if there was he would be declared racist, so there is no one rushing to Brunswick GA to demand justice for me. There is no White Panther party to put a bounty on the lives of those who murdered me. I have no voice, I have no representation and unlike those who shot me in the face while I sat innocently in my stroller - I no longer have my life. So while you are seeking justice for Trayvon, please remember to seek justice for me too. Tell your friends about me, tell you families, get tee shirts with my face on them and make the world pay attention, just like you did for Trayvon.

The need to redirect income to build the required reserve may slow down that momentum in the short term. Long term looks very optimistic.

BAC meets almost all of Basel III's requirements and, in case you've forgotten, they don't have to fully comply until 2018. Not sure how the redirection of income could slow momentum since they've been doing that all along. Don't forget, earnings that are retained, that is not paid out in dividends, automatically becomes a part of shareholder equity capital. Retaining earnings does NOT decrease income in any way.

Being a person who lives just outside of Detroit, our news papers are full of problems coming out of Detroit that never reaches the world media. How about the recent news just outside of Detroit where a hooded black man walked into a Dollar Store and killed a young white man and abducted a 20 year old white girl, who he later had his pleassures with and when finished he killed her.

Living just outside Detroit, I could write a book on the happenings from that city and it may sound racial. It's not racial, because the majority of that city are black and most of the problems stem from the city. How about the one about a 12 year old black boy who stole a bike and broke into a bank at 3 am. When the police arrived they found him with pockets of money. If you would like more stories, I'll provide them to you. Or how about the two white boys who killed one of the boys father, but his mother in the hospital and his brother in a comma using a baseball bat all in the name of drugs.</Msg><Username>bondholder44</Username><Timestamp>1374257615170</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 14:13:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374257622890-184</Id><Topic><Title>SYNC $2.97...EARNINGS MONDAY 7/22...HUGE SHORT SQUEEZE POSSIBLE/9 DAYS TO COVER...INSIDERS BUYING ...STRONG BALANCE SHEET...DEAL WITH GOOGLE</Title><Username>kellyjessica50</Username><Timestamp>1374253907592</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 13:11:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Love unloved stocks with strong balance sheet, great fundamentals, low float and huge upside....this is one of them</Msg><Username>twittyforever</Username><Timestamp>1374257622890</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 14:13:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374257666628-185</Id><Topic><Title>Detroit ..... the crowning achievement of Democrat politicians!</Title><Username>starkdirt</Username><Timestamp>1374237998192</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 08:46:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The city with the highest proportion of Muslim immigrants is Dearborn, MI...a suburb of Detroit.

In the middle of last month, Meredith Whitney -- who famously foretold Citigroup's fall five years ago -- reiterated her view that Bank of America was one of the most undervalued bank stocks in the market. "Very rarely do these big banks have both value catalysts and momentum," Whitney noted. "Bank of America had all of that." Since making her original call at the end of last year, Whitney's opinion has been vindicated, as the Charlotte, N.C.-based lender's shares are up roughly 15%.</Msg><Username>cchaker</Username><Timestamp>1374259066151</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 14:37:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374259408685-197</Id><Topic><Title>Obama is correct.

It amazes me that the rest of the lunatic left didn't fall immediately silent and turn their backs on the whole TM affair despite their opposition to the verdict once she went on TV and explained that it was Tray's suspicion that he was being followed by a gay person that led to the confrontation and beatdown.</Msg><Username>obamalipsync</Username><Timestamp>1374262550452</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 15:35:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374262591030-211</Id><Topic><Title>Detroit ..... the crowning achievement of Democrat politicians!</Title><Username>starkdirt</Username><Timestamp>1374237998192</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 08:46:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>First off Clinton was out office before the housing bubble started, we had a republican president , senate and congress at the time who deregulated the banks and got rid of the income to debt ratio which was the cause of the great recession. 04 Bush takes credit for high home ownership and pushes for low income housing and that was on fox news !

After years of struggle, pre-crisis levels of profits are back. JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanleymade a combined $17.6bn in second-quarter net income when they reported in the past 10 days. That is the best since the same period six years ago. The new-found earnings strength has not gone unnoticed in Washington where Sherrod Brown, a Democratic senator, suggested to Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, that he should not heed bankers’ pleas to rein back regulatory pressure. “It’s no surprise that mega banks are doing quite well,” he says. Investors have gravitated to a sector that not long ago used to struggle to attract interest as stormclouds from toxic assets to new regulations left banks unloved. Shares in BofA and Morgan Stanley have more than doubled in 12 months. Yet these are not the same banks that entered the crisis. JPMorgan swallowed Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual, BofA bought Merrill Lynch and, even for those untransformed by mergers, there has been a monumental restructuring. They have spent tens of billions of dollars on acquisitions, legal settlements and writedowns to return to those profit levels. And even if the headline numbers for the survivors look attractive, they are still far from pre-crisis levels of profitability. “You’ve seen this big rock – the regulatory change – splashing into the mill pond,” says Brad Hintz, analyst at AllianceBernstein. “The thing it hits immediately is all the RoEs of the banks.” The average return on equity at the five big Wall Street institutions is 8.9 per cent, less than half the returns reached in 2006 and 2007, partly because regulators have demanded far higher capital levels to absorb future losses. But it is getting better.</Msg><Username>cchaker</Username><Timestamp>1374263683306</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 15:54:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374263705814-226</Id><Topic><Title>☛☛☛☛DETROIT a disaster..CROOKS..earnings AWFUL..no QE in DEC=tank !</Title><Username>wallysworld18</Username><Timestamp>1374260847549</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 15:07:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you may look at clabassass and think "it can't happen here" but detroit seems to be at the point of no return.

Hey, you seem like a nice doggie.... friendly, full of spirit, not one to run away from a fight....... how'd you like to be my editor? Don't worry about occasional lapses in housetraining, either....my current editor has set the bar pretty low in that regard. He's a lovable old cur, but I know eventually he'd get over losing me. Even some of the other roles you suggested have possibilities.....but right now what I really need is a co-pilot/tailgunner/ECM specialist/vicious Samoan lawyer and so far all the girls I've interviewed for the position have been seriously deficient both technically and cosmetically.
