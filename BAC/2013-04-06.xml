Right wingers are wing nuts these days in the media, who has ruined most of their reputations. They don't spend money AT ALL compared to the socialistic liberals who are all running things like looting savings and the tax base. By way of supporting failed social programs and bankrupted government contractual businesses (solaro). That is the problem we have too much debt as a result of spending the media supports, not a bunch of extremists they say are the problem This is also a form of mind control and you have been victimized it would seem as well as many others on this board. Do you watch a lot of tv? When was the last time you read a book that isn't on the ny times best seller list perhaps, or recommended by someone like oprah who has no formal education? These people are not popular overall but to a small sector of the country who never shuts the hell up and ever gets up off their #$%$ and does something to correct what they are complaining about.</Msg><Username>kone2410</Username><Timestamp>1365221427590</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 00:10:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365222666556-2</Id><Title>Bush should never have invited Obama to his library grand opening</Title><Msg>Dude Bush you are actually killing democracy by inviting a marxist, liberalist, communistic pig to the party</Msg><Username>kingofvietnam</Username><Timestamp>1365222666556</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 00:31:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365222683900-3</Id><Title>Judge Approves BAC Settlement.</Title><Msg>Bank of America on Friday won a federal judge’s approval for a $2.43 billion settlement with investors who said the lender hid crucial information when it bought Merrill Lynch. The accord, among the largest investor settlements stemming from the recent global financial crisis, was approved by Federal District Judge P. Kevin Castel in Manhattan. Judge Castel called the settlement “fair, reasonable and adequate.” Shareholders said Merrill’s mounting losses and bonus plans should have been disclosed before investors voted on the merger in December 2008. Bank of America denied the plaintiffs’ claims, but the chief executive, Brian T. Moynihan, has said the settlement would remove uncertainty for bank.</Msg><Username>cchaker</Username><Timestamp>1365222683900</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 00:31:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365225856219-4</Id><Topic><Title>Would the latest settlement hurt the coming earning?</Title><Username>tanishuma</Username><Timestamp>1365213646070</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 22:00:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>the quarter was over last Thursday</Msg><Username>gamblin09</Username><Timestamp>1365225856219</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 01:24:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365228195563-5</Id><Topic><Title>Right wing extremists have become a huge problem for America</Title><Username>nogoodpete</Username><Timestamp>1365185805340</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 14:16:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>We would all like the tax codes reformed but they won't do it.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1365228195563</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 02:03:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>21</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365243081358-6</Id><Topic><Title>Would the latest settlement hurt the coming earning?</Title><Username>tanishuma</Username><Timestamp>1365213646070</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 22:00:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>2.4B is small change to BAC.

Geez, look at that Fiskar Auto now, Obama gave them like $180Million, and today they announced they are laying off 75% of their employees and may file BK!!! We are a small business operation here in NC, and though my own FICO scores (last pull was 800 level) and local success is very high, no bank will lend me these "historic low rates" which would allow me to grow, expand, hire people; yet they have tripled my "unsecured" credit accounts now which makes no sense, forcing me to use those instead of lower % loans that are suppsoed to be available!! I have credit accounts sure, but interest rates have risen to as high as 29.99% on some of them like Lowes &amp; Home Depot! We do not want to use them, but are forced to today, to keep in business, because the dammn banks WILL NOT lend to any established US small business as they should be doing...</Msg><Username>investrman</Username><Timestamp>1365253008293</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 08:56:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365253271651-15</Id><Topic><Title>This economy is a disaster!!!</Title><Username>farmergreg100</Username><Timestamp>1365218288963</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 23:18:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama's people have got to STOP using Keynesian Economics policies of the 1930's which were disasterous for the USA...

To summarize the major settlements to date and the remaining liabilities - BOA faces liability under three legal categories - 1) Mortgage servicing • Banking Industry Regulators (OCC &amp; FRB) - [settled $2.5B] • US Justice Dep't &amp; 49 State AG's - [settled $10.8B] 2) Securities fraud 20+ cases (AIG, FHFA, etc) in federal court in California that address claims of securities fraud: • Based on recent securities fraud settlements (Citi, Wells, Deutsche), BOA's potential estimated exposure is range of [$2.6 - $3.9 billion]; however, if • Based on a separate securities fraud potential settlement (UBS v FHFA), BOA's potential estimated exposure could be higher, a possible reasonable securities fraud overall range of [$5 - $15 billion.] 3) Breach of contract • Federal Housing Agency - [settled $1B] • Freddie Mac - [settled $1.2B] • Fannie Mae - [settled $8.8B] • US Justice Dept - [remaining $1 billion pending] • Private institutions (Pimco, BlackRock,etc) - [remaining $8.5 billion pending judicial approval] • Other Private institutions - [remaining $6.5 billion pending] • Bond Insurers (MBIA,etc) - [settled $2B; remaining $6 billion pending] BOA has some reserves to cover the current pending liability... not sure what they have reserved. One interesting note is that BOA has a case pending against MBIA re restructuring - if the outcome is favorable for BOA, it will dampen/neutralize the amount BOA may owe to MBIA re the MBIA case against BOA. The above estimates and the possible final remaining settlement amounts could be more/less and are TBD... but the good news is that BOA is making progress towards putting these uncertainties behind.</Msg><Username>san_tan_a</Username><Timestamp>1365280268852</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 16:31:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365280647387-51</Id><Title>I voted today.

I don't think there were any major payouts/settlements during 1Q13, therefore, BOA's earnings could be ok and they s/b able to continue building on reserve levels if necessary. I believe they are in a good position to start clearing the deck of the remaining litigation. BOA mentioned they hope to settle the $8.5B private suit in late 2Q/early 3Q. And, yes, it appears MBIA is trying to have it both ways... I think BOA's claim against MBIA re hiding funds/restructuring to avoid payouts is on point and that one will hopefully work out favorably to BOA. Not sure if when they settle and pay claims from reserves if it has an impact on the Qtr earnings or not? For example, haven't they already booked the $8.5 pending claim and when they settle and pay, that amt will not impact the upcoming 2nd or 3rd Q right?</Msg><Username>san_tan_a</Username><Timestamp>1365286707077</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 18:18:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365287277700-68</Id><Title>ECONONIC DISSABILITY</Title><Msg>Let,s face it,the country is on economic dissability.

Concurrent (CCUR) is an undiscovered and extremely undervalued low float stock that will capitalize most on this! CCUR's MediaHawk multi-screen technology can deliver any format of video, to any screen/device, at any time, over any network. CCUR was the first company to introduce video on demand (VOD) technology over a decade ago and today they hold a 30% market share of the VOD space with 212 VOD deployments across 4 continents and a reach of 50mm VOD homes. CCUR's clients include Time Warner Cable, Cox, Charter, and Bright House. CCUR ran from $7 to over $200 during the original VOD boom and now we are about to experience a boom of pay-TV companies rushing to upgrade their VOD infrastructure to support multi-screen video delivery to tablets and smartphones. CCUR just signed Virgin Media (VMED) the largest cable TV company in the UK with 3.8mm subscribers. CCUR will be powering VMED's brand new Virgin TV Anywhere service that allows their subscribers to watch content over their tablets and smartphones. CCUR has also signed a huge multi-screen deal with the largest cable TV company in Japan. CCUR closed last week at $7.24 per share with only 9.2mm shares outstanding and a market cap of $66.6mm with $24.6mm in cash, no debt, and an enterprise value of only $42mm or just 0.67X its revenue of $62.59mm! CCUR's EPS has been ramping up big on a quarter-to-quarter basis from $0.02 to $0.04 and to $0.08. Their main competitor Seachange (SEAC) is losing money, yet it's trading with an enterprise value/revenue ratio of 1.81, which would value CCUR at $15. CCUR's gross margins of 58.81% exceed SEAC's gross margins of 50.18% CCUR has potential to at least double this month.</Msg><Username>bbajf591</Username><Timestamp>1365288221785</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 18:43:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365289042382-71</Id><Topic><Title>Kim Young Un is the guy I admire the most !!!!</Title><Username>kingofvietnam</Username><Timestamp>1365282399899</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 17:06:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I might have to slap you IF you ever dare talking about Supreme Comander Kim Young Un like so.</Msg><Username>kingofvietnam</Username><Timestamp>1365289042382</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 18:57:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365289799758-72</Id><Topic><Title>Would the latest settlement hurt the coming earning?</Title><Username>tanishuma</Username><Timestamp>1365213646070</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 22:00:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>19B is a lot however the known pending settlements are probably more than that, let alone the new cases.

Right now unless things change it looks as if it is $4 billion out of pocket but depending on the settlements could possibly go higher (remember lawsuits rarely go lower). But it was estimated at $6 billion out of pocket last year thus that is a bit of rare good news if it does end up being $4 billion or possibly lower if the stars line up.</Msg><Username>nasa_rs</Username><Timestamp>1365290069946</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 19:14:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365291757868-74</Id><Title>BAC</Title><Msg>BAC has a MAF Stock Rating of 4 "Normal Downtrend".

Bank of America is among 17 banks and lenders facing lawsuits by the Federal Housing Finance Agency over losses suffered by Fannie Mae (FNMA.OB) and Freddie Mac (FMCC.OB) on mortgage securities. The FHFA has sued Bank of America over $57.5 billion of securities, more than any other bank, that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bought, and which were sponsored or underwritten by Bank of America, Countrywide or Merrill." Plus economy at its peak and about to tank. This is good news for now but if BAC was to lose the remaining lawsuits, it wouldn't have half the $$ to cover the judgements. I'd say BAC could be a good short-term (days) position but nothing beyond that.</Msg><Username>mrsanteph</Username><Timestamp>1365303052123</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 22:50:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365303460967-83</Id><Topic><Title>Tomorrow $13</Title><Username>nasa_rss</Username><Timestamp>1363731807683</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 18:23:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>even if world indexes show clearer sings of a tanking global economy by then? is BAC going to be $14 even as the economy tanks (if it tanks)?</Msg><Username>mrsanteph</Username><Timestamp>1365303460967</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 22:57:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365303934299-84</Id><Topic><Title>Would the latest settlement hurt the coming earning?</Title><Username>tanishuma</Username><Timestamp>1365213646070</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 22:00:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I thought Bac had settled the majority of FHFA cases back to its Jan 10.5B settlement.
