They have already spent millions on voter suppression tactics, intimidating billiboards, distribution and mailing of millions of inflammatory DVDs ( like "the Dreams of My REAL Father"), funding for "grass roots" organizations (Tea Party) with a hundred different names so as not to all be linked to one source--Karl Rove. The deep pockets of the Koch brothers, Sheldon Adelson, and others of their ilk that openly funnel funds into Rove's money trove have no bottom. Some of the worst of it may be from Jon Husted, Secretary of State of Ohio. He is a one man voter obstruction machine. He should be impeached and charged with criminal activity for his actions. Google his latest attempt at voter obstruction in Ohio. All of his dirty dealings began months, if not years ago, as he devised and implemented one dirty method after another to selectively invalidate Democrat votes. He has had his arbitrary orders overturned by the courts, yet he continues on obstructing voters with orders from his office that change voting rules with only days left leaving the courts little time to stop him again. The worst of it may never be seen. Surreptitious E-voting "glitches and failures" may rule the day. We've already seen several reports popping up on the internet about this as if to prime the flow of much more to come. Honesty and Republicans are strangers. The two shall never meet. Barring all of the above, I have no doubt that the re-election of President Obama is a given.</Msg><Username>mr.whizzard</Username><Timestamp>1352003675509</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 00:34:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352004180124-5</Id><Title>Romney, say to the American people: " I am a liar, and I would like for you to forgive me"</Title><Msg>We will consider if you and your sons and their sons and daughters promise not to run for public office ever again.

Here's a little bedtime reading for you...involving a President in a similair situation as today..google Smedley Butler, Wikipedia website. "“I spent thirty-three years and four months in active military service as a member of this country's most agile military force, the Marine Corps. I served in all commissioned ranks from Second Lieutenant to Major-General. And during that period, I spent most of my time being a high class muscle-man for Big Business, for Wall Street and for the Bankers. In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism.” Allegations of the Business Plot....... Smedley Butler describes an alleged political conspiracy to overthrow President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933. In November 1934, Butler alleged the existence of a political conspiracy of Wall Street interests to overthrow President Roosevelt, a series of allegations that came to be known in the media as the Business Plot.

It's wrong to use these brave young men, who wanted freedom for all, to degrade Obama." The mother of an American killed in a terrorist attack in Benghazi objects when the Republican tells the story of how he once met her son In Romney's telling, he and his wife once accidentally stumbled into a Christmas party at a neighbor's home, where they met some "really interesting people." Among them, Romney said, was a young man from Massachusetts. "He was a former Navy SEAL," Romney said. I "learned about him. He talked about his life. He skied a lot. He skied in some of the places I had. We had a lot of things in common." So, Romney continued, "you can imagine how I felt when I found that he was one of the two former Navy SEALs killed in Benghazi on Sept. 11. It touched me, obviously." (A sister of the late Glen Doherty confirmed that the two had been introduced at a Christmas party.). "He shouldn't make my son's death part of his political agenda. It's wrong to use these brave young men, who wanted freedom for all, to degrade Obama." Romney's campaign said he would stop telling the anecdote out of respect for his family. The reaction: Romney will regret inserting this story into his stump speech, says Steve Benen at MSNBC. He "already faced criticism for exploiting the deaths in Benghazi for partisan gain last month," and getting slapped down by a grieving mom whose son died serving his country will reinforce the impression that Romney is using our dead as campaign props. Romney did the right thing by respecting the grieving mom's wishes, says Mary Katherine Ham at Hot Air. Still, at the outset, he related the story "with respect and in good faith," praising Doherty for rushing to protect the consulate after hearing of the attack. Romney didn't even use Doherty's name, and if he called attention to the sacrifices of heroes who go "above and beyond to serve and save others," well, that's a good thing.

The rate of regulations quadrupled under this president." Not one year, not 'breaks,' not Fisker or Tesla ... it goes on "In one year, (President Obama) provided $90 billion in breaks to the green energy world … into solar and wind, to Solyndra and Fisker and Tesla and Ener1." The deficit is actually down slightly from what Obama inherited Says President Obama has "doubled" the deficit. Wrong before, wrong now "Right now, the (Congressional Budget Office) says up to 20 million people will lose their insurance as Obamacare goes into effect next year." Plenty of non-payers support Romney The "48, 49 percent" that supports President Barack Obama are "people who pay no income tax." Suit seeks fewer restrictions, not more President Obama’s lawsuit claims it is unconstitutional for Ohio to allow servicemen and women extended early voting privileges during the state’s early voting period. A gross distortion President Obama was saying success "is the result of government," not "hard-working people," when he said, "If you've got a business, you didn't build that. Somebody else made that happen." Not the stimulus, not to buy foreign cars Says stimulus money went to buy electric cars from Finland as a payback to Obama supporters. Where's the evidence? " ‘Obamacare’ puts the federal government between you and your doctor." No fuel for this claim Says Dow Chemical decided to build a plant in Saudi Arabia rather than Oklahoma due to the impact of environmental regulations on the supply of natural gas. Cherry-picked number that lacks key context "Obamacare … means that for up to 20 million Americans, they will lose the insurance they currently have, the insurance that they like and they want to keep." Not supported by evidence "Obamacare adds trillions to our deficits and to our national debt." Spending increased by about 5 percent a year on his watch When Mitt Romney was governor of Massachusetts, "we didn’t just slow the rate of growth of our government, we actually cut it." Health care law doesn't 'cut' Medicare Says Barack Obama "is the only president to ever cut $500 billion from Medicare." No support for giveaway claim "The president gave the (auto) companies to the UAW." Obama did mention Israeli fear about rockets "This president went before the United Nations and castigated Israel for building settlements. He said nothing about thousands of rockets being rained in on Israel from the Gaza Strip." That omits deals with South Korea, Colombia, and Panama Says President Barack Obama has opened up no new trade relationships with other nations. Repeal would ultimately increase deficit Eliminating "Obamacare" ... "saves $95 billion a year." Nothing to do with right-to-work state Says the National Labor Relations Board told Boeing that it couldn’t build a factory in South Carolina because South Carolina is a right-to-work state. Other presidents cut benefits - and Obama hasn't "Only one president has ever cut Medicare for seniors in this country . . . Barack Obama."</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1352039817642</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 09:36:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352039820759-62</Id><Topic><Title>★★★★★ TWO days until the Re-Election of President Obama ★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★</Title><Username>ebonics4gfy</Username><Timestamp>1351998222624</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 23:03:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I hope Romney gives his concession speech before Midnight.

Obama's been an author, attorney and community organizer Says Barack Obama "never worked in the private sector" before he was elected president. Overstates state of union-Boeing spat Says the National Labor Relations Board told Boeing that it "can't build a factory in a non-union state." It's bad, but several other recoveries were weaker "This is the slowest job recovery since Hoover." Making it correct requires stretching the numbers "Today there are more men and women out of work in America than there are people working in Canada." Not a sincere apology in the bunch Several times, Obama "has apologized for what he deems to be American arrogance, dismissiveness, and derision; for dictating solutions, for acting unilaterally ... ." Obama has stayed pretty close to campaign goals "He (Obama) has done several things well. Most of those things are places where he changed his view from where he had during the campaign. So, for instance, he's left our troops in Iraq and they're being more successful there. He boosted our effort in Afghanistan, which is the right course to take. He did not close Guantanamo, thank heavens." He should check their resumes "I was pretty proud of being the only guy on the stage that ever had a job in the private sector." Campaign is ankle-deep in lobbyists "I don't have lobbyists running my campaign." Even he admits it's not true "I just talked about guns. I told you what my position was, and what I did as governor, the fact that I received the endorsement of the NRA." Flubbing a key number in Red Sox lore The Red Sox waited "87 long years" to win the World Series. Z-visas have many requirements "The Z-visa that was offered in that Senate bill let everybody who's here illegally, other than criminals, stay here for the rest of their lives."</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1352040196225</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 09:43:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352040330163-65</Id><Topic><Title>YOU CAN'T SAY : "I SUPPORT THE TROOPS" AND THEN VOTE FOR OBAMA</Title><Username>whitest_white</Username><Timestamp>1352038592031</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 09:16:32 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>OBAMA SUPPORTERS HAVE NO CONSCIENCE</Msg><Username>bury_obama</Username><Timestamp>1352040330163</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 09:45:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352040370763-66</Id><Title>Romney: the also-ran who will be remembered for lies, nondisclosure, and mega-gaffes</Title><Msg>To start; Jeep, FEMA, the "47%," and only two years of tax records.</Msg><Username>j.farragut</Username><Timestamp>1352040370763</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 09:46:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352040404079-67</Id><Title>Fox News schedules 2 hr special on Benghazi</Title><Msg>for 10 PM ET Tuesday.</Msg><Username>jefatkinson</Username><Timestamp>1352040404079</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 09:46:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352040464096-68</Id><Topic><Title>YOU CAN'T SAY : "I SUPPORT THE TROOPS" AND THEN VOTE FOR OBAMA</Title><Username>whitest_white</Username><Timestamp>1352038592031</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 09:16:32 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Lying #$%$</Msg><Username>j.farragut</Username><Timestamp>1352040464096</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 09:47:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352040569891-69</Id><Topic><Title>Fox News schedules 2 hr special on Benghazi</Title><Username>jefatkinson</Username><Timestamp>1352040404079</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 09:46:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Election night?

"As Obama removes our combat brigades from Iraq, he will send at least two additional brigades to Afghanistan, where the Taliban is resurgent. He will also provide our armed forces with the reset capability that they need. He will replace essential equipment, and he will ensure that our men and women in uniform get the care and support they have earned." Increase the size of the Army and Marine Corps "Barack Obama supports plans to increase the size of the Army by 65,000 troops and the Marines by 27,000 troops. Increasing our end strength will help units retrain and re-equip properly between deployments and decrease the strain on military families." Increase special operations forces and civil affairs "Build up our special operations forces, civil affairs, information operations, engineers, foreign area officers, and other units and capabilities that remain in chronic short supply." Create a military families advisory board "Consisting of experts and family representatives from each service, it would help identify and develop actionable policies to ease the burden on spouses and families. The board would provide an institutionalized conduit (presently missing) for the evolving concerns of military families to be brought to the attention of senior policymakers and the public." Make military deployments predictable for troops and families "Establish regularity in deployments: so that active duty and reserves know what they must expect, rather than the current trend of changing the deployment schedules after they have left home, which harms the morale of troops and their families." MoreEnd the "Stop-loss" program of forcing troops to stay in service beyond their expected commitments Restore the Deployment Policies Under Which the Reserve and Guard Enlisted: America should recommit to the broken promises made to the men and women who serve in the Guard and Reserves. An Obama administration will: • Limit lengthy deployments to one year for every six years • Restore the 24-month limit on cumulative deployment time • End the "Stop-Loss" program of forcing troops to stay in service beyond their expected commitments. Make National Guard leader a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff "Too often, top-level military decisions, which impact the National Guard, are made without its input. Obama cosponsored legislation to elevate the Chief of the National Guard to the rank of four-star general and make the chief a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the top military advisory panel to the president. As president, Obama will sign this legislation into law." Strengthen and expand military exchange programs with other countries Existing U.S. programs of military to military exchanges, joint training, education, and human rights programs must be reoriented from their current Cold War standards to reflect new strategic priorities and ethical standards. Relationships that reassure potential future competitors both of America's goodwill and its strength may help dissuade emerging powers from becoming threats. An Obama administration will also prioritize the strengthening training and working relationships with the next generation of military leaders in allied states in the Muslim and wider developing world, in order to build professionalism and respect for rights and democracy, as well as open and sustain unofficial channels of communication and influence. Make greater investment in advanced military air technology "We must adapt and make tradeoffs among systems originally designed for the Cold War and those required for current and future challenges. We need greater investment in advanced technology ranging from the revolutionary, like unmanned aerial vehicles and electronic warfare capabilities, to systems like the C-17 cargo and KC-X air refueling aircraft—which may not be glamorous to politicians, but are the backbone of our future ability to extend global power." End the abuse of supplemental budgets for war "End the abuse of the supplemental budgets, where much of the money has been lost, by creating system of oversight for war funds as stringent as in the regular budget." Increase non-military aid to Afghanistan by $1 billion Barack Obama would increase U.S. non-military aid to Afghanistan by an additional $1 billion to $3 billion. "This aid would fund reconstruction, police and army training, embassy operations, and local projects including efforts to impact the lives of ordinary Afghans and to give farmers alternatives to growing opium poppies. The aid would also be tied to better performance by the Afghan national government, including anti-corruption initiatives and efforts to extend the rule of law across the country." Make U.S. military aid to Pakistan conditional on anti-terror efforts "As president, Barack Obama would condition U.S. military aid to Pakistan on their making progress to close down the training camps, evict foreign fighters, and prevent the Taliban from using Pakistan as a base to strike inside of Afghanistan. ... Obama also will increase aid to Pakistan for development and secular education to counter extremists." Open "America Houses" in Islamic cities around the globe "Modeled on the successful program the United States launched in Germany following World War II, America Houses would offer state-of-the-art English-language training programs, discussions, and a wide selection of current periodicals, newspapers, and literature. They would offer free Internet access and moderated programs that promote direct exchange with Americans through the use of modern information technology." End the use of torture "From both a moral standpoint and a practical standpoint, torture is wrong. Barack Obama will end the use torture without exception. He also will eliminate the practice of extreme rendition, where we outsource our torture to other countries.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1352041086207</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 09:58:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352041088037-76</Id><Topic><Title>Romney: A Desperate Man, Fudge a little more, switch positions a lot a lie like your butt depends on it.</Title><Username>reggie.thoma</Username><Timestamp>1351644409628</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 20:46:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Romney has only one plan, Corporations will rule over the middle class, get ready to work for much less, they may not even pay anything for healthcare..</Msg><Username>fireundersmoke</Username><Timestamp>1352041088037</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 09:58:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352041201028-77</Id><Topic><Title>Nate Silver has it right!

That was when government officials, egged on by left-wing activists, began accusing mortgage lenders of racism and "redlining" because urban blacks were being denied mortgages at a higher rate than suburban whites. The pressure to make more loans to minorities (read: to borrowers with weak credit histories) became relentless. Congress passed the Community Reinvestment Act, empowering regulators to punish banks that failed to "meet the credit needs" of "low-income, minority, and distressed neighborhoods." Lenders responded by loosening their underwriting standards and making increasingly shoddy loans. The two government-chartered mortgage finance firms, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, encouraged this "subprime" lending by authorizing ever more "flexible" criteria by which high-risk borrowers could be qualified for home loans, and then buying up the questionable mortgages that ensued. All this was justified as a means of increasing homeownership among minorities and the poor. Affirmative-action policies trumped sound business practices. A manual issued by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston advised mortgage lenders to disregard financial common sense. "Lack of credit history should not be seen as a negative factor," the Fed's guidelines instructed. Lenders were directed to accept welfare payments and unemployment benefits as "valid income sources" to qualify for a mortgage. Failure to comply could mean a lawsuit. As long as housing prices kept rising, the illusion that all this was good public policy could be sustained. But it didn't take a financial whiz to recognize that a day of reckoning would come. "What does it mean when Boston banks start making many more loans to minorities?" I asked in this space in 1995. "Most likely, that they are knowingly approving risky loans in order to get the feds and the activists off their backs . . . When the coming wave of foreclosures rolls through the inner city, which of today's self-congratulating bankers, politicians, and regulators plans to take the credit?" Frank doesn't. But his fingerprints are all over this fiasco. Time and time again, Frank insisted that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were in good shape. Five years ago, for example, when the Bush administration proposed much tighter regulation of the two companies, Frank was adamant that "these two entities, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are not facing any kind of financial crisis." When the White House warned of "systemic risk for our financial system" unless the mortgage giants were curbed, Frank complained that the administration was more concerned about financial safety than about housing. Now that the bubble has burst and the "systemic risk" is apparent to all, Frank blithely declares: "The private sector got us into this mess." Well, give the congressman points for gall. Wall Street and private lenders have plenty to answer for, but it was Washington and the political class that derailed this train. If Frank is looking for a culprit to blame, he can find one suspect in the nearest mirror.</Msg><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1352046904687</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 11:35:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352047076689-103</Id><Topic><Title>Barney Frank and left-wing activists caused financial crisis..</Title><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1352046904687</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 11:35:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>he should be in jail jmho</Msg><Username>victory_val_2007</Username><Timestamp>1352047076689</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 11:37:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352047188310-104</Id><Title>ANOTHER 1 MILLION FORECLOSURES COMING ON EAST COAST HOMES - WALK AWAYS ....</Title><Msg>Now estimated another 1 million homeowners who were close to losing their homes before are now just going to walk away as their homes are now more damaged and they have no means to repair them because of water damage.</Msg><Username>mauinightnights</Username><Timestamp>1352047188310</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 11:39:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352047435703-105</Id><Title>I am voting for Romney.

Oh, what a big man you are! .. and all that comes out of your mouth is bile. Ooh, how fouled-up you are!" The context: While running for president Romney seems to have suddenly found his inner philanthropist. As George Zornick reports (quoting Romney’s trustee, Brad Malt), “Over the entire 20-year period period [of 1990-2009, the Romneys gave to charity an average of 13.45 percent of their adjusted gross income.” To be a Mormon in good standing one must donate 10 percent of one’s gross income to the Mormon church. If Romney did so, that means he gave only 3.45 percent of his vast fortune to all other charities. Finally, there is the question of whom Romney gives his money to. Business Insider ran the numbers: “The answer appears to be primarily one organization: The Church of Jesus Christ Of Latter-Day Saints, more commonly known as the Mormon church.

Poor support of points exposes transparently silly 'reasoning'. To wit: "And O's motivation is as pure as Stalin's love for his enemies"....well since Romney has now switched all his positions to match Obama's, has his motivation changed also? And how did you acquire this supernatural (unnatural?) power to divine the motivations of others? That seems a power unto God himself, no? And..."it's not the kind of change that spreads joy and peace and happiness. It spreads misery ..." Well, it seems various provisions, at least, of the ObamaCare legislation are enjoying widespread support (e.g. no denial of coverage for pre-existing conditions, children up to 26 can remain on parents policy, etc) from American citizens, including Slippery Mitt!

Thousands of fuel-starved New Yorkers were able to get much-needed gasoline from the government at no cost yesterday, but not without a high-octane fit of confusion and double talk from state and federal authorities. The trouble-plagued giveaway began when Gov. Cuomo’s office announced in the morning that officials would try to ease the post-Sandy gas crisis by giving out free fuel to both “emergency vehicles and the general public.” The gas was to be dispensed from trucks at five locations around the area — and throngs of desperate drivers showed up to fill their tanks. But by the afternoon Cuomo spokesman Matt Wing rolled back the offer of free gas, announcing that fuel was intended for emergency vehicles first and foremost. The change came after the U.S. Department of Defense — which provided the gas in coordination with the National Guard — said the gas was only for first responders. A Cuomo administration source blamed the mixup on the military.</Msg><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1352059142700</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 14:59:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352059196410-151</Id><Topic><Title>YOU CAN'T SAY : "I SUPPORT THE TROOPS" AND THEN VOTE FOR OBAMA</Title><Username>whitest_white</Username><Timestamp>1352038592031</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 09:16:32 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>they hATE THE TRUTH SO THEY CALL NAMES</Msg><Username>carburetorkid</Username><Timestamp>1352059196410</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 14:59:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352059276702-152</Id><Topic><Title>Tea Party Going Crazy Over Good Jobs Numbers, They Wanted Americans Bankrupt</Title><Username>fireundersmoke</Username><Timestamp>1351859891921</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 08:38:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Can you name a policy of Obama's?</Msg><Username>kevivoe</Username><Timestamp>1352059276702</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 15:01:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352059359321-153</Id><Topic><Title>libya coverup is a huge story</Title><Username>victory_val_2007</Username><Timestamp>1352046855728</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 11:34:15 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>4 brave americans are death for lack of proper securty and planning that's not political you idiot that's life and death</Msg><Username>bury_obama</Username><Timestamp>1352059359321</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 15:02:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352060288549-154</Id><Title>When you stop questioning authority and just believe and defend any crap they shovel your way, you have forfeited your freedom.</Title><Msg>Take a hard look in the mirror.

Of Miss Leweinsky he stated "I did not have sexual relations with this woman on stage with us, Miss Lewinsky.You can believe me when I say, there was not a sexual relationship, an improper sexual relationship or any other kind of improper relationship.

The London-based publication said in its leader that while the United States faced a tougher decision and a more negative campaign than in 2008, Obama's Republican rival Mitt Romney "DOES NOT FIT THE BILL". (Note: I say UNFIT, in my posts) "This choice turns on two questions: how good a president has Mr Obama been, especially on the main issues of the economy and foreign policy? And can America really trust the ever-changing Mitt Romney to do a better job?" it said. "On that basis, the Democrat narrowly deserves to be re-elected." The Economist said it had backed Obama "with enthusiasm" in 2008, as did millions of voters, but that Americans will in 2012 "trudge to the polls far less hopefully". "So (in spirit at least) will this London-based newspaper. Having endured a miserably negative campaign, the world's most powerful country now has a much more difficult decision to make than it faced four years ago," it said. But while it said that Obama's achievements had been modest, Romney had FLIP-FLOPPED on too many issues to be credible, while his plans to cut taxes and increase defense spending were non-affordable. "For all his businesslike intentions, Mr Romney has an economic plan that works only if you don't believe most of what he says. THAT IS NOT A CONVINCING PITCH FOR A CHIEF EXECUTIVE," The Economist said. "And for all his shortcomings, Mr Obama has dragged America's economy back from the brink of disaster, and has made a decent fist of foreign policy. So this newspaper would stick with the devil it knows, and re-elect him." The Economist has a worldwide circulation of 1.57 million, with nearly 850,000 copies shifted in the United States alone, according to its publishers. Its website had more than 14 million unique visitors in July 2012." --------- NOTE: I have pointed to all the above negatives (putting it very mildly) of Romney in several of my earlier posts in the past. What we surely know is that it would be very damaging for Americans to elect Romney who is simply put UNFIT for the position of U.S. President.</Msg><Username>johnmjay</Username><Timestamp>1352063239127</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 16:07:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352063370084-177</Id><Topic><Title>THE OBAMA EXPERIMENT IS FINISHED IN 2 DAYS - THANK GOD !!!</Title><Username>mauinightnights</Username><Timestamp>1352046796438</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 11:33:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Is there noone brave enough amongst you cowering, silent charlatans to even attempt an answer to the simple Christian (quiet, heathens) question?

My financial situation is not unusual in the US. i am a baby boomer with a high paying profession. My spouse works and we both collect military retirements. Our agregate income puts us right in Obama's cross hairs. My spouse is old enough to collect social security but he is still working because he is healthy, able, and likes his job. We have a housekeeper 2 days a week, a yard guy and a pool cleaner. At the current tax rates, it is worth our while for both of us to work. However, in the Obama robin hood plan, it would be more prudent for my spouse to quit working, stop paying in to social security and begin to collect it. Of course, the house keeper, yard guy, and pool cleaner would no longer be necessary because my non working spouse could easily pick up these low level, non skilled jobs. Our lifestyle would not really change, but our service people would really take a hit. We have happily worked to help our kids out and make college and grad school available to them without saddling them with excessive student debt. For non minorities, college is not free. But, at 35 to 40 cents on the dollar, why would anyone continue to work? When the government makes excessive taxation a disincentive to work, there is something truly wrong. Although my situation may seem unusual to younger people, I personally know at least twenty other well compensated baby boomers who are social security eligible but still happily working and paying in, until Obama begins the fleecing.</Msg><Username>kcarvill</Username><Timestamp>1352070379402</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 18:06:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352070403470-253</Id><Topic><Title>mason's posts stringing together hi smany id's has NO one Fooled</Title><Username>zevoter22</Username><Timestamp>1352066958892</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 17:09:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The discrediting of your reputation and integrity is complete.

This is a huge part of the "fiscal cliff". Neither Obama nor Romney plan to change the social security entitlement. My point is that it makes more sense to encourage people who are healthy to work longer and pay into the entitlement system rather than to penalize them for doing so. The burden of entitlements will be on younger workers. I don't want this for my kids. Economies work better when people work and spend. My financial situation isn't based on inheritance, it is based on hard work over a lot of years. I don't call it greed, I call it the American dream.

Re-electing the president, supporting him in office and working together for the good of all of us. Thoughts not misdirected by a flip flopping trickster/ slicker backed by big money men who have nothing but their interest at heart. None of them supported Romney in the beginning no all of a sudden they love him even though he stands for absolutely nothing but more money for them. They are are the ones holding on to their money and power and setting up their "children and grandchildren" who will continue to do nothing for you and me. Like I said before and I will say again, we can go for the "shiny baubles" that Mitt Romney is trying to steal votes with. He is too much of a politician for me. Jumping back and forth so that you do not know what side he is on and that not good for the American people. Taste good now but will hurt your stomach like hell later. Furthermore do not try to bamboozle me with this "children and grandchildren" foolishness. Make the field even and their will be less "have nots" What we have made so far is a solid investment in the future. Way much better than the swamplands and minefields GW had us walking in. Republicans are now trying to capitalize on the investment and progress Obama has made. They bit their tongues rather than admitting that they are safer now, stock market is going up, jobs are being created and like I said before we are moving forward.</Msg><Username>reggie.thoma</Username><Timestamp>1352079966211</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 20:46:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352080088155-327</Id><Topic><Title>Romney exploiting the death of a former Navy Seal, Glen Doherty</Title><Username>j.farragut</Username><Timestamp>1352037258708</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 08:54:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Never mind the facts, never mind who gets hurt by the constant lying, if they can smear Obama, they will say anything.</Msg><Username>frankmangus</Username><Timestamp>1352080088155</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 20:48:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352080153350-328</Id><Topic><Title>Mother of slain former Navy Seal Glen Doherty says "I don't trust Romney"</Title><Username>j.farragut</Username><Timestamp>1352037883569</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 09:04:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Repug liars continue to exploit Ameericans killed in action</Msg><Username>frankmangus</Username><Timestamp>1352080153350</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 20:49:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352080213923-329</Id><Topic><Title>Obama's win will be celebrated almost as much as Romney's loss.</Title><Username>j.farragut</Username><Timestamp>1348242549299</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 11:49:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>With Romney gone, will we be finally rid of the lies?</Msg><Username>frankmangus</Username><Timestamp>1352080213923</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 20:50:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352080252760-330</Id><Topic><Title>Obama: My agenda after being re-elected on Tuesday.

You have lots of important things to consider. Why can't you get together and agree on what to do about these major issues? Why can't you come up with a compromise? Harry Reid: We've run into a situation here where compromise is not part of what we do around here anymore. Now on your program, 60 Minutes, Speaker of the House Representatives John Boehner said, "I reject the word compromise." That's exactly what he said, my friend Sen. McConnell, 'the single-most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president.' And that's what's happened this last year and a half. Mitch McConnell: Compromise is sometimes very difficult. My 47 members of the Senate have very different views from Harry and his colleagues about how much government we ought to have, how much taxation we ought to have, how much regulation we ought to have. It is not easy to reach agreement when you have very different views, Steve, of the direction the country ought to take. Truth be told, neither party's done much to resolve their differences and have used every parliamentary trick in the book to obstruct each other's agenda. As minority party in the Senate, the Republican's favorite tool is the filibuster; a tactic older than this Frank Capra movie from the 1930s. Harry Reid: The Senate, in my opinion, Steve, has been buried in procedural-- a procedural morass. Steve Kroft: Senator Reid, you are the majority leader in the Senate. You set the agenda for the Senate. You bear a responsibility, just as much of a responsibility as Senator McConnell, to make the system work and to do some things. Harry Reid: I believe that if you look at what Lyndon Johnson had to do when he was the leader, as I am, it was a different world. Why? You know how many filibusters he had to try to override? One. Me? 248.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1352081821764</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 21:17:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352081854436-353</Id><Topic><Title>Nate Silver has it right!

I'd rather see the workplace return more profits to the worker but when they don't provide a decent wage then government always steps in to adjust the imbalance. Not the best solution but the only one that works when you don't have strong unions and competition. Mergers, aqusitions, company failures, and offshoreing have reduced competition so that now we have to have a government managed economy. Our corporations love it. Look at the countries with managed economies where they are expanding.

You need your own isolated island - a jail cell might work - since you're too vicious and maladjusted to conform to the shared societal mores of a modern, civilized, democratic society.</Msg><Username>mixtli_speaks</Username><Timestamp>1352089996491</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 23:33:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352089997505-422</Id><Topic><Title>Obama's win will be celebrated almost as much as Romney's loss.</Title><Username>j.farragut</Username><Timestamp>1348242549299</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 11:49:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'll be celebrating both.</Msg><Username>oskarmeijer</Username><Timestamp>1352089997505</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 23:33:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352090066420-423</Id><Topic><Title>Easier than ringing a bell.</Title><Username>oskarmeijer</Username><Timestamp>1352089376945</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 23:22:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Another confirmation of their being idiots is that they will vote against their own interests because of blind following inability to see the larger picture. From their post it's easy to see that these Romney fans are uneducated and illiterate. That means even if they have jobs are not on gov. dole, they would be only low wage earners. Yet they're still follow Romney... to their own detriment.</Msg><Username>johnmjay</Username><Timestamp>1352090066420</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 23:34:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352090247003-424</Id><Topic><Title>171,000 jobs added in October, some 46,000 more than forecast.

It will be doubling the fun. Romney and Ryan have no chance! Hmm... one concern may be that two thirds of the U.S. is overweight and one third are obese. Could it be that their thinking and reasoning may have been compromised? I hope not! But it makes one think... as too many are now feeding themselves junk foods... for one reason or another. One can also observe even at this board that many GOP fringe posters invariable show lack of education and apparently come from the lowest class of society from what they post.</Msg><Username>johnmjay</Username><Timestamp>1352090750984</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 23:45:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352090857924-434</Id><Topic><Title>Lying Ryan and Romney are at it 24/7</Title><Username>amagine2000</Username><Timestamp>1352086056251</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 22:27:36 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>perfect science-lab specimens</Msg><Username>spmoran32</Username><Timestamp>1352090857924</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 23:47:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352091167846-435</Id><Title>171,000 jobs added in October</Title><Msg>9 million to go bwahahahahahahahahahahahaaaaa !!!!</Msg><Username>victory_val_2007</Username><Timestamp>1352091167846</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 23:52:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352091342085-436</Id><Topic><Title>171,000 jobs added in October</Title><Username>victory_val_2007</Username><Timestamp>1352091167846</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 23:52:47 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>and probably another 171k went on ss disability.
