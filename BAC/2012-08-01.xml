So how much of "your" money did you send them to bail them out? How much came out of your pocket? Answer: ZERO! Stop with they "they owe me something because I helped bail them out" crap. The government bailed them out by printing money (not by taking it out of your pocket, and not by creating a debt you had to repay). And since then, they paid the money back. So tell me how, if not a cent came out of your pocket, and you did not loan them anything, and the entity that did bail them out has been repaid, tell me how that equates to you having even the slightest to do with their bailout? They owe you NOTHING.</Msg><Username>mrstan4089</Username><Timestamp>1343811198885</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-01 04:53:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343811582866-31</Id><Topic><Title>WILLARD ROMNEY DID NOT PAY TAXES FOR 10 YRS</Title><Username>farawaylife</Username><Timestamp>1343782020636</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 20:47:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>My God man, do you take every speculative #$%$ comment as a fact then repeat it as such?

He's had plenty of time and plenty of top-notch help to shape his campaign strategy, and I'm sure his returns are immensely convoluted but squeaky-clean. Whatever Mitt is hiding, the place to look for it is in the NeverNeverLand of his 'retroactive retirement' from Bain, somewhere between 1999 and 2003. The only plausible explanation for Romney's refusal to release his tax returns is that something in those returns links him to something at Bain from that period (or later) that is political kryptonite. My own theory is that he's distancing himself from involvement in the Bain-Stericycle deals, the problem being that a major segment of Stericycle's operations dealt with the disposal of aborted fetuses. Now, to clarify the issue, there is nothing inherently illegal about that business (although Stericycle WAS convicted by a Texas court in 2006 of improperly dumping human fetal remains in public landfills). The real issue is that Romney wants to avoid having to explain how and why a Good Mormon like him got involved in funding Stericycle's operation. It would also explain why Mitt eased his Pro-Life stance around that time and and shifted to tepid support of pro-choice for his gubernatorial campaign and term as governor, and then wandered back to Pro-Life after he left the governorship behind and starting chasing the Republican presidential nomination in earnest. Mitt has put a tremendous amount of effort into removing the 'Massachusetts Liberal" label he pasted on for his run for governor, and for the guy who pioneered ObamaCare in his own state, he's done a remarkable job of straddling that fence. However, straddling the Bain-Stericycle issue would require a wider stance than Larry Craig's, a position that makes it hard to run for anything other than the 'EXIT' sign. Pros and cons, pros and cons: that pretty well sums up not only Romney's political calculus, but the people who were involved in developing and implementing it as well. (IMHO of course).</Msg><Username>fish2kill</Username><Timestamp>1343820817913</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-01 07:33:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343820990126-37</Id><Title>ARNA = Apple of Pharma</Title><Msg>Keep your eye on ARNA friends. -Milestone payment for Obesity drug Approval next week announcement. -Product launch ready -EU APPROVAL COMING (FDA ALREADY APPROVED) -DEA Scheduling Many other catalysts @@ If sales in the 1st quarter are great expect the stock to trade $40-$50 range.

Growth in employment has been slow in recent months, and the unemployment rate remains elevated. Business fixed investment has continued to advance. Household spending has been rising at a somewhat slower pace than earlier in the year. Despite some further signs of improvement, the housing sector remains depressed. Inflation has declined since earlier this year, mainly reflecting lower prices of crude oil and gasoline, and longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects economic growth to remain moderate over coming quarters and then to pick up very gradually. Consequently, the Committee anticipates that the unemployment rate will decline only slowly toward levels that it judges to be consistent with its dual mandate. Furthermore, strains in global financial markets continue to pose significant downside risks to the economic outlook. The Committee anticipates that inflation over the medium term will run at or below the rate that it judges most consistent with its dual mandate. To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee expects to maintain a highly accommodative stance for monetary policy. In particular, the Committee decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that economic conditions--including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run--are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014. The Committee also decided to continue through the end of the year its program to extend the average maturity of its holdings of securities as announced in June, and it is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities. The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments and will provide additional accommodation as needed to promote a stronger economic recovery and sustained improvement in labor market conditions in a context of price stability. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, Chairman; William C. Dudley, Vice Chairman; Elizabeth A. Duke; Dennis P. Lockhart; Sandra Pianalto; Jerome H. Powell; Sarah Bloom Raskin; Jeremy C. Stein; Daniel K. Tarullo; John C. Williams; and Janet L. Yellen. Voting against the action was Jeffrey M. Lacker, who preferred to omit the description of the time period over which economic conditions are likely to warrant an exceptionally low level of the federal funds rate.</Msg><Username>brazentrader</Username><Timestamp>1343849328840</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-01 15:28:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343849409520-168</Id><Topic><Title>Chick-fil-A says thanks to intolerant racist liberals</Title><Username>dumpobamie</Username><Timestamp>1343843586152</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-01 13:53:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Only approved businesses are allowed to build and only if they give kickbacks to Obama and democrats</Msg><Username>tulsaturd</Username><Timestamp>1343849409520</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-01 15:30:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343849605264-169</Id><Title>Bear Trap IMHO</Title><Msg>bear are phucked, price is no longer going down.</Msg><Username>easytr8er</Username><Timestamp>1343849605264</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-01 15:33:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343849942964-170</Id><Topic><Title>Bear Trap IMHO</Title><Username>easytr8er</Username><Timestamp>1343849605264</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-01 15:33:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Bulls...

The item of clothing set off a media firestorm, with the Romneys widely accused of being “out of touch” with average Americans. In particular, the Washington Post wrote that the $990 blouse “will not help her husband change those perceptions, no matter how many Laundromat photo ops are on the campaign’s itinerary.” Fast forward to last Friday, when First Lady Michelle Obama attended an Olympics reception for heads of state at Buckingham Palace, donning a J. Mendel cap sleeve jacket from the 2013 Resort collection. The price-tag? $6,800. This time, the Washington Post simply described the intricacies of the jacket and noted that Mrs. Obama has previously been criticized for “not dressing up enough for Queen Elizabeth II, so she stepped up her game.” No snide remarks, no outrage over the cost, no suggestion she was “out of touch.”</Msg><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1343855555274</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-01 17:12:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343855605519-208</Id><Topic><Title>Hey, Station, You Sell FSLR Before The Earnings???</Title><Username>traderx1966</Username><Timestamp>1343842249012</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-01 13:30:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What does First Solar have to do with bank of America?</Msg><Username>brazentrader</Username><Timestamp>1343855605519</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-01 17:13:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343855649270-209</Id><Topic><Title>Newbies: There are a Few Disgusted Bagholders Here Who Are Investor and Sexually Challenged</Title><Username>brazentrader</Username><Timestamp>1343854732874</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-01 16:58:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The moral being.

You can earn nearly $65k to $70k after deductions and stay in the 15% bracket. Second investors are using money they already paid income taxes on. This is the capital that was left after paying 35% in taxes. Because investors are at risk of losing their investment there is an incentive of lower capital gains tax at 15%. do not compare income tax to capital gains tax.</Msg><Username>jonesy196380</Username><Timestamp>1343877985568</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-01 23:26:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343878049029-269</Id><Title>If Romney were a Democrat would the Mainstream Media have a problem with his wealth?</Title><Msg>If you don't know the answer to that question you have a lot to learn</Msg><Username>przyblinski</Username><Timestamp>1343878049029</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-01 23:27:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343878445352-270</Id><Topic><Title>"I find it amusing how the plebeian lower castes on this message board continually denigrate my worthy opponent who has much more in common with them than I do."</Title><Username>nitwit_mitt</Username><Timestamp>1343877392452</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-01 23:16:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"You are one of those of the lower castes that recognizes how superior I am to you.
