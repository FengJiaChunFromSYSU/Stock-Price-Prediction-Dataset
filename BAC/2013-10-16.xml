Who holds it</Title><Msg>5.6 trillion is foreign owned. 1.1 trillion to China and a similar amount to Japan. As of 30 November 2012, debt held by the public was approximately $11.553 trillion or about 72% of GDP. Intra-governmental holdings stood at $4.816 trillion, giving a combined total public debt of $16.369 trillion. The national debt can also be classified into marketable or non-marketable securities. As of March 2012, total marketable securities were $10.34 trillion while the non-marketable securities were $5.24 trillion. Most of the marketable securities are Treasury notes, bills, and bonds held by investors and governments globally. The non-marketable securities are mainly the "government account series" owed to certain government trust funds such as the Social Security Trust Fund, which represented $2.7 trillion in 2011. The non-marketable securities represent amounts owed to program beneficiaries. For example, in the case of the Social Security Trust Fund, the payroll taxes dedicated to Social Security were credited to the Trust Fund upon receipt, but spent for other purposes. If the government continues to run deficits in other parts of the budget, the government will have to issue debt held by the public to fund the Social Security Trust Fund, in effect exchanging one type of debt for the other. Other large intragovernmental holders include the Federal Housing Administration, the Federal Savings and Loan Corporation's Resolution Fund and the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund (Medicare).</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1381916859335</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-16 05:47:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1381917624274-34</Id><Title>Hyper inflation</Title><Msg>Is the only way out of the debt issue, need to be prepared for that to occur</Msg><Username>donedooditi</Username><Timestamp>1381917624274</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-16 06:00:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381917735804-35</Id><Topic><Title>Break out Next Week?</Title><Username>donedooditi</Username><Timestamp>1375474320600</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-08-02 16:12:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Spring has Been winding up HARD again......</Msg><Username>donedooditi</Username><Timestamp>1381917735804</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-16 06:02:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1381919572613-36</Id><Title>Buffett on cnbc morning show.</Title><Msg>BAC better not disappoint.</Msg><Username>midnightbob62</Username><Timestamp>1381919572613</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-16 06:32:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1381920942071-37</Id><Title>The Americans will and should default</Title><Msg>It is much wiser to let the Yuans be the dominant factor</Msg><Username>kingofvietnam</Username><Timestamp>1381920942071</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-16 06:55:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1381921011187-38</Id><Title>I stopped watching Fox News, and read a newspaper, and now I am informed !</Title><Msg>What a revelation !</Msg><Username>zevoter33</Username><Timestamp>1381921011187</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-16 06:56:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1381921180509-39</Id><Title>I had no idea Ted Cruz was such a jackass until I stopped watching Fox News!</Title><Msg>Am I the only zevoter to see the light?</Msg><Username>zevoter33</Username><Timestamp>1381921180509</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-16 06:59:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1381921287499-40</Id><Title>ONE HOUR AND 30 MINS.</Title><Msg>Till the TRUTH.</Msg><Username>garyjohnson34231</Username><Timestamp>1381921287499</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-16 07:01:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1381921336134-41</Id><Title>I am so embarrassed and ashamed that I was ever associated with the Tea Party jackasses</Title><Msg>All I ever did was watch Fox, so what do you expect?</Msg><Username>zevoter33</Username><Timestamp>1381921336134</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-16 07:02:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>14</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381921517548-42</Id><Topic><Title>I am so embarrassed and ashamed that I was ever associated with the Tea Party jackasses</Title><Username>zevoter33</Username><Timestamp>1381921336134</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-16 07:02:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You are such a MORAN and you will pay for it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</Msg><Username>garyjohnson34231</Username><Timestamp>1381921517548</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-16 07:05:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1381921923377-43</Id><Title>When i am not posting as "zevoter," I am posting as "pfswsucks," or as "dumpo bombie."</Title><Msg>Ain't I a clever saKKK #$%$ tea bagging POS?</Msg><Username>zevoter33</Username><Timestamp>1381921923377</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-16 07:12:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1381921982269-44</Id><Title>20 cents vs 19 cents estimate</Title><Msg>Great</Msg><Username>jdelavega46</Username><Timestamp>1381921982269</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-16 07:13:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381922011234-45</Id><Topic><Title>The national debt.

Tampon praise is running out of time as a way of life as bubble after bubble implodes. Tbere is nothing really wrong with redistribution- including giving people access to health care- but if that start impacting quality of life someone is going to get angry. All of these stimulus programs not suprisingly seemed to go to sociophiles rather than people who were going to produce something. The real estate bubble seems to be re inflated with no indication that the occupants incomes have gone up enough to maintain affordability or sustainable appreciation. Ben would have been better off buying 85 billion in tangible goods to allow peopple in those industries to afford mcmansions. You can argue that would be arttificial but look at how markets and people react to the word "tapering" and there was never any hope that bond purchases would stimulate the sociophiles to produce, just impress each other with consumption. Now for the puffed up useless brats of high self-esteem to get angry. All praise the humans. Now maybe the gov could keep printing money but eventually that too would anger the foreign producers. This is not winnable unless someone in the US invents a tricorder or another Edison can be taken away from designing financial products.

It's not as if it wasn't expected. Most of the banks have been experiencing the same thing. If you will remember back I think a couple years or so, when the Feds were forced to reduce the transaction charge ceilings that banks and card companies could receive on merchants processing debit cards. It was shouted loud and clear that bank revenues would be down. But then I guess people have short memories. In addition, it has been widely reported that the economic climate is something at a standstill for the time being and housing sales/mortgages are taking a breather. What is important to look at is how much profit the bank is wringing out of every dollar of revenue. On that score BAC is doing quite well. BAC is, in fact, delivering in a tough environment.</Msg><Username>tigger.redux</Username><Timestamp>1381927120644</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-16 08:38:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381927175656-96</Id><Topic><Title>i just read through BAC's quarterly</Title><Username>smallcapthinkingcap</Username><Timestamp>1381927094342</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-16 08:38:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Until the clowns in Washington get their act together, stocks will remain hostage.</Msg><Username>tigger.redux</Username><Timestamp>1381927175656</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-16 08:39:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381927257582-97</Id><Topic><Title>BAC TRUST ME</Title><Username>jmstocks75</Username><Timestamp>1381926926980</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-16 08:35:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Just remember, even if BAC did announce they were going to request a dividend increase, we wouldn't see it until next year because they would still have to go through the annual stress tests and the Feds would have to approve their request based on those stress test results.</Msg><Username>tigger.redux</Username><Timestamp>1381927257582</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-16 08:40:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381927399795-98</Id><Topic><Title>Racist Ignorant Teabaggers want to destroy the US and world economy just because a black liberal is in their WHITEhouse !</Title><Username>teabagsonscrotum</Username><Timestamp>1381926516908</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-16 08:28:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I bet you suck kawk.</Msg><Username>tagoznail</Username><Timestamp>1381927399795</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-16 08:43:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381927438625-99</Id><Topic><Title>Racist Ignorant Teabaggers want to destroy the US and world economy just because a black liberal is in their WHITEhouse !</Title><Username>teabagsonscrotum</Username><Timestamp>1381926516908</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-16 08:28:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Quit inbreeding !

So much for whatever housing recovery the rose-colored glasses ones had envisioned.</Msg><Username>mmm_64slices_of_american_cheese</Username><Timestamp>1381929378390</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-16 09:16:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381929435372-112</Id><Topic><Title>i just read through BAC's quarterly</Title><Username>smallcapthinkingcap</Username><Timestamp>1381927094342</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-16 08:38:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Continue to listen to the conference call.

Revenue results, like many of its competitors, missed expectations with the company reporting a 5.4% increase to $21.53B. Positive trends included increases in consumer and business banking that led to a $1.78B profit, up from $1.35B profits a year ago. The wealth and investment management business reported a 26% increase in net income from $719M a year ago this quarter. Bank of America’s consumer real estate division reported a $1B loss, furthering the decline from an $857M net loss a year ago. Mortgage banking has had negative effects not only on Bank of America but its competitors as well due to increased long-term interest rates.</Msg><Username>adspatz</Username><Timestamp>1381932253092</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-16 10:04:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381932664800-157</Id><Topic><Title>Is $14.50 the ceiling for today?</Title><Username>whyduyouask</Username><Timestamp>1381931851084</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-16 09:57:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Reached a high of $14.54.

Again, you make my point. You do not know the difference between the marginal rate and the EFFECTIVE rate! I always love the argument below that the rich pay whatever they make % of all taxes. That is because the top 1% own the majority of the wealth. It is like saying that the person that makes 100,000 pays 10% and the person making 10,000 pays 10%, The 100K earners tax would be 10,000 while the 10K earner's tax is only 1,000. That means that the 100K earner is paying 90% of all the taxes. IT is simply due to the fact that he makes 10 times more. Look at folks like Buffett and Romey paying 12%. My MARGIAL RATE is 33%, I actually pay about 15% (effective rate) because of deductions. The middle class does not have the means, or intelligence, but mostly the means, to change tax codes to their favor. Now as to cuts. Dems again want to make cuts to defense and tax breaks. And, they are not afraid as you would like to think. The only people that look stupid is the teaparty. Not the dems. Enough said, this is like talking to dolphins.</Msg><Username>small.jobs54</Username><Timestamp>1381939297378</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-16 12:01:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1381939549127-217</Id><Title>UPDATE: BofA’s mortgage pipeline plummets</Title><Msg>UPDATE: BofA’s mortgage pipeline plummets By Nathan Stovall Bank of America Corp. experienced a modest drop in mortgage originations in the third quarter, but it said Oct. 16 that its current mortgage pipeline had dropped 59% from year-ago levels. BofA reported early Oct. 16 that first-mortgage originations totaled $22.60 billion in the third quarter, down 11% from the prior quarter but up 11% from originations reported in the year-ago period. BofA CFO Bruce Thompson said on a conference call to discuss third-quarter results that the company believes the decline in production in the period is less than its peers because it has been working through its existing pipeline. However, the executive also noted that the company's current pipeline at the end of the third quarter is down 59% from the second quarter due to a "significant reduction" in demand, particularly from the refinancing space. BofA President and CEO Brian Moynihan said many originations had been related to HAMP and the level of those originations has declined each quarter. He said the company's current mortgage pipeline stands at approximately 30,000 and noted it receives 1,000 applications a day, 300 of which relate to new purchase activity. That equates to roughly a month and a half of mortgages currently in the pipeline, he said, adding that production levels should decrease again in the fourth quarter. BofA and several of its peers noted during the third quarter that mortgage originations had come under pressure as refinancing activity had slowed with the recent increase in long-term interest rates. Many banks, including BofA, responded with cuts to headcount in their origination workforce. Thompson said on the call that the company reduced headcount in its mortgage department by more than 1,000 employees.

Guess what, the defense industry does not PAY the federal government a DIME. But, the folks collecting Social Security and Medicare have paid in their entire working life. See the difference? IF you want to balance the budget, just like the dems are saying CUT about 500 billion a year out of defense, not for poor old people. OK dolphins, back to the pond.

China stocks have been exploding in recent days with some rallying 50% to 300% within just 2-3 days GRO's China seeds business just reported 98% revenue growth, yet is currently receiving NO value at GRO's current share price of $1.60. (GRO has only 55.38 million shares outstanding.) GRO owns a controlling stake in PGG Wrightson (PGW.NZ) a New Zealand Exchange company with over NZ$1.13 billion in revenue (USD$946 million). GRO's 80.81% owned Agria Asia subsidiary owns 379.1 million PGW.NZ shares. With PGW.NZ trading for NZ$0.39 these shares are worth NZ$147.85 million (USD$123.85 million), valuing GRO's 80.81% stake at USD$100.09 million or $1.81 per share. GRO's wholly owned China seeds business grew fiscal 2013 revenues by 98% to $17 million. A modest valuation of 3X sales would value it at $51 million and add $0.92 per share to GRO's fair value - making GRO worth $2.73 per share. GRO paid $58 million for prepaid leases on 13,500 acres of farmland in China with 9-27 years remaining on these leases. They are receiving no value on GRO's balance sheet now that GRO has divested its sheep breeding business, but GRO could potentially sell these rights to another company. Even if GRO only receives back 1/2 of what they paid or $29 million, it would add $0.52 per share to GRO's fair value - making GRO worth $3.25 per share. GRO now controls PGW.NZ's Board of Directors and PGW.NZ's annual shareholders meeting is on Tuesday, October 22nd. If you Google "Seeds deal could grow enormous" the New Zealand Herald reported that GRO wants to merge PGW.NZ's seeds business into GRO to form a NYSE traded international seeds giant that competes with Monsanto (MON). PGW.NZ's seeds business has 15X greater revenues than GRO's China seeds business, but GRO's China seeds business is growing 12X faster! Disclaimer: We own 550,000 GRO shares that we intend to sell and can sell at any time.</Msg><Username>frmdar84</Username><Timestamp>1381946180320</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-16 13:56:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381946266658-240</Id><Topic><Title>Radical Dumbamacrats think the Government can go on spending more than its income forever</Title><Username>pfswsucks</Username><Timestamp>1381932897479</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-16 10:14:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Problem with medicare not only fraud but our insane medical cost, now social security has always had a surplus but theres 3 or 4 trillion borrowed against it.

Specifically, it had Fed approval to redeem $5.5 billion of preferred shares along with approval to buy back $5 billion of common stock. The bank redeemed the preferred stock in May as part of a broader strategy of managing net interest margin by refinancing high-cost liabilities (with some of the redeemed shares paying over 8% in non-cumulative preferred dividend yield), and also in 2013 Q2 repurchased $1 billion of common shares at an average price of $12.6. With tangible book value per share at $13.3, stock buyback was a good use of capital, and this remains true even at the current stock price of $14.1. CEO Brian Moynihan has commented: buying back common shares is the best way to continue to drive value for our shareholders and, indeed, the buyback has taken precedence over raising the dividend, which remains token at 1 cents/share per quarter.</Msg><Username>cchaker</Username><Timestamp>1381956122273</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-16 16:42:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381956677254-282</Id><Topic><Title>Radical Dumbamacrats think the Government can go on spending more than its income forever</Title><Username>pfswsucks</Username><Timestamp>1381932897479</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-16 10:14:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You are the most immoral of the immoral for believing without even trying to understand what it is you believe.

It's pejorative to say they 'loved' cherrypicking the healthy, that they prefered the healthy to keep rates down is true....and covering pre-existing is and improvement.

It is a shame that Government gives contracts to their friends and not to the best people for any job.</Msg><Username>fireundersmoke</Username><Timestamp>1381973035863</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-16 21:23:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381974298394-325</Id><Topic><Title>LameStream Media...Can you Imagine what they would be saying if BushCare was the Flop Obamacare is?</Title><Username>sarangino46</Username><Timestamp>1381968290978</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-16 20:04:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"either FAILED or gone BANKRUPT" Again...you are referring to BUSH!</Msg><Username>erazor111</Username><Timestamp>1381974298394</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-16 21:44:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381975329512-326</Id><Topic><Title>Sebellius should be Fired. for the Obamacare flop, An effective President would have already done that</Title><Username>sarangino46</Username><Timestamp>1381969910503</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-16 20:31:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That is the most common sense I have ever seen from you.

Either you stumbled into logic or you just stumbled. Either way government involvement of picking winners and losers are why our system will not last. Corporations and Political groups(people) have figured out how to game the system for advantages which lead to disjointed markets, broken markets, monopolies among corporations and groups of dependent people organized into political groups for material gain. The framers tried to put in as many checks and balances as possible but the federal government has been gaining power and authority and too much power in a central authority is a dangerous thing and leads eventually to totalitarianism. Any effort to weaken the federal government either in the form of regulatory power, spending or taxation is met with stiff opposition from the ruling established legal/government/corporate complex that ensnarls us. The Tea Party is the largest threat to the establishment since Ross Perot.</Msg><Username>sista_twistak</Username><Timestamp>1381977245754</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-16 22:34:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1381977720048-337</Id><Title>Far right extremists take losing SOOOOOO badly ! !
