The F-16 is not, and never was, a Top Gun contender, or even in the same league as the F-14s and F-15s. It was a relatively low-cost fighter sold in large numbers to foreign air forces, and it offered a lot of bang for the buck. However, keep in mind the relative ages of the aircraft I mentioned. The F-14 first flew in 1970, the F-15 around 1972, the F-16 a year or so later, and the F-22 in 1997. Add 4 or 5 years to those dates to approximate the time they entered service with the armed forces. 20 or 30 years of advances in airframe, avionics, engines, and stealth technology certainly give the F-22 a significant edge over the older aircraft.....there would have been no reason to build it if it didn't, and a heads-up shootout would be as pointless as putting a Sopwith Camel up against a P-51 Mustang. The nature of 1st-tier air superiority fighters in a sense makes them obsolete (from a design standpoint, at least) before they ever fly. The point I was making is that the F-22 cost far too much for what it has delivered, and far more rational approaches were available that could have delivered equal or greater performance for far less cost.</Msg><Username>fish2kill</Username><Timestamp>1349611511188</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-07 08:05:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349612737839-18</Id><Topic><Title>Restart the F-22 production line, now admits he was wrong about the 47%ers...... talk about Triangulation!</Title><Username>andym_30054</Username><Timestamp>1349431836755</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 06:10:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm sure I never heard of him. I never claimed to be a pilot; I was only enlisted swine, a mere buck sergeant, but I worked on the radar weapons systems of the top-echelon fighters, not throwaways like the F-16. Modern fighters are nothing more that airborne weapons platforms, and those weapons systems were my forte'. I never met a throttle jockey who knew as much about those systems as I did, but I'm sure your cuz could fly circles around me. Be sure to thank him for his service, and don't give yourself a sunburn basking in the reflected glow of his accomplishments. But enough about your cousin and me. Tell us all what you've done for your country lately (or ever). ROTFLMAO I worked on the F-4s of the only two Air Force aces of the Vietnam war, and all that means is that if I ever run into one of them and offer to buy him a drink, he might accept it.</Msg><Username>fish2kill</Username><Timestamp>1349612737839</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-07 08:25:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349613234080-19</Id><Topic><Title>Turn BAC Into Your Personal ATM!</Title><Username>pittswilcox513</Username><Timestamp>1349525837906</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 08:17:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sure thing.

We have tolerated each other for many years for the sake of future generations, but sadly, this relationship has clearly run its course. Our two ideological sides of America cannot and will not ever agree on what is right for us all, so let's just end it on friendly terms. We can smile and chalk it up to irreconcilable differences and go our own way. Here is our model separation agreement: 1. Our two groups can equitably divide up the country by land mass, each taking a similar portion. That will be the difficult part, but I am sure our two sides can come to a friendly agreement. After that, it should be relatively easy. Our respective representatives can effortlessly divide other assets since both sides had such distinct and disparate tastes. 2. We don't like redistributive taxes, so you can keep them. 3. You are welcome to the liberal judges and the ACLU. 4. Since you hate guns and war, we'll take our firearms, the cops, the NRA, and the military. 5. We'll take the nasty, smelly oil industry and you can go with wind, solar, and bio-diesel. 6. You can keep Oprah, Michael Moore, and Rosie O'Donnell. You are, however, responsible for finding a bio-diesel vehicle big enough to move all three of them. Also, please take Ted Turner, Sean Penn, Martin Sheen, Barbara Streisand, and Jane Fonda with you. 7. We'll keep capitalism, greedy corporations, pharmaceutical companies, Wal-Mart, and Wall Street. 8. You can have your beloved lifelong welfare dwellers, food stamps, homeless homeboys, hippies, druggies, and illegal aliens. 9. We'll keep the hot Alaskan hockey moms, greedy CEO's and rednecks. 10. We'll keep the Bibles and give you NBC and Hollywood .. 11. You can make nice with Iran and Palestine and we'll retain the right to invade and hammer places that threaten us. 12. You can have the peace-niks and war protesters. When our allies or our way of life are under assault, we'll help provide them security. 13. We'll keep our Judeo-Christian values. 14. You are welcome to Islam, Scientology, Humanism, political correctness, and Shirley McLain. You can also have the U.N., but we will no longer be paying the bill. 15. We'll keep the SUV's, pickup trucks, and oversized luxury cars. You can take every Subaru station wagon you can find. 16. You can give everyone healthcare if you can find any practicing doctors.. 17. We'll continue to believe healthcare is an earned luxury and not a right. 18. We'll keep "The Battle Hymn of the Republic" and "The National Anthem." 19. I'm sure you'll be happy to substitute "Imagine", "I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing", "Kum Ba Ya," or "We Are the World". 20. We'll practice trickledown economics and you can continue to give trickle up poverty your best shot. 21. Since it often so offends you, we'll keep our history, our name and our constitution and our flag. And you won't have to "Press 1 for English" when you call our country.</Msg><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1349613767465</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-07 08:42:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349614002236-21</Id><Topic><Title>Another Republican comes out</Title><Username>carolyne47</Username><Timestamp>1349600336899</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-07 04:58:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good morning Carolyne.

In 2009, after the underwear bomber’s Christmas Day plot was stopped, Obama called him an “isolated extremist.” That wasn’t true — he was sent on the mission by an al Qaeda affiliate, a fact interrogators knew before Obama spoke. In May 2010, when a Pakistani national tried to set off a car bomb in Times Square, Homeland Security chief Janet Napolitano claimed it was a “one-off,” a tale that police knew was false. Those deceptions were all part of a relentless public-relations campaign to make Obama look good. The death of a colleague does not deter their spin. But it should wake up the rest of us. The lack of integrity about something so fundamental as a terror attack suggests there is no line this White House will not cross to protect Obama. The choice to mislead the public dishonors the sacrifice of Stevens and those who died with him. But it does something else, too. It shows a willingness to put Obama’s reputation and re-election ahead of America’s national security. That’s a real emergency.</Msg><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1349617906178</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-07 09:51:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349617969440-39</Id><Topic><Title>MICHELE BACHMAN HEAD OF TEA PARTY RETARDS .

By: Myra Adams (Diary) | October 5th, 2012 at 10:11 AM Remember all those exaggerated Soviet Union grain harvest forecasts that were supposed to prove how well the Russian communist system of collective farming worked for the people? Well today in the USA after the news that the unemployment rate dropped in September to 7.8% down from 8.1% in August, our new national motto should be, “We are all communists now.” Jack Welsh, the former CEO of General Electric said in a tweet: “Obama Is Manipulating The Jobs Numbers Because His Debate Performance Was Awful.” Could this be true? Could our Beloved Leader have instructed his people to manipulate the unemployment rate so close to the election? Considering only 114,000 new non-farm jobs were added and yesterday there were credible estimates that the unemployment rate would actually rise to 8.2%, someone in the Labor Department has some explaining to do. So comrades, in the meantime, enjoy all the hoop-la from the “Pravda Press” over this new rate, with just enough rah-rah to overshadow Obama’s pathetic debate performance. Ironically 7.8% was the unemployment rate when President George W. Bush left office in January, 2009, the highest in his 8 years in office — the average being 5.3% over his two terms. Now that Bush’s highest unemployment rate is Obama’s lowest, can someone explain why this will be seen as such great news for Obama? I guess 7.8% is just part of President Obama’s “inheritance” from President Bush.</Msg><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1349618433554</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-07 10:00:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349618862604-45</Id><Topic><Title>Do you Believe the Magic Job Numbers?</Title><Username>eat_shit.pelosi</Username><Timestamp>1349594639232</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-07 03:23:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Lies, damn lies, and statistics.</Msg><Username>bejupete</Username><Timestamp>1349618862604</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-07 10:07:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349619171126-46</Id><Topic><Title>Does the New 7.8% Unemployment Rate Mean That We Now Live in Soviet Russia?</Title><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1349618433554</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-07 10:00:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Can OBAMA ride a horse like PUTIN?</Msg><Username>greenbacks98</Username><Timestamp>1349619171126</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-07 10:12:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349619337077-47</Id><Topic><Title>The Tea Party has 41 million memembers..that is 41 million votes Obama can't get...and this is a FACT!!!</Title><Username>milesed18</Username><Timestamp>1349575535608</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 22:05:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You think Hitler was a leftist?

The private jobs figure stood at 111 million in January 2009, the month Obama took office. And total nonfarm payrolls, including government workers, are down from 133.6 million workers at the beginning of 2009 to 133.2 million in July 2012. There's been a net loss of nearly 1 million public-sector jobs since Obama took office, despite a surge in temporary hiring for the 2010 census. Meanwhile, the jobs that have come back aren't the same ones that were lost. Are you better off? According to a study released last week by the liberal-leaning National Employment Law Project, low-wage fields such as retail sales and food service are adding jobs nearly three times as fast as higher-paid occupations. Conclusion: The figure of 4.5 million jobs is accurate if you look at the most favorable period and category for the administration. But overall, there are still fewer people working now than when Obama took office at the height of the recession. ***(My point is population has been growing and this report doesn't factor that in so its a net loss not a net gain when factoring in population growth, you need to learn basic math and stop the silly lies)</Msg><Username>stockking_profit</Username><Timestamp>1349624617790</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-07 11:43:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349624641554-69</Id><Topic><Title>Waaaaa!

The sudden drop of .3% in one month at such a critical election time moment just SCREAMS "FIX". With all the other trickery, lies and deceit that have occurred recently from Obama's staff, I, along with millions of other Americans, are deathly afraid of what this man and his minions are capable of doing if re-elected. Totally scary! In my opinion, it would be much better to have someone in the White House who can be trusted than a puppet, and his czars, who only makes sense when he reads messages prepared by political writers on a teleprompter.

However, he claimed he would not reduce taxes on the rich but would for middle class. Of course he would not reduce taxes for the rich, they are at historical lows. He never mentioned he would increase them or support the expiring tax cuts. I feel he holds on to the trickle down economics which has been a disaster. Simple logic tells you if you give a middle class person an extra $10,000, they would spend a portion of it, if not all. Give it to a multi-millionaire and it buys a bond on sits in CD, if it were even noticed. That is unproductive, trickle down economics for you.

How many trousers you got open? How many of your ids are currently signed in to yahoo at this moment? How many of those ids are you using to converse with yourself? How do you spell "loser""? How many times a day does dumpobamie lick the splurt off of your face? How much do you enjoy licking my crack?

The letter, handwritten in 1954, a year before Einstein's death, was addressed to philosopher Eric Gutkind. In it, Einstein discussed his views on religion, including calling "the Bible a collection of honorable but still primitive legends which are nevertheless pretty childish." An anonymous collector who bought the letter in 2008 is putting it on sale on online auction site eBay from Monday. The auction closes Oct. 18. Eric Gazin, a spokesman for the sale, said Sunday: "With the interest in Einstein, along with the questions this (letter) touches on, we feel it is well worth the price." ROTFLMAO What do you suppose his letter about how "God does not play dice with the universe" would fetch? It was written around the same time as the letter mentioned in this article. Do you think it would do better on "The 700 Club"?

The report showed a relatively modest 114,000 increase in US non-farm payrolls (NFP) in September, nearly matching the consensus forecast of 115,000 derived from a recent Bloomberg survey. What did jump out from the latest NFP report came from the household data, based on a survey of about 60,000 US households. The official US employment rate, which had been lingering between 8.1 to 8.3 percent over the prior eight months (highlighted in yellow on the graph below), fell to 7.8 percent in September. A large portion of the previous drop in the unemployment rate from its October 2009 peak of 10 percent can be attributed to a surge in Americans no longer counted as unemployed after they stopped looking for a job. Last month, however, it was big jump in the number of job holders [derived from the household survey] that drove the jobless rate below 8 percent for the first time since January 2009. Most of that 873,000 increase came from people who settled for part-time work. In this video, Art Cashin at UBS offers one theory behind the increase: “It may be that Christmas hiring has started already.” Zero Hedge proposes a darker explanation here.

Only that he is in the game to play... at this time. He was out of it before the debate. But mind you, the Obama base is solid and the independents like me are who matter in this election. Romney can't go too far with flip-flopping and his days are counted. The old GOP tactic of lying to the uninformed to win elections is OVER! I know it because I myself fell for that several times... only after the fact to discover what a despicable ideology and strategy the GOP has! The times and the tide are against liars and pretenders... and that certainly is the GOP in this case!</Msg><Username>johnmjay</Username><Timestamp>1349662745643</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-07 22:19:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349662805720-249</Id><Title>Do you think fdr fdr fdr fdr might be one of SW's rectal drip aliases?</Title><Msg>Well then you are RIGHT!</Msg><Username>dumpobamle</Username><Timestamp>1349662805720</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-07 22:20:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349662808988-250</Id><Topic><Title>Vote white Mormon!</Title><Username>barackalinski</Username><Timestamp>1349662105328</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-07 22:08:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>OBAMUNIST BIGOTS are against The white Mormon!</Msg><Username>barackalinski</Username><Timestamp>1349662808988</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-07 22:20:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349662837831-251</Id><Topic><Title>Our Ambassador to Lybia is murdered while Obama is busy campaigning!</Title><Username>dumpobamie</Username><Timestamp>1349660578951</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-07 21:42:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Of course he is.
