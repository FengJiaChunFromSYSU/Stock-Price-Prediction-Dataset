He has been there when the tornadoes, hurricanes, fires shootings, droughts, explosions indiscriminately hit any state. Hardly any politics has been played and it is amazing that the people are helped and could be helped much more if all this political grandstanding was not taking place. The entire country needs help from time to time and if you notice how grateful Christi was when Sandy hit and and how grateful the Republican Governor, senators and congressmen are. Less bashing the president and working with him would be better.

Not to benefit Al Gore. The world is not in some sort of conspiracy to make Al Gore wealthy. The carbon tax idea is a vehicle to reduce carbon emissions and allow them where they are still necessary (like Grilling a good steak). The starkdirt mimics claim was that global warming is not a problem and wants to ignore it with his head in the sand. Most of the world likes to ignore it because reducing carbon emissions is inconvienient and requires changes in so many things we do. Not changes particularly in what we do but how we do them, like using gas instead of wood or coal, or electric cars or composting your yard trimmings instead of burning them. Not so long ago recycling was nothing but a concept. Now it is almost a necessity. We made changes there and we eventually will with carbon and no one is going to feel any more put out about it than those that feel upset that they can't throw their litter out of their car window as they drive down the road.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1369267320165</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 20:02:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369267768299-177</Id><Topic><Title>I want to open a tax-free corp that pledges to work to overthrow the IRS</Title><Username>golden_ghandi</Username><Timestamp>1369251958344</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 15:45:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Killing fetus with a rusty coat hanger is how it was done before Roe Wade. If you want to repeal Roe Wade that is what you go back to. Back room abortions in unsanitary conditions and more injury to women who elect not to carry a child to term. Abortions have been around since long before any present day western religion and are not going to cease because some religious zealots want to control womens' reproduction. Yes liberals will tolerate a safe, well executed abortion over the "rusty coat hangers" of the past.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1369267768299</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 20:09:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369267799080-178</Id><Topic><Title>600% in profit this MONTH!!!</Title><Username>stockmr</Username><Timestamp>1368345047603</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-12 03:50:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>i signed up with them.</Msg><Username>bgates354</Username><Timestamp>1369267799080</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 20:09:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369267985489-179</Id><Topic><Title>MONSTER monster profits MONTLY</Title><Username>stockmr</Username><Timestamp>1368250017950</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-11 01:26:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>i signed up with them.</Msg><Username>bgates354</Username><Timestamp>1369267985489</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 20:13:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369267998036-180</Id><Topic><Title>OBAMA HAS BROUGH THIRD WORLD LEADERSHIP TO AMERICA</Title><Username>purebred_red</Username><Timestamp>1369255294642</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 16:41:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I suppose you might be able to blame the tea party on him but I'd give the credit to the Koch brothers.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1369267998036</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 20:13:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369268155325-181</Id><Topic><Title>IRS Official Lois Lerner to Plead The Fifth</Title><Username>starkdirt</Username><Timestamp>1369232154335</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 10:15:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How dumb are you?

You're right - the rusty coat hanger is a stand by nowadays. Kermit Gosnell essentially used a pair of scissors that he inserted into a slit in the back of the baby's neck and then severed the spinal cord, leaving the child to die in agony. But then, that's not really much different than pulling the limbs apart and reassembling them on the table outside the womb so one can be sure one has gotten "all the pieces". I guess that's what you mean by "well executed". More than 1,000 black babies are treated this way each and every day. It's informative to know that the diseased liberal mind condones and applauds this.</Msg><Username>obamalipsync</Username><Timestamp>1369269320272</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 20:35:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369269772634-187</Id><Topic><Title>OBAMA HAS BROUGH THIRD WORLD LEADERSHIP TO AMERICA</Title><Username>purebred_red</Username><Timestamp>1369255294642</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 16:41:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Please, Reggie.

The BEARISH DARK CLOUD COVER pattern finally received a confirmation because the prices crossed the confirmation level which was at 13.4400, and our valid average selling price stands now at 13.4250. The previous BUY recommendation was issued on 5/6/2013, 16 days ago, when the stock price was 12.4050. Since then BAC has risen by +8.22%. Market Outlook The market ran out of steam and the traders are now more in agreement about the bearishness. The evidence is strong enough to prompt the closing of long positions. The bearish pattern that was previously identified is finally confirmed and a SELL signal is generated. You still have time to follow the signal and then you may start checking other securities for a bullish bet.</Msg><Username>aeparnell</Username><Timestamp>1369275305340</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 22:15:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369275655420-216</Id><Topic><Title>gee irs offical ( reg democrap) takes the 5th, afer making statement</Title><Username>zevoter01</Username><Timestamp>1369274218525</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 21:56:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>pleading the 5th is a right for sure.
