A decade and a half ago, both of us served on President Clinton's Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform, the forerunner to President Obama's recent National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform. In 1994 we predicted that, unless something was done to control runaway entitlement spending, Medicare and Social Security would eventually go bankrupt or confront severe benefit cuts. Eighteen years later, nothing has been done. Why? The usual reason is that entitlement reform is the third rail of American politics. That explanation presupposes voter demand for entitlements at any cost, even if it means bankrupting the nation. A better explanation is that the full extent of the problem has remained hidden from policy makers and the public because of less than transparent government financial statements. How else could responsible officials claim that Medicare and Social Security have the resources they need to fulfill their commitments for years to come? As Washington wrestles with the roughly $600 billion "fiscal cliff" and the 2013 budget, the far greater fiscal challenge of the U.S. government's unfunded pension and health-care liabilitBuies remains offstage. The truly important figures would appear on the federal balance sheet—if the government prepared an accurate one. But it hasn't. For years, the government has gotten by without having to produce the kind of financial statements that are required of most significant for-profit and nonprofit enterprises. The U.S. Treasury "balance sheet" does list liabilities such as Treasury debt issued to the public, federal employee pensions, and post-retirement health benefits. But it does not include the unfunded liabilities of Medicare, Social Security and other outsized and very real obligations. As a result, fiscal policy discussions generally focus on current-year budget deficits, the accumulated national debt, and the relationships between these two items and gross domestic product. We most often hear about the alarming $15.96 trillion national debt (more than 100% of GDP), and the 2012 budget deficit of $1.1 trillion (6.97% of GDP). As dangerous as those numbers are, they do not begin to tell the story of the federal government's true liabilities. The actual liabilities of the federal government—including Social Security, Medicare, and federal employees' future retirement benefits—already exceed $86.8 trillion, or 550% of GDP. For the year ending Dec. 31, 2011, the annual accrued expense of Medicare and Social Security was $7 trillion. Nothing like that figure is used in calculating the deficit. In reality, the reported budget deficit is less than one-fifth of the more accurate figure. Why haven't Americans heard about the titanic $86.8 trillion liability from these programs? One reason: The actual figures do not appear in black and white on any balance sheet. But it is possible to discover them. Included in the annual Medicare Trustees' report are separate actuarial estimates of the unfunded liability for Medicare Part A (the hospital portion), Part B (medical insurance) and Part D (prescription drug coverage). As of the most recent Trustees' report in April, the net present value of the unfunded liability of Medicare was $42.8 trillion. The comparable balance sheet liability for Social Security is $20.5 trillion. Were American policy makers to have the benefit of transparent financial statements prepared the way public companies must report their pension liabilities, they would see clearly the magnitude of the future borrowing that these liabilities imply. Borrowing on this scale could eclipse the capacity of global capital markets—and bankrupt not only the programs themselves but the entire federal government. These real-world impacts will be felt when currently unfunded liabilities need to be paid. In theory, the Medicare and Social Security trust funds have at least some money to pay a portion of the bills that are coming due. In actuality, the cupboard is bare: 100% of the payroll taxes for these programs were spent in the same year they were collected. In exchange for the payroll taxes that aren't paid out in benefits to current retirees in any given year, the trust funds got nonmarketable Treasury debt. Now, as the baby boomers' promised benefits swamp the payroll-tax collections from today's workers, the government has to swap the trust funds' nonmarketable securities for marketable Treasury debt. The Treasury will then have to sell not only this debt, but far more, in order to pay the benefits as they come due. When combined with funding the general cash deficits, these multitrillion-dollar Treasury operations will dominate the capital markets in the years ahead, particularly given China's de-emphasis of new investment in U.S. Treasurys in favor of increasing foreign direct investment, and Japan's and Europe's own sovereign-debt challenges. When the accrued expenses of the government's entitlement programs are counted, it becomes clear that to collect enough tax revenue just to avoid going deeper into debt would require over $8 trillion in tax collections annually. That is the total of the average annual accrued liabilities of just the two largest entitlement programs, plus the annual cash deficit. Nothing like that $8 trillion amount is available for the IRS to target. According to the most recent tax data, all individuals filing tax returns in America and earning more than $66,193 per year have a total adjusted gross income of $5.1 trillion. In 2006, when corporate taxable income peaked before the recession, all corporations in the U.S. had total income for tax purposes of $1.6 trillion. That comes to $6.7 trillion available to tax from these individuals and corporations under existing tax laws. In short, if the government confiscated the entire adjusted gross income of these American taxpayers, plus all of the corporate taxable income in the year before the recession, it wouldn't be nearly enough to fund the over $8 trillion per year in the growth of U.S. liabilities. Some public officials and pundits claim we can dig our way out through tax increases on upper-income earners, or even all taxpayers. In reality, that would amount to bailing out the Pacific Ocean with a teaspoon. Only by addressing these unsustainable spending commitments can the nation's debt and deficit problems be solved. Neither the public nor policy makers will be able to fully understand and deal with these issues unless the government publishes financial statements that present the government's largest financial liabilities in accordance with well-established norms in the private sector. When the new Congress convenes in January, making the numbers clear—and establishing policies that finally address them before it is too late—should be a top order of business.</Msg><Username>rhinoinchgo</Username><Timestamp>1354030825722</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 10:40:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354030889592-81</Id><Topic><Title>OBAMA YOU F/ING IDIOT!

If a judge sees this as it is, he or she will no doubt rule in favor of the defendant;...BAC, Wells Fargo, etc. Remember, C/W deal specifically EXCLUDED BAC from any and ALL liabilities incurred prior to the acquisition.</Msg><Username>dfaduke</Username><Timestamp>1354033733474</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 11:28:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354033969319-115</Id><Topic><Title>i'm asking the obama suporters on this board</Title><Username>victory_val_2007</Username><Timestamp>1354033084816</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 11:18:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You lying neo-nazi fools only want to believe the lies you suck up from Fox.

Is the overhang of the 10 dollar BAC offering that much stronger than the 15 dollar offering?</Title><Msg>Or is it simply that the poor little retail guys mainly got "shafted" into buying the 15 dollar BAC offering while the extremely powerful hedge fund style shops bought the 10 dollar offering and have all the bazooka power to keep BAC from staying comfortably above the 10 dollar share price level? An inquiring mind wants to know the answer to that conundrum. I think it is a quite difficult and complicated question since I am one of those "dumb", not politically connected, out of the loop, abused, small retail "stock investors" that has so far wasted a bunch of my expendable funds on Bank of America equity instruments. I take some solace in Warren Buffett liking BAC enough to get stock warrants. I would get out of you bashers' hair if Mr. Buffett could get a double on his BAC warrants in the next few weeks.

Many inherited the money and are using it overseas.</Msg><Username>m.swanger</Username><Timestamp>1354048411790</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 15:33:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354048509596-185</Id><Topic><Title>At 14:21 who flipped on the BEAR RAID on BAC algo program?</Title><Username>bluesky_there_to_here</Username><Timestamp>1354045428700</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 14:43:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yep, it's the start of a good short.

"McCain followed his father and grandfather, both four-star admirals, into the United States Navy, graduating from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1958. He became a naval aviator, flying ground-attack aircraft from aircraft carriers. During the Vietnam War, he was almost killed in the 1967 USS Forrestal fire. In October 1967, while on a bombing mission over Hanoi, he was shot down, seriously injured, and captured by the North Vietnamese. He was a prisoner of war until 1973. McCain experienced episodes of torture, and refused an out-of-sequence early repatriation offer. His war wounds left him with lifelong physical limitations."</Msg><Username>mike_van_der_slut_irvin19</Username><Timestamp>1354055683151</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 17:34:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354055851231-214</Id><Topic><Title>John McCain lost the election in 2008 and is not aware he did.

I know John McCain's history. There are things you do and things you don't. Some fought and some did not and some like Romney, his sons, George W ran away from it. Furthermore many of us were not there to fight the civil wars, the World wars the Boer wars, the Vietnam Wars. Obama was not available to fight a war. Still he is the Commander in Chief and John McCain ain't.

I form a gut feeling before i go forward. Well if you are like me, I wouldn't put my faith in BAC. Been a BAC customer 45 years, they gave me my 1st RE loan back when they were pressured to loan to Vietnam vets. In the early 70's. I am compelled to share their incompetence with you so you can evaluate form a different perspective, a BAC customers experience. I've been a loyal BAC customer for over 40 years. I recently applied to refinance my home, that I built 25 years ago, to pull some cash to pay off maturing auto lease option to buy. credit 815 fico, never a day late on any obligation. BofA loan representative informed me that I qualified, no issues, competitive rate, etc. 3 months later BAC loan processor calls and informs me that the loan representative submitted my loan under a wrong program and couldn't honor the amount requested. She advised that I start the process from scratch, hence losing 90 days and most likely having to pay another appraisal fee as mine will no longer be valid to make it through the new loan process, as well as losing my rate lock. My lease option expires Dec 5th. frustrated to say the lease. Really I have only myself to blame, because after the fact I researched BOfA Mortgage reviews, they were horrendous! BofA it appears has scorched many a good customer. I know I would be interested in this information if I were a BAC investor. Good luck.</Msg><Username>A Yahoo!

All I know is that one of first things that hit me like a ton of bricks after Ms. Schapiro became the head of the SEC is her being shown on media outlets recorded as saying she didn't want to have short squeezes happening. If she has decided to call it a job and is now retiring from the SEC, then the shorts have to beg for Ms. Elisse Walter to have just as staunch an aversion to the short squeeze. Otherwise, something like BAC could very easily get back to 15 and beyond very rapidly on a short squeeze if one sees the multicent uptick rule brought back. Since most people thought the Great Depression was coming back back in 2008, I was very surprised that the current solution for massive shorting was not the same as the solution back then... the multicent one eighth uptick rule being brought in as it was in 1934 with that Act. We need that rule to protect individual stocks from bear raids and from prop ups by superior shorters solely making a higher point to short the stock down from. Those are the most dangerous shorters to the psychology of the market because they are determining the top of the stock and most of the hedge funds do PIGGY BACK on the big dog's moves. Long investors for 70 years have only had the chance of a SHORT SQUEEZE happening to have a hope of recovering their lost capital in a stock that has lost its usual customary share price. Take that hope away by having upticks be ten thousandths of a dollar as what happened in the year 2000 and beyond and you have people that leave the stock market never to return because of lost HOPE!!!!!! Shorts have to have longs to parasitize. It is not the other way around. Stock can be sold to investors to fund growth of a company. A company should not short its own shares to fund its own growth, as that would be financial stock market suicide. SHORTS ARE RULING THIS MARKET AND WOULD HAVE HAD US DOWN IN THE DIRT IF IT WERE NOT FOR QUANTITATIVE EASING. You know you have heard it a million times with respect to the stock market...."DON'T FIGHT THE FED". If it weren't doing what it is doing, I shudder to think how low the market would have gone without the multicent uptick rule. It's like Obi Wan Kenobi, you're our only hope. Obi Wan is Ben Bernanke. Shame is that Ben Bernanke may have not needed to expand the balance sheet anywhere near as large as it has been expanded if there had been a multicent uptick rule implemented for financial stocks back when Senator Kauffmann was pushing for it before he didn't run for reelection. Not anywhere near the burden it has become. Not anywhere near.

A Naked Shorting Primer for CEOs.Cale Smith, Senior Associate Hawk Associates, Inc. The drama surrounding naked shorting has all the elements of a John Grisham novel. Sly, blue blood institutions conspire with shadowy hedge fund cowboys to unmercifully assault a well-meaning but outgunned CEO in his quest for shareholder value. Offshore accounts and corrupt foreign officials veil the crimes for decades, until finally being thrust into the open through the hyper-caffeinated efforts of hundreds of message board denizens throughout cyberspace. As with most Grisham novels, however, liberties may have to be taken with the original story to romanticize an otherwise bland topic. After all, it’s hard to make CUSIP numbers and stock certificates sound sexy, but that’s really the heart of the naked shorting controversy. Due largely to concerns raised by microcap CEOs and their shareholders, naked shorting is a hot topic on message boards. Opinions range widely on how common it is. Those claiming it pervades the markets and foreshadows a systemic meltdown are met with equally fervent arguments calling it an over-hyped, isolated problem that is becoming the grassy knoll conspiracy theory of Wall Street. Everyone agrees, however, that risks of naked shorting are heightened in the microcap world. The sheer number of small public companies, combined with high volatility and an almost inevitable need for financing, make detecting this hard-to-prove crime that much more difficult for the microcap CEO. Although the odds seem small that a particular company will be victimized, there is no authoritative data indicating how many microcaps are being naked shorted. Keeping those odds in perspective, then, this primer is for microcap CEOs curious about the naked shorting fuss. On the off chance that a company attracts naked shorts, CEOs should recognize that there is despairingly little that can be done to stop it from occurring. Due to the nature of the crime, legal expertise may not help. Although there seem to be few bulletproof ways to stop naked shorts, there are a handful of things a proactive CEO can do to reduce the odds of being blindsided by this notorious lot. This primer includes a rough sketch of how naked shorting works and a brief familiarization with the main players. A worst-case scenario of what it means to be targeted by naked shorts is presented, as are suggestions for wary CEOs. The final section contains a list of links with more about the intriguing world of naked shorting. WHAT IS NAKED SHORTING, AND WHY SHOULD A CEO CARE? In its simplest terms, naked shorting involves selling shares of stock that don’t exist. It’s performed routinely by market-makers to keep an orderly market, but it is illegal when done to manipulate a company’s stock price. Only when someone intends to drive down the stock price is naked shorting breaking the law. Throughout the rest of this overview, any reference to naked shorting will refer to the illegal variety. It’s also worth noting the important distinction between shorting and naked shorting. The former is perfectly legal and occurs extensively as either a way for an investor to mitigate risk or as a bet that a company’s share price will decrease (i.e. the short-seller or “short” believes the company is overvalued). Despite the wary glances often cast upon them, shorts are an essential part of a robust market and are often the first to discover financial fraud, as in the case of Enron. A short will sell borrowed shares as a bet against a company because he believes the price will eventually drop. These borrowed shares come from his broker, which loans the short a certain number of shares (not dollars). As soon as the short receives the borrowed shares in his account, he sells them immediately for cash, which goes to his brokerage account. The short still has that pesky loan to pay back, though, and does so by waiting for the price of the stock to drop. Then he buys some cheaper shares using money from the same pool of cash he received after the original sale, gives the broker his shares back, and keeps whatever cash is left in his account. Naked shorts, in contrast, are much more manipulative – they sell short shares that don’t exist and then attempt to actively lower the company’s share price through constant short-selling pressure. By using pretend shares, of which there is an unlimited supply, naked shorts can effectively control the share price through this constant pressure, eventually driving the price of a company’s shares into the basement. Where do these fake shares come from? Naked shorts can create them out of thin air, depending on your point of view, due to either (a) glaring inefficiencies in the back-office world of certificate transfers, or (b) institutionalized fraud on a massive scale. Either way, the effects can be disastrous for companies who are victimized. WHO IS INVOLVED? Naked shorting is typically done by hedge funds with arm’s length support from several other parties. The extent of active assistance provided to the fund by these related groups is unclear but hotly debated. One player is the Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corp. (DTCC), which tracks the stock certificates of traded shares between brokerages. When a fund sells short a share of stock, the fund’s brokerage (another prominent player) has a settlement period of three days to deliver those shares to the buyer’s broker. If the transfer doesn’t occur, the DTCC notifies the fund’s broker that it has “FTD’d” (Failed to Deliver). The DTCC is required by the SEC to enforce delivery of missing shares. While waiting to account for shares, the DTCC may charge the brokerage to borrow similar shares from its own inventory. The obvious conflict of interest here is that DTCC is policing its own customers - the brokerages. In response to complaints, the SEC required all exchanges to comply with Regulation SHO in January of 2005. Reg SHO establishes several requirements aimed at broker-dealers, but it does not specifically address the manipulative aspects of naked shorting, which fall under existing securities law. Regulation SHO specifically requires the major exchanges to provide a daily list of Threshold Securities, defined as those that (1) have an aggregate fail to deliver position of over 10,000 shares (2) equal to 0.5% of the issuer’s total shares outstanding for (3) greater than five days. Reg SHO also requires a broker-dealer to close out any “open fail” position once it has been included on an exchange’s Threshold Security list for 13 consecutive days. The ironic effect of this policy, as noted by its detractors, is that it effectively requires shorts to cover (buy back shares) after they’ve had two weeks to drive the price down - meaning they profit from the trade. Needless to say, the effectiveness of such a regulation is often called into question among the cyberspace crowd. Links to the Threshold Security list for each primary exchange are included at the conclusion of this article. It’s important to remember that seeing a company included on the Threshold Securities list does not mean that company is being naked shorted nor that its share price is artificially depressed. It means shares in that company are failing to deliver on time for what may be legitimate reasons, including simple human error. Even shares bought long could FTD and show up on the Threshold list. A daily presence on the Threshold list for more than 13 days at a time, however, might signal the need for deeper digging. HOW DOES NAKED SHORTING ACTUALLY WORK? Based on the accounts of CEOs who believe they have been the target of naked shorts, here is how the worst-case scenario might play out using an ill-intentioned hedge fund (“Fund Malicious”) as an example. Fund Malicious first identifies a target in the microcap world for naked shorting, most likely an obscure company in the development stage or having otherwise questionable fundamentals. The hedge fund gets that firm listed on a foreign exchange in, say, Berlin, via a request funneled through a complicit broker or official in that country. Malicious then sells short shares it doesn’t have (naked shorts them), waits three days for the DTCC to call and ask for the shares, and then replies either, “I borrowed them on the Berlin exchange, and they’ll take some time to get here,” or “I’m a market-maker for that company’s shares in Berlin and naked shorting rules don’t apply there.” The DTCC then loans the fund shares from its inventory and charges the broker a fee until the stock loan is repaid. Malicious, in the meantime, continues to drive the price of the target’s shares down as long and as aggressively as possible. In the event the fund does cover to pay off the stock loan, it doesn’t take much effort to begin the naked shorting cycle again. Other theories exist as to how the hedge fund might skirt additional rules. To prevent “piling on,” exchange rules mandate that a stock cannot be shorted on a downtick or decrease in stock price. In other words, Malicious must wait for the stock price to increase briefly before shorting the company. Rather than wait passively for an uptick, though, Fund Malicious can create an uptick in the stock itself by purchasing a few shares through a small offshore account. The hedge fund is then free to short (or naked short) the company with both barrels at home. Malicious may get additional leverage out of the original naked short by choosing to target an ugly, obscure microcap company. By driving the price down, the fund hopes to scare existing shareholders into selling their shares, too, out of fear that something is going on that they don’t know about (i.e. the fund can “paint the tape”). This, of course, drives the price even lower while further obscuring the role of Fund Malicious. There is plenty of room for additional mischief in the above scenario. According to the most vocal critics of naked shorting, funds like Malicious have relationships with reporters and/or message board regulars who are compensated to distribute negative news about the company in order to exaggerate the selling. There is also plenty of irony possible, in that a CEO can be her shareholders’ worst enemy by merely uttering the words “naked shorting.” Investors may panic, the stock might dive further and legitimate short-sellers could begin to circle. KEEPING THINGS IN PERSPECTIVE Given the mysterious nature of hedge funds and the convoluted nature of this crime, it’s easy to get carried away with paranoid scenarios regarding naked shorting. The skeptics, however, have some unanswered questions of their own. For instance: • What’s in it for the brokerages? Are they supposed to take all the risk just to get a few more commissions or under-the-table money? Since when have they been that desperate? • Has anyone ever been found guilty of naked shorting? • Where is the proof? Are there other pieces of evidence that would suggest a crime is being committed? • Why aren’t more companies making noise about it? Where are the whistleblowers? • Wouldn’t the unintentional buyers of naked-shorted shares voice their concerns when they did not receive proxy votes? • Why is there no outrage from legitimate funds and brokerages? • How much regulatory burden should the SEC and other publicly traded companies have to bear to resolve the questionable problems of a few companies? Both camps raise legitimate issues that simply cannot be addressed definitively yet. Reg SHO is not the deterrent the problem seems to demand. There have been numerous calls on the SEC to increase the scope of data provided in the daily Threshold Securities lists, which may help better gauge the seriousness of this problem. Until those issues are resolved, the SEC continues to consider the surveillance and enforcement of trading activity as the primary responsibility of the markets and exchanges. The DTCC considers its role to be reporting the FTDs. Brokerages are doing all they can to win commissions from hedge funds. Detection is difficult, accusations are nearly impossible to prove, and nobody has figured out a foolproof way to stop this crime. So what’s all that mean for the microcap CEO? When it comes to naked shorting, you are your own best watchdog. WHAT TO DO IF YOU THINK YOU MAY BE TARGETED Above all else, be discrete with your public accusations. A well-intentioned CEO can fulfill his own prophecy by going public with accusations of naked shorting. Investors may flee the stock, further lowering the share price. Meanwhile, other funds may hover, waiting for an uptick to begin shorting your company themselves. Watch your trading volume. If you’re seeing four or five times your company’s float trade hands in an otherwise ordinary day, and you have no large share overhangs, pay attention. Start documenting those patterns. Keep your focus on operations. Your stock price is not declining exclusively due to naked shorting. Weakness in the business, industry, model, communications or management team exists well before naked shorting begins and allows it to continue. In most cases, the best deterrent for shorts of any kind is consistent execution and credible communications with your shareholders. Always surprise on the upside. By maintaining absolute secrecy before good news, you give yourself the best chance to catch the shorts off guard and maybe even squeeze them. Be conscious of unintended signals you may send when in public appearances, conference calls and analyst meetings before a particularly good quarter or other surprising good news. Keep your cards close to your chest and save those glowing press releases for the middle of the trading day. Maintain a steady stream of news. By communicating with your investors as often as possible, you remove some of the mystery surrounding a company that a naked shorter typically targets. In the absence of any company news, a continuously dropping stock price is the only communication your investors are hearing. Sales of stock by legitimate owners are sure to follow. Put floors on your convertibles. A floorless convertible bond (also known as a “convertible death spiral”) is an open invitation for its owners to short the stock as aggressively as possible. A constant decline in share price means the convertible owners will get more shares because the initial rate of conversion will change. While the original shareholders may very well lose their entire stake in the company, the convertible owners can continue to short the stock until they can effectively cover the original short with new shares created by a new rate. Should those convertibles be held offshore where naked shorting is not illegal, the potential for price depression becomes even greater. Ensuring you have a floor on those converts will prevent the worst case scenario. Monitor small international exchanges. If your firm unexpectedly turns up on the Berlin-Bremen stock exchange and you, the CEO, did not request a listing there, that might be a sign of a problem. Request the removal of your company from that exchange immediately, and keep asking until it’s done. Realize your choice of financing vehicle may attract naked shorting interest. In addition to floorless convertibles, PIPEs may also attract undue attention from potential funders. Since shares in a PIPE are sold for below market price, the provider could short the stock down to that level with no risk of capital loss on his part. When issuing warrants with the deal, you’re also effectively pushing the price lower through increased dilution of existing shareholders. While it’s true that sometimes beggars can’t be choosers when it comes to raising funds, go into those negotiations with your eyes wide open. Check the Threshold Security lists. Links to the lists at each exchange are below. Keep in mind that inclusion on that list does not mean naked shorting or any other improper activity is occurring, just that some shares meet the three requirements mentioned above. An extended presence on the Threshold list, however, in combination with other signals may be an important sign. Don’t read the message boards. You’ll drive yourself nuts, waste a ton of time and eventually convince yourself you’re a victim of someone’s ill wishes, naked shorts or otherwise. If you’re that compelled to monitor the boards, ask your IR team to send you weekly summaries of any cogent posts. Know your IR company. Consider your choice of an investor relations firm as your first line of defense. Does the company have expertise in dealing with naked shorting? Does the price of your stock mysteriously rise or fall between the time you send your draft press releases and when they hit the wires? Do they have long-term clients willing to vouch for their integrity? And do they have processes in place to handle sensitive information? Know your transfer agent. Given that the process of naked shorting begins at the brokerage level, there’s not much your company’s transfer agent can do with regards to those shares. The responsibility for tracking them lies with the brokerage. It is theoretically possible, however, for a corrupt transfer agent to conceal the true float and otherwise manipulate the shares themselves. Both your transfer agent and IR firm should be able to advise you on the effectiveness of combating naked shorts by changing CUSIP numbers, reverse mergers, and/or reverse splits. Although the long-term effectiveness of these strategies is questionable, it may be useful as part of a larger strategy to deter naked shorting. After changing your company’s CUSIP number, for instance, all existing stock certificates must be exchanged for new ones. All issued and outstanding certificates from old shares will no longer represent an interest in the company until exchanged. This may be more trouble than it’s worth, however. Once the new shares are in circulation, there’s nothing to stop a new round of naked shorting by determined parties. Such tactics may represent a small part of an overall strategy to reduce naked shorting interest in your company. What do you think of this strategy Brain Moynihan?
