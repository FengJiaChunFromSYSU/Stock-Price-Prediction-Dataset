You dumb #$%$ do some research. America is all about small business. Read first what is an S corporation and you will understand what Republicans are talking about. Anyhow in any country taxes should be collected from all people making $1 to those making $1b all pays flat15% this will take away all arguments on tax codes and loop holes Here is another example of what democrats or Obama loves on tax policy they want capital gain tax to go to your income tax level and look at the example and you will understand Intel as corporation earns 1 dollar which it pays 29% tax on it ( highest in the world ) now that profit comes to you as a share holder which means you will get 61 cents and these dumb #$%$es wants anywhere from 33% to 50% depending on your tax bracket so another 25 to 30 cents gone what do you have in your hand 30 cents.

Buying lower than the rest of the bagholders gave you the feeling of having an edge except your decision is decaying too. (B) Affirm to everyone how smart you are for owning a loss that's really a jackpot in disguise. (C) Kick the dog a little harder but only when no one is looking so that beating your wife later is less abusive. (D) Ignore all the warning signs since they are wrong and you are right. (E) Hold hands with your fellow subjects and sing Kumbaya since safety in numbers singles out more than just yourself. The more the better. (F) Take a course in Lower Bollinger Bands and general chart reads but basic fundamentals always prevail. Charts are 2nd line of defense when fundies fail. Just watch a little TV, you'll see what I mean. (G) Ignore anyone that tells you everything is fine when it isn't and don't give them the pleasure of an argument. (H) Always think for yourself and not how others brainwash you to think forcing you to feel ignorant when you're not. (I) Find other ways to grow your hard earned cash besides the stock market. (J) Since you want stock market revenge, you are determined to average down your way out and stick it to the big guy except your avg downs go down too. There is no rule you have to avg on the same stock issue now that you're hooked and addicted heck bent on getting out how you got in. (K) When hubby or wifey comes home from work and asks if you made back the money they gave to you to keep yourself occupied, look up and to the left and extend the lie you tell them every evening. Don't worry, they know &amp; they are learning much about their partner. (L) Let your emotions step in sometimes. Notice what ignoring them got you? Everyone has emotions. Some call it sentiment. (M) Keep a stiff upper lip. It's only money... probably your future and that of your children’s and your spouse, but you only live once. Might as well gamble it. Botox treatments getting cheaper. (N) Invest more money in high paying dividends. At this astonishing rate of .01c you only need $72,000 to make $100. You need more return than $100? Simple, just shovel more in. You have an endless supply just like the big boys don't you? (O) Go to freeway off ramp. Hold sign that says 'BofA investor'. Find one with nice cars and happy faces. (P) Arrange to speak with a man of the cloth. Ask if he can provide devine intervetion since you're pretty handy with a rosary. (Q) Keep telling yourself you're in it for the long run but keep peeking at the stock price every hour on the hour. (R) Petition that you want your money back &amp; try to find someone to give the papers to. (S) Do nothing and simply fuggetaboutit. (T) Learn from your mistakes. (U) Encourage others to buy the same mistake you did. With 11 billion shares, finding someone to buy at the rate of 1 per second will only take 372 years. (V) Cut back on the frivolous things in life like gas, electricity, eating and shelter so you can continue playing in the stock market just like the experts. (W) Cuss out your keyboard for making it so easy to just press enter and lose as soon as you join while somebody else is taking that money before your very eyes. (X) Visit as many websites as possible and pay strict attention to the TV for this is the extent of dilligence in this day and age... until reality steps in. (Y) Y? That's a good question. Ask yourself 'why' over and over every day. Adding 'me' helps beat yourself up a little more if you like a swift beating. Make sure the neighbors hear because the the cubicle next door is laughing too hard to stop you. (Z) Add up all the positives and then subtract all the negatives and see what you have. When bagholders scream "ALL the bad is known and out now, load up!", use extreme caution because a stinker doesn't smell any better just because everyone announced who cut the cheese. Shucks.... ran out of alphabet.

Released today, the transcript school indicates that Obama, under the name Barry Soetoro, received financial aid as a foreign student from Indonesia as an undergraduate. The transcript was released by Occidental College in compliance with a court order in a suit brought by the group in the Superior Court of California. The transcript shows that Obama (Soetoro) applied for financial aid and was awarded a fellowship for foreign students from the Fulbright Foundation Scholarship program.

Donofrio's case is just one of 18 suits brought by citizens demanding proof of Obama's citizenship or qualification to serve as president. Gary Kreep of the United States Justice Foundation has released the results of their investigation of Obama's campaign spending.

While I've little interest in getting in the middle of the Obama birth issue, Paul Hollrah over at FSM did so yesterday and believes the issue can be resolved by Obama answering one simple question: What passport did he use when he was shuttling between New York , Jakarta , and Karachi ? So how did a young man who arrived in New York in early June 1981, without the price of a hotel room in his pocket, suddenly come up with the price of a round-the-world trip just a month later?And once he was on a plane, shuttling between New York, Jakarta, and Karachi, what passport was he offering when he passed through Customs and Immigration? The American people not only deserve to have answers to these questions, they must have answers. It makes the debate over Obama's citizenship a rather short and simple one. Q: Did he travel to Pakistan in 1981, at age 20? A : Yes, by his own admission. Q: What passport did he travel under? A: There are only three possibilities. 1) He traveled with a U.S. ... Passport, 2) He traveled with a British passport, or 3) He traveled with an Indonesia passport. Q: Is it possible that Obama traveled with a U.S. Passport in 1981? A: No. It is not possible. Pakistan was on the U.S. .. State Department's "no travel" list in 1981.Conclusion: When Obama went to Pakistan in 1981 he was traveling either with a British passport or an Indonesian passport.If he were traveling with a British passport that would provide proof that he was born in Kenya on August 4, 1961, not in Hawaii as he claims. In a move certain to fuel the debate over Obama's qualifications for the presidency, the group "Americans for Freedom of Information" has Released copies of President Obama's college transcripts from Occidental College ... Released today, the transcript school indicates that Obama, under the name Barry Soetoro, received financial aid as a foreign student from Indonesia as an undergraduate. The transcript was released by Occidental College in compliance with a court order in a suit brought by the group in the Superior Court of California. The transcript shows that Obama (Soetoro) applied for financial aid and was awarded a fellowship for foreign students from the Fulbright Foundation Scholarship program. To qualify, for the scholarship, a student must claim foreign citizenship. This document would seem to provide the smoking gun that many of Obama's detractors have been seeking.

This is largely unchanged from earlier in July and consistent with polling over the course of this year. Across eight Pew Research Center surveys since January, Obama has led Romney by between four and 12 percentage points. Obama holds only a four-point edge (48% to 44%) across 12 of this year’s key battleground states. While the data does not allow a state-by-state analysis, the overall balance of support in these closely contested states has remained level in recent months, with Obama slightly ahead, but neither candidate holding a significant advantage. The poll also finds that Romney's favorability has taken a hit this summer: "By a 52% to 37% margin, more voters say they have an unfavorable than favorable view of Mitt Romney. The poll, conducted prior to Romney’s recent overseas trip, represents the sixth consecutive survey over the past nine months in which his image has been in negative territory. While Romney’s personal favorability improved substantially between March and June – as Republican voters rallied behind him after the primary season ended– his image has again slipped over the past month. Barack Obama’s image remains, by comparison, more positive – 50% offer a favorable assessment of the president, 45% an unfavorable one. Even so, Obama’s personal ratings are lower than most presidential candidates in recent elections. The 10-point lead for Obama here is bigger than any of the other recent polling we've seen, which have tended to show a fairly static race."</Msg><Username>go_choke_charlie</Username><Timestamp>1343946448481</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 18:27:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343946635707-148</Id><Topic><Title>New polling data out from Pew Research Center finds President Obama with a double-digit lead over Mitt Romney nationally:</Title><Username>go_choke_charlie</Username><Timestamp>1343946448481</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 18:27:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>SW and Rectal Drips (dumpobamie, zevoter, whitest white, buckynoodlesuck, et.al.): Try to spin this!

He blames others for certain acts while doing the same or worse himself. Yet we are told its ok just believe Obama Researchers have discovered that Obama’s autobiographical books are little more than PR stunts, as they have little to do with the actual events of his life. The fact is we know less about President Obama than perhaps any other president in American history and much of this is due to actual efforts to hide his record. This should concern all Americans. A nation-wide network of researchers has sprung up to attempt to fill in the blanks, but at every opportunity Obama’s high-priced lawyers have built walls around various records or simply made them disappear. It is estimated that Obama’s legal team has now spent well over $1.4 million dollars blocking access to documents every American should have access to. The question is why would he spend so much money to do this? The president who campaigned for a more “open government” and “full disclosure” will not unseal his medical records, his school records, his birth records or his passport records. He will not release his Harvard records, his Columbia College records, or his Occidental College records—he will not even release his Columbia College thesis. All his legislative records from the Illinois State Senate are missing and he claims his scheduling records during those State Senate years are lost as well. In addition, no one can find his school records for the elite K-12 college prep school, Punahou School, he attended in Hawaii. What is he hiding? Well, for starters, some of these records will shed light on his citizenship and birth. For example, Obama’s application to Punahou School – now mysteriously missing – would likely contain a birth certificate. And, obama 2 scott and barry 3rd grade 1969 punahou school in hawaii The Mystery of Barack Obama Continuesaccording to attorney Gary Kreep, “his Occidental College records are important as they may show he attended there as a foreign exchange student.” Indeed, Obama used his Indonesian name “Barry Soetoro” while attending Occidental. Kreep has filed lawsuits challenging Obama’s eligibility to be president and as part of his lawsuit he requested Obama’s records from Occidental.

"IRS missing billions in ID theft"</Title><Msg>WASHINGTON (AP) — The Internal Revenue Service may have delivered more than $5 billion in refund checks to identity thieves who filed fraudulent tax returns for 2011, Treasury Department investigators said Thursday. They estimate another $21 billion could make its way to ID thieves' pockets over the next five years. The IRS is detecting far fewer fraudulent tax refund claims than actually occur, according to a government audit that warned the widespread problem could undermine public trust in the U.S. tax system. Although the IRS detected about 940,000 fraudulent returns for last year claiming $6.5 billion in refunds, there were potentially another 1.5 million undetected cases of thieves seeking refunds after assuming the identity of a dead person, child or someone else who normally wouldn't file a tax return. In one example, investigators found a single address in Lansing, Mich., that was used to file 2,137 separate tax returns. The IRS issued more than $3.3 million in refunds to that address. Three addresses in Florida, the epicenter of the identity theft crisis, filed more than 500 returns totaling more than $1 million in refunds for each address. In another troubling scenario, hundreds of refunds were deposited into the same bank account — a red flag for investigators searching for ID thieves who may be filing for refunds for multiple people. In one instance, the IRS deposited 590 refunds totaling more than $900,000 into one account. "We found multiple reasons for the IRS's inability to detect billions of dollars in fraud," J. Russell George, the Treasury Department's inspector general for tax administration, in a statement. "At a time when every dollar counts, these results are extremely troubling." Topping the list of concerns is the IRS's lack of timely access to third-party information it needs to verify returns and root out fraud. Many Americans are struggling to pay their bills and the IRS takes pride in processing returns and issuing refunds promptly. But taxpayers can start filing their returns in mid-January, while employers and financial institutions don't have to submit withholding and income documents for taxpayers to the IRS until the end of March. That means the IRS often issues refunds long before it can confirm the veracity of what's listed on taxpayer returns. Thieves are also exploiting vulnerabilities in the way the IRS delivers refunds, investigators found. Of the 1.5 million undetected cases of potential fraud, 1.2 million used direct deposits, including pre-loaded debit cards. Thieves often prefer those methods to a paper check, which require a physical address to receive the check and photo ID matching the taxpayer's name to cash it. IRS officials said the growth of identity theft-related fraud is one of its biggest challenges. Already this year, the agency has stopped almost $12 billion in confirmed fraud, it says. And it says its criminal investigators are actively pursuing those who perpetrate fraud — including the previously undetected cases identified by the audit. "If the IRS determines a refund has been issued improperly, we will attempt to recoup the funds," said IRS spokeswoman Michelle Eldridge. The IRS agreed with the inspector general that Congress should expand the agency's access to resources that could help it fight theft, including the National Directory of New Hires, a database created to help states enforce child support orders. The IRS specifically asked Congress for that authority in its 2013 budget request. But IRS officials disputed the notion that $21 billion in fraudulent returns could be issued over the next five years, arguing that the estimate didn't take into account the IRS's stepped-up compliance and prevention efforts. "We're going to continue to monitor the IRS in this area until we see some improvement," Michael McKenney, the acting deputy inspector general for audit, told The Associated Press. Investigators went back through a sample of the 1.5 billion undetected cases to see why the IRS never flagged them as fraudulent. In 49 of 60 returns, investigators said, the return didn't score high enough on the IRS's fraud filter to merit a closer review. In eight of the 11 cases where the IRS did perform an additional review, it never verified the income and withholding on the return. The audit was prompted by a request from Florida Sen. Bill Nelson, whose home state contains the top two cities where fraudulent tax returns originate: Tampa and Miami. Last week Nelson, a Democrat, joined with Republican Sen. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma to introduce legislation designed to curb identity theft in the tax system. "It's an ongoing problem," Nelson said in a statement. "We've got to find a fix." Nelson's bill would improve protections for Social Security numbers that thieves need to file returns, and would expand an existing program that gives previous victims of ID theft a personal identification number to deter repeat offenses against the same taxpayer. Another bipartisan bill passed by the House on Wednesday would bolster prosecutions and strengthen criminal penalties on ID thieves. The IRS said it is already putting a number of new measures in place, including new ID theft screening filters that will hold on to refunds until the IRS can verify a taxpayer's identity. That filter had thwarted about $1.3 billion in potentially fraudulent refunds through April, the audit said. Another system flags returns filed with Social Security numbers of those who have died. For those who fall victim to identity thieves, the recovery process can be less than smooth. A separate report by the inspector general in May found that the IRS wasn't providing good customer service and proper assistance to victims of ID theft, increasing the burden for those whose identities are stolen. The Federal Trade Commission has listed identity theft as the No. 1 consumer complaint for the past 12 years. ___</Msg><Username>uncle_wilbur1</Username><Timestamp>1343953052842</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 20:17:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343953126451-181</Id><Title>Clash of the Mormons.

I haven't confirmed this, but the important thing is that a felon should not be permitted to shame this country and preside over the senate. Harry must resign immediately and prove that he did not take a bribe in 2006. I don't believe he paid taxes properly on the bribe if he characterized it as a long term capital gain instead of ordinary (and illegal) income. The IRS and FBI must investigate Harry, and a special prosecutor must be appointed to ensure justice is served.

You are the biggest idiot in the village.</Msg><Username>mrstan4089</Username><Timestamp>1343966373627</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 23:59:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
