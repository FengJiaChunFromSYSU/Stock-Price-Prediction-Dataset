No winner. No loser.</Title><Msg>Romney scored big points with his image by projecting some warmth and humanity. His usual wooden and awkward posturing was absent. Obama was his usual steady, smooth, and unflappable self, so no pluses or minuses either way for him. As far as the debate and the issues discussed and argued, neither candidate dominated or "won." Both were respectful and polite. Both ignored moderator Jim Lehrer's attempts to limit speaking and response times, but not to the point of incivility. The friendly gathering and mingling of both candidates' families on the debate stage after the debate ended seemed somewhat insincere, and awkwardly staged for the benefit of the forty million viewers, but smiles, and greetings, and handshakes all around was refreshing to see nonetheless. A borderline yawn fest.</Msg><Username>cosmo_vitelli</Username><Timestamp>1349326524444</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 00:55:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349326640985-19</Id><Topic><Title>ROMNEY 67% OBAMA 25% CNN</Title><Username>flashcrashcoming</Username><Timestamp>1349321105607</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 23:25:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>OBAMA can't defend himself when ROMNEY told him that he spent 90 billion on companies that most went BK and most of them are his contributors instead OBAMA should have spent the 90 billion on teachers and education.</Msg><Username>urichey</Username><Timestamp>1349326640985</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 00:57:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349326764164-20</Id><Title>I would never have sex before presidential debate</Title><Msg>I think it put lots of wear and tear on you.....hee hee LOL no matter how prepared you are....you can try to have sex to get rid of the stress of standing there for 1.5 hour without going pee pee....I feel for Mitt &amp; Obama....1.5 hours of grilling by media, citizens, voters and the world....I can see the expression on Obama's face he really need to go pee pee really quick.

Neither candidate was able to convincingly argue that their numbers added up better than their opponents numbers. Romney did not convince anyone that his proposed policies would improve anything. Obama adequately defended his record, but was not convincing either. The viewers finally saw a Romney that did not put his foot in his mouth, and was able to present himself as presidential. Obama is presidential. That doesn't make a winner or a loser out of either. The opinions of the mindless extremist fools who continue to plague this board with never ending lies and stupidity are obviously not capable of making an objective assessment of anything. They had the same opinion of Obama before the dabate. If they have a better opinion of Romney since the debate, where are their posts about Romney? All they continue to do is keep on with their onslaught of asinine lies and stupid comments about Obama. They are the losers, but then, they have always been losers.</Msg><Username>cosmo_vitelli</Username><Timestamp>1349361149800</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 10:32:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349361196548-121</Id><Topic><Title>$9 line</Title><Username>highlowsel</Username><Timestamp>1349187979153</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 10:26:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Bid $9.36.

However, because Obama wants to be re-elected, they will do anything to make the non-farm payroll numbers looking good. With that said, and banks earnings are coming out next week, BAC has much more catalysts to go higher than most anticipated. Keep in mind, BAC's P/E is below its peers and book value is still at 50% discount. They have over $634 billion in cash and what they got it from the FED are practically free (0 to .25 basis point). BAC are doing a very aggressive job at costs cutting and that's a good thing. In due time, shareholders will be rewarded.</Msg><Username>fbi4hire</Username><Timestamp>1349371988926</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 13:33:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349371996118-184</Id><Topic><Title>You should view this profile (BAC)</Title><Username>alishagzx063071</Username><Timestamp>1349270354448</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 09:19:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This is what I am looking for.</Msg><Username>lianneees27894</Username><Timestamp>1349371996118</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 13:33:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349372074014-185</Id><Topic><Title>THE HIGHER BAC GOES TODAY THE MORE WE WILL SHORT TO PROTECT OUR POSITION..WE WILL PREVAIL</Title><Username>greatestideaman</Username><Timestamp>1349354216105</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 08:36:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Regardless, you are an idiot that missed out on making real money to the upside while wasting your day whining on here.</Msg><Username>tradejunky</Username><Timestamp>1349372074014</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 13:34:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349372275174-186</Id><Topic><Title>Just sold my Calls..

The term "forcible rape" was created to counter false rape claims and protect men from vindictivetive sex partners.</Msg><Username>peter_norths_proctologist</Username><Timestamp>1349373478786</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 13:57:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349373640946-196</Id><Topic><Title>$9.50 close?</Title><Username>ryanmilliron</Username><Timestamp>1349370495568</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 13:08:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There was alot of talk earlier this year (March-April timeframe, around the stress tests) that BAC would issue a share buyback later in the year...with several months of rising housing prices, and an all around improving market, does anyone else see at least a small buyback coming with earnings?</Msg><Username>ryanmilliron</Username><Timestamp>1349373640946</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 14:00:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349373688722-197</Id><Topic><Title>Republicans Suffer From alzheimer's Syndrome, Republicans Destroyed This Country</Title><Username>fireundersmoke</Username><Timestamp>1349372993530</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 13:49:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nothing could be worse than this Marxist in the White House.

Hmmm, I wonder why? Here’s an idea. The US economic situation is a gigantic CRAP storm, regardless of how badly the Federal Reserve wants to nullify the business cycle and pretend it doesn't exist. To say they are out of bullets is like saying it’s kind of chilly in the middle of winter in Barrow, Alaska. Based on the most important measures (employment, confidence, wage growth) it feels like a recession for the most part anyway and people are behaving as though we're in one. Oh yeah, the debates happened Wednesday and one side was hell bent on telling us that it’s not the case, while the other will say we are deep in it. Whatever!!!! The spin masters can spin away but a barely employed father of three in the rust belt won’t give a rat’s #$%$ about a positive ISM number. With over 8% unemployment,it's hard to find anything sexy in a random economic release. And because we know that Europe is now in a continent-wide recession, possibly headed toward a depression, it's not a stretch to say that we'll be joining them soon enough. So, having this knowledge as the backdrop, feel free to ponder the question of how much longer this recovery should/might last. Pssssst!

The election wasn't any closer than the polls were reporting all along, but I'd have to say it probably is now. Not once did Obama seize the numerous openings Mitt gave him. He should have clocked Romney for now claiming to support most of Obamacare after an entire primary season of running away from his own Massachusetts version of it, and then letting Mitt pour syrup on that waffle by saying he'd still repeal it anyway. Same story on Medicare and Social Security. When Romney said that no one 55 or older would be hurt by his proposed changes to those programs, Obama failed to point out that all those UNDER 55 who would. And letting Mitt accuse HIM of using his own set of facts.....I actually leaned forward in my chair waiting for the dope-slap that was never delivered. I also have to admit that I was so distracted by watching the CNN voter-reaction crawl line that I missed some of the nuances of posture, expression, and so on....but I saw them in the replays, and it wasn't pretty. Obama started this debate in the red zone, could have put the game away with a scoring drive, and fumbled. If he doesn't get the ball back in a hurry, this game could go into overtime. ROTFLMAO so these are the two best candidates our two-party system could deliver?

Romney's tax plan was simply not possible, unless he raised taxes on capital gains. Romney has said he would offset the loss of personal income tax revenue (estimated at $360 billion a year by the Tax Policy Center) by reducing tax deductions and credits. And he has said he would do this while making sure that those at the top keep paying the "same share of the tax burden they're paying now." But he has steadfastly refused to say which tax preferences would be cut or reduced. He has pointed to the revenue-neutral proposals for rate-cutting put forth by the deficit commission as evidence that what he proposes is possible in theory, but those proposals pay for the cuts largely by taxing capital gains at the higher rates that apply to ordinary income, a measure Romney has specifically ruled out. So Romney has failed to produce evidence that what he promises is possible. And we judge that the weight of evidence and expert opinion is clear -- it's not possible."</Msg><Username>skistriad</Username><Timestamp>1349379810397</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 15:43:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349380403283-247</Id><Topic><Title>Republicans Suffer From alzheimer's Syndrome, Republicans Destroyed This Country</Title><Username>fireundersmoke</Username><Timestamp>1349372993530</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 13:49:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Very well stated and I fully agree with you!

Please get one of your Democrat friends who can read and have him/her/it read this column to you. This information should help you refrain from making statements about Republicans that are not true..have a nice day. Frank's fingerprints are all over the financial fiasco By Jeff Jacoby Boston Globe Columnist / September 28, 2008 'THE PRIVATE SECTOR got us into this mess. The government has to get us out of it." That's Barney Frank's story, and he's sticking to it. As the Massachusetts Democrat has explained it in recent days, the current financial crisis is the spawn of the free market run amok, with the political class guilty only of failing to rein the capitalists in. The Wall Street meltdown was caused by "bad decisions that were made by people in the private sector," Frank said; the country is in dire straits today "thanks to a conservative philosophy that says the market knows best." And that philosophy goes "back to Ronald Reagan, when at his inauguration he said, 'Government is not the answer to our problems; government is the problem.' " In fact, that isn't what Reagan said. His actual words were: "In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem." Were he president today, he would be saying much the same thing. Because while the mortgage crisis convulsing Wall Street has its share of private-sector culprits -- many of whom have been learning lately just how pitiless the private sector’s discipline can be -- they weren't the ones who "got us into this mess." Barney Frank's talking points notwithstanding, mortgage lenders didn't wake up one fine day deciding to junk long-held standards of creditworthiness in order to make ill-advised loans to unqualified borrowers. It would be closer to the truth to say they woke up to find the government twisting their arms and demanding that they do so - or else. The roots of this crisis go back to the Carter administration. That was when government officials, egged on by left-wing activists, began accusing mortgage lenders of racism and "redlining" because urban blacks were being denied mortgages at a higher rate than suburban whites. The pressure to make more loans to minorities (read: to borrowers with weak credit histories) became relentless. Congress passed the Community Reinvestment Act, empowering regulators to punish banks that failed to "meet the credit needs" of "low-income, minority, and distressed neighborhoods." Lenders responded by loosening their underwriting standards and making increasingly shoddy loans. The two government-chartered mortgage finance firms, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, encouraged this "subprime" lending by authorizing ever more "flexible" criteria by which high-risk borrowers could be qualified for home loans, and then buying up the questionable mortgages that ensued. All this was justified as a means of increasing homeownership among minorities and the poor. Affirmative-action policies trumped sound business practices. A manual issued by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston advised mortgage lenders to disregard financial common sense. "Lack of credit history should not be seen as a negative factor," the Fed's guidelines instructed. Lenders were directed to accept welfare payments and unemployment benefits as "valid income sources" to qualify for a mortgage. Failure to comply could mean a lawsuit. As long as housing prices kept rising, the illusion that all this was good public policy could be sustained. But it didn't take a financial whiz to recognize that a day of reckoning would come. "What does it mean when Boston banks start making many more loans to minorities?" I asked in this space in 1995. "Most likely, that they are knowingly approving risky loans in order to get the feds and the activists off their backs . . . When the coming wave of foreclosures rolls through the inner city, which of today's self-congratulating bankers, politicians, and regulators plans to take the credit?" Frank doesn't. But his fingerprints are all over this fiasco. Time and time again, Frank insisted that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were in good shape. Five years ago, for example, when the Bush administration proposed much tighter regulation of the two companies, Frank was adamant that "these two entities, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are not facing any kind of financial crisis." When the White House warned of "systemic risk for our financial system" unless the mortgage giants were curbed, Frank complained that the administration was more concerned about financial safety than about housing. Now that the bubble has burst and the "systemic risk" is apparent to all, Frank blithely declares: "The private sector got us into this mess." Well, give the congressman points for gall. Wall Street and private lenders have plenty to answer for, but it was Washington and the political class that derailed this train. If Frank is looking for a culprit to blame, he can find one suspect in the nearest mirror.</Msg><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1349381955309</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 16:19:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349382106081-254</Id><Topic><Title>What BAC Shareholders Do Not Know</Title><Username>milesefren65</Username><Timestamp>1349351488887</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 07:51:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Very nice analysis</Msg><Username>nandrea35</Username><Timestamp>1349382106081</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 16:21:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349382196924-255</Id><Topic><Title>OBAMA WON THE DEBATE LAST NIGHT!</Title><Username>milesed17</Username><Timestamp>1349368007039</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 12:26:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You are so not nice!
