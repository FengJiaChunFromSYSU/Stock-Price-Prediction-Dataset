The order came from Washington. Note that UK, which has a larger amount of debt, is not involved in this crisis. Last year, USD set a new low and stayed there for a while, which really scared the caretakers. They realized that usual "push ups" and down no longer worked (due to excessive use). And with low dollar, they couldn't do any QE. Hence, they engineered the Euro crisis. Note that with USD rising, equities didn't go down much. They'll keep the market in the 12000 until the election. Then, they'll do QE3 and we'll have a rally.</Msg><Username>telezz10100</Username><Timestamp>1343139713484</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 10:21:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343140059895-63</Id><Title>I Challenge Anyone to Debate Why Holding an Obvious Reverse Split with Potential to Default or Breakup is a Good Investment</Title><Msg>I'm all ears.</Msg><Username>brazentrader</Username><Timestamp>1343140059895</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 10:27:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343140093870-64</Id><Title>Obama is a Fraud President</Title><Msg>No ideas, nothing of substance only speeches and whining.

Not one. That's because I pay attention, I've been here a very long time learning, and never marry my entries. I rent the stock and nothing more.

I do not have hundreds of thousands of dollars of others peoples money to trade with though.

The spark in the current crisis could come from a bank failure, and not necessarily in Spain. It could be a bank in Italy — or Austria, or Germany. German banks are notoriously undercapitalized and poorly supervised and have created a number of mini-crises in the past few decades since the collapse of the Herstatt Bank in 1974.</Msg><Username>shooting_my_load1</Username><Timestamp>1343156181120</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 14:56:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343156296274-175</Id><Title>Any Average Down Above $5 is Dashed Now</Title><Msg>Averaging here for example would necessitate a need to average it down on top of the original. 11B shares is quite a bag to lug around I bet.</Msg><Username>brazentrader</Username><Timestamp>1343156296274</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 14:58:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343156449757-176</Id><Title>Bank Down Skipper - It Wants to Implode - IMO, Let It - 7 is Going, Going, ...............</Title><Msg>eom...</Msg><Username>brazentrader</Username><Timestamp>1343156449757</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 15:00:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343156469208-177</Id><Topic><Title>Any Average Down Above $5 is Dashed Now</Title><Username>brazentrader</Username><Timestamp>1343156296274</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 14:58:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Get a life you #$%$</Msg><Username>projectionunknown</Username><Timestamp>1343156469208</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 15:01:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343156547257-178</Id><Topic><Title>Bank Down Skipper - It Wants to Implode - IMO, Let It - 7 is Going, Going, ...............</Title><Username>brazentrader</Username><Timestamp>1343156449757</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 15:00:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Jerk no-nothing basher.</Msg><Username>projectionunknown</Username><Timestamp>1343156547257</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 15:02:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343156579348-179</Id><Title>7 Going Once........ 7 Going Twice...............

The report, called The Price of Offshore Revisted, revealed that between 21 and 32 trillion dollars could be hidden in tax havens like Switzerland and the Cayman Islands. The report revealed that some ten trillion dollars that has been stashed in off-shore accounts is owned by only 92,000 people, or 0.001 percent of the world's population."These estimates reveal a staggering failure: inequality is much, much worse than official statistics show," New York Daily News quoted John Christensen of the Tax Justice Network, as saying. Private banks and investment firms have facilitated these wealthy individuals and corporations to take advantage of loopholes and gaps in cross-border tax rules, the report said. The economic transparency group Tax Justice Network revealed that the amount is larger than the entire United State's economy, or enough money to entirely solve the European debt crisis. According to the Tax Justice Network report, almost every country has suffered from the billions of dollars in tax revenue, adding that sub-Saharan Africa and oil producing states like Saudi Arabia have especially faced the brunt. The report was compiled using thousands of pieces data and sources, including information from the IMF, the Tax Justice Network said. Democrats have accused Republican candidate Mitt Romney of stashing some of his wealth in offshore banks to avoid taxes.</Msg><Username>brazentrader</Username><Timestamp>1343172039661</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 19:20:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343172172145-279</Id><Topic><Title>World's rich have hidden $21 trillion in offshore accounts: 92,000 People aka .001% of the Population</Title><Username>brazentrader</Username><Timestamp>1343172039661</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 19:20:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>UBS, Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs handle the most offshore assets, even after the celebrated 2009 tax amnesty at UBS. But the US mega-banks have increased their share dramatically. And this ends up facilitating a host of other potential abuses, like we saw in the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations investigation into HSBC. If you’re wondering how global inequality can continue to rise despite advances in productivity and the promotion of democracy worldwide, it’s due to the ability for the richest people in the world to stash away their money with relative ease. And the global financial system, the executives of which have the net wealth and lifestyle of the richest of the rich, enable this behavior.</Msg><Username>brazentrader</Username><Timestamp>1343172172145</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 19:22:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343172286858-280</Id><Title>The report revealed that major banks such as Bank of America and Citigroup were among the many major corporations and banking organizations to hide their assets</Title><Msg>July 23, 2012 Originally appeared on Natural Society Major banks and the financial global elite are now confirmed to have as much as $32 trillion in hidden assets stashed away in offshore accounts that are subject to little or no taxation. As a result, around $280 billion is estimated to be lost in tax revenues. In other words, the multi-trillion dollar banks and elite families are avoiding any taxation while forcing United States citizens to foot the bill. Amazingly, the $32 trillion stashed away represents the overall GDP of the United States and Japan combined. In order to reach the monetary figure, which many are calling quite conservative, economist James Henry commissioned was by the Tax Justice Network — a group that seeks to bring tax evasion to light. Even the Tax Justice Network was quite shocked by the outcome, with spokesperson John Christensen saying he was ultimately startled by the “scale” of the numbers. What’s more concerning than the numbers, however, is the entities behind them. The report revealed that major banks such as Bank of America and Citigroup were among the many major corporations and banking organizations to hide their assets in offshore tax havens. Bank of America, HSBC, Global Elite Families Among Listed In an interview with the news organization Al Jazeera, Christensen explains just how deep the report goes: “We’re talking about very big, well-known brands – HSBC, Citigroup, Bank of America, UBS, Credit Suisse – some of the world’s biggest banks are invovled…and they do it knowing fully well that their clients, more often than not, are evading and avoiding taxes.”</Msg><Username>brazentrader</Username><Timestamp>1343172286858</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 19:24:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343172511605-281</Id><Topic><Title>When the French were in dire need of Mormon missionaries, Willard answered the call.</Title><Username>doctor_casanova</Username><Timestamp>1343136596014</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 09:29:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>With deferments Willard's daddy got for him, Willard spent the Vietnam War years in Paris where the godless French were taught how to keep several wives by the draft dodging Mormon "missionary," Willard Romney.</Msg><Username>urbansquall</Username><Timestamp>1343172511605</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 19:28:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343172693984-282</Id><Topic><Title>banks</Title><Username>gollywogazoo</Username><Timestamp>1343171500280</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 19:11:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>exactly what are YOU babbling about...I think you're a bit behind the eight ball as far as history is concerned?
