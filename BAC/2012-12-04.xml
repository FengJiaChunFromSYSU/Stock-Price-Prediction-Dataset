In her current stump speech Rice claims that her goal has been accomplished, “We’ve repaired frayed relations with countries around the world. We’ve ended needless American isolation on a wide range of issues. And as a consequence, we've gotten strong cooperation on things that matter most to our national security interest.” This past weekend shows just how disastrous Rice’s strategy has been. Rice has been silent on important issues and ineffective when she does engage. She skipped Security Council meetings when Israel needed defending and even failed to show up for the emergency session on the Gaza Flotilla incident. Rice didn’t even show up for the first two emergency Security Council meetings on the unfolding Arab revolution last year. Rice stayed silent when Iran was elected to the UN women’s committee, she didn’t call out Libya when it was elected to the Human Rights Council, she was absent from the Haiti crisis meeting and was a no-show for the last open meeting scheduled before the planned U.N. vote to recognize Palestinian statehood. When she actually shows up, she is a miserable failure. Take the crucial issue of Iran. Rice spent the last several years undermining and grumbling about the Bush administration’s increasingly tough measures but has only been able to pass one resolution of her own – compared with the Bush team’s five. Rice’s one and only Iran resolution was 22 months ago. And it passed with just 12 votes of support – the least support we have ever seen for a Security Council sanctions resolution on Iran. In fact, Susan Rice lost more support with her one resolution than the previous five Iran resolutions combined. In another example, Rice secretly negotiated with the Arabs on acceptable language for a possible U.N. resolution to condemn Israel’s settlement activity.</Msg><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1354630329263</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 09:12:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354630355211-32</Id><Title>CNBC -MOYNIHAN SAYS FISCAL CLIFF IS TAKING DOWN NOS FOR NEXT YEAR-VERY BAD</Title><Msg>SELL</Msg><Username>theworldview</Username><Timestamp>1354630355211</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 09:12:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354630426089-33</Id><Topic><Title>OBAMA SAYS RAISING TAXES IN THIS BAD ECONOMY WOULD HURT AMERICANS</Title><Username>america_divided_by_obama</Username><Timestamp>1354625038557</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 07:43:58 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yeah and the egg creates the chicken!

Obama and his administration have control over what is cut in the 10% across the board cuts including defense making all those companies with defense contracts wanting to cozy up to him along with any one who has contracts in any other area with the government. Seems to me if the republicans don't give on the taxes now and negotiate having some say in cuts they are irrelevant for the next four years. Aside from the immediate pain from having our debt rating lowered again and layoffs from companies who lose government funding and states who will have stipends cut eventually we will recover with republicans taking the heat for the pain and democrats taking credit for the recovery. The only control the republicans will have for any say about anything is a refusal to raise the debt ceiling next year making the problem even worse. In short if the republicans want to survive at all they best go along now. It would be the best for the country and their only path to relevance. Boehner is dead meat for leadership after he takes us over the cliff. Ryan and Cantor will be avoided like the plague. This Congress which is now labeled the worst in history will go down as the one which almost destroyed America. After that they will be looking for some place on Mt Rushmore where they can carve Obama, ears and all.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1354632123698</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 09:42:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354632462730-41</Id><Topic><Title>OBAMA SAYS RAISING TAXES IN THIS BAD ECONOMY WOULD HURT AMERICANS</Title><Username>america_divided_by_obama</Username><Timestamp>1354625038557</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 07:43:58 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Where in history has congress taken the blame for anything?

The thinking goes that the president is unable or unwilling to take on his base on discretionary spending or entitlement reform and has convinced himself he has a mandate to do nothing but raise taxes on the rich. One senior Senate adviser put it this way, speculating the White House would give no response to the GOP: “The House showed that the White House won’t take anything but their own plan.” He added, “I really think they’d rather have a political ‘win’ even if it means the country is screwed.

Without a resolution, the state of Michigan will not release cash to keep the city running. Mayor Dave Bing, who contends that bankruptcy or bond defaults are not on the horizon, is prepared to put city workers on unpaid leave to keep the struggling local government operating. Credit rating agencies are warning that political and legal obstacles could derail plans to get Detroit back on solid financial footing. Moody's Investors Service last week pushed the city's credit ratings deeper into the junk category and warned of a heightened risk of bankruptcy or default over the next year or two.</Msg><Username>joe6pack65</Username><Timestamp>1354633470513</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 10:04:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354633474486-48</Id><Topic><Title>Is today the day</Title><Username>highlowsel</Username><Timestamp>1354545594105</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 09:39:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>pse, educate me, what's a finny??</Msg><Username>jckwede</Username><Timestamp>1354633474486</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 10:04:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354633571394-49</Id><Title>DINGLING BROTHERS(aka:CON_gress) and Bernanke &amp;

(In Mexico, for example, that would arguably mean holding an FM-2 visa stamped “resident,” or having “immigrant” status, and filing a Mexican income tax return for any income Mexico requires residents to report.) On the other hand, if you fall into one of the following categories which many U.S. expats will, my guess is you will find the IRS wanting you to pay the ObamaCare tax if you fail to purchase US health insurance that meets minimum government requirements: 1) You live out of the country and spend more than 35 days a year in the U.S. and are not considered a “resident” by the country in which you live and do not pay income taxes in that country as required of residents, or 2) You live out of the country pursuant to a non-resident visa, e.g., an FM-3 “non-resident” visa in Mexico, and you do not pay income tax in the country where you live because you are not, or claim not to be, a resident there. Of course, I could be wrong. It remains early in the game. The individual mandate of ObamaCare does not take effect until January 1, 2014, which is also when the tax for failing to have mandated insurance goes into effect. That tax includes an annual penalty of $95, or up to 1% of income, whichever is greater, on individuals who are not covered by an acceptable insurance policy; this will rise to a minimum of $695 ($2,085 for families), or 2.5% of income, by 2016. (Any US citizen who lives outside the US should consult with their tax attorney or tax advisor to determine whether they must buy US health insurance or pay the tax.)</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1354636886990</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 11:01:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354637268781-66</Id><Topic><Title>to the United 16Trillion Debtstates of America.</Title><Username>joeschoft</Username><Timestamp>1354628739985</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 08:45:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>More like 138 TRILLION search US DEBT CLOCK</Msg><Username>rhinoinchgo</Username><Timestamp>1354637268781</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 11:07:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354637612733-67</Id><Title>BAC = Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz</Title><Msg>;g;dfg;sdlkf';lskf';lg';ld</Msg><Username>caplain_nobull1</Username><Timestamp>1354637612733</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 11:13:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354637891818-68</Id><Topic><Title>to the United 16Trillion Debtstates of America.</Title><Username>joeschoft</Username><Timestamp>1354628739985</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 08:45:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>lol nonsense, sour grapes much ??</Msg><Username>bbkenno</Username><Timestamp>1354637891818</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 11:18:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354637953788-69</Id><Topic><Title>AS AN EXPAT I AM EXEMPT FROM OBAMA CARE</Title><Username>puta_placer</Username><Timestamp>1354634641971</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 10:24:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you live in a nation most likely that has national health insurance, your hypocracy is staggering.

The Democratic Platform stated: Civil Rights: Against poll tax and segregation of the armed forces. Federal laws should be made to end discrimination in hiring for jobs. The Republican Platform stated: Civil Rights: Against poll tax. Right to work should not be stopped by race, color or religion. The crucial difference between parties is in the call for federal laws to ensure civil rights. Read more from the Truman Presidential Museum and Library. Election Results Most Americans are familiar with the famous photo of Harry Truman holding a newspaper with the banner headline "Dewey Defeats Truman." Part of the reason that the paper was willing to go to press without the final electoral tally was the anticipated effect of the Dixiecrat and Progressive (Henry Wallace) candidates on both the Southern and liberal elements of the Democratic Party. The final tally: Harry S. Truman, Democratic — 49.5% Thomas E. Dewey, Republican — 45.1% Strom Thurmond, States' Rights — 2.4% Henry A. Wallace, Progressive — 2.4% Thurmond carried Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and South Carolina. Strom Thurmond and the Civil Rights Act of 1957 The Civil Rights Act of 1957 was introduced and strongly supported by Senator Lyndon B. Johnson (D-TX). It passed in spite of a filibuster led by Senator Strom Thurmond (D-SC, who switched to R-SC in 1964), during which Thurmond spoke for a Senate record of 24 hours 18 minutes.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1354644896073</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 13:14:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354644918258-108</Id><Title>CEO Moynihan received open letter published in Charlotte Observer</Title><Msg>In today's Charlotte Observer, Moynihan had an open letter written to him about litigation as a last resort.

"House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said she would try to use a procedure known as a discharge petition to bring a Senate-passed bill for extending the middle-class tax cuts to the floor of the House. Nancy Pelosi Like what you see? Click here to sign up for Accounting Today's daily newsletter to get the latest news and behind the scenes commentary you won't find anywhere else. A discharge petition would require 218 signatures to bring it to the floor of the House. Republicans, who hold a majority in the House, have so far resisted allowing a vote on a bill passed earlier this year by the Senate, which would extend the tax cuts for only those earning less than $250,000 a year. "The message from the American people is loud and clear: we need solutions not stalemates,” Pelosi said in a statement Sunday. "We continue to call on Speaker Boehner to immediately schedule a vote on the Senate-passed bill to extend tax cuts for the middle class, which the President has said he will sign immediately. Congressional Republicans must heed the call of middle-class families during this holiday season, end the uncertainty and stop holding middle income tax cuts hostage to tax cuts for the rich. If Speaker Boehner refuses to schedule this widely-supported bill for a vote, Democrats will introduce a discharge petition to automatically bring to the floor the Senate-passed middle class tax cuts. We must find a bold, balanced and fair agreement to avoid the fiscal cliff. The clock is ticking and stalemates are a luxury we cannot afford.” Pelosi held a press conference last Friday in which she said she planned to introduce the discharge petition this coming Tuesday. However, she admitted that Democrats will need some Republicans to join them in signing the discharge petition. Democrats currently hold 192 seats in the House, but the discharge petition would need 218 signatures to bring the bill to the floor for a vote" The beauty of this is that republicans have to vote and publicly voice there individual positions.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1354646422934</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 13:40:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354646512171-124</Id><Topic><Title>Bloomberg Journalist just had an interview iwth King Obama signaling GOING OVER FISCAL CLIFF</Title><Username>rhinoinchgo</Username><Timestamp>1354645104990</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 13:18:24 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It cracked me up too when I first heard it, but it makes a lot of sense when you think about it.

By all accounts, Republican lawmakers, led by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), had the report killed. But the ongoing effort to find out exactly what happened continues. Democrats still want to know why the Congressional Research Service withdrew a report that found no correlation between top tax rates and economic growth. Their suspicion that it might have been because of Republican political pressure is being piqued by internal correspondence between CRS officials and senior GOP aides. A series of email exchanges from Sept. 25 and Sept. 26 obtained by Roll Call reveals displeasure among staffers for Senate Finance ranking Republican Orrin G. Hatch of Utah and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. For weeks, the official Republican line has been that GOP policymakers and even folks outside Capitol Hill raised concerns about the economic report, but did not explicitly call for the analysis to be withdrawn. Roll Call's report features a series of complaints between Republican Senate aides, including one in which a McConnell aide specifically lamented "partisans" misusing the CRS's conclusions, adding that "a retraction should be considered." Arguably more damaging is an email from a high-ranking CRS employee, who told a colleague at the time, "Now they are asking for the report to come down," in reference to Hatch and McConnell staffers. This is consistent with what Thomas Hungerford, the CRS researcher who produced the report, told the Huffington Post earlier this month: the analysis was taken down due to "pressure from the Senate minority." In other words, the GOP denials about the Congressional Research Service are looking a little shaky. As for the bigger picture, I suspect this seems like inside baseball -- most folks have probably never even heard of the Congressional Research Service -- but I continue to believe it matters. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- To reiterate a point from earlier in the month, it's important to understand that the Congressional Research Service, generally recognized as Congress' own think tank, has a well-deserved reputation for non-partisanship. The CRS is counted on to provide lawmakers with the most reliable and accurate information available, and the notion that partisan lawmakers can pressure, censor, and possibly even intimidate independent researchers is simply unacceptable. In other words, we just can't have public offices' scholarship being stifled because Republicans find reality politically inconvenient. Our system of government isn't supposed to work this way. Republicans have adopted trickle-down, supply-side economics as the foundation for their entire worldview. The Congressional Research Service used reliable, objective information to report what most mainstream economists widely accepted -- if the goal is boosting economic growth, giving people who are already rich a tax break doesn't do anything except make the gap between rich and poor more dramatic.

Without a resolution, the state of Michigan will not release cash to keep the city running. Mayor Dave Bing, who contends that bankruptcy or bond defaults are not on the horizon, is prepared to put city workers on unpaid leave to keep the struggling local government operating. Credit rating agencies are warning that political and legal obstacles could derail plans to get Detroit back on solid financial footing. Moody's Investors Service last week pushed the city's credit ratings deeper into the junk category and warned of a heightened risk of bankruptcy or default over the next year or two. An informal meeting of the city council has been called for Tuesday for an update on Detroit's financial condition. Under current law, Detroit has no path that could lead it to federal bankruptcy court. Bettie Buss, a senior research associate at the Citizens Research Council of Michigan, a nonpartisan public policy group, said the state would have to appoint an emergency financial manager for the city who could decide to pursue Chapter 9 municipal bankruptcy as long as the state does not block the move. The city of 700,000 has been hard hit by a steep population drop, years of severe budget deficits and escalating employee costs -- factors that led state officials to begin an intervention process about a year ago. Detroit was able to avoid the appointment of an emergency manager by signing a consent agreement earlier this year that gives the state some oversight. Progress under that deal has been slow, while a 2011 law that was used to craft parts of the agreement, including the ability to suspend collective bargaining agreements with unions, was repealed by Michigan voters on November 6. To take its place, state officials resurrected a former, weaker emergency manager law -- sparking a flurry of litigation challenging the move. Terry Stanton, a spokesman for Michigan's Treasury Department, said Moody's downgrades of Detroit underscore the importance of having "a mechanism in place that can assist municipalities and school districts experiencing financial stress or in the midst of a financial emergency." Governor Rick Snyder, who has expressed concern that repeal of the emergency manager law could open the door to municipal bankruptcy in his state, has been talking with legislative leaders about crafting a new law that could potentially be passed during a lame-duck session this month.

By all accounts, Republican lawmakers, led by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), had the report killed. But the ongoing effort to find out exactly what happened continues. Democrats still want to know why the Congressional Research Service withdrew a report that found no correlation between top tax rates and economic growth. Their suspicion that it might have been because of Republican political pressure is being piqued by internal correspondence between CRS officials and senior GOP aides. A series of email exchanges from Sept. 25 and Sept. 26 obtained by Roll Call reveals displeasure among staffers for Senate Finance ranking Republican Orrin G. Hatch of Utah and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. For weeks, the official Republican line has been that GOP policymakers and even folks outside Capitol Hill raised concerns about the economic report, but did not explicitly call for the analysis to be withdrawn. Roll Call's report features a series of complaints between Republican Senate aides, including one in which a McConnell aide specifically lamented "partisans" misusing the CRS's conclusions, adding that "a retraction should be considered." Arguably more damaging is an email from a high-ranking CRS employee, who told a colleague at the time, "Now they are asking for the report to come down," in reference to Hatch and McConnell staffers. This is consistent with what Thomas Hungerford, the CRS researcher who produced the report, told the Huffington Post earlier this month: the analysis was taken down due to "pressure from the Senate minority." In other words, the GOP denials about the Congressional Research Service are looking a little shaky. As for the bigger picture, I suspect this seems like inside baseball -- most folks have probably never even heard of the Congressional Research Service -- but I continue to believe it matters. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- To reiterate a point from earlier in the month, it's important to understand that the Congressional Research Service, generally recognized as Congress' own think tank, has a well-deserved reputation for non-partisanship. The CRS is counted on to provide lawmakers with the most reliable and accurate information available, and the notion that partisan lawmakers can pressure, censor, and possibly even intimidate independent researchers is simply unacceptable. In other words, we just can't have public offices' scholarship being stifled because Republicans find reality politically inconvenient. Our system of government isn't supposed to work this way. Republicans have adopted trickle-down, supply-side economics as the foundation for their entire worldview.

By all accounts, Republican lawmakers, led by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), had the report killed. But the ongoing effort to find out exactly what happened continues. Democrats still want to know why the Congressional Research Service withdrew a report that found no correlation between top tax rates and economic growth. Their suspicion that it might have been because of Republican political pressure is being piqued by internal correspondence between CRS officials and senior GOP aides. A series of email exchanges from Sept. 25 and Sept. 26 obtained by Roll Call reveals displeasure among staffers for Senate Finance ranking Republican Orrin G. Hatch of Utah and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. For weeks, the official Republican line has been that GOP policymakers and even folks outside Capitol Hill raised concerns about the economic report, but did not explicitly call for the analysis to be withdrawn. Roll Call's report features a series of complaints between Republican Senate aides, including one in which a McConnell aide specifically lamented "partisans" misusing the CRS's conclusions, adding that "a retraction should be considered." Arguably more damaging is an email from a high-ranking CRS employee, who told a colleague at the time, "Now they are asking for the report to come down," in reference to Hatch and McConnell staffers. This is consistent with what Thomas Hungerford, the CRS researcher who produced the report, told the Huffington Post earlier this month: the analysis was taken down due to "pressure from the Senate minority." In other words, the GOP denials about the Congressional Research Service are looking a little shaky. As for the bigger picture, I suspect this seems like inside baseball -- most folks have probably never even heard of the Congressional Research Service -- but I continue to believe it matters. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- To reiterate a point from earlier in the month, it's important to understand that the Congressional Research Service, generally recognized as Congress' own think tank, has a well-deserved reputation for non-partisanship. The CRS is counted on to provide lawmakers with the most reliable and accurate information available, and the notion that partisan lawmakers can pressure, censor, and possibly even intimidate independent researchers is simply unacceptable. In other words, we just can't have public offices' scholarship being stifled because Republicans find reality politically inconvenient. Our system of government isn't supposed to work this way.
