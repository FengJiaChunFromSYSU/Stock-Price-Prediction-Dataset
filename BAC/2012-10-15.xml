Amex Bluebird will not have much of an impact on GDOT revenue and they are going to get considerable new revenue from Sallie Mae offering new "My Flex Card" prepaid debit MasterCard (MA), in partnership with Green Dot (GDOT) ..

For all the numbers that I consider on a daily basis, this is the one that is tough for me to wrap my brain around. How can we casually be talking about $16 trillion? No matter what your political leanings, Senator Alan Simpson from Wyoming put it in to perspective on CNBC last week when asked by Steve Liesman about the debt. STEVE LIESMAN: Senator, if you were in a position now to be advising both candidates, what would you have them say now about the deficit, particularly in light there's a vice presidential debate this evening. What would you like to hear from them? ALAN SIMPSON: Well, I think I'd want to tell them what a trillion bucks is. I know that's a silly exercise. Just say-- well, let me tell you something about us-- this country. If you spend a-- if you spend a buck a second, you wouldn't hit a trillion for 32,500 years. And if you spend a million a day since the birth of Christ, you wouldn't be at a trillion. And the big bang theory of the universe happened 13 billion 600 million years ago, that ain't even close to a trillion. And we owe 16 of those babies! So start thinking. And then you're going to borrow $3,600,000,000 a day, every day. You're going to do that today, tomorrow. Every buck you spend, you borrow 41 cents. And I would say, "Will one of you-- let a peep out of yourself of what you're going to do about that and to restore the solvency of Social Security without letting the A.A.R.P. tear your leg off or Grover Norquist on the other side rip the other let.

I will not respond in kind, I will not respond in personal attacks, I do not think they want america to Go down, I think they just don't know any better, and that this is the only way they know to respond.

Think about it he stops or slows drilling in American while giving billions to South America to drill. I could go on for hours with these examples. Wake up please. I am all American, served in Vietnam as a Marine. I care, and Obama is destoying America from within. It took a geberation to get their people in office. Now look at the results. Go ahead blame Bush. He probably did start the financial problems,But Obama was supposed to improve that situation. Bush delt with 911 and made decisions to prevent more tragedy for us. He made mistakes that cost us money, but no more tragedy or attack. In my opinion Bush did his part a at a huge cost. Now Obama should solve the financial problems. Would you rather Obama have 911 and Romney solve the financial end. Think about it, Obama inherits 911 . What should be esier and safer to solve. 911 or Financial situation.

Any of you that track BAC using technical charts, set your charts to show Bollinger Bands YTD. For those with less technical trading knowledge (not that I am an expert), Bollinger Bands are a fantastic way to measure price strength. The wider the bands, the more volatile the price per share. If the bands begin to narrow, this shows price movability steadying (usually in preparation for a BIG move). It is worth noting that as of right now, the Bollinger Bands on the YTD are extremely narrow by comparison to most of the rest of the year. The Bollinger Bands have narrowed this much two times since January. Immediately following the bands forming this narrow of a gap, the movements were as follows: CASE 1: Late February -- Early March. Bands narrow. Price per share moves from $7.71 on March 6 to the 52 week high of $10.10 on March 19. Price per share movement of ~$2.40 in over 13 days. CASE 2: Late August -- Early September. Bands narrow. Price per share moves from $7.95 on September 5 to a high of $9.79 on September 14. Price per share movement of ~$1.85 in 9 days. If this analysis is correct, a move from our current price (~$9.40) to $12.00 is not only possible, some may argue that it is probable in the next couple weeks. If we get lucky, $12.00 could only be the beginning of this stock taking a serious move to the upside. My opinion: Technical breakout seems to be on its way.

The “balanced budget” was certainly not something GW showed any concern for nor did the 2001-2006 Republican controlled Congress. GW made it clear during his 2000 campaign that he had no concern for the deficit, there is a surplus and it is your money so if I win tax cuts for everyone. I use quotes around “balanced budget” because it only existed during Clintons administration due to payroll tax contributions (Social Security, etc.) exceeding outgoing payments, in reality even Clinton ran deficits. It is my understanding that the last President not to add to the deficit was Eisenhower.

Not only is the economy is improving, but there’s no reason to trust Romney’s claim he would improve it more quickly. He’s given no specifics about how he’d pay for his massive tax cut for the wealthy, or what he’d replace ObamaCare with, or how he’d regulate Wall Street if he repeals Dodd-Frank. His record to date has flip-flopped on every major issue. Why should Americans trust his assertions? 2. Our problems require we pull together, but Romney and his party want to pull us apart. Romney has praised Arizona’s draconian anti-immigration law profiling Hispanics, and has called for “voluntary deportation” by making life intolerable for undocumented workers. He is against equal marriage rights. He wants to ban abortions, and his party and running mate want to ban them even in the case of rape or incest. He’s determined to make the rich richer and the rest of us poorer. Romney is beholden to a radical right-wing Republican party that is out of step with most of America. 3. Romney’s “reverse Robin Hood” agenda is inappropriate at a time when the wealthy are taking home a larger share of total income and wealth than they have in a century, and when the middle class is still struggling. He wants to cut taxes on the rich by almost $5 trillion – which inevitably means higher taxes on the rest of us; and over 60 percent of its budget cuts come out of programs for the poor and working middle class. He’s determined to turn Medicare into vouchers whose value won’t keep up with rising healthcare costs, and turn Medicaid over to cash-starved states. His comment about “47 percent” of Americans not paying taxes and taking government handouts was not only wrong (every working person pays payroll taxes, and every consumer pays sales taxes; and the biggest so-called “entitlements” are Social Security and Medicare, which are insurance programs that Americans pay for during their working years). The comment also reveals a callousness and divisiveness that’s the opposite of what we need now. Romney wants to set Wall Street loose again when the Street’s greed got us into the mess we’re still trying to get out of. 4. Romney views America as if it was one huge corporation, but we’re not a corporation; we’re a nation. He says corporations are people; touts his years at Bain as if making companies profitable qualifies him to be president; wants to deregulate corporations and Wall Street; and assumes CEOs and the wealthy are “job creators,” and if we cut their taxes they’ll have more incentive to create jobs. None of this is true. The nation exists to make lives better for all its people – making sure that corporations treat their workers as assets to be developed rather than as costs to be cut. Companies have been slow to create jobs not because of insufficient profits but because of inadequate customers. The vast American middle class are the real job creators, but they don’t have enough money in their pockets because too many companies have broken the basic bargain linking wages to productivity. 5. On foreign policy, Romney wants to rush to judgment, blaming the administration for not acting quickly enough in Libya on scant information. But that rush-to-judgment mentality is exactly what got us into Iraq eight years ago on the pretext of “weapons of mass destruction.” Two days ago we marked the 50th anniversary of the Cuban missile crisis. Had John F. Kennedy rushed to judgment as Romney wants to, humankind would have been obliterated in a nuclear holocaust. Be indignant, but measured and steady – as you naturally are. Practice your closing (your last closing was listless) so the nation can see clearly the choice: We’re all in it together, or we’re on our own.

Face Scrutiny</Title><Msg>Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney’s new assertiveness on national security and taxes may have hit a couple of hurdles. In the latest development, the father of Christopher Stevens, the U.S. ambassador to Libya who was killed in the Sept. 11, 2012 attack in Benghazi, said over the weekend that his son’s death shouldn’t be an issue in the campaign. On domestic issues, the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation last week took a closer look at Romney’s tax proposals — and raised renewed skepticism about whether they can be achieved without requiring middle class families to pay more. David Redlawsk, a political science professor at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N.J., said as Romney gains some traction in the race, he will also face more scrutiny. “When it looks like you are going to lose, there is in a sense a lot less pressure,” Redlawsk said. “Once you are trending up, the attention changes.” The developments may influence how aggressive and specific Romney, 65, is in the next meeting with Obama, 51. They are set to hold their second debate 9 p.m. Tuesday at Hofstra University in Hempstead, N.Y. It will be a town hall format, which will allow audience questions on a full range of issues. Romney’s foreign policy stances — most notably his criticism of the White House’s handling of the Libya attack — drew new attention this weekend after the ambassador’s father warned against politicizing the tragedy. “It would really be abhorrent to make this into a campaign issue,” Jan Stevens, 77, said in an Oct. 13 telephone interview from his home in Loomis, Calif. He asked politicians to allow a formal investigation to conclude before laying blame. While Stevens stopped short of criticizing Romney by name, Obama surrogates on Sunday talk shows seized on his comments to Bloomberg News. Obama campaign strategist David Axelrod said on “Fox News Sunday” that Romney is “working hard to exploit this issue.” Robert Gibbs, senior adviser to the Obama campaign, said on CNN’s “State of the Union” program that Romney is “playing politics with this issue” and “we don’t need wing-tip cowboys.” Romney campaign adviser Ed Gillespie said on Fox that it’s legitimate to ask questions because the administration’s story is “constantly shifting,” while Republican Ohio Senator Rob Portman said on ABC’s “This Week” program that the administration has yet to explain why adequate security wasn’t in place in Benghazi. In light of the statements by the ambassador’s father, Romney must show that he’s “sensitive to the grieving father” and that he can “come across as presidential and not merely political,” said Peter Feaver, a political scientist at Duke University who served as director for Defense Policy and Arms Control at the National Security Council during the Clinton administration. Romney must do more than just criticize the administration for failing to provide enough security at the compound if he wants to gain an advantage, Feaver said. “He has to show that he understands the broader strategic context. The opportunity is for him to present a compelling analysis of the threats we face in the Middle East.” The Romney campaign on Oct. 10 issued a statement expressing respect for the wishes of the mother of Glen Doherty, who also died in the attack on the U.S. consulate in Libya. Doherty’s mother had criticized Romney for telling the story of meeting her son at campaign stops. In addition to adding nuance to his Libya criticism, Romney is under pressure to begin filling in his tax proposals. The committee released on Oct. 12 an estimate that raised new doubts about Romney’s call for a 20 percent income-tax rate cut that he says would be paid for by limiting deductions, credits and exemptions. The findings released by the panel, Congress’ nonpartisan scorekeeper, show immediate repeal of some of the most popular tax benefits would pay for only a 4 percent cut in U.S. income tax rates. Romney says he can broaden the tax base and create enough economic growth to offset his tax cuts, while Obama maintains it’s mathematically impossible. Romney would need either to raise middle-class taxes or increase the deficit, Obama charges. While there are major differences between the assumptions underlying Romney’s plan and the committee study, the findings emphasize shortcomings in Romney’s approach, said Daniel Shaviro, a tax law professor at New York University. While polls indicate that voters say Obama would do a better job on foreign policy issues, Republicans point to surveys showing that voters are less satisfied since the assault in Libya. The Obama administration was “trying to sell a narrative about the Mideast that the wars are receding and that al-Qaida was being defeated” until the Sept. 11 attack in Benghazi, which killed Stevens and three other Americans, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said yesterday on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” U.S. intelligence officials say they are investigating whether the Libyan militia group suspected of carrying out the assault, Ansar al-Sharia, has operational ties to al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb, a loose-knit extremist group that’s made inroads in Niger, Mali, and other North African nations. Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said “we don’t have substantial evidence yet” on exactly what transpired." ---------------- Romney is UNFIT to become president... given his background of lying and flip-flops and acting as a critic of the genuine and intelligent Obama! His posturing is not going to stand the close scrutiny he will get... since his last debate where the President acted passive and in contrast Romney look good on the surface though lacking in substance and being questionable... in the larger issues.</Msg><Username>giovannijay</Username><Timestamp>1350340179912</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 18:29:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350340255177-250</Id><Topic><Title>ANY PERSON WHO SUPPORTS ROMNEY AT THIS STAGE NEED THEIR HEAD EXAMINED</Title><Username>farawaylife</Username><Timestamp>1350336990950</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 17:36:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You must be a Racist to say such things.

Also BAC laying off all the extra employes it picked up in all the mergers going back ten years is a big deal also. Most effective is the retiring of old prefered shares. I just love to new rules that prefered shares are treated badly under basel III and common shares are finaly treated with more respect.

As we work to secure our personnel and facilities, we have confirmed that one of our State Department officers was killed. We are heartbroken by this terrible loss. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and those who have suffered in this attack. This evening, I called Libyan President Magariaf to coordinate additional support to protect Americans in Libya. President Magariaf expressed his condemnation and condolences and pledged his government’s full cooperation. Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior as a response to inflammatory material posted on the Internet. The United States deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs of others. Our commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation. But let me be clear: There is never any justification for violent acts of this kind. In light of the events of today, the United States government is working with partner countries around the world to protect our personnel, our missions, and American citizens worldwide."

I reviewed that self-aggrandizing tome of Romney's on this site over a year ago. Let me refresh your memory: Book Review: "No Apology"/Mitt Romney By fish2kill . May 22, 2011 9:40 AM . Permalink Mitt Romney claims in his book "No Apology: The Case for American Greatness" that populist groups have demonized business people, CEOs, Wall Street, and the highly educated. He could hardly have struck a more elitist tone, or elicited less sympathy. A better title for his work would be "Trickle-Down Redux: Recycling A Failed Theory". Mitt sounds like a wealthy cattle baron explaining to the herd why ranchers and cowboys shouldn’t be reviled for eating so much steak. He and the crew have worked so hard (branding, slaughtering and butchering cows), and have such big hearts (feeding cows who don’t work) that they deserve to eat well. In Romney’s view, the problem is that cows are stupid. Mitt thinks if cows were smarter, they’d acknowledge his genius by running to the slaughterhouses instead of dragging their feet. The resulting improvements in margins would enable Romney and his friends to expand their ranches and provide similar opportunities for even more cows. Ranchers and cowboys would then deserve and demand veal; their consumption of steak would decline; and a bovine utopia would ensue. Romney should actually be worrying about those cows getting any smarter. They might realize that learning how to use pitchforks, and learning how to avoid gagging on patrician meat, would better serve their interests. Instead of regurgitating Mitt's claims and creating fictitious 'democratagogue' demons, why not write your own review of "No Apology"? ROTFLMAO I know, your approach IS the simpler one.</Msg><Username>fish2kill</Username><Timestamp>1350355241777</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 22:40:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350355369683-350</Id><Topic><Title>TOMORROW NIGHT MITT ROMNEY WILL SEAL THE DEAL AND OBAMA WILL NEVER RECOVER!!!</Title><Username>milesed18</Username><Timestamp>1350354633788</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 22:30:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The young people today are complete idiots.

He picked David Copperfield as his Treasury Secretary! That was approved by the GOP. Ryan likes the choice... even Sarah Palin told a reporter he was happy with it. David gives fantastic performances on stage and does magical wonders... just like Romney did in his first debate! He won that debate handsomely! His popularity went high and the polls show it. Performance is what counts. The details must remain secret. People should wait to see the details... that have to be worked with Congress. David will lead the process. I'm impressed... and as an independent I owe it to myself to think again who should get my vote!-:)</Msg><Username>giovannijay</Username><Timestamp>1350356589947</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 23:03:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350356693488-359</Id><Topic><Title>Beware of Republican election fraud.</Title><Username>urbansquall</Username><Timestamp>1349098668930</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 09:37:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Repugs will do whatever they can to obstruct Democrats from voting.

I remember sitting in front of the TV watching his speech a few days after 9/11, and had just remarked to my wife that Bush was sounding surprisingly presidential, when he launched into the 'long war on terror' and 'axis of evil' rave. I immediately blurted "What an idiot!", and my wife asked what was wrong. "He's declaring an undeclared war against a stateless, nameless, unidentifiable foe, and is about to mire us on the losing end of an asymmetric battle. The terrorists should be pursued either covertly, or under existing RICO statutes." I suppose that's sufficient grounds for questioning my patriotism, but being right is not a reliable indicator of bias. ROTFLMAO I can understand you might not have found yourself in that position very often.</Msg><Username>fish2kill</Username><Timestamp>1350357263415</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 23:14:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350357504707-362</Id><Topic><Title>I am not better off...I spend all my money on gasonline, food and health insurance all have gone up huge</Title><Username>bobbykennedy500</Username><Timestamp>1350319558005</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 12:45:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>even crack hoes charge more</Msg><Username>rkmtt</Username><Timestamp>1350357504707</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 23:18:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350357856603-363</Id><Topic><Title>A democratagogue or rabble-rouser is a political leader who appeals to the emotions, prejudices and ignorance of the poorer and less-educated classes in order to gain power.</Title><Username>mrstan4089</Username><Timestamp>1350353955796</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 22:19:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This post is old garbage; stop trying to pass it off as recyclable trash.
