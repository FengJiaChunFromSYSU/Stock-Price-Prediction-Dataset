All millionaires trust Mitt... who the hell wants to pay more taxes. Hmm... isn't Mitt shmart? He thinks he should be rewarded for his shmartness and become president. Indeed, should he succeed in his wishes, he would set a precedent as a millionaire president without any understanding of what the working class goes through to just keep body and soul together. He can't be blamed for his lack of understanding... he was born to riches and affluence and never faced any hardships and real challenges in his life. The only big challenge in his life is right now trying to snatch the presidency from a President Obama who is too intelligent and experienced for the likes of Mitt Romneys and Sarah Palins of the GOP! What a bankrupt party!</Msg><Username>johnmjay</Username><Timestamp>1351139678082</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 00:34:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351140143610-8</Id><Topic><Title>Why don't Governor Romney show us his tax returns for the past 10 years?...</Title><Username>jbhdallas2000</Username><Timestamp>1351137819455</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 00:03:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks.

States rights has never gone away as an issue in the south and will continue to divide the country between those who want a strong union and those who want more local control. The republicans became the party of the confederates when the dixiecrats fled the democrat party during the civil rights era. Racial and societal inequality is still a cornorstone of the southern culture of the landed aristocracy as they hang on to their "good old boy" and debutant mentality with private schools replacing public education to effect segregation. Always a culture of privilege rather than of law the only way they can continue is by eliminating federal oversight of their activities.

Obama's attitude and the perception that the people in his administration would rather lie than tell the truth about any issue really, really bothers me. Too much coverup for bad decisions made in all areas of what the Obama Administration attempts to control with an iron fist. Additionally, too much socialism does not mix with what has to be done to get the Country back on healthy ground.

Driven by high prices and new drilling methods, U.S. production of crude and other liquid hydrocarbons is on track to rise 7 percent this year to an average of 10.9 million barrels per day. This will be the fourth straight year of crude increases and the biggest single-year gain since 1951. The boom has surprised even the experts. "Five years ago, if I or anyone had predicted today's production growth, people would have thought we were crazy," says Jim Burkhard, head of oil markets research at IHS CERA, an energy consulting firm. The Energy Department forecasts that U.S. production of crude and other liquid hydrocarbons, which includes biofuels, will average 11.4 million barrels per day next year. That would be a record for the U.S. and just below Saudi Arabia's output of 11.6 million barrels. Citibank (C) forecasts U.S. production could reach 13 million to 15 million barrels per day by 2020, helping to make North America "the new Middle East."</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1351162635464</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 06:57:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351163090481-54</Id><Topic><Title>Neither Candidate has offered a plan</Title><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1351160503094</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 06:21:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Your perception of lying and coverup is a bit stilted and unjustified.

I do not think a Southern sweep by Romney is indicative of a subtle racism on any large scale afforded by the anonymity of the closed voting booth. I do believe it has a lot to do w/a die hard preference for states rights and local rule. Even though the Civil War ended, the idea of a union, or big government, or federal oversight was never embraced by the South. That ideology has been passed from generation to generation in political thought. Each individual state has strong identity; heck in many southern states it is hard to be accepted as part of the community if you have not lived there for at least 20 years. Florida is the exception to that given the massive immigration to that state by all socioeconomic and ethnic groups largely due to weather and tax considerations.</Msg><Username>roboklerk</Username><Timestamp>1351166749755</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 08:05:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351167681047-59</Id><Title>Bain Capital borrowed money from banks, saving &amp; loans, and mortgage companies to pay</Title><Msg>for Mitt Romney $150 million annual salary and $60 million oversea properties!

We were in the one of the worst recessions we had seen in recent times, close to a depression.” “The fiscal system was collapsing: Wall Street was in chaos, we had 800,000 jobs lost in that first month of the Obama administration,” he said. “Unemployment peaked at 10 percent, so we were in real trouble. The auto industry was collapsing, housing was started to collapse, and we were in very difficult straits. “And I saw over the next several years stabilization come back in the financial community,” Powell added. “Housing is now starting to come back after four years; it's starting to pick up. Consumer confidence is rising." The four-star general also said that Obama “got us out of one war, started to get us out of a second war, and did not get us into any new wars.” “The actions he has taken in respect to protecting us from terrorism have been very solid,” Powell said. “We ought to keep on the track we are on.” Powell served as secretary of state during George W. Bush’s first term. He was also national security adviser in the last years of the Reagan administration and chairman of the joint chiefs of staff from 1989-1993. He told CBS he still considers himself a Republican. "I think I'm a Republican of a more moderate mold — that's something of a dying breed I'm sorry to say." During his CBS appearance, Powell criticized GOP candidate Mitt Romney’s foreign policy, saying his positions in Monday night’s debate were “quite different from what he said earlier.” "I'm not quite sure which Governor Romney we would be getting with respect to foreign policy," he added. “One day he has a certain strong view about staying in Afghanistan but then on Monday night he agrees with the withdrawal — same thing in Iraq.” On Romney’s domestic policy, Powell said, "As I listen to what his proposals are especially with respect to dealing with respect to our most significant issue — the economy — it's essentially: ‘Let's cut taxes and compensate for that with other things,’ but that compensation does not cover all the cuts intended or the new expenses associated with defense." Note: Colin Powell is among the few in GOP that has gained some of trust, after being INSTRUMENTAL in GWB adm. taking our nation to invade Iraq on LIES! However, GOP itself is not to be TRUSTED!</Msg><Username>giovannijay</Username><Timestamp>1351194920588</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 15:55:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351195358393-240</Id><Topic><Title>Bank of America Corporation(BAC)</Title><Username>catinaotlln68120</Username><Timestamp>1351164961655</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 07:36:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I just joined.</Msg><Username>dorthycoljb29370</Username><Timestamp>1351195358393</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 16:02:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351196476922-241</Id><Topic><Title>Colin Powell Backs Obama for Second Term</Title><Username>giovannijay</Username><Timestamp>1351194920588</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 15:55:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Gen.

As Election Day nears, Mitt Romney is drawing large and excited throngs. Look to dusty Iowa cornfields, rain-soaked Virginia parks, the muddy fields of the Shelby County Fairgrounds, where a crowd of 9,500 - almost half of this western Ohio town - gathered among the barns and stables on a frigid October evening this week to glimpse the Republican presidential contender. Romney's debate performance against President Barack Obama last week - and his energetic appearances following it up - have fueled a rise in enthusiasm on the campaign trail. Whether or not it will translate into votes, polls do suggest that Republicans are fired up. It's a welcome development for the Republican businessman, who is hardly a natural politician and has long struggled to match Obama's ability to inspire excitement.

The majority of decent voters in our nation NO MORE TRUST the GOP. Proof? GWB gave us 911, TWO WARS, a FINANCIAL DISASTER and still have not LEARNED their lesson! And to add insult to injury, the GOP clowns (TP &amp; Sen. McConnell, John Boehner, etc.) played OBSTRUCTION against a historic president shamelessly announcing the same to our nation and the world that they would do that JUST TO WIN, while HURTING our nation and our economy!

A Bank of America branch in Manhattan. The Justice Department took aim at a home loan program known as the "hustle." 9:34 p.m. | Updated Five years after the housing market crumbled, government officials are still trying to assign blame for the problems that fueled the mortgage boom and bust. On Wednesday, federal prosecutors in New York took aim at Bank of America. They accused it of carrying out a scheme, started by its Countrywide Financial unit, that defrauded government-backed mortgage agencies by churning out loans at a rapid pace without proper controls. In a civil suit, prosecutors seek to collect at least $1 billion in penalties from the bank as compensation for the behavior that they say forced taxpayers to guarantee billions in bad loans. Financial firms have been battling chaotic — and at times redundant — litigation related to the mortgage mess. The cases have come from a patchwork of federal agencies, state officials and shareholder suits, some of which have been resolved in multibillion-dollar settlements.

Related Links Documents: Bank of America Complaint Video: Assigning Blame for Mortgage Bust . “They never know who’s going to be coming after them next,” said Dan Hurson, a former federal prosecutor who now defends securities cases. “There’s no central traffic cop.” Still, the public has been frustrated with the limited number of criminal actions that have been filed since the financial crisis. Few cases have taken aim at top executives. Even in the latest case against Bank of America, no company officials were sued as part of the complaint. Angelo R. Mozilo, the former chief executive of Countrywide Financial, never faced criminal charges but did agree in 2010 to pay $67.5 million to settle a civil fraud case brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mr. Hurson said that the government had yet to overcome the notion that federal authorities were reluctant to pursue the top rungs of Wall Street. The criminal actions to come from the crisis, he noted, have focused on “small-time operators.” The government, however, has contended that it has aggressively pursued mortgage fraud. As the legal deadline approaches for filing crisis-related cases, President Obama formed a mortgage task force to investigate wrongdoing. The unit recently announced its first case, taking action against JPMorgan Chase over mortgage deals created by Bear Stearns, the firm that JPMorgan bought during the crisis. The legal problems for Bank of America, however, have taken a deeper financial toll, costing the bank billions in write-downs and settlements. Much of its problems stem from its takeover of Countrywide Financial, once the nation’s largest mortgage lender. The bank also struck a $2.4 billion deal in September to settle a class-action lawsuit over shareholder claims that it misled investors about the 2009 purchase of Merrill Lynch. In the lawsuit on Wednesday, the Justice Department attacked a home loan program known as the “hustle,” which the bank inherited from Countrywide in 2008 and kept alive through 2009. Prosecutors say the venture was a symbol of Wall Street’s slipshod standards during the mortgage bubble. According to the lawsuit, Countrywide rubber-stamped mortgage loans to risky borrowers and passed them on to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two government-controlled mortgage financial giants that guaranteed the loans. The two entities were ultimately stuck with heavy losses and a glut of foreclosed properties. “The fraudulent conduct alleged in today’s complaint was spectacularly brazen in scope,” Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, said in a statement. “This lawsuit should send another clear message that reckless lending practices will not be tolerated.” Mr. Bharara filed the civil suit along with the inspector general of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The government watchdog for the bank bailout program, the special inspector general for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, also joined the complaint. In a statement, a Bank of America spokesman said the bank “has stepped up and acted responsibly to resolve legacy mortgage matters; the claim that we have failed to repurchase loans from Fannie Mae is simply false.” The spokesman, Lawrence Grayson, added, “At some point, Bank of America can’t be expected to compensate every entity that claims losses that actually were caused by the economic downturn.” The case builds on a broader federal crackdown of Wall Street that continues years after the onset of the crisis. In a last-ditch effort to hold financial firms accountable, Mr. Bharara this month sued Wells Fargo over questionable mortgage deals. The assertions in the Bank of America suit, however, do not shed much new light on the mortgage mess. The Federal Housing Finance Agency last year sued 17 big banks over losses sustained by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac over different mortgage-related products. The twin mortgage finance companies, also bailed out by taxpayers in 2008 and still controlled by the government, continue to push firms like Bank of America to repurchase billions of dollars in bad loans. The flurry of litigation, which comes on the cusp of the presidential election, has caused some on Wall Street to question whether the effort is rooted in political motivations. Other white-collar lawyers say the complaints rehash old claims put forth by private investors. JPMorgan says that the government urged it to buy Bear Stearns, a defense that does not apply to Bank of America, which acquired Countrywide as part of an aggressive expansion effort. Still, a lawyer close to the Bank of America case, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the case was continuing, argued that the bank had already repaid Fannie Mae for some of the soured loans in question. Other loans, this person argued, were never before disputed by Fannie Mae. The lawsuit threatens to impose steep fines on the bank. The Justice Department filed the case under the False Claims Act, which could provide for triple the damages suffered by Fannie and Freddie, a penalty that could reach more than $3 billion. The act also provides an avenue for a Countrywide whistle-blower, Edward J. O’Donnell, to cash in. Under the act, the government can piggyback on accusations he filed in a lawsuit that was kept under seal until now. Mr. O’Donnell, who lives in Pennsylvania, was an executive vice president for Countrywide before leaving the company in 2009. The government’s case in part hinges on the credibility of his claims. In the 46-page lawsuit, prosecutors contend that Countrywide abandoned its lending standards in 2007 with the creation of the “hustle” program. Short for “HSSL,” or “High-Speed Swim Lane,” the program adopted the motto “move forward, never backward,” prosecutors said, citing Countrywide documents. With the goal of generating a high number of loans, Countrywide tore down internal controls known as tollgates that were in place to slow the mortgage process and root out risky borrowers. The firm at one point removed trained underwriters from the loan process, opting instead to rely on “unqualified and inexperienced” loan processors. At times, prosecutors claim, loan processors crossed a legal line. Some “repeatedly did manipulate” loan forms, jotting down higher incomes for borrowers so they would qualify for Fannie Mae’s standards. By early 2008, the lax standards started to show. More than a third of the unit’s loans were defective, a significant jump over the industry standard of about 5 percent. Despite the poor performance, prosecutors said, the bank sold the loans to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and “concealed the defect rates and continued the hustle.”</Msg><Username>vinesandweb</Username><Timestamp>1351204981664</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 18:43:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351205109578-286</Id><Title>MESSAGE TO GIOVANNI JAY</Title><Msg>Since you didn't allow my post in reference to your nasty comment about me; I have been recently diagnosed with cancer.

A new USA Today/Gallup poll has Romney leading President Obama by 4 percentage points among likely voters in 12 battleground states. The reason? USA Today says women in these swing states are moving Mitt's way. Time Magazine's Mark Halperin is also reporting tonight in an Electoral College update that a top Democratic source is worrying for the first time that Ohio may be slipping out of the Obama column and moving toward the tossup pile.</Msg><Username>bury_obama</Username><Timestamp>1351207526569</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 19:25:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351207613583-292</Id><Topic><Title>PRESIDENT OBAMA CALLS MITT ROMNEY BULLSHITTER in Rolling Stone Interview</Title><Username>urichey</Username><Timestamp>1351206405114</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 19:06:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama is a pathetically small man</Msg><Username>bury_obama</Username><Timestamp>1351207613583</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 19:26:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351207945580-293</Id><Topic><Title>Bank of America Corporation(BAC)</Title><Username>catinaotlln68120</Username><Timestamp>1351164961655</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 07:36:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You are the best.</Msg><Username>charolettemawnb81362</Username><Timestamp>1351207945580</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 19:32:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351208108340-294</Id><Topic><Title>If Obama is RE-ELECTED</Title><Username>ollienorthwest</Username><Timestamp>1351202163679</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 17:56:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I definitely leave the stock market!</Msg><Username>parisonr</Username><Timestamp>1351208108340</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 19:35:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351208339190-295</Id><Title>I Will Pay $10,000 If Trump Gives Me The Names Of The First 50 Men That Had Sex With His Wife ..</Title><Msg>Trump, the names do not have to be in order and you can use men's names from Wife#1,Wife#2,Wife#3, that should make it easy.. you dirt bag, if it wasn't for the money your father left you, you would be a Bum ..</Msg><Username>fireundersmoke</Username><Timestamp>1351208339190</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 19:38:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351208591638-296</Id><Title>NEW FOX NEWS POLL RELEASED!!!!</Title><Msg>99% of of men convicted of rape support the republican party</Msg><Username>carolyne47</Username><Timestamp>1351208591638</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 19:43:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351208765228-297</Id><Title>SHOCKING NEWS UNCOVERED BY RNC</Title><Msg>The rnc has uncovered a shocking fact that will, they are afraid, have a neg.

If they are found guilty, $1B is the first of many problems, including state lawsuits, shareholder lawsuits, and class action mortgage holders. BofA will have to split and sell companies at deep discounts, and spends even more than the $1.6B currently reserved for legal costs. It's going to get really ugly.

Uber-lib late night talk show host David Letterman is one of President Barack Obama’s biggest supporters and Kool-aid drinkers. However, Letterman, said on Tuesday’s Late Show that he was “upset” and “discouraged” that President Obama during Monday’s debate lied about Mitt Romney wanting to let Detroit go bankrupt. OUCH!!! Even David Letterman sees Obama is the Lying King. It appears that Letterman is upset and discouraged that Obama was caught lying. Really Dave? Like this is the first time Obama has lied? If Letterman wants a president who does not lie, he can always vote for Romney.</Msg><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1351211726499</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 20:35:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351211764832-335</Id><Topic><Title>PRESIDENT OBAMA CALLS MITT ROMNEY BULLSHITTER in Rolling Stone Interview</Title><Username>urichey</Username><Timestamp>1351206405114</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 19:06:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Traitors are those who OBSTRUCT going forward to help our economy ash hole! m Soon, not only we will re-elect President Obama, but we will also get rid of many GOP reps in Congress...

Powell, a retired four-star general who served as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the George H.W. Bush administration before becoming George W. Bush’s top diplomat, told CBS’s “This Morning” that “I voted for [Obama] in 2008, and I plan to stick with him in 2012. I’ll be voting for he [sic] and for Vice President Joe Biden next month.” Powell credited President Obama for stabilizing the financial system, ending the war in Iraq, and beginning to end the war in Afghanistan. By contrast, Powell criticized Romney’s economic plans and expressed concern that Romney is a “moving target” on foreign policy. “The governor who was speaking on Monday night at the debate was saying things that were quite different from what he said earlier,” Powell said. “So I’m not quite sure which Governor Romney we would be getting in terms of foreign policy.” “Sometimes I don’t sense that he has thought through these issues as thoroughly as he should have,” Powell added. “And he gets advice from his campaign staff that he then has to adjust and modify as he goes along.” Predictably, many on the right could not accept that Powell — who maintains that he is still a Republican despite endorsing both of Obama’s presidential runs — could have serious policy reasons for supporting the president. Instead, the fringe came up with the same answer that they embrace to explain almost every Obama-related event: it’s all about race. A brief scan of right wing message boards and media figures reveals the ugly strain of racism that lurks barely beneath the surface of many hyper-partisan criticisms of the president. Note that no Caucasian is ever labeled as a racist for endorsing a white candidate. Some mainstream Republicans were also critical of Powell’s endorsement. Arizona Senator John McCain went on Brian Kilmeade’s radio show this morning and slammed Powell’s decision, saying “General Powell, you disappoint us and you have harmed your legacy even further by defending what is clearly the most feckless foreign policy in my lifetime.” This is an especially interesting critique, given that Powell is the man who stood before the United Nations in 2003 and made the disastrously faulty case for an invasion of Iraq. Powell considers the incident to be a “blot” on his record that will always be “painful” to him. If anyone would understand the value of restraint — which McCain and his colleagues in the Republican foreign policy establishment tend to consider “feckless” — it would be a man like Powell, who has seen firsthand what type of damage Romney and his foreign policy team can do. Note: Any body with ave. intelligence and above actually has no other choice IF THEY ARE SERIOUS ABOUT OUR NATION but to vote for the RE-ELECTION of President Obama. I am aware that we have a many dumbos and idiots... but they're not the majority! Thank you General Colin Powell!</Msg><Username>giovannijay</Username><Timestamp>1351222155550</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 23:29:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351222253456-389</Id><Topic><Title>Under Romney, Your Doctor Would Put "Do Not Resuscitate" When You Run Out Of Money ...</Title><Username>fireundersmoke</Username><Timestamp>1351179281827</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 11:34:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>if obamacare is so great, why did congress make themselves exempt from it?-bucko</Msg><Username>muench.john</Username><Timestamp>1351222253456</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 23:30:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351222305845-390</Id><Title>dumbama, all your lies are catching up with you fast.</Title><Msg>the end of the rope for odumba.</Msg><Username>big_triceratops</Username><Timestamp>1351222305845</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 23:31:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351222622957-391</Id><Topic><Title>dumbama, all your lies are catching up with you fast.</Title><Username>big_triceratops</Username><Timestamp>1351222305845</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 23:31:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You'll have to overlook dumpobamie's stupidity.
