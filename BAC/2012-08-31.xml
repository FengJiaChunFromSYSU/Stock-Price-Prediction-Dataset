In a move certain to fuel the debate over Obama's qualifications for the presidency, the group "Americans for Freedom of Information" has Released copies of President Obama's college transcripts from Occidental College ... Released today, the transcript school indicates that Obama, under the name Barry Soetoro, received financial aid as a foreign student from Indonesia as an undergraduate. The transcript was released by Occidental College in compliance with a court order in a suit brought by the group in the Superior Court of California. The transcript shows that Obama (Soetoro) applied for financial aid and was awarded a fellowship for foreign students from the Fulbright Foundation Scholarship program. To qualify, for the scholarship, a student must claim foreign citizenship. This document would seem to provide the smoking gun that many of Obama's detractors have been seeking. Along with the evidence that he was first born in Kenya and there is no record of him ever applying for US citizenship, this is looking pretty grim. The news has created a firestorm at the White House as the release casts increasing doubt about Obama's legitimacy and qualification to serve as President article titled, "Obama Eligibility Questioned," leading some to speculate that the story may overshadow economic issues on Obama's first official visit to the U.K. In a related matter, under growing pressure from several groups,Justice Antonin Scalia announced that the Supreme Court agreed on Tuesday to hear arguments concerning Obama's legal eligibility to serve as President in a case brought by Leo Donofrio of New Jersey . This lawsuit claims Obama's dual c itizenship disqualified him from serving as president.. Donofrio's case is just one of 18 suits brought by citizens demanding proof of Obama's citizenship or qualification to serve as president. Gary Kreep of the United States Justice Foundation has released the results of their investigation of Obama's campaign spending. This study estimates that Obama has spent upwards of $950,000 in campaign funds in the past year with eleven law firms in 12 states for legal resources to block disclosure of any of his personal records. Mr. Kreep indicated that the investigation is still ongoing but that the final report will be provided to the U.S. Attorney general, Eric Holder. Mr. Holder has refused to comment on the matter... LET OTHER FOLKS KNOW THIS NEWS, THE MEDIA WON'T! Subject: RE: Issue of Passport? While I've little interest in getting in the middle of the Obama birth issue, Paul Hollrah over at FSM did so yesterday and believes the issue can be resolved by Obama answering one simple question: What passport did he use when he was shuttling between New York , Jakarta , and Karachi ? So how did a young man who arrived in New York in early June 1981, without the price of a hotel room in his pocket, suddenly come up with the price of a round-the-world trip just a month later? And once he was on a plane, shuttling between New York , Jakarta , and Karachi , what passport was he offering when he passed through Customs and Immigration? The American people not only deserve to have answers to these questions, they must have answers. It makes the debate over Obama's citizenship a rather short and simple one. Q: Did he travel to Pakistan in 1981, at age 20? A : Yes, by his own admission. Q: What passport did he travel under? A: There are only three possibilities. 1) He traveled with a U.S. ... Passport, 2) He traveled with a British passport, or 3) He traveled with an Indonesia passport. Q: Is it possible that Obama traveled with a U.S. Passport in 1981? A: No. It is not possible. Pakistan was on the U.S. . State Department's "no travel" list in 1981. Conclusion: When Obama went to Pakistan in 1981 he was traveling either with a British passport or an Indonesian passport. If he were traveling with a British passport that would provide proof that he was born in Kenya on August 4, 1961, not in Hawaii as he claims.. And if he were traveling with an Indonesian passport that would tend to prove that he relinquished whatever previous citizenship he held, British or American, prior to being adopted by his Indonesian step-father in 1967. Whatever the truth of the matter, the American people need to know how he managed to become a "natural born" American citizen between 1981 and 2008. Given the destructive nature of his plans for America, as illustrated by his speech before Congress and the disastrous spending plan he has presented to Congress, the sooner we learn the tru th of all this, the better. If you Don't care that Your President is not a natural born Citizen and in Violation of the Constitution, then Delete this, and then lower your American Flag to half-staff, because the U.S. Constitution is already on life-support, and won't survive much longer. If you do care then Forward this to as many patriotic Americans as you can, because our country is being looted and ransacked!</Msg><Username>anopinion2005</Username><Timestamp>1346393573334</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 02:12:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346395278498-6</Id><Topic><Title>Clint Eastwood said Joe Biden was the intellect of the democrat party a stupid grin with a body behind it</Title><Username>ronjamisonee</Username><Timestamp>1346388881391</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 00:54:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In other words a Buffoon</Msg><Username>kitingfool</Username><Timestamp>1346395278498</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 02:41:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346400466646-7</Id><Title>BANK OF AMERICA BIGGEST DAY OF THE YEAR TOMORROW</Title><Msg>UP 40 CENTS MINIMUM INSIDE TIP</Msg><Username>shanumer8310</Username><Timestamp>1346400466646</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 04:07:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346404662371-8</Id><Topic><Title>Let me be perfectly succinct on this issue Republicans!</Title><Username>andym_30054</Username><Timestamp>1346351189185</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 14:26:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Don't you folks ever get tired of being on your knees to the Wall street crooks?</Msg><Username>andym_30054</Username><Timestamp>1346404662371</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 05:17:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346405244242-9</Id><Topic><Title>Do you want a businessman who generated Billions .... or a President who wasted Trillions ?</Title><Username>dumpobamie</Username><Timestamp>1346351309940</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 14:28:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The NITWITs on this board listen to Fox propaganda 24x7 and have no idea of what Wall street de-regulation did to the country!

"overseas contingency operation" my #$%$</Title><Msg>Watch your mouth -- everyday phrases like "hold down the fort" and "rule of thumb" are potentially offensive bombshells. At least according to the State Department. Chief Diversity Officer John Robinson penned a column in the department's latest edition of "State Magazine" advising readers on some rather obscure Ps and Qs. Robinson ticked off several common phrases and went on to explain why their roots are racially or culturally insensitive. The result was a list of no-nos that could easily result in some tongue-tied U.S. diplomats, particularly in an administration that swaps "war on terror" for "overseas contingency operation" and once shied away from using the word "terrorism." For instance, Robinson warned, "hold down the fort" is a potentially insulting reference to American Indian stereotypes. "How many times have you or a colleague asked if someone could 'hold down the fort?'" he wrote. "You were likely asking someone to watch the office while you go and do something else, but the phrase's historical connotation to some is negative and racially offensive." He explained: "To 'hold down the fort' originally meant to watch and protect against the vicious Native American intruders. In the territories of the West, Army soldiers or settlers saw the 'fort' as their refuge from their perceived 'enemy,' the stereotypical 'savage' Native American tribes." He singled out another phrase, "Going Dutch," as a "negative stereotype portraying the Dutch as cheap." And "rule of thumb," he wrote, can according to women's activists refer "to an antiquated law, whereby the width of a husband's thumb was the legal size of a switch or rod allowed to beat his wife." Further, he explained, "If her bruises were not larger than the width of his thumb, the husband could not be brought to court to answer for his behavior because he had not violated the 'rule of thumb.'" He went on to urge caution over the word "handicap," as some disability advocates "believe this term is rooted in a correlation between a disabled individual and a beggar, who had to beg with a cap in his or her hand because of the inability to maintain employment." What to make of all this? Robinson cited the cautionary tale of Nike rolling out a "Black and Tan" sneaker without realizing the phrase once referred to a group "that committed atrocities against Irish civilians." Nike later apologized. "Choose your words thoughtfully," Robinson wrote. "Now that you know the possible historical context of the above phrases, perhaps you will understand why someone could be offended by their use. Let us agree that language will continue to evolve with continually improving consciousness and respect for others." Robinson also serves as the director of the Office of Civil Rights and an adviser to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on diversity issues. He earlier worked as chief diversity officer with the IRS.</Msg><Username>mike_van_der_slut_irvin19</Username><Timestamp>1346414367448</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 07:59:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346415364208-31</Id><Topic><Title>Do you want a businessman who generated Billions .... or a President who wasted Trillions ?</Title><Username>dumpobamie</Username><Timestamp>1346351309940</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 14:28:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Herbert Hoover was our last business man who was in the Power Oval.

Talk about "exposed"...you mean like Ryan exposed for simultaneously railing against government handouts, securing them for his district, and repeatedly lying that he'd ever done so? Or decrying Obama's budget plan, one that was identical to what Ryan was seeking? Or castigating Obama for failing to approve a budget deal that Ryan himself rejected? LMAO did you also eat up Ann's stale tunafish story? It really resonated, mostly because she thoughtfully omitted one little piece of trivia from her "poor newlyweds living in the squalor of a basement apartment" narrative.....that neither she nor the Mittster had jobs, and were living off the sale of stocks. Not quite the struggling newlywed saga that comes to mind when someone says, "When we first got married, we were broke", is it? And Mitt's promise-laden, detail-free plans to restore America and create 12 million new jobs? Heck, I'll create 13 million new jobs and completely remanufacture this dump....just elect me president, and I'll tell you how I'm gonna do it right after I take the oath of office.

San Francisco Fed President John Williams, in an interview from Jackson Hole, Wyo., said he was "concerned that we could be stalling at the current high level of unemployment." As a result, more bond-buying from the Fed in the form of quantitative easing (learn more) might help, he added. (Read more: What Do Markets Expect From Jackson Hole?) "Witout further accommodation I see the unemployment rate staying right around where it is now…at least for another year and a half," said Williams, who is a permanent voting member on the Fed's Open Market Committee (learn more). He also stated he could see rates remaining at zero until 2015. "Given our mandated goals…I think the extra or additional monetary accommodation would be very useful to help boost the economy, speed the recovery along somewhat, and help get employment toward its full employkment goal over the next few years," he added. Williams' remarks come hours before a highly anticipated speech by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, and amid a pitched debate about whether more stimulus would really help boost the economy. On Thursday, Atlanta Fed President said that more quantitative easing was "a close call" given the weakness of both labor markets and economic activity.</Msg><Username>low_mac</Username><Timestamp>1346423066081</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 10:24:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346423292161-81</Id><Title>The failure of OB can be traced to Reiid, Peloousy and ALL the CZARS he created</Title><Msg>Then DEMOCRATS in CONGRESS became out of control due to failure in leadership.
