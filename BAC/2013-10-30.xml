All others: proceed at your own risk. - - - Police work can be entertaining as well as dangerous. Recently, a female sheriff's deputy arrested Patrick Lawrence, a 22 year old white male, who was fornicating with a pumpkin in the middle of a field at night. The next day, at the Gwinnett County (GA) courthouse, Lawrence was charged with lewd and lascivious behavior, public indecency and public intoxication. The suspect explained that he was passing a pumpkin patch on his way home from a drinking session when he decided to stop. 'You know how a pumpkin is soft and squishy inside, and there was no one around for miles, or at least I thought there was no one around' he stated. Lawrence went on to say that he pulled over to the side of the road, picked out a pumpkin that he felt was appropriate to his purpose, cut a hole in it, and proceeded to satisfy his pressing need. 'Guess I was really into it, y'know?' he commented with evident embarrassment. In the process of doing the deed, Lawrence failed to notice an approaching sheriff's car and was unaware of his audience until Deputy Brenda Taylor approached him. 'It was an unusual situation, that's for sure,' said Deputy Taylor. 'I walked up to Lawrence and he's just humping away at this pumpkin.' Deputy Taylor went on to describe what happened when she approached Lawrence. 'I said: 'Excuse me sir, but do you realize that you're having sex with a pumpkin?' He froze and was clearly very surprised that I was there, and then he looked me straight in the face and said: 'A pumpkin? #$%$ ... is it midnight already?' The court (and the judge) could not contain their laughter. Lawrence was found guilty only of public intoxication, fined $10. and sent on his way. The Washington Post wrote an article describing this as "The best come-back line ever." Attempting to contact Patrick.

They also found poor abstract reasoning skills were related to homophobic attitudes which was mediated through authoritarianism and low levels of intergroup contact. Despite their important implications for interpersonal behaviors and relations, cognitive abilities have been largely ignored as explanations of prejudice. We proposed and tested mediation models in which lower cognitive ability predicts greater prejudice, an effect mediated through the endorsement of right-wing ideologies (social conservatism, right-wing authoritarianism) and low levels of contact with out-groups. In an analysis of two large-scale, nationally representative United Kingdom data sets (N = 15,874), we found that lower general intelligence (g) in childhood predicts greater racism in adulthood, and this effect was largely mediated via conservative ideology. A secondary analysis of a U.S. data set confirmed a predictive effect of poor abstract-reasoning skills on antihomosexual prejudice, a relation partially mediated by both authoritarianism and low levels of intergroup contact. All analyses controlled for education and socioeconomic status. Our results suggest that cognitive abilities play a critical, albeit underappreciated, role in prejudice. Consequently, we recommend a heightened focus on cognitive ability in research on prejudice and a better integration of cognitive ability into prejudice models."</Msg><Username>bauer_jackson</Username><Timestamp>1383151835436</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-30 12:50:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>12</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1383151853648-103</Id><Title>Obama, Sebelius and Democrats Refuse to Apply the laws they pass to themselves</Title><Msg>I say vote them out then. thanks</Msg><Username>jackcorso49</Username><Timestamp>1383151853648</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-30 12:50:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1383152066614-104</Id><Topic><Title>Obama, Sebelius and Democrats Refuse to Apply the laws they pass to themselves</Title><Username>jackcorso49</Username><Timestamp>1383151853648</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-30 12:50:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Poor 'lil feller "jackcorso49" gots nothin' to do but lap scrot, bung hump, jerk off, and post stupidity.</Msg><Username>bauer_jackson</Username><Timestamp>1383152066614</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-30 12:54:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1383152069799-105</Id><Topic><Title>In print we trust.</Title><Username>ruudkrul</Username><Timestamp>1383150665640</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-30 12:31:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Can't not, or the house of cards collapses.

Qatar Holding, the investment arm of Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), began buying BofA shares about two years ago, the newspaper said on its website, citing a person close to the fund. The FT added that Qatar had bought more of the bank's shares when their price fell to $7-$8 last year. BofA's stock closed at $14.17, up 2 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange. A $1 billion stake at this price represents less than 1 percent of BofA, which has a market capitalization of about $151.2 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. Under newly appointed Chief Executive Ahmed Al-Sayed, QIA has been on an aggressive expansion spree, hiring bankers and senior executives with experience ranging from mergers and acquisitions in Asia to retail and luxury investments in Europe. The FT said QIA had hired Michael Cho, a former co-head of Asia mergers and acquisitions at BofA, for a senior role in its mergers and acquisitions department. Three sources had told Reuters in September that Qatar Holding had hired Ugo Arzani, most recently a BofA managing director in London, as its new head of consumer and retail investments. The sources had also said that QIA, worth more than $100 billion, was scouting for opportunities</Msg><Username>cchaker</Username><Timestamp>1383164767659</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-30 16:26:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1383164843506-167</Id><Title>YES WE CAN!

I'm rooting for a game 7 extra innings win, don't really care who takes it, but just want to be forced to stay up late to watch a game that ends in the 12th inning with a score like 25-24.

I threw them into my random access memory and did a weighted read against memory to put on the autocue's screen for him to speak. This is how all of his scripted speeches are generated. Phrases that scored high on pulse polling were given equal distribution throughout the speech, subject to contextual limitations, and were offset by emotional modifiers such as jokes. The jokes are created by acknowledging administration scandals as though they are inside jokes that are funny. The laugh box is cued along with line delivery, as listeners are inclined to laugh about anything when cued to do so. The goal is to create a populist message that people will feel emotionally attached to, so that they won't be inclined to investigate facts or listen to other sources. And the higher the level of emotion on the part of the listener, the more militant they will become in defending the speaker's words, even though they may be completely false.

Perception can alter reality and create its own. One of the first thoughts that popped up as I studied your question was, holy toolbelt, batman, I'd HIRE this guy! When I was in hi tech and the tech ops guru (individual contributor/specially padded office) for a start-up that eventually hit the long ball (videoconferencing) the morons in HR took me to task for an interview technique they deemed 'highly unorthodox'. Rather than grill candidates on technical details about video/audio codecs, I had 5 questions like yours on a whiteboard. My instruction were to take as much time as they wanted but to play by the following rules: 1) NO blurting answers! Do so, and GONG! 2) Talk me through your problem-solving thought process.....no penalties for going down dead ends, not even an emphasis on getting the 'right' answer 3). Take all the time you want but NO silences 5 seconds.....keep talking all the way. Stop talking? GONG! 4) When you arrive at an answer (or are stumped) tell me. 5) Most important of all: attach a confidence number to your final answer (1-10 with 1 = wild ace guess, 10 = bet your life) Amazing what pudding resides between the ears of bright, educated people....and what deception! All had sterling credentials (and I have none....no degree in anything, ever); HR had prescreened them all, which means I probably never even got to SEE the best ones. The good news is that none ever had to report to me, but all I ever heard from the managers they DID report to was "Wow, I wouldn't have picked this guy, but he turned out to be GREAT!" One of the other strongest indicators of a great individual is the quality of questions he asks. The job required solving problems no one had ever faced, and I needed absolute technical honesty, a willingness to question assumptions, and above all self awareness: knowing what you know, knowing what you don't know, and knowing which is which.

SNL predicted that these huge charges, fines, and settlements would continue. We agree and think that the government agencies are in domino-attack mode. One major charge and settlement only begets another, likely from another rival agency or group. A settlement with the Department of Justice triggers the Securities and Exchange Commission to go after the banks from a securities and investor angle. A federal settlement triggers similar moves by states. It can be endless. When banks settle with any branch of the government and when they have to put more and more cash aside just to be held in reserves, take a guess what it does for their desire to make new loans. Now consider how eager you would be to take on the risk of a loan when the Federal Reserve is artificially keeping interest rates lower than they should be. Now go one step further. If your credit score is bad, or if you have a blemish from your past, what are your chances of ever getting a bank loan over a solid credit profile when reserves are going up and when settlement payments are eating at that cash? The end game is that loan demand is low on its own, but banks are frequently accused of only lending money to people or companies that do not really need the money. That may be more and more true by the day if these settlements and legal bills keep piling up. These banks paid back the TARP bailout, for a net profit to the taxpayer. We would also like to remind readers that most of the mergers that banks are still getting to pay fines from were in mergers that were often mandated by regulators at the peak of the meltdown.</Msg><Username>doncassel365</Username><Timestamp>1383181930499</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-30 21:12:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1383181995652-243</Id><Topic><Title>BAC Increase Legal Reserver to 5.1 Billion - (Additional 2.3 Billion From Last Quarter)</Title><Username>sammsjohn99</Username><Timestamp>1383171988176</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-30 18:26:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Not at all.

Everyone knew about people losing their insurance several years ago but the Media is acting like this is a surprise. Where were they when Obama was running for reelection last year? They have really let America down because left wing political advocacy is now such a part of the media there is now coordinated misinformation efforts. Now they have turned on Obama basically because this is indefensible and they know it and their strategy is now to hit him hard and start blaming the insurance companies because they really want a Single Payer Purely Government Run System. Vladimir Lenin: "Socialized Medicine is the Keystone to the Arch of the Socialist State." This law is unworkable and their will be a real struggle as to what to do now. Nobody but a few will suggest deregulating and let competition produce the best result.

Lawyers for the Federal Home Loan Banks of Boston, Chicago and Indianapolis today told New York Supreme Court Judge Barbara Kapnick they are withdrawing from the case. Also today, lawyers for Cranberry Park LLC and Cranberry Park LLC II, funds which in August said they owned Countrywide securities with an original principal value of more than $1 billion, asked the judge for permission to withdraw their previous objection to the settlement. The settlement between Bank of New York Mellon Corp., as trustee for the securities, and Bank of America’s Countrywide, resolves claims the mortgage lender breached its contractual obligation to repurchase delinquent mortgages that were pooled for the securities.</Msg><Username>doncassel365</Username><Timestamp>1383187532008</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-30 22:45:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1383187557395-272</Id><Topic><Title>You know things are bad for Obama</Title><Username>doncassel365</Username><Timestamp>1383182103194</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-30 21:15:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's not like they just started.....they've been romping on him for over a week, and rightly so.
