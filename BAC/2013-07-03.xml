It's the amount of earnings and capital. Dividends are a return of capital generally paid out of current or retained earnings. With capital rules being changed and the possibility of the big banks having to further increase equity based capital, I wouldn't expect to see any rapid increases in dividends any time soon as they will be keeping earnings to bring up their capital ratios to satisfy regulators.</Msg><Username>tigger.redux</Username><Timestamp>1372850784262</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 07:26:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372850981883-6</Id><Topic><Title>When does BAC payout ratio improve?

Banks are required to set aside a certain amount of reserves and capital for every dollar of loans they make. This is part of what determines leverage. At the moment, regulators are forcing banks to reduce leverage which is done by requiring them to keep more reserves and capital for every dollar they loan. Thus, less money to loan.</Msg><Username>tigger.redux</Username><Timestamp>1372850981883</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 07:29:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372854422986-7</Id><Topic><Title>When does BAC payout ratio improve?

First, they increased fees and had to roll back when customers loudly complained, negatively affecting image of the bank. Then they forced city to sue a customer who wrote in chalk a derogatory remark about dishonest bank and the customer got acquitted by jury. Then BAC gets sued on the ground t hat employees were rewarded for scuttling the settlement terms on mortgage modification. There have been just too many missteps that severely hurt bank's image and reputation. The banking business thrives on honesty and trust, bu t BAC is so poor managed with bad culture that a new CEO is needed to clean the house.

The conservative estimate for the number of deaths by starvation under Stalin's reign is 10,000,000 Ukrainians, as reported by the Encyclopedia Britannica. Yet, other sources show the numbers to be much higher. Taking into account the full toll of Communism on the Russian people, the number reaches 45,000,000.

The Lockerbie Case Explodes In Israel's face Marwan Was Said To Be Involved. The Main Lockerbie Defendant Is Released Ashraf Marwan Falls Off A Highrise The Same Day. A Lot Of Coincidences The timing, and colorful departure, of Ashraf Marwan, mimics his life. Starting as a third-rate Egyptian officer, he woos Nassar's daughter and starts his climb to power. He quickly sells out to Israel, tipping off the Israelis about the start of the Yom Kippur war in 1973. He served in Egyptian Intelligence, and alerted Israel to most of the Arab strategy during the 1973 war. If he did that, then God knows what else he was involved in. An Agent Is Used To Send A Message Marwarn was suspected in the Lockerbie cover-up, and his assassination sends a message. Assassinated On May 28. 2007 That is the day the Lockerbie trial verdict was tossed, called a 'Miscarriage of Justice', and the case was re-opened. Lockerbie Trial Hoax Israel, backed by Zionists in the US blamed the Lockerbie bombing on Gaddafi, Libya, and these two Arabs. Almost Twenty Years Later The trial, considered to be a Zionist Flim Flam, blows up, and the Arab is released. The Trial Was In The Netherlands The Netherlands is totally controlled by Zionists. Their diamond trade, ecstasy, slave running, cocaine distribution , etc. is based here. Al-Megrahi Gets New Trial Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al-Megrahi, who is in a Scottish prison, welcomed the decision by the independent Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission (SCCRC), which found he "may have suffered a miscarriage of justice" at his 2001 trial. Famed Mossad Informant Slips Ashraf Marwan fell off his six story balcony Gaddafi Is Not Surprised Meanwhile in Tripoli, Libya Colonel Gaddafi said he wasn't really surprised because his best guess was that Marwan was the turncoat Mossad #$%$ who had framed the Libyan Al-Megrahi for the Lockerbie bombing. Mossad Sends A Message Normally when they publicly execute someone, the point is to send a message. I sort of doubt anyone will be anxious to come forward on Israeli involvement in Lockerbie. This Follows The Entebbe Revelations On 6/10/2007, the British secret service accidentally released their confidential files which revealed that it was Israel's Mossad, working with Abu Nidal, and the PLO, that staged Entebbe. Court Says Evidence Planted The key evidence was a circuit board the size of a fingernail, and the court says it was planted. So now the question is: - "If Megrahi didn’t carry out Lockerbie, who did?" Zionists Live By Their Self-Made Mystique They peppered the Bible with fables of Abraham, lost tribes, Solomon's Temple, Masada, Samson, etc. Now, move to the Twentieth Century and 21st Century, and you have the Freuds, Einsteins, Chess Champions, 135 average IQ, the Holocaust, Dell computer, their business wizards, etc. But what happens when the world stops believing 4,000,000 Auschwitz Jews died in a two-car garage from bug spray? What if people talked about the 50 million killed by Bolsheviks? I dare say between the internet, the 9/11 questions, the ability to review historical events, etc, that now is not a good time for Lockerbie to be blamed on the Mossad.</Msg><Username>barry_bonds_64</Username><Timestamp>1372889578895</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 18:12:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372889998411-53</Id><Topic><Title>ROFLMFO, higher US trade deficit being described as good.</Title><Username>spocklovesyou</Username><Timestamp>1372884405565</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 16:46:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Much of the CA suprlus was due to asset churn and detroit was talkng about selling off the DIA holdings, not to be confused with CIA or NSA.

Finally, I blame customers of BAC who have not closed their accounts or tear-off their BAC credit cards or avoid buying other BAC products.
