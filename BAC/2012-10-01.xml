The main question was, is there an "Obama phone"? The answer is obviously "no": Is the Obama Phone Obama's doing? No. The universal service requirement dates back at least to the Communications Act of 1934. The Lifeline program specifically was started in 1984 under President Reagan and was expanded in 1996 under President Clinton to allow qualifying households to choose to apply the benefit to either a landline or a cell phone. So no, it's not an Obama handout. Like Mitt Romney's 47 percent remark, the Republicans use overtly racist appeals to whites to attempt to give the impressions that non-whites are the prime beneficiaries of "government handouts." And as in that case, when the 47 percent was mostly comprised of whites, like whites on Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans benefits, student loan for college, the universal phone service requirement primarily benefits whites, in this case rural whites. Consider the Universal Service Program for Rural Health Care Providers: The Rural Health Care program supports health care providers serving rural communities by funding telecommunications services necessary for the provision of health care. Congress mandated in 1996 that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) use the Universal Service Fund (USF) to provide support to telephone companies that serve eligible rural health care providers. Congress also directed the FCC to enhance access to advanced telecommunications and information services for these health care providers. Here are some frequently asked questions about the Rural Health Care program. Who benefits the most from this program? Rural whites, of course. Or, to put it another way, predominantly Republican voters. But nobody helps them. Ask Craig T. Nelson: But with the first of the 5 stages of grief setting in for Republicans regarding Romney's chances, denial: Anger, racial anger, is sure to follow.

Get real its about too much government and bankrupting the taxpayer!!!!! Lifeline is an extension of a program that has existed since 1985. Still, critics including Rep. Tim Griffin, R-Ark., note the program has swelled from $772 million in 2008 to $1.6 billion. “It's a government-run, taxpayer-funded program that's running wild and costing more and more,” reads Griffin’s official House of Representatives website. In 2008, there were 7.1 million Lifeline accounts nationwide. There are 12.5 million today, according to Bloomberg News. About half of those are mobile phones sold by Miami-based TracFone, Sprint and hundreds of smaller regional companies. The government pays those carriers up to $10 per month for each program subscriber. Users, in turn, get free phones and 250 minutes of monthly airtime. Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., received a mailed solicitation last year informing her she was eligible for a phone, leading her to question the program. “I am troubled by the expansive potential for the program to be abused," McCaskill wrote the FCC in December.</Msg><Username>jack_ste56</Username><Timestamp>1349093724078</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 08:15:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349093876063-22</Id><Topic><Title>its the economy stupid</Title><Username>cbrow11</Username><Timestamp>1337089964000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-05-15 09:52:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I am starting to think there is real possibility of a recession by year's end.</Msg><Username>jack_ste56</Username><Timestamp>1349093876063</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 08:17:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349094005695-23</Id><Topic><Title>Obama: "I think the trick is figuring out how do we structure government systems that pool resources and hence facilitate some redistribution -- because I actually believe in redistribution"</Title><Username>dumpobamie</Username><Timestamp>1349061337341</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-30 23:15:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Free Welfare check, Free food stamps, Free housing, Free phone, Free bills assistance.

The sad thing is the on topic is so sparse by comparison. In effect these boards are rendered useless to the topic seekers...excepting that ignore function works fairly well. In any case I agree with Bluesky that Algo's and HFT's are making a travesty of trading and investing. It serves no purpose economically at all to be submitting and rescinding bids a million times a second. None whatsoever. But it is what it is until the reg's catch up with the new reality, and we're forced to play along until it changes. I feel BAC, from a longer term perspective, is undervalued...so I continue to build out my longer term basket that I first started building back in the $5's. I'm not opposed to trading around that core, either...which is why I bother to monitor its intraday as closely as I do. Bid now $8.93. Let's see if BAC catches some upside....

How despicably low the Republicans go to smear someone is truly disgusting.</Msg><Username>j.farragut</Username><Timestamp>1349119785251</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 15:29:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349119830101-188</Id><Title>AND down she goes again!!</Title><Msg>if bac comes back up again, I'LL SELL AND STAY AWAY</Msg><Username>gburget2003</Username><Timestamp>1349119830101</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 15:30:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349119839526-189</Id><Title>BUY BUY BUY...DON'T PANIC SELL</Title><Msg>NO REASON TO SELL</Msg><Username>bry345</Username><Timestamp>1349119839526</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 15:30:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349119897035-190</Id><Topic><Title>BAC May Be Starting To Get Some Exposure...</Title><Username>griffinissac567</Username><Timestamp>1349092465207</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 07:54:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It made me so excited when got to know about features and returning policy of the shares.u can actually double your money.</Msg><Username>flynnacosta69</Username><Timestamp>1349119897035</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 15:31:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349120040590-191</Id><Title>WHOA. who's the whale who came in with the big sell order</Title><Msg>anyone</Msg><Username>greatestideaman</Username><Timestamp>1349120040590</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 15:34:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349120207343-192</Id><Topic><Title>Dancing, singing and even jogging gingerly onto stage, Venezuela's cancer-weakened President Hugo Chavez is squeezing out every last ounce of energy to recapture some of his old campaign magic before Sunday's election.</Title><Username>dumpobamie</Username><Timestamp>1349116259759</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 14:30:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You gave yourself away, dumpo-perv.

The most dramatic evidence was the decision to air a 60-second spot TOUTING Romney’s compassion, clearly an effort to counter the DISASTROUS IMPACT of the leaked video showing the Republican nominee writing off 47 percent of the electorate. The former Massachusetts governor’s private words only reinforced months of advertising by Obama and allied groups portraying Romney as a WEALTHY, OUT-of-TOUCH champion of the interests of the very rich. Recent polling in swing states has shown that this attack has stuck. Most striking of all, a campaign that has been relentless in assailing Obama abandoned this approach for a moment in the compassion ad by having Romney declare that “President Obama and I both care about poor and middle-class families.” Challengers are always in a weak position when they have to hug their opponent for validation. This is a defensive move, a SIGN of HOW WORRIED Romney is about Obama’s lead in the surveys as a friend of the middle class and the needy. A LANDSLIDE WIN IS IN THE MAKING FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA!</Msg><Username>giovannijay</Username><Timestamp>1349120376296</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 15:39:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349120397160-194</Id><Title>dumpo-pervert is too stupid to write his own posts, so he steals them from Yahoo! news.</Title><Msg>It's bad enough that you are a hopeless nuisance white trash troll, but you are also a plagiarizing low-life thief.</Msg><Username>j.farragut</Username><Timestamp>1349120397160</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 15:39:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349120491329-195</Id><Title>buy buy buy..need to get back to $9</Title><Msg>buyyyyyyyy</Msg><Username>bry345</Username><Timestamp>1349120491329</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 15:41:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349120645483-196</Id><Topic><Title>buy buy buy..need to get back to $9</Title><Username>bry345</Username><Timestamp>1349120491329</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 15:41:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Buy buy buy...the pig can't fly..so bye bye bye...ilmfao</Msg><Username>milesed18</Username><Timestamp>1349120645483</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 15:44:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349120708819-197</Id><Topic><Title>For the first time, Mexican victims of crimes tied to the botched Operation Fast and Furious are being identified, including teenagers killed in a 2010 massacre.</Title><Username>dumpobamie</Username><Timestamp>1349115532365</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 14:18:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>dumpo-pervert is too ignorant and too stupid to write his own posts so he steals them from Fox, from Yahooo, and from who knows where.

We know how Pat Robinson feels about science- unless it fits his belief system it doesn't count. "In recent years, some global warming deniers have pointed to a slight warming trend on Mars as evidence that man-made climate change is not real. But Penn State meteorologist Michael Mann told Live Science that blaming the sun’s radiation for climate change is just another scapegoat for global warming caused by human activities. “The small measured changes in solar output and variations from one decade to the next are only on the order of a fraction of a percent, and if you do the calculations not even large enough to really provide a detectable signal in the surface temperature record,” Mann explained. “Solar activity continues to be one of the last bastions of contrarians,” he added. “People who don’t accept the existence of anthropogenic climate change still try to point to solar activity.”</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1349131050798</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 18:37:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349132127116-260</Id><Topic><Title>Curiosity Rover Finds Martian planet warming</Title><Username>zevoter22</Username><Timestamp>1349127717530</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 17:41:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And people who don't consider politics as the source of 'anthropogenic climate change' have blinders on.
