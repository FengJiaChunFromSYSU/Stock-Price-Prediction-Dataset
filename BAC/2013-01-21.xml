Tax revenues in that 81 -84 period were not stagnamt. They advanced from $607 billion to $780 billion or 29%. In the Reagan years personal disposable income rose 82% frm $2.41 tillion to $3.64 trillion and GDP rose from $2.18 trillon to $5.48 trillion. Highest sustained growth rates since the depression not to mention the 16+ million added to the payrolls. Taken from the Fed Reserve data. You can empahsize and manipulate data all you want from the blogs you consult but those are the facts. The economy flourished under Reagan and supply side policies.. .</Msg><Username>jhitcher2011</Username><Timestamp>1358747551926</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 00:52:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358749343815-5</Id><Topic><Title>The truth about Reaganomics and the laffer curve</Title><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1358743697746</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-20 23:48:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Come on hitch you know he raised taxes in 1982 because it trickle down didn't work. " Despite the tax cuts, a recession started in July 1981. Reagan did inherit the so-called stagflation of high inflation and slow growth, and there was a brief recession in the first half of 1980. But the economy was growing when he came into office. The deficit promptly soared—indeed, the national debt would ultimately triple in Reagan’s eight years in office But the economy tanked and unemployment headed toward double digits. In early 1982, concerned by this exploding deficit and convinced that the tax cuts had gone too far, Congress on a bipartisan basis moved to limit the damage. Despite outcries on the right that one could not raise taxes in a recession, advocates said that bringing down the deficit was more important. In August 1982, the unemployment rate hit 10.1 percent, while mortgage rates hovered near their all-time high at 15 percent. Reagan's tax cuts had had a year to stimulate the economy, but they had not done so. So Republicans in Congress and some members of his own administration convinced Reagan to agree to a $98.3 billion tax increase, the largest peacetime increase in history." So quit using your 1981 to 1984 period to give credit to growth as a product of supply side economics. It was plain old fashion borrowing that grew the economy and he never paid any back. His tax increases and his brief flirtation with supply side only redistributed wealth to the rich. In 1981 Republicans controlled the senate and had enough control in the Congress to get his tax cuts passed.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1358749343815</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 01:22:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358750140440-6</Id><Topic><Title>The truth about Reaganomics and the laffer curve</Title><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1358743697746</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-20 23:48:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"All told, the tax increases Reagan approved ended up canceling out much of the reduction in tax revenue that resulted from his 1981 legislation. Annual federal tax receipts during his presidency averaged 18.2% of GDP, a smidge below the average under President Carter -- and a smidge above the 40-year average today. Reagan's behavior might not pass muster with those voters today who insist their Congressmen treat every proposed tax increase as poisonous to the republic. "By today's standards, the Gipper would easily qualify for status as a back-stabbing, treacherous RINO [Republican in Name Only]," wrote Tax Analysts contributing editor Martin Sullivan, in an article for Tax Notes in May. Thanks in part to the increases in defense spending during his administration, Reagan also didn't really reduce the size of government. Annual spending averaged 22.4% of GDP on his watch, which is above today's 40-year average of 20.7%, and above the 20.8% average under Carter. Indeed, in one very symbolic respect he enlarged it. While in the early years of his presidency Reagan tried to shrink the IRS, by the end, the number of IRS employees hit an all-time high, according to Steuerle in his book Contemporary U.S. Tax Policy. The reason was two-fold, Steuerle said. The first was a desire to crack down on the proliferation of tax shelters. But the point of cracking down was to boost tax revenue. That, in turn, could reduce the need to impose other tax increases to combat budget deficits."</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1358750140440</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 01:35:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358753323136-7</Id><Topic><Title>The truth about Reaganomics and the laffer curve</Title><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1358743697746</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-20 23:48:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"In 1973, the first of two 1970s era energy crises exploded on the world scene with OPEC instituting an embargo against the US and its allies in retaliation for US support of Israel during the Yom Kippur war. At the start of the embargo, the price for a barrel of oil was around $20 a barrel in 2008 dollars. By the way, for all of the prices I am going to discuss, I am going to use what the equivalent of the prices would be in 2008 dollars so it is easier for us to understand the effect of what happened. The price of a barrel of oil promptly doubled and then some as a result of the embargo to nearly $45 a barrel. The effects of that first crisis on oil and gas prices hadn't ended by 1979 when a second crisis ensued from Iran's Shah coming to the US for medical treatment and the hostage crisis that occurred when our embassy personnel in Tehran were taken hostage. At that time, the price of a barrel of oil shot up to $100 a barrel in 2008 prices. The price of a gallon of gas went up to an equivalent of four dollars a gallon. The Hostage crisis ended in 1981 the day that Reagan was inaugurated and almost immediately, the price of a barrel of oil and of a gallon of gas began to drop. By 1984, the price of a barrel of oil had come down from the equivalent of $100 to $60 a barrel and the price of a gallon of gas had gone back down from the equivalent of $4 a gallon down to $2.80 a gallon Now we all know what the effect of a massive increase or decrease in the price of gas and oil does to the economy. In economic terms, a huge increase or decrease in the price of oil and gas is known as a supply shock. Supply shocks cause major shifts in the direction of the economy. It is no coincidence that the economic recovery for which Reagan is credited follows the decrease in the price of oil almost exactly."</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1358753323136</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 02:28:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358754398094-8</Id><Topic><Title>The truth about Reaganomics and the laffer curve</Title><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1358743697746</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-20 23:48:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Congressional Budget Office, the Treasury Department, the Joint Committee on Taxation, the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers and a former Bush administration economist all say that tax cuts lead to revenues that are lower than they otherwise would have been – even if they spur some economic growth.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1358754398094</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 02:46:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358757963454-9</Id><Topic><Title>-LQQK- Where will BAC Bounce?

I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. (More...) After a stock more than doubles, it is only sensible to reassess the investment rationale to ensure that an adequate margin of safety still exists. Few companies have had to tread through the mountains of litigation, loan losses and legacy expenses associated with the Great Recession that Bank of America (BAC) has experienced. Due to the most damaging acquisition in recent memory, Bank of America is earlier in the rehabilitation process than its closest competitors such as J.P. Morgan (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC), but because of the discounted valuation I believe it offers a superior investment opportunity over the next 2-3 years. For the long-term investor, I believe that even at current prices Bank of America offers a substantial margin of safety and significant upside.</Msg><Username>haideh00</Username><Timestamp>1358773362134</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 08:02:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358773606259-19</Id><Title>If Fox wanted to attract an intelligent audience, they would air all of the inauguration celebrations</Title><Msg>..., but they are content to feed the maggot fringe right what they like best: S*H*!*T*</Msg><Username>lying_teabag_sakkk_sukkker</Username><Timestamp>1358773606259</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 08:06:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358773836170-20</Id><Topic><Title>The 1 % need the guilotine</Title><Username>severlohhein</Username><Timestamp>1354132653868</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 14:57:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What a great idea!

Spanish exports fell 0.6 percent in November from the same month the previous year, when they had risen 7.4 percent, the Economy Ministry said today. House-price data tomorrow will show if the property market endured a fourth year of declines. The Bank of Spain may also release its estimate for fourth-quarter gross domestic product, and the data will culminate in jobs figures on Jan. 24, forecast by economists to show a record 26 percent of Spaniards unemployed. Officials predict the euro-area’s fourth-biggest economy faces a further slump this year at a time when the government will struggle to meet its budget goals. Such a backdrop hasn’t deterred investors, with the prospect of a European Central Bank backstop in the event of a bailout enabling the Treasury to fast-track higher 2013 funding needs, selling 16 billion euros ($21 billion) at its first three auctions at lower costs. “Unemployment will continue to rise this year,” said Sara Balina, an analyst with Madrid-based consultancy firm Analistas Financieros Internacionales. “Demand will deteriorate and outweigh the positive contributors to growth that are tourism and exports.” Spanish Bonds Spanish two-year bonds declined, pushing the yield up four basis points to 2.53 percent at 12:45 p.m. Madrid time. The nation’s 10-year bond yield was up three basis points at 5.11 percent, compared with a euro-era record of 7.75 percent in July. The spread with similar German maturities was 3.52 percentage points. Unemployment probably rose to 26 percent of Spain’s active workforce in the last quarter, reaching 6 million unemployed, according to a median of 10 estimates in a Bloomberg survey.

The turbulence was awful, and things go from bad to worse when one wing is struck by lightning. Carolyne loses it. She stands up in front of the plane and screams, “I’m too young to die.” She shakes and sobs for just a moment, and then gathers her courage and continues, “Well if I’m going to die, I want my last minutes on Earth to be memorable! I’ve had plenty of sex in my life, but no one has ever made me feel like a woman! Well I’ve had it! Is there ANYONE on this plane who can make me feel like a Woman?” For a moment there is silence. All the passengers have forgotten their own peril, and they all stare, riveted, at the desperate woman in the front of the plane. Then a man stands up in the rear of the plane, “I can make you feel like a woman.” He’s handsome; tall, built, with flowing black hair and jet black eyes. He starts to walk slowly up the aisle, unbuttoning his shirt one button at a time. No one moves. Carolyne is breathing heavily in anticipation as the strange man approaches. He removes his shirt. Her lips part slightly. Muscles ripple across his chest as he reaches the trembling Carolyne and extends his arm and holds his shirt out and whispers……….”Iron this.”</Msg><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1358781058836</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 10:10:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358781102029-39</Id><Title>Bank Of America Will Likely Double Again Within 3 Years</Title><Msg>January 21, 2013 After a stock more than doubles, it is only sensible to reassess the investment rationale to ensure that an adequate margin of safety still exists. Few companies have had to tread through the mountains of litigation, loan losses and legacy expenses associated with the Great Recession that Bank of America (BAC) has experienced. Due to the most damaging acquisition in recent memory, Bank of America is earlier in the rehabilitation process than its closest competitors such as J.P. Morgan (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC), but because of the discounted valuation I believe it offers a superior investment opportunity over the next 2-3 years. For the long-term investor, I believe that even at current prices Bank of America offers a substantial margin of safety and significant upside. CEO Brian Moynihan inherited a gem of a business that was obscured and tainted beyond recognition. His predecessor's history of poorly conceived acquisitions had produced a never ending stream of lawsuits and losses, which impaired Bank of America's capital base. To combat the internal crisis Moynihan took some drastic steps. In 2011, Moynihan accepted a very expensive preferred stock and warrant deal with Warren Buffett to boost capital and arguably more importantly, to instill confidence in the bank being a surviving entity years into the future. During the CCAR process of 2012, Moynihan intelligently did not ask for a dividend increase or stock buyback, but instead the company put its head down to build up its capital base. This was achieved through reducing liabilities, disposing of non-core assets, and reducing the expense structure of the company.</Msg><Username>cchaker</Username><Timestamp>1358781102029</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 10:11:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358781660671-40</Id><Topic><Title>This Is What I Think.</Title><Username>michellerorex008</Username><Timestamp>1311349663000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2011-07-22 11:47:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Am Impressed!!!</Msg><Username>emiwilliam</Username><Timestamp>1358781660671</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 10:21:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358781951430-41</Id><Topic><Title>Only in America</Title><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1358772573792</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 07:49:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No it's not new, although I doubt your source.....but since all of it is true, and hardly revolutionary or asking for anything.....I see no reason for vilification of simple facts.

That is about 1%. If the rate of growth under the Bush administration had been maintained there would have been a million and a half new Federal employees. The 143,000 figure does not count the post office. If you count that then the growth in government employees is 27,000. If you count all government employment, Federal, State and Local there are less government employees today than when Obama took office.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1358787350150</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 11:55:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358788326946-66</Id><Title>God sent His only Son, a Savior was born, and named Him "Barrack"</Title><Msg>And our Great Savior, did indeed, save America, and to Him, we offer Praise and Thanks, and our obedience and loyalty.

Dems actually won a plurality of the house votes nation wide. And add to that the fact that almost all of the long term trends, especially the demographics, are against the party. Some people looking at the demographics even see a chance that Texas may turn blue in the statewide elections as early as '16.</Msg><Username>jefatkinson</Username><Timestamp>1358805071679</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 16:51:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358805274150-110</Id><Title>With any luck</Title><Msg>The Teapublicans will continue to support their Nazi platform thus assuring that they lose the house in 2014 and the Presidental wlwction in 2016.

Memorable lines? I can’t think of any. Indeed, there was no shape to the speech, no defining purpose other than to reaffirm his collectivist bent. It frankly sounded like a recycled convention speech. Its redeeming feature was its brevity; but he had little to say other than his undying faith in the government to do things for us.

I am sure he also is an advocate of a strong military ( big military budgets) and less government regulation. I think he is right on! Unfortunately, it seems a Repbulican often can't win the primary without catering to a bunch of evangelical nut jobs. Now that Obama has stressed the need for equal rights for gays and Lesbians, the far right is going to be in a lathe until the 2014 elections. The result is likely to be primary victories for really weak Republican candidates that will ultimately lose to just average Democratic opponents. One need not look further than what happened in the Senate races in Indiana and Missouri.. Oppisition to a practical immigration policy, including illegals, and a science be damned approach to global warming isn't going to help either.</Msg><Username>nxyluck</Username><Timestamp>1358815863968</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 19:51:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358816581263-150</Id><Topic><Title>Good mourning Democrats..something you should never forget.</Title><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1358168020081</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-14 07:53:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If you're saying democrats don't gerrymander whenever and wherever possible, also, methinks you be seriously damaging you credibility.
