And that would have added to the deficit/debt, significantly, as the government program cuts they envisioned would in no way compensate for the tax cuts c) even with these corporate tax cuts, the businesses would NOT be hiring in any significant way, simply because the consumer demand - 66% of the entire economy, remember - was not there. The consumer was/is pretty much tapped out debt-wise,with their house values gone bad, and was/is in 'savings' mode, bigtime. With weak demand for their products and services, businesses WILL NOT hire more people. Within short order, another wasted, massive tax giveaway, just like the Bush tax cuts.</Msg><Username>tinkers_curse</Username><Timestamp>1354944590294</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-08 00:29:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354945063795-3</Id><Topic><Title>TEA BAGGER SLUG DeMINT EXITS THE SENATE.

It’s a question many Arabs ask these days, and it deserves an answer. Morsi and his Brotherhood followers are on a power trip after decades of isolation and persecution. You could see that newfound status when Morsi visited the United Nations in September and even more so during the diplomacy that led to last month’s cease-fire in Gaza, brokered by Morsi and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The Brotherhood leaders had gone from outcasts to superstars, and they were basking in the attention. And let’s be honest: The Obama administration has been Morsi’s main enabler. U.S. officials have worked closely with him on economic development and regional diplomacy. Visiting Washington last week, Morsi’s top aides were touting their boss’s close contacts with President Obama and describing phone calls between the two leaders that led to the Gaza cease-fire.</Msg><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1354973602397</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-08 08:33:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354973680669-13</Id><Topic><Title>I guess Socialists cannot create jobs</Title><Username>nasa_rss</Username><Timestamp>1354892103501</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 09:55:03 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Reagan created 1 million jobs in ONE month!

That's how nostalgia works, especially as the years creep up on us and we rebel against the relentless changes of all things in the universe. But a moment's deeper reflection of those times, if we really want to discern the truth, pierces the hazy 'reality' of selective memory and well, for me at least, things were not all that back then. But they could be, in the future, if we want them to be. So, while looking back can often be sweetly comforting - if we are or were the' lucky' ones - looking forward can truly be satisfying, fulfilling even, and worthy of a life well spent.</Msg><Username>tinkers_curse</Username><Timestamp>1355007025351</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-08 17:50:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355007106351-76</Id><Topic><Title>Where's Warren's Attempt at a Coherent Synopsis???</Title><Username>sarcasm_en_witticism</Username><Timestamp>1355000362502</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-08 15:59:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>bump time Just to #$%$ off the liberals out there...

There's a resident gang here...didn't you know? And...Since this REALLY #$%$ JoeKent and the gang off... Now there's a list that only exists to post on this board. Nothing else. It's all part of the experiment.  Didn't you see my xxxtheory? No? Here it is again, just in case you missed it the first time around...  cyclingthesquare posts here a while ago as joek,right?  The only other post from cyclingthesquare is on, get this, the Cardinals board from a couple of years ago. (Thought you covered your tracks, eh???)  Who is the only other poster that we all know that would post here on BAC and on the Cardinals board??? That's right ladies and gentlemen...Kent.  So, JoeK is Kent...  What does that tell you? Well, my theory is that Kent, JoeK, and the other posters here (the list above???) that get summarily thrown off and deleted every so often are using this forum as a kind of experiment to see how people react. All the political back and forth, all the religion stuff...all made up. I think they're all actually the same poster with nothing better to do...Kent, JoeK, donut/fruitcake, etc., etc., etc..  There is no intention on its part to use this as a BAC discussion board, only to NOT use this as a BAC discussion board. This is what Yahoo does not like, and why all those names get deleted every now and again. They know where all this emanates from, and its the same spot. It is all a big game to this sick individual.  Everyone here that does try to use this as a BAC discussion just becomes part of the experiment. So, again, be warned.  If you want even more proof, check the creation date of any joekdoe?o id as well as the latest incarnation of donut/prawn, preferred_prawn...They're both the same. August 10, 2007. Coincidence? I don't think so...(oh yeah..after I posted this the first time, the preferred_prawn id went away...I wonder why?)  This board is, however, always good for sarcasms and witticisms.  So what do you think???

I'm throwing every bit of mine over 250K into deferred comp. No marxist pig is getting a dime of extra taxes by raising the rates. As far as they're concerned, I'm just gonna be one of the 5% instead of the 1%. In 4 years when common sense returns, I'll either change jobs and get it in a lump, or i'll retire early. Totally legit, and there's not a damn thing you or any other marxist useless idiot can do about it.

It only took several weeks of cold and a few hundred dead for the central planners to come up with a strategy that will be ripe with fraud and abuse and probably kill a few hundred more in poor working conditions. They'll probably make them pay union dues out of their unemployment checks. Don't look on the bright side for this to be a solution. They'll find a way to "liberalize" it, and it'll end up as a campaign contribution and vote enhancement strategy for the left.</Msg><Username>flippant_1</Username><Timestamp>1355027259499</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-08 23:27:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355028282950-111</Id><Topic><Title>Yahoo boards are filled with mindless liberals</Title><Username>passthebuckaroo</Username><Timestamp>1355013528157</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-08 19:38:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>hahhahahahaah!!! as is lazy mindless liberal!!!</Msg><Username>sheepskinner20</Username><Timestamp>1355028282950</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-08 23:44:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
