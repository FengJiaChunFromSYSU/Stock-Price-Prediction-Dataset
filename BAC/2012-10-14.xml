Do it with the Biden 'laughing in your face while I shove this pie in it" delivery. This is just the working-class hot stove to let Mitt burn himself on, especially in Ohio and Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. Point out that no matter how hard he shakes that Etch-A-Sketch, it can't turn the 3-piece suit who was willing to kill Detroit and the American pickup truck into a 'car guy'. ROTFLMAO or ask him if he thought American pickup owners were ready to switch to Nissans and Toyotas, and were just waiting for a bright businessman like himself to come along and offer the right incentives.</Msg><Username>fish2kill</Username><Timestamp>1350190195715</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 00:49:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350191385281-5</Id><Title>Dividend Increase</Title><Msg>What are the chances BAC increases the dividends this earnings call?</Msg><Username>argjentmena</Username><Timestamp>1350191385281</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 01:09:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350192446221-6</Id><Title>WILL OBAMA GO POSTAL ON TUESDAY?</Title><Msg>After biden's mental performance should we look for even more craziness from obama.

Why have embassies in pooop hole countries that won't protect the U.S. facility? In my opinion, we need to go to the city center of every poop hole countries capital and put in a phone booth that has a sign reading "Embassy of the United States of America". Want to talk, call or get on a plane and come and see us where we can talk without the threat of an RPG attack. If Rep. Issa wants, he can deploy the entire Marine Corp to guard U.S. Embassies!

No In memoriam or mention of USA military deaths in Afghanistan. There was editorial comment about the GOP (Romney) receiving good press and higher attendance at events in Ohio, and its Senator (rob Portman) labelling the Obama campaign as quite negative. What happened in Benghazi was said (by Portman) as not caused by a movie trailer, but was a highly organized Sept 11 event. And of course GOP doing great in Ohio, feels Portman. Again, the VP is quoted saying “we” did not know of security needs in Libya. Others in adm, though, did… Bulk of program dealing with query, “Do presidential campaign debates matter?” We heard re 1960, 1976, Reagan’s “there you go again” in 1980, also his “wont take advantage of youth of opponent 4 years later” and the unemotional Dukakis answer to “if your wife was raped…” And historian g f Will told us the Lincoln Douglas debate included one of 60 minute introductory statement by one, followed by 90 minute replay, then responses to those 150 minutes. Martha Raddatz, moderator of the VP debate, did say she could sense wheels turning as each candidate pondered what might be said, what might have been left out in earlier comments. Jake Tapper filled in for Geo Stephanopoulos.</Msg><Username>cent_0425</Username><Timestamp>1350228420324</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 11:27:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350229446842-45</Id><Topic><Title>23 Days Until the Re-Election of President Obama</Title><Username>obama.4more</Username><Timestamp>1350197460411</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 02:51:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Early voting reports look very good for Obama.</Msg><Username>newvulgarian</Username><Timestamp>1350229446842</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 11:44:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350229743657-46</Id><Title>Tee-shirt of the day from a book I'm reading!</Title><Msg>"I'm not a Gynecologist, but I'll take a look."</Msg><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1350229743657</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 11:49:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350230328206-47</Id><Title>What will the (( DIVIDEND / YIELD )) be in 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 ??</Title><Msg>dividend / yield ??

That included character, life achievements, politics, demeanor, intelligence, and behavior. Obama disappointed me in several ways. His most apparent lack seems to be promising too much based on his idealism and trust that even known political realities can be easily overcome. Said to say all that is very aggressively exploited and he is demonized by the very same party that gave up most of the financial woes of our times. However, Obama is still a genuine and somebody that I can trust more than Romney with a record of flip flops on basic issues and apparently lacking an inner guidance (at his age?) on major issues yet showing the illusion of being decisive. His debating skills are good but that has little to do with governance of a nation such as ours. His career has limited relevance to what the job requires and his reference of not caring for the 47% Americans is stating how he feels. Simply the GWB/GOP acted irresponsibly and therefore can no more be trusted with the economy... as they still believe in failed policies. Sorry, but I believe Romney has no chance of being elected. The bottom line is that I have no choice but vote for Obama and his idealism is also diminishing. I was wrong in voting for GWB in 2000... I know I am right this time... and Obama is the right choice.</Msg><Username>johnmjay</Username><Timestamp>1350232765890</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 12:39:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350232831745-53</Id><Topic><Title>Why didn't obama fulfill any of his 2008 campaign promises?</Title><Username>zevoter22</Username><Timestamp>1350223794542</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 10:09:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You mean like killing Bin Laden.</Msg><Username>reppiz9</Username><Timestamp>1350232831745</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 12:40:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350233208032-54</Id><Topic><Title>If YOU are middle class and vote GOP,,you are</Title><Username>webber3240</Username><Timestamp>1350221757574</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 09:35:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Webber, that is the truth of the matter.

They will just kidnap voters and lock up enough voters to swing the elections. William Koch allegedly held a senior executive of his Oxbow energy company captive after discovering his concerns with a plan the official claimed in a lawsuit sought to evade U.S. taxes on $200 million in profit. Former Oxbow Senior Vice President Kirby Martensen alleged an internal company probe revealed his misgivings over a plan by Oxbow Carbon &amp; Minerals LLC to evade taxes. As a result, Martensen claimed, he was falsely imprisoned for almost two days by Koch’s agents and interrogated at a remote Colorado ranch as part of an effort to intimidate him. He was also fired, he said. Koch, who Forbes estimates is worth close to $4 billion, is the brother of conservative Tea Party funders David Koch and Charles Koch. Martensen, promoted last year to senior vice president of Oxbow, said he was lured to the billionaire’s Bear Ranch near Aspen in March on false pretenses and questioned about anonymous allegations of wrongdoing against him tied to a kickback scheme, and a related investigation by the firm. “Based on this surreptitious review of plaintiff’s e-mails and voice communications, Koch learned that Martensen and others expressed concern of the legality of what they were doing on behalf of Oxbow and their distrust of upper management,” Martensen said in his complaint filed Oct. 11 in San Francisco federal court. “As a result, William Koch promoted and implemented a plan to intimidate and discredit plaintiff for the purpose of chilling his speech and damaging his credibility.” TOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO FUNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNY!!</Msg><Username>toooofunnny</Username><Timestamp>1350251132434</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 17:45:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350251287483-99</Id><Topic><Title>libertylies, global warming cancelled better spin it</Title><Username>zevoter22</Username><Timestamp>1350245406820</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 16:10:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"The new data . . . was issued quietly on the internet."</Msg><Username>jefatkinson</Username><Timestamp>1350251287483</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 17:48:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350251691239-100</Id><Topic><Title>Romney, a Friend of the Middle Class?</Title><Username>giovannijay</Username><Timestamp>1349120376296</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 15:39:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Dem ads essentially say, "Here's the video.

The data, compiled from more than 3,000 measuring points on land and sea, noted that the “plateau” or “pause” in global warming has now lasted for about the same time as the previous period when temperature rose from 1980 to 1996. The Daily Mail report quoted climate scientists – some argued that 15-16 years was too short a period to draw conclusions from, while others said that it was clear that the computer models used to predict future global warming were ‘deeply flawed’. Professor Phil Jones, director of the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia, admitted that he and his colleagues did not understand the impact of ‘natural variability’, but he was convinced that the current decade would end up significantly warmer than the previous two, the report added. The report quoted other climate scientists who said that the computer models used by the Met Office are flawed and that the climate is far more complex than the models assert. Professor Judith Curry, chair of School of Earth and Atmospheric Science at America’s Georgia Tech university, was quoted as saying, “Climate models are very complex, but they are imperfect and incomplete. Natural variability [the impact of factors such as long-term temperature cycles in the oceans and the output of the sun] has been shown over the past two decades to have a magnitude that dominates the greenhouse warming effect. “It is becoming increasingly apparent that our attribution of warming since 1980 and future projections of climate change needs to consider natural internal variability as a factor of fundamental importance.”</Msg><Username>value_investorr</Username><Timestamp>1350252050886</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 18:00:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350252172951-102</Id><Topic><Title>UK Meteorological Center saying Global Warming has stopped</Title><Username>value_investorr</Username><Timestamp>1350252050886</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 18:00:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hey look at it this way ignorant Libtards, Obama can now claim he kept a campaign promise.

Farmers are very much in favor of socialism for farmers. Read the history of the various Farm Bills they've aggressively lobbied for and participated in. (The recent trend is away from direct payment and price supports and toward government subsidized insurance to protect them against production and price risks.) The income/wealth to farmers from the rest of us have been huge. The idea that farmer will cut acreage with grain prices at current very high levels is silly. Farmers won't cut acreage unless the gov pays them to, as has often been the case in the past when there were surpluses and low prices. With today's grain prices, they're bidding up prices for tillable pasture land to bring it into production.</Msg><Username>jefatkinson</Username><Timestamp>1350253824861</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 18:30:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350254045531-105</Id><Title>I volunteered for Governer Romney this whole weekend</Title><Msg>Honestly it's so nice to see so many nice blond chics lined up behind Romney too</Msg><Username>kingofvietnam</Username><Timestamp>1350254045531</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 18:34:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350254116417-106</Id><Topic><Title>“Bully Joe” Biden makes quick work out of the Republican tool! ha</Title><Username>andym_30054</Username><Timestamp>1350139922232</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-13 10:52:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That punk Ryan deserved to be hit on the head with a chair for holding entire America hostage!

They take politics as hate and war and practice scorched earth policy for our own country and nation. That ugly Senator Mitch McConnell is the symbol of the new GOP! A despicable character daring to say in public that main goal of the GOP is to make the President of the U.S. a one-term president. Wretched and ugly Senator. You are going to eat up those words soon... and your party is going to be subjected to a resounding rejection in the election. You are your party are despicable because you want to see all America go down... just because you are in full hatred and animal rage against a popular and historic president. Senator, you and the GOP are destined to lose. The Taliban and Al-Quaida are proud of you!
