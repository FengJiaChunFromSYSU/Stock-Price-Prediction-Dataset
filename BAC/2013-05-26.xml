The operation was fully in the hands of the defense department from the time the president told them to handle it until it was over and done. State department is not involved until statements start going out to the public. By the time Obama is in Vegas the incident is long over. Of course you can claim the defense department should have sent the four guys from Tripoli in without knowing what was going on and they would not have arrived until the first attack was well over and then would have had to find and get to the safe house and maybe they might have been there in time to help...or get killed themselves . All this with no regard for liaison with the Libyan government. Those two died doing their job. The job they signed up for. No one forced them to take that job and they knew what the risks were. They did it well protecting the civilians in their care. One might ask why the civilians were not out firing back at the attackers and aiding in their own defense.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1369556329537</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-26 04:18:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369560953688-7</Id><Topic><Title>I truly believe the Republicans would complain about intercourse!</Title><Username>andym_30054</Username><Timestamp>1369493485743</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-25 10:51:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It was the court that defined it, not Clinton.

Chasing two men brought out a Militia that resembled #$%$ Storm Troupers. What was most worrisome is that the Boston public seemed to sanction the city wide raids that were deployed in order to catch 2 men. . People were cowering in their properties just because the police branded the action as emanating from a terrorist cell. From now on, all that has to happen, is that any crime committed by individuals be branded as a terrorist act, and the Storm Troupers will come out to catch them, Meanwhile the freedoms of thousands will be suspended. When the police are handed such power, you should all be worried, very worried. Now is the time to speak out against these phony police reactions. This is exactly how Hitler took over the cities of Germany. Tell lies about the enemy,(the Jewish People as an example) and the public will come to your side without thinking, or evaluating the consequences.</Msg><Username>bejupete</Username><Timestamp>1369577880769</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-26 10:18:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>13</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369579549403-21</Id><Topic><Title>I want to open a tax-free corp that pledges to work to overthrow the IRS</Title><Username>golden_ghandi</Username><Timestamp>1369251958344</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 15:45:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>how happy will you be when weeds choke out crops and antibiotics no longer work?

All these might be just coincidence, until you find out that the suspects' uncle Ruslan married the daughter of publicly known CIA officer.

ROFLMFO. No one cares about the holodeck until there are no homes in ND for oil worker or the people who work in the local businessses making sure they have food and things. The economic signs and respect for those was what made capitlism work for the people. Now we have homes no one can use and a cycle of bailouts and bubbles. The hard part was always getting a proper reaction to data that is not immediately flattering to the sensitive brats so that everyone could win. With a housing shortage in north dakota, not even the oil workers are assured of affordable housing. Even rewarding production has been hard as the sociophiles always use manipulation to divert rsources to tira masu consumption.
