The only way the FED can try to stem this tide is by keeping the interest rates artifically low which is their punishment on savers for not playing with the Wall street sharks.

Those programs were made to support business profits from Tax dollars. Any one of us could cut a Trillion dollars from the budget every years, each person in Congress has their own pet project that wastes money, the Defense budget are loaded with them. We don't have a lowest bidder system for Government Work, start one. Your children and grandchildren will not be paying much of anything to the debt, nothing but wasted talking points. Infrastructure Spending creates Jobs, more jobs increase the tax base to Gov and that will reduce what each person has to pay in Taxes. Cut all Social Services for anyone illegal, that is anyone without a Social Security Number, gets nothing..No Food stamps, No Unemployment Payments, No Gov Gifts. Right now we have Millions of people collecting Total Disability while they are out on the Golf Course every week. Every person on Disability should only be paid for what percent of Disability they have, 10%, 50%, 80%, 100%. I know someone with a Bad Knee on Full Disability, he walks better than I do. I know someone else who goes fishing on his big boat every week and he is on Full Disability, I still can't figure out for what.. I also know a Cop who is on Full Pension because she has Nerve Damage in her Trigger finger, I'M not kidding, I know that is a union pension but we do pay for it in the end.. So lets not pick on the poor and the people making $10 per hour, I'm OK with them not paying anything, you can't get blood out of stone.. Every Person making over $50,000 should pay No Less than 25% in Taxes for anything over that.. No body making Millions should pay less because of deductions. I am not a Liberal, I pay 33% in taxes because I live in America and I worked my #$%$ off my whole life, I never collected Unemployment, I only bought American Made cars to support American jobs, I don't expect any American to compete with workers in China or Mexico because Americans live better than any of them,,we have more...we expect more and we pay for better.</Msg><Username>fireundersmoke</Username><Timestamp>1353797825545</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-24 17:57:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353798195285-108</Id><Topic><Title>CNN BOEHNER NO DEAL IF TAXES ARE RAISE FOR THE RICH......DOWN DOWN 500 MONDAY</Title><Username>dextergestapo</Username><Timestamp>1353795408524</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-24 17:16:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Not necessarily hard working, like Mitt, most of them are born into wealth and privilege.

You have stumbled upon what you mistakenly thought was a BAC financial message board. Unfortunately, it is not. It is, however, open for any other topic of discussion you would like, with particular emphasis on the Iraq war, both pro and con, politics in general, as well as religious topics of any kind. Bad poetry and boring travelogs are also welcome, as well as daily diaries of your personal activities and medical history. DO NOT, however, post anything even remotely related to BAC or finance or the markets. Posting any kind of on-topic, BAC or finance or market related posts will get buried by the resident gang crap that has hijacked this forum. Of particualar annoyance lately has been yellowratchimp/gutlesswhatever/shockertoyounumber/blubbering_billy_idiot/the_idiot_foreigner, and its latest incarnation, chimpbushidiot. It has attempted to take over this forum for it's own particular brand of left-wing, anti-American propoganda. The only posters that read its crap are honourmydick/starswithoutbrains/rememberwhenihadalife, and libertydujour. As a matter of fact, they may very well be all the same poster, along with JoeKent, donut/fruitcake/prawndujour, stanluboffanynumberwilldo...(See The Theory of JoeKent and the Gang...) Consider yourself warned, and proceed at your own risk! This board is always, however, good for sarcasm &amp; witticisms... Good luck. Later...
