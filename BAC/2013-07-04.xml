My wife and I live on Social Security, own a home and have no debt. My son lives with us and makes $7800 a year. I drive him to work everyday and spend only about $90 on gas a month by way of a local grocery store chain who gives points for groceries purchased there. Last month my gas cost me $2.55 a gallon. Next month I will get $1.80 off a gallon of gas plus 5 cents per gallon using their credit card. We have no interest in toys like Iphones, Ipads, Ipods or "I" anything and we still have money left each month to pay property taxes of around $5000 and $2000 car insurance each year. We get interest from the bank on monies in our checking account that grows each month and savings account which we don't touch and we pay no banking fees of any kind from the Regional Bank we bank with. We also have an account with BAC where our SS payments goes and pay no fees. I'm sure we fall within a few of your categories listed above but life is what a person makes of it. Most people on your list can't control their spending, therefore complain about how the banks are treating them. Are you one of them?</Msg><Username>bondholder44</Username><Timestamp>1372911216604</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-04 00:13:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372919372056-2</Id><Title>NCDEX news for 4th july</Title><Msg>NCDEX Chana for august delivery may trade on bullish side ,you supported it at 3562, 3520 and resistance at 3676, 3696.

Always putting 15% of each paycheck into an IRA. I don't get a pension just SS, however my IRA is paying itself $118 a day, everyday, 365 days a year. That money in the IRA is for helping my sons in their retirement years. In a year or two I have to start taking out monies from the IRA and transfer to another account. Have been doing so for a couple of years trying not to pay Fed. income taxes on my SS. At 70 1/2 I guess I will not be able to prevent that. The State provides a reduction on tax payers with property however the State has taken that away from its seniors wth incomes of $32 thousand or more. Half of a husband and wife SS is figured into that. Over my lifetime I have had 6 jobs and enjoyed all of them, but the monies into my IRA has never changed. As far as our expenses, home paid off, no car payments, insurance, property tax, etc., we seem to be living the same life style. I have owned 5 homes and made money on the 4 sales. Paid cash on the last one that we now own. The price on the present home has dropped, however I know the price over time will rebound to more than we paid for it. Got my first college degree when I was 50 and a second one at 57. Just been using my common sense to live up to then, which it seems other people disregard. It has been great talking to you.

CCUR tracks the behavior of 35mm pay-TV subscribers and has processed 15 billion media transactions. Big Data Analytics is the hottest space on Wall Street. Tableau Software (DATA) recently had its IPO at $31 and hit a new 52-week high yesterday of $61.45 for a gain of 98%.

I'm two years older than the baby boomer's starting point. As we were growing up, we were incurraged to SAVE sponsored by banks, public schools, and public broadcasting. Today's generations have goals of owning all the toys available and live for the day. A year ago, I sold a car I owned for 21 years and had personal problems selling it -purchased a smaller one with better gas mileage using cash and that car will be my last car in this life time. If you haven't noticed, I am a millionaire and working on my second million most of which is in an IRA. My goal is to increase the amount earned per day in that IRA. I have said it alot around this board, but I make $118 dollars a day, everyday, 365 days a year in that IRA through corporate bonds. On this day, 4th of July, I earned $118 and at midnight another $118.. If I live that long, I will see another half million in about 8 years meaning that at that time I'll be working on my third million none of which will come from the stock market or wages. Social Security is our only usable income and we always have money left at the end of the month except on property tax day. I'm feel sorry for you knowning your goals are only owning a home and having no debt and the rest being pointless. When you're ready to retire there will be no Social Security and you will look back and see how pointless your statement really is. You'll be working until the day you die. My goal is to insure my sons ability to retire at a reasonable time in their lives without Social Security.
