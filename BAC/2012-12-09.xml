This investment has received criticism as the United States makes an effort to slash nearly $4 trillion in government spending.Plenty of outrage following the announcement made Thursday afternoon by a government commission that suggested huge cuts to the budget, including eliminating the interest education for home mortgage. This juxtaposed with the United States investing millions to refurbish mosques as a good-will effort in Muslim countries has upset many taxpayer groups. “We are spending money we don’t have. This is all on a gigantic credit card right now,” said Jared Thomas, a taxpayer advocate. Millions more dollars have been sent to places like Cyprus. The State Department displays before and after pictures of mosques refurbished with U.S. tax dollars. “I think it is very hard to explain to the American taxpayer right now whose having an extraordinary time paying bills and making ends meet that this is why we took this out of your paycheck, so we can fund this,” said Thomas.</Msg><Username>carburetorkid</Username><Timestamp>1355059341495</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-09 08:22:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355059376724-29</Id><Title>All those Apple sellers need somewhere to put thier money</Title><Msg>Limited upside from increasing competition, lack of new product lines, aapl crosses the death cross.

Since the collapse of the economy in 2008, the government has poured $520 billion — an amount equal to about half its annual deficit in recent years — into unemployment benefit extensions.

Normal math..$520 billion-4 years equals $130 per year.

And, of course, NO (underline) GOP persons (allegedly) will want a tax increase—hey that means jobs lost!—and govt funding is a spending problem, not an income problem (also allegedly). GOP sen coburn wants “entitlement” reform, and more individual participation (meaning personal dollars) re using medicare. Then the guests left and roundtable came, the Carvilles, Paul Krugman, g f will again, and matthew dowd. Krugman claims no GOP specificity re loopholes, etc…points out charitable deductions are targeted and that is baaad and closing “loopholes” would raise few dollars. Mr Carville says the same, his wife pointed out—twice—that GOP persons elected to many governorships, run many state legislatures, and their budgets are in good shape. Michigan—union dominated rust belt state—just may become “right to work” state number 24, joining Indiana as right to work and rust belt. Mrs Carville says out of wedlock babies a greater problem to the future economy than “gay” marriages, which would seem to produce few children. Brief mention of 2016—with “many” democrats wanting hillary to run. GOP, well they have eloquent Ryan and ethnic favorite Marco Rubio for two likelies.

Do conservatives tend to be less intelligent than liberals? A provocative new study from Brock University in Ontario suggests the answer to both questions may be a qualified yes. The study, published in Psychological Science, showed that people who score low on I.Q. tests in childhood are more likely to develop prejudiced beliefs and socially conservative politics in adulthood. I.Q., or intelligence quotient, is a score determined by standardized tests, but whether the tests truly reveal intelligence remains a topic of hot debate among psychologists. Dr. Gordon Hodson, a professor of psychology at the university and the study's lead author, said the finding represented evidence of a vicious cycle: People of low intelligence gravitate toward socially conservative ideologies, which stress resistance to change and, in turn, prejudice, he told LiveScience. Why might less intelligent people be drawn to conservative ideologies? Because such ideologies feature "structure and order" that make it easier to comprehend a complicated world, Dodson said. "Unfortunately, many of these features can also contribute to prejudice," he added. Dr. Brian Nosek, a University of Virginia psychologist, echoed those sentiments. "Reality is complicated and messy," he told The Huffington Post in an email. "Ideologies get rid of the messiness and impose a simpler solution. So, it may not be surprising that people with less cognitive capacity will be attracted to simplifying ideologies." But Nosek said less intelligent types might be attracted to liberal "simplifying ideologies" as well as conservative ones. In any case, the study has taken the Internet by storm, with some outspoken liberals saying that It validates their suspicions about conservatives and conservatives arguing that the research has been misinterprete</Msg><Username>mr.whizzard</Username><Timestamp>1355075905186</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-09 12:58:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>30</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355075925100-57</Id><Title>The Riccaro Money Flow Quotient signals strong buy on BAC.</Title><Msg>Signaled as a strong buy on 12/9 at 10.64 with a stop loss at 8.87.

Now you are in the" republicans are wealthy democrats are poor" camp.. Yes there are more poor than rich and as Mitt so well pointed out the GOP could care less about anyone but the wealthy. Now if you want to get in to policies that have been made in the last 50 years that have disenfranchised the middle class to enrich the wealthy you have a concerted effort by the GOP that shows their disdain for the working man. The evidence is clear. Rather than storm the Bastille as was done in France, in a democratic country the solution is voting for policies the level the playing field so the working poor and middle class get a bit more of the GDP they help produce. Arguments about who that money belongs to is always part of labor negotiations and tax policy. There is no clear evidence that it should belong to one segment of the economic community over the other. When it starts eroding the middle class and the govenment has to be relied on to support a large portion of the labor force it is obvious that that the distribution is out of balance.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1355085150590</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-09 15:32:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355085176515-76</Id><Topic><Title>The republican party wants to be identified as conservative and moderate, but they encourage extremist, racist, and perverted hate-mongering elements--like the KKK Tea Baggers-- to join their ranks.

I would have done the important parts in crayon to make it more comfortable for you but it doesn't work on message boards. " Jobless Americans have collected $434 billion in unemployment benefits over the past four years. Taxpayers have footed $184.7 billion of the tab incurred during the federal government's unparalleled response to the Great Recession, according to Labor Department data. State and federal taxes on employers cover the rest. The cost of continuing this safety net will be the subject of intense debate in Congress in coming weeks as lawmakers decide whether to extend the deadline to file for federal benefits beyond year's end. Keeping this lifeline in place through 2012 would cost $44 billion. Here's how the system works: The jobless collect up to 26 weeks of state benefits before shifting to the federal program. Federal benefits consist of up to 53 weeks of emergency compensation, which is divided into four tiers, and up to another 20 weeks of extended benefits. Those who reach the end of their state benefits or federal tier will not be able to apply for additional benefits unless the deadline to file is extended. We're hiring! Some 17.6 million Americans have collected federal benefits over the past four years. The most recent extension, passed last December, kept 7 million people on the rolls. If Congress doesn't act, 5 million Americans would lose federal benefits in 2012, according to the Labor Department. "These modest payments help unemployed workers and their families stay afloat and they keep money flowing into local businesses," said Christine Owens, executive director of the National Employment Law Project. While extending the safety net generally has bipartisan support, lawmakers are deeply divided over how to pay for it. Republicans have insisted the cost be covered through steps such as spending reductions, while Democrats want it considered emergency spending so it would not have to be offset by other measures. "Some lawmakers say that we cannot afford to extend unemployment benefits and payroll tax relief in the current fiscal environment. But I say we can't afford not to," Labor Secretary Hilda Solis said at a press conference Wednesday. Federal emergency benefits began in June 2008 and have been increased or extended eight times since then. When Congress passed a 13-month extension last December, it was thought by some to be the last. The cost of jobless benefits has been dropping as the unemployment rolls contract. Some $156 billion was doled out in fiscal 2010, boosted in part by a $25 weekly supplement that ended in the middle of that year. The unemployed collected only $116 billion in the past fiscal year. As of early November, 6.7 million people were collecting state or federal unemployment benefits, down from a height of 12.1 million in January 2010."

Of the 10 lowest, eight are “red.” Even within states, Democratic-leaning counties tend to consume fewer services for the tax money they contribute than red counties do—even though Democratic areas generally include large urban populations. While food stamp growth ballooned during the president’s first two years in office, from 2010-2011 it only increased by three percent as the recovery began to take hold. Yet during the 2012 election, Newt Gingrich constantly referred to President Obama as “the food stamp president,” a term whistling with “welfare queen”-like racial overtones. Despite Gingrich’s racial connotations, the majority of Americans who use food stamps are white, and they increasingly live in Republican areas. Bloomberg recently compiled U.S. Department of Agriculture data and found that, “70 percent of counties with the fastest growth in food-stamp aid during the last four years voted for the Republican presidential candidate in 2008.” Democratic voters are increasingly supporting Republican voters. This is largely due to the lingering impact of the financial downturn, which has been exacerbated in red states and red counties with red policies. Republicans have been enacting austerity measures at state and local levels with unprecedented downsizing of public employees during the jobs crisis. Total governmental employment is down more than half a million since President Obama took office. Many of these workers who lost their good government jobs are unemployed or forced to take wages so low that they still qualify for food stamps. In 2010, 41 percent of those who received food aid had jobs. Blue states tend to take better care of the poor and also take steps to prevent poverty by spending more on education. “By nearly every measure, people who live in the blue states are healthier, wealthier, and generally better off than people in the red states,” according to The New Republic’s Jonathan Cohn. Republican states not only benefit most from government support, their policies create the need for food stamps in the first place! Facts have no meaning when it comes to the GOP... now led by a bunch of mindless fanatics!</Msg><Username>giovannijay</Username><Timestamp>1355111337598</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-09 22:48:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355111886129-177</Id><Topic><Title>WE NEED A BIG ATLAS SHRUG</Title><Username>whitest_white</Username><Timestamp>1355089616923</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-09 16:46:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wow, you didn't read it.

However, McConnell’s plan backfired after Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) called for a vote on the legislation, which would have given the president the authority to raise the federal debt ceiling on his own. The top Senate Republican was forced to filibuster his own bill. What we have here is a case of Republicans here in the Senate once again not taking ‘yes’ for an answer,” Reid said, after McConnell announced his filibuster. “This morning the Republican leader asked consent to have a vote on this proposal, just now I told everyone we were willing to have that vote — up or down vote. Now the Republican leader objects to his own idea. So I guess we have a filibuster of his own bill, so I object.” Now, that's pretty darn funny, dontcha think?</Msg><Username>tinkers_curse</Username><Timestamp>1355112678369</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-09 23:11:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355113330958-185</Id><Topic><Title>WE NEED A BIG ATLAS SHRUG</Title><Username>whitest_white</Username><Timestamp>1355089616923</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-09 16:46:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>800-plus pages of boring psuedo-philosophy with a theme that can only make one laugh out loud: the rich and powerful are being abused so they take their toys and go home.
