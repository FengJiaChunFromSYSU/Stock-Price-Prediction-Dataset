"Mitt Romney’s promise to restore $716 billion that he says President Obama “robbed” from Medicare has some health care experts puzzled, and not just because his running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan, included the same savings in his House budgets. Mitt Romney discussing Medicare last week. The $716 billion that he promises to restore to the program would be for higher payments to care providers, not for recipients’ benefits. The 2010 health care law cut Medicare reimbursements to hospitals and insurers, not benefits for older Americans, by that amount over the coming decade. But repealing the savings, policy analysts say, would hasten the insolvency of Medicare by eight years — to 2016, the final year of the next presidential term, from 2024. While Republicans have raised legitimate questions about the long-term feasibility of the reimbursement cuts, analysts say, to restore them in the short term would immediately add hundreds of dollars a year to out-of-pocket Medicare expenses for beneficiaries. That would violate Mr. Romney’s vow that neither current beneficiaries nor Americans within 10 years of eligibility would be affected by his proposal to shift Medicare to a voucherlike system in which recipients are given a lump sum to buy coverage from competing insurers.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1345647548548</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 10:59:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345647624341-58</Id><Title>PRESIDENT OBAMA UP DOUBLE DIDGETS OVER MORMON MOBSTER ROMNEY +RE+ELECT THE PRESIDENT</Title><Msg>REPUBLICANS SUCK</Msg><Username>A Yahoo!

Imagine how crazy the GOP must be to AGAIN sell themselves to the intelligent voters the VERY SAME policies and politics to gain leadership. Only the insane will want to try the same BLUNDERS that brought America to its knees! They seem unaware the old days of lying, smearing, and namecalling to win elections is a thing of the past thanks to speedy communication and easy access to the FACTS by voters- as a crazy Republican candidate Akin learned in the last few days! - in a TIMELY MANNER. The GOP will be UNMASKED in our age of information for who they really are hence a more informed electorate will keep them out of important leadership of our nation. As an independent, the GOP will never get my vote again!</Msg><Username>giovannijay</Username><Timestamp>1345650044858</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 11:40:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345650117134-82</Id><Title>Double dip recession headed our way</Title><Msg>"Economists say we could be headed for a second recession—and if they’re right, it’s poised to be even more devastating than the first, writes Catherine Rampell in the New York Times.

The difference is Bush managed the crisis and he handled the job. Obama hasn't. BTW, the only war we are not able to win is the one the Democrats were in favor of. Afghanistan! Another dose of reality, the Clinton surplus the liberals brag about came from that improperly managed tech bubble, that was allowed to careen out control. Combined with off the books borrowing from Social Security, and the neglect and failure to make appropriate expenditures to counter the increasing incidents of terror perpetrated by Al-Qaeda around the world. In other words, it never really existed except on paper. And, how do you have a surplus while you are still running up the National Debt as Clinton was? Bush, upon entering office, immediately called for investigations into Fannie and Freddie that were held up in committee or filibustered at very turn by Democrats and a handful RINOs. Bush continued to call for and urge congress to investigate these GSE’s throughout his entire presidency. No action was taken. Those investigations had the potential to expose the whole mortgage back security scam before it became critical. Thank Barney Frank, Barack Obama and Chris Dodd for leading the opposition to those requested investigations. Bush never had a super majority in congress as Obama was privileged to have for two years, and wasted on the ideological legislation of Obamacare, rather than on fixing the economy. While Obama sat on his hands waiting for Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi to push though his health care nightmare, the economy continued to fall deeper and deeper into despair. Spending reeled out of control with government sinking it’s tentacles deep into the private sector arena with business choking regulations and bailouts for campaign donors of Obama. Had Obama put aside his ideological nonsense and focused on a private sector based recovery plan we would not still be in this dire recession. This is Obama's mess, in all this time as president he and his party still refuse to take responsibility, and he continues to blame everything under the sun but himself. Yet Democrats blame Bush for everything that transpired in his first nine months. Double standard idiocy! Obama is no leader! Obama is without one original cogent idea! Obama has damage hundreds of thousands of families beyond repair. He's just a sniveling whiner! And now he wants to sue the banks! What a feeble ideologically blinded mind this president has!</Msg><Username>carburetorkid</Username><Timestamp>1345650967528</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 11:56:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345651184301-87</Id><Topic><Title>Has Obama invited Ahmadinejad over for a beer</Title><Username>dumpobamie</Username><Timestamp>1345648944010</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 11:22:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Has Romney?

In interviews, news releases and tweets, they've blasted Akin for saying victims of "legitimate rape" are able to naturally prevent pregnancy and tried to tie their opponents to legislation he's supported. Those moves might only be the beginning, as Akin has so far refused to drop out of the race despite pleas from top Republicans, including GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney, and the widespread condemnation of his remarks. "PEOPLE are DISGUSTED and APPALLED," said Joe Mikosi, a Democratic congressional candidate in suburban Denver, who began tying his opponent, GOP Rep. Mike Coffman, to Akin within hours of learning about his comments this past Sunday. Mikosi sent a tweet that read, "Mike Coffman and Todd Akin have been fighting side by side AGAINST WOMEN in Congress," and posted a video online included footage of Akin praising Coffman on the House floor. Coffman responded by calling for Akin to leave the race and decrying his rape comments as "wrong, inappropriate and hurtful to women across the country." It's a scene repeated in House races nationwide, as Akin's comments on rape are playing a role in more than dozen House races in battleground states — particularly those in which the incumbents joined Akin last year in co-sponsoring a resolution that would have redefined rape as "forcible rape." Most Democrats and women's groups objected to such language, because it suggested there are different severities of rape. "People are simply amazed there are elected officials who would take these positions, to redefine rape," he said. "We were hearing about it in Wisconsin before Akin said this, and of course we're hearing a lot more about it now." The GOP belongs in the 50's! Times and progress have left the party behind times by 6 decades or so. Thus the tide is rising against the GOP... as their fanaticism and ideology have become unsuitable for human progress.</Msg><Username>giovannijay</Username><Timestamp>1345674295575</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 18:24:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345674357219-162</Id><Topic><Title>Hey dumpobamie...what's round on the ends and high in the middle?</Title><Username>lying_teabag_sakkk_sukkker</Username><Timestamp>1345670284259</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 17:18:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Is this a trick question?</Msg><Username>big_trlceratops</Username><Timestamp>1345674357219</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 18:25:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345674425975-163</Id><Topic><Title>Who says Akin doesn't know how to spell kootch?</Title><Username>lying_teabag_sakkk_sukkker</Username><Timestamp>1345669187934</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 16:59:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>who cares???????? he knows how it works.</Msg><Username>big_trlceratops</Username><Timestamp>1345674425975</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 18:27:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345674517023-164</Id><Title>Growing Evidence of a Stock Market Crash and a looming Deep Recession</Title><Msg>Obama will lose in a landslide</Msg><Username>tulsaturd</Username><Timestamp>1345674517023</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 18:28:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345674595394-165</Id><Topic><Title>Obama set up trust funds for all of his half-brothers' children and all of his half-brothers' childrens' children to squelch all of the bad press he got on Fox News for not paying the medical bills for his half-brothers' chidren and their childrens' children.</Title><Username>lying_teabag_sakkk_sukkker</Username><Timestamp>1345670954963</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 17:29:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm not going to do that.

Up from -170, the Democrats now sit at -190 which is just short of 1/2 odds. With the Dems going up, the Republicans had to fall. Now sitting at +155 (down from +140), the Republicans would appear to be sliding heading into the last few months before the election but we've seen these odds shift quite a bit since Romney seemingly wrapped up the Republican nomination. In actuality, now might be the best time to bet on Romney to win President simply because of his odds and where he currently stands. If the odds were much lower, it would probably be too risky to wager anything on it. But, right now they're still at the point of being possible and profitable which is what you should look for.</Msg><Username>ooo_mau_mau</Username><Timestamp>1345674976769</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 18:36:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345675053757-170</Id><Topic><Title>Our champion of conservative Republican values, (R-MO) Rep.

Don't you think that's a cute little riddle Round on the end and "Hi" in the middle You can find it on the map if you look high and low. The O's are round, it's high in the middle. O-H-I-O That's the riddle! Round on the end and "Hi" in the middle. O-HI-O!</Msg><Username>sapiosexual_1</Username><Timestamp>1345679015600</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 19:43:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345679030960-192</Id><Topic><Title>Who is the GOP for?</Title><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1345678278511</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 19:31:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It is for disconnected, ignorant fools like Congressman Akin.

For example, if $1,100 has been placed on all horses, and $375 has been placed on Our Horse to Win, and the track’s percentage is 15%, then we would use the following procedure to calculate the horse racing odds on our stallion: First, we would take out the track’s percentage by multiplying $1,100 by 0.85, winding up with $935. We then take our horse’s bets out of that total by subtracting $375 from $935, ending up with $560. Then, we divide the total remaining bet pool by the amount placed on our horse, so divide $560 by $375, winding up with $1.49. That gets rounded up to $1.50, and our final horse racing odds are 1.5:1, or 3:2. WOW, THAT'S COMPLICATED!
