What is happening is stagnation in the major indices. This happens when the large derivative players are shifting their positions. They are now moving money and are going to bet against both markets. In the past this is when large corrections take place (over 10 percent). The large derivative players are the ones that run the indices. For example look at Warren Buffet; he is a heavy derivative player that has, over the last five years, substantially decreased his position in stocks and gone the derivative route. Smart, rich player. Derivative are an easy way to hide money.......so large losses can be covered up. The SEC does not understand this and they cannot track this. The result is no regulation. It will only take one major, dishonest derivative player to send our financial systems into ruin.</Msg><Username>geraldomcginty</Username><Timestamp>1371898961288</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-22 07:02:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371898974778-2</Id><Topic><Title>Derivatives</Title><Username>geraldomcginty</Username><Timestamp>1371898961288</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-22 07:02:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There are two.</Msg><Username>geraldomcginty</Username><Timestamp>1371898974778</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-22 07:02:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371900322987-3</Id><Topic><Title>ROTFLMAO 'stockpikerre' + 'generatee1' + 'gfasrd190' = 1 frustrated subgenius?</Title><Username>fish2kill</Username><Timestamp>1371848986833</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-21 17:09:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>But what about the Al Bundy Kyle Dube econonmics conference?

In this piece they show which states depend most heavily on federal aid as a percentage of state general revenue. I was surprised by some of the Red States on this list such as Mississippi which relies on the fed for 49% of its general revenue. If there’s going to be a states right movement then these states need to stop eating so much from the federal trough. Richard Borean of The Tax Foundation illustrates that truth here: This week, our Monday Map illustrates what percentage of a state’s general revenue is made up of federal aid. Mississippi relies more heavily on federal assistance than other states, with 49% of its total general revenue coming from federal aid. Close behind are Louisiana at 46.5% and Arizona at 45.7%. On the other end of the spectrum, Alaska relies on federal aid for only 24% of its general revenue, followed closely by Delaware at 25.9% and North Dakota at 26%. ................................. Of course in North Dakota and Alaska they have small populations and a lot of oil revenue.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1371907432485</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-22 09:23:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371908212656-12</Id><Topic><Title>If GOP would have not deregulated the banks this financial crisis would never have happened and kids would not be starving !</Title><Username>dubbyaworstever</Username><Timestamp>1371672342043</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 16:05:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well lets see Hitch.

The Obama campaign last night issued a statement by Raines insisting, "I am not an advisor to Barack Obama, nor have I provided his campaign with advice on housing or economic matters."

Still that is an Afghan problem not a US problem and they will fight it out among the warlords and tribes as they always have. Iran remains a problem that must be dealt with. Are you ready to fund a war this time or do you want to just charge it again? No new taxes but new wars are what the GOP seems to be all about. Those that got rich during the Bush wars ought to be funding the recovery.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1371921518589</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-22 13:18:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371921572247-32</Id><Topic><Title>Dear Fish/Viewer/Spock:</Title><Username>ghostwriteronthestorm</Username><Timestamp>1371918596562</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-22 12:29:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Dear Colleague, we would be happy to have you attend. Please submit a short abstract and a session preference- Bundy or Dube. We are happy to encourage new people in the field and speculative new ideas however someone with experience setting up an economic circle jerk and have it collapse ruining many lives on a fantasy would be preferable. If you can document your success in the field it will help us attract more experts and those who are simply curious about the dismal science. Experiences with entirely pointless industries or products would help, perhaps something like a miracle drug of somekind.

No I think it was the republican clamor for deregulation and the idea that trickle down would solve all problems if government just got out of the way left over from Reagan that has put us in this economic morass. Going back or perpetuating those ideas is doom. Do you agree it was a bad move or not?

One thing for sure a lot more Kurds and Shiites would have been slaughtered by now, and Iraq would have been hell bent on developing nuclear weapons. While Bush did set a timetable for withdrawal it was accelerated and complete (no residual presence) under Obama. It has guaranteed failure in Iraq. Same with Afghanistan. And you are wrong: Afghanistan is our probelm. We don't want a repeat of 9/11 whose plans were laid in the mountains of Afghanistan by OBL and fellow tribesmen.
