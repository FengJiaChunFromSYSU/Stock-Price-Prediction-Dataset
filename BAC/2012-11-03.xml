In 2012, the coverage gap - or "doughnut hole" - is $2,930. The law eliminates that gap by 2020. So far, no research has shown that the drugmakers have passed costs from those discounts on to other consumers, as some opponents of the law had feared. Compared to last year, more patients have saved more money this year, Blum said. Through August 2012, beneficiaries have saved an average of $641. "This could mean that more people are taking their medication as directed by their doctor on their prescriptions because they're more affordable," Blum said. The increased number of patients on medications could also be the result of seniors using the provision of the law that eliminates out-of-pocket expenses for annual and preventive exams. Before, a colorectal-cancer screening could cost as much as $160, according to Health and Human Services. "The law is already saving money on prescription drugs and ensuring millions of seniors can get the preventive care they need to stay healthy," HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1351915426552</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 00:03:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351915469103-2</Id><Topic><Title>It will be a sad day for America if Romney wins !</Title><Username>sirifuture</Username><Timestamp>1351893232560</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 17:53:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You have mental problems.</Msg><Username>barackalinski</Username><Timestamp>1351915469103</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 00:04:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351915684512-3</Id><Topic><Title>It will be a sad day for America if Romney wins !</Title><Username>sirifuture</Username><Timestamp>1351893232560</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 17:53:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Remember OBOMBYA lying to McCain about campaign contributions and then over the weekend by MONDAY accepting them when McCain 2 days before on FRIDAY agreed to the "LIMIT" .

These two late breaking stories should be the nails in the coffin of President Obama’s green energy agenda. The failure and the dishonesty totally discredit this staple of the President’s plan for a second term. The Washington Examiner reported on Wednesday on their analysis of the SEC filings of 15 publically traded companies that received taxpayer assistance from the Obama administration. The Examiner found that executives and corporate insiders had “pocketed tens of millions by selling their stock after the government's money poured in and before their companies' values plummeted.” These executives bet against their companies after asking taxpayers for help, and cashing out as taxpayer money went to waste. In two cases, insiders sold off stock worth nearly the amount of their government funding. Executives at Amyris, which received $24.3 million in government support, sold off $21 million worth of stock since 2009. At Solazyme, which received $21.8 million from taxpayers, executives made $18.4 million selling their stock in the company. These profits by executives dependent on taxpayer support underscore one of the fundamental problems with the President’s green energy initiatives – a problem his administration has been curiously uninterested in addressing: the President’s programs ask taxpayers to take all the risk of funding “green” startups, but let the private individuals who asked for help keep all the profits. In an even more outrageous example reported earlier this year, the CEO of First Solar – recipient of $3 billion in government loan guarantees – sold nearly half a billion dollars with of stock in his company as the price fell. Despite the President’s determination to continue funding green energy companies on the taxpayer dollar, the Washington Examiner found that so far his “investments” have performed abysmally: "The Obama administration gave more than $700 million in grants and guaranteed an additional $500 million in loans to publicly traded green energy companies through its 2009 stimulus package. If Obama had invested all that money in a Standard &amp; Poors index fund of the top 500 publicly traded companies, his investment would have seen a 73 percent return since he took office. In contrast, the Obama "green energy" stimulus portfolio has fallen by 78 percent -- performing about five points worse than green energy companies that didn't get subsidies.” Unfortunately, this weak performance didn’t prevent insiders from cashing out – and it’s not preventing Obama from touting these programs as a big part of his second term agenda. See the full story on Barack Obama's failed green energy agenda here Newly Released Emails Show Obama Personally Made Decisions About Green Energy Loans Just one week ago, President Obama claimed in an interview on Colorado television that he had nothing to do with decisions in the troubled green energy loan program that financed Solyndra and other high-profile stimulus recipients. He said they were “decisions, by the way, that are made by the Department of Energy, they have nothing to do with politics.” But emails released this week by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform strongly suggest that what the President said was untrue – that he didn’t leave loan decisions up to Department of Energy professionals, instead he and other White House officials put significant political pressure on the program. In one email, a senior DOE official says the President personally “imposed” a policy fast-tracking loan approvals. The official writes: “I am growing increasingly worried about a fast track process imposed on us at the POTUS level based on this chaotic process that we are undergoing…by designing the fast track process and having it approved at the POTUS level (which is an absolute waste of his time!) it legitimizes every element and it becomes embedded like the 55% recovery rate which also was imposed by POTUS.” In another email, it seems President Obama personally intervened on behalf of a loan applicant. An official writes to a DOE colleague, “Jonathan [Silver, Executive Director of the Loan Program] just said at our staff meeting that, opposite the message received on Thursday, AREVA is now a “go” (seems on Friday POTUS himself approved moving it ahead).” If President Obama was indeed involved in individual loan cases, it suggests his public claims that he wasn’t involved in the details of the program are simply dishonest. He was, in fact, playing investor-in-chief. And considering the Examiner’s analysis, he was doing a terrible job.</Msg><Username>broke.obama55</Username><Timestamp>1351915971018</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 00:12:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351918252741-6</Id><Title>Need to get Uncle Warren off the BofA payroll.</Title><Msg>Pay this guy off!</Msg><Username>dipacultboilwtr</Username><Timestamp>1351918252741</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 00:50:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351918361299-7</Id><Title>is odumba a retard ? he is as slow as they come.</Title><Msg>seems to be. too much bong will do it to you. and the other thing, only retard would pick a retard as the vp.</Msg><Username>big_triceratops</Username><Timestamp>1351918361299</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 00:52:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351918953159-8</Id><Topic><Title>Racist Tea Bagger fools froth at their bungs over Colin Powell endorsement of Obama</Title><Username>mr.whizzard</Username><Timestamp>1351276407546</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 14:33:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Let 'em froth.

Since I don't fit any of the charges in the indictment you've so casually lobbed into this thread, who else could you be referring too? 'sirfuture's' reply raised an entirely different issue regarding the size and cost of government; and 'jetatkinson' chimed in with a remark about faith and believing in myths.

Odds of 1-to-2 means you have to bet $1 to win 50 cents. To me, that means if Obama wins, as seems likely, I need to start selling my big winners. By the way, Intrade also is quoting even more certain odds that the Republicans will keep control of the House and the ditto the Democrats with the Senate. In other words, gridlock will be here for at least two more years, so do not expect any major initiatives absent the miraculous. That brings up what an Obama re-election means for the so-called fiscal cliff. The fiscal Cliff is, in essence, the result of a law requiring $560 billion combined in government spending cuts and higher taxes that will reduce a $1.1 trillion budget deficit by half. To me, if Obama wins, I cannot imagine that there will not be very many (if any) spending cuts anytime soon. A Google search says that this year’s presidential and congressional campaign spending will total around $6 billion, with most of that coming from the special interest groups that benefit the most from government largesse. Do you think that those who put up the $6 billion will allow the government to cut spending? Maybe growth in spending could be cut, but certainly not current spending. That leaves higher taxes. The special interest groups promoting lower taxes would seem to be in less favor with the Obama administration then those special interests that support more government. That is why I expect higher taxes by at least $200 billion annualized this year-end. I think it is certain that the 2% payroll tax will be repealed, equal to about $120 billion in higher taxes and at least an $80 billion increase in dividend and capital gains taxes. Currently, after-tax wages and salaries are growing by about $200 billion annualized unadjusted for inflation. If payroll and capital taxes grow by $200 billion, that leaves a no-growth economy. Given the slowdown in Europe and the emerging world, a flat U.S. would accentuate the global weakness, probably sending the U.S. into a downturn. In addition to the impact of higher taxes on the economy, stocks will also be hurt. On the one hand, the Federal Reserve wants to boost stock prices to create a wealth effect that boosts the economy. On the other hand, the Obama administration currently plans to raise dividend and capital gains taxes, which will depress stock prices and make for a negative wealth effect. Of course, Obama could throw us a curve and push for lower taxes for all making under $250,000, but even then the odds of no increase in dividends and capital gains taxes would seem to be very slim. Therefore, stocks with lots of built-in gains should sell off as we got closer to year-end. To me, that means the big tech winners -- such as Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG), and eBay (EBAY), could sell off through year-end. Personally, I have already started taking profits on my big winners now, expecting the year-end sell-off. Of course, all of the above assumes an Obama victory and that his administration will not change its tax policy.</Msg><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1351946233012</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 08:37:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351946450865-63</Id><Title>LYBIA SECURITY NOT UP TO BEIRUT STANDARDS A DEADLY ADMINISTRATION FAILURE</Title><Msg>GOOGLE THIS VIDEO: Chaffetz: US Security Experts Actually IN Libya Didn't Get Resources They Needed &amp; Asked For</Msg><Username>bury_obama</Username><Timestamp>1351946450865</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 08:40:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351946497606-64</Id><Topic><Title>Obama endorsed by Colin Powell.

The accounts, from foreign and American security officials in and around Benghazi at the time of the attack, indicate there was in fact a significant lag between when the threat started to show itself and help started to arrive. According to the CIA, the first calls for assistance came at 9:40 p.m. local time from a senior State Department official at the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, to the CIA annex about a mile away. But according to multiple people on the ground that night, the Blue Mountain Security manager, who was in charge of the local force hired to guard the consulate perimeter, made calls on both two-way radios and cell phones to colleagues in Benghazi warning of problems at least an hour earlier. Those calls allegedly went to local security contractors who say that the CIA annex was also notified much earlier than 9:40 p.m. U.S. military intelligence said that armed militia was gathering up to three hours before the attack began.</Msg><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1351947051747</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 08:50:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351947480315-67</Id><Title>Obama watched the Al Queda raid of Bengazi consulate from the "situation room" at 5 pm ET on 9/11 and decided to withhold help from his ambassador and our SEALs</Title><Msg>Obama has the blood of patriots on his hand.

Nothing inconsistent about Romney conducting a canned food drive for New York and New Jersey disaster relief in Kettering, Ohio, either.

As George Zornick reports (quoting Romney’s trustee, Brad Malt), “Over the entire 20-year period period [of 1990-2009, the Romneys gave to charity an average of 13.45 percent of their adjusted gross income.” To be a Mormon in good standing one must donate 10 percent of one’s gross income to the Mormon church. If Romney did so, that means he gave only 3.45 percent of his vast fortune to all other charities. Finally, there is the question of whom Romney gives his money to. Business Insider ran the numbers: “The answer appears to be primarily one organization: The Church of Jesus Christ Of Latter-Day Saints, more commonly known as the Mormon church. According to tax documents viewed by Business Insider, the vast majority of the money Mitt Romney gave away in 2009 and 2010—80 percent of it—went to the church.”</Msg><Username>venturian321</Username><Timestamp>1351969755103</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 15:09:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351969831838-124</Id><Topic><Title>In the Name of the Honest Citizens, An Arrest Warrant is Issued for the Moral Criminal Romney</Title><Username>venturian321</Username><Timestamp>1351966449270</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 14:14:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Try not to use words bigger than "it" and "the".

"You make a charitable donation, this whole place stinks with your sulphurous, sphincter emissions for a week - how much you just ingested. Oh, what a big man you are! .. and all that comes out of your mouth is bile. Ooh, how fouled-up you are!" The context: While running for president Romney seems to have suddenly found his inner philanthropist. As George Zornick reports (quoting Romney’s trustee, Brad Malt), “Over the entire 20-year period period [of 1990-2009, the Romneys gave to charity an average of 13.45 percent of their adjusted gross income.” To be a Mormon in good standing one must donate 10 percent of one’s gross income to the Mormon church. If Romney did so, that means he gave only 3.45 percent of his vast fortune to all other charities. Finally, there is the question of whom Romney gives his money to. Business Insider ran the numbers: “The answer appears to be primarily one organization: The Church of Jesus Christ Of Latter-Day Saints, more commonly known as the Mormon church. According to tax documents viewed by Business Insider, the vast majority of the money Mitt Romney gave away in 2009 and 2010—80 percent of it—went to the church.”</Msg><Username>mixtli_speaks</Username><Timestamp>1351974892320</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 16:34:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351975185476-139</Id><Topic><Title>Why don't the right wing imbeciles back up Romney on his FEMA comments?</Title><Username>frankmangus</Username><Timestamp>1351814335604</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 19:58:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The GOP mosquitoes at this board are just doing their jobs.

He turned the team over to couch GW. After 8yrs of trying, plus deficit spending the team ended up in last place with a losing record (banks in trouble, real-estate in shambles, auto industry near collapse, wall-street in freefall, negative GDP, high unemployment, two wars…etc). Folks stay with me on this one. Couch GW retired and turn over the team to couch BO. Couch BO then took this losing team and turned it into a team with a winning record (banks up, wall-street double, auto industry back on top, real-estate improving, unemployment improving, positive GDP…etc) after 3 plus yrs. This was done with half of the referees (Republican leadership, some billionaires ..etc) making bias calls, even tripping some of his players while the game result was on the line. Well it’s now late in the season and these billionaires and their friends (Koch brothers, D Donald…etc) are now advocating replacing couch BO, but there is a little problem. Most of the fans like the improvement they see with this team and they are resisting this need for change. The bigger problem was the replacement they want was a former Tee-ball couch (Mass Governor, Bain Capital, unemployed millionaire) who continue to change his training techniques (Flip Flop) every few weeks, resulting in total confusing of his players. Another problem the fans see with this new person is how much tall tale (Jeeps production to China) comes out of his mouth. The biggest problems the fans see is that the new person have stated publicly that he plan to use couch GW approach (cut taxes for the rich, remove regulations so banks and wall-street can now go wild again, even though this created the problem for the team/country in the first place). Now fans tell me, will it be a good idea to bring in this new person to start couching this team after what you saw with couch GW? Folks think about it, I’m sure you will draw the same conclusion as I do. Stay with couch BO.</Msg><Username>farawaylife</Username><Timestamp>1351977998197</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 17:26:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351978063077-155</Id><Topic><Title>PICKING THE RIGHT COUCH FOR THE TEAM</Title><Username>farawaylife</Username><Timestamp>1351977998197</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 17:26:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>dude, its coach. sheesh</Msg><Username>mixtli_speaks</Username><Timestamp>1351978063077</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 17:27:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351978203839-156</Id><Topic><Title>PICKING THE RIGHT COUCH FOR THE TEAM</Title><Username>farawaylife</Username><Timestamp>1351977998197</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 17:26:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You must have a tiny bit of Republican in you.

The Democrats came out in their convention with the likes of Sandra Fluck promoting free birth control and tax payer abortions. My husband was adopted many years ago by a wonderful Italian couple in PA that couldn't have children. This was a young couple (like 16) that elected to not have an abortion for convenience and give the child up for adoption. We should all think about what is happening in this Country with the lack of moral and religious convictions. Granted, every woman has a right to choose to terminate a pregnancy or do what I feel is the right thing. It doesn't matter who is elected, women will still have that option.

He turned the team over to coach GW. After 8yrs of trying, plus deficit spending the team ended up in last place with a losing record (banks in trouble, real-estate in shambles, auto industry near collapse, wall-street in freefall, negative GDP, high unemployment, two wars…etc). Folks stay with me on this one. Coach GW retired and turn over the team to couch BO. Coach BO then took this losing team and turned it into a team with a winning record (banks up, wall-street double, auto industry back on top, real-estate improving, unemployment improving, positive GDP…etc) after 3 plus yrs. This was done with half of the referees (Republican leadership, some billionaires ..etc) making bias calls, even tripping some of his players while the game result was on the line. Well it’s now late in the season and these billionaires and their friends (Koch brothers, D Donald…etc) are now advocating replacing couch BO, but there is a little problem. Most of the fans like the improvement they see with this team and they are resisting this need for change. The bigger problem was the replacement they want was a former Tee-ball couch (Mass Governor, Bain Capital, unemployed millionaire) who continue to change his training techniques (Flip Flop) every few weeks, resulting in total confusion of his players. Another problem the fans see with this new person is how much tall tale (Jeeps production to China) comes out of his mouth. The biggest problems the fans see is that the new person have stated publicly that he plan to use coach GW approach (cut taxes for the rich, remove regulations so banks and wall-street can now go wild again, even though this created the problem for the team/country in the first place). Now fans tell me, will it be a good idea to bring in this new person to start coaching this team after what you saw with couch GW? Folks think about it, I’m sure you will draw the same conclusion as I do. Stay with coach BO. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;</Msg><Username>farawaylife</Username><Timestamp>1351982051765</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 18:34:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351982093332-189</Id><Topic><Title>Romney: Support the Troops Like I Did: Dodge the Draft and Your Taxes Too!

But accepting words is easy, costs little and looks good. That's it. Actual compromise on those disparate viewpoints when crucial, national decisions/laws/policies etc must be made - or can no longer be delayed - is essential if we are to preserve or improve our nation's present and future viability. With years of polticial gridlock already behind us, and the prospect of many more ahead of us, more than words, dogma and rigid adherence to ideals are required. That is... simple, human, primal....give-and-take...i.e. compromise. Now I'm no Democrat true believer..just like any group of humans, some signficant percentage is going to be of rather dubious character, sooner or later. But in the political impasse before us as a nation.....one party has REFUSED to compromise. Regardless of provincial 'principles'...there is a much higher calling, an overriding principle that we who truly love the USA must abide....simple compromise. Without that how can any group of people, or nation, or any group whatsover, survive?</Msg><Username>venturian321</Username><Timestamp>1351985268257</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 19:27:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351985776867-218</Id><Topic><Title>LIFE IS A GIFT</Title><Username>parisonr</Username><Timestamp>1351982618983</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 18:43:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I will repeat, thank you for your kind words, ask for your prayers.

Some have said this Market could double again under Obama. Some have said if Romney wins, we are sure to go over the fiscal cliff, any cuts in this fragile economy would send the country back into recession or even worse. What Americans should be thinking about is voting people into Congress that will make cuts but also add more revenue to balance our government needs. With only 7% approval rating, the Congress is where we must make some big changes. The revenue of the Federal Government is equal to the revenue they had in 1950, With an extra 100 Million people to receive benefits by 2015. Everyone can see the problem is very big. If Congress would cancel some things passed under Bush, the problem becomes workable. Things to Cancel: 2003 Drug Bill costs this country an extra $400 Billion every year. Bush Tax cuts costs this country an extra $400 billion every year. $200 Billion per year was added to the Defense Budget. That is $1 Trillion dollars that can come off our government budget every year. Congress is looking to cut things that would never help help us balance the budget, Saving $5 billion a year from stopping payments to healthcare for women is not doing anything but hurting women. Cancel those mistakes that were not paid for under Bush. There is no reason to cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, Just remove the waste and there is sure to be enough savings there. I see no reason Medicare pays $7,000 to someone who needs an ELECTRIC Wheelchair, they will even pay for an Electric lift for a truck to load that wheelchair. I have posted about these Electric wheelchairs for the last 2 years because My Neighbor who is on Social Security and Medicare has enough money to buy a $45,000 Pickup truck and walks a mile every day, was able to get an $7,000 Wheelchair and a lift, paid for from Medicare. How many here have an Electric Wheelchair paid for from Medicare??</Msg><Username>fireundersmoke</Username><Timestamp>1351987421156</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 20:03:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351987454907-225</Id><Topic><Title>IF OBAMA WINS ATLAS SHRUGS</Title><Username>whitest_white</Username><Timestamp>1351977432143</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 17:17:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm more of an Inferno kind of guy.</Msg><Username>mixtli_speaks</Username><Timestamp>1351987454907</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 20:04:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351987564302-226</Id><Topic><Title>Libya.

But I believe President Obama and first lady Michelle have not lied and demonstrated a lot of integrity while Mr. Mitt Romney is on record for lying too times and apparently that is just for winning an election. That sounds too much of GOP politics and I hate to have a leader like that for America that sets an example for the rest of the world and mankind! He MUST be DEFEATED for that reason and a host of others! America is too important for mankind's progress and the age of consciousness has just dawned upon mankind! No more reptilian responses to the most important world problems that need to be resolved by leadership that America with an enlightened leadership can provide!</Msg><Username>giovannijay</Username><Timestamp>1351998223460</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 23:03:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351998432456-305</Id><Title>N*A*A*C*P Takes Over Houston Polling Station, Advocates for O bama</Title><Msg>townhall d*o*t **c*o*m</Msg><Username>jedbs2</Username><Timestamp>1351998432456</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 23:07:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351998437595-306</Id><Topic><Title>PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL WIN RE-ELECTION!</Title><Username>mr.whizzard</Username><Timestamp>1351992512976</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 21:28:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No doubt!!</Msg><Username>ebonics4gfy</Username><Timestamp>1351998437595</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 23:07:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351998508355-307</Id><Topic><Title>★★★★★ TWO days until the Re-Election of President Obama ★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★</Title><Username>ebonics4gfy</Username><Timestamp>1351998222624</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 23:03:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I will celebrate like I have never celebrated before and that's not only for America, but for the whole world.

That's some kind of timing for your surgery. Does your doctor understand what Election Day means to a political junkie? I guess as long as your surgeon isn't Dr. Nick Riviera, you'll be fine. Just don't exhaust yourself on Election Night; it'll probably be weeks or months before it's settled anyway, so try not to hang on every precinct's returns. Stay strong, paris, and let us know how things went as soon as you're able.

I believe he will prevail. I'm quite sure of it., I settled in America believing that America had the best chance of leading the world when it came to the right ideas in leadership... among all that the rest of the world offered in 1970 and I chose to settle here in the U.S. and have now a beautiful family and grandkids! I expect it to continue under the genuine leadership of President Obama regardless of his party and religion. The latter are just man made details and not too important, imo.

Yes, while the nation's public and civic institutions are under attack as undeserving, and too expensive, with 'socialist' tossed in for redneck and biblethumper flavor, these cynical and snickering elitists suck the government teat dry.
