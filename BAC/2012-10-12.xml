And it showed. Just hot air from a rank amateur. Ryan also must be naive fellow... who believes he can change the thinking of the Imams in Iran. Hmm... How could one change the thinking of religious nuts (Imams in Iran) from tens of thousand miles away in totally different country and culture? His answer was... we shouldn't give a schedule of leaving Afghanistan... even though 49 other countries already agreed with it. What? When we can't do anything about our own religious fanatics here in America how can you behave here so that you change the mindset of fanatics in other lands? Remember the fanatic who decided to burn Korans in public over here?</Msg><Username>johnmjay</Username><Timestamp>1350014494764</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 00:01:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350014621462-2</Id><Title>Undecideds and Independents will go for RYAN....BIG MOUTH BULLY Biden TOTALLY LOST THEM</Title><Msg>SAD but TRUE, In the next two days NEW POLLS will come out and OBAMA/BIDEN will not like it.</Msg><Username>urichey</Username><Timestamp>1350014621462</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 00:03:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350014963153-3</Id><Topic><Title>Undecideds and Independents will go for RYAN....BIG MOUTH BULLY Biden TOTALLY LOST THEM</Title><Username>urichey</Username><Timestamp>1350014621462</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 00:03:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hmm... said "objectively" by a Republican?

After an entire year of fear-mongering and saber-rattling and wailing about Obama's catastrophic failures with all things foreign, from Iraq and Israel and Iran to Afghanistan and Pakistan and Russia, to Libya, Syria and Egypt, Ryan was pinned down and forced to admit that the latest iteration of the Grand Romney-Ryan Foreign Policy Initiative boils down to this: "Well, we mostly agree with everything Obama's done, but he lacks credibility. We promise to raise America's credibility by making a lot more threats, and building as many aircraft carriers as it takes to back them up". ROTFLMAO and for a guy who's supposed to be a serious budget wizard, I was surprised by how math-averse Ryan seemed to be.</Msg><Username>fish2kill</Username><Timestamp>1350017992150</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 00:59:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350018130848-5</Id><Title>Biden did not win over any undecideds with that "performance".

You have got to be kidding. GM saw he was handing out money like water and wanted to get some free money. I remember the banks needing money to survive, next thing he is giving money to GM because he is from the Chicago area. Im not bashing him, im realistic. He had 4 years with the dems in the house to do something and we are worse off in getting jobs for americans. Listen I love freedoms America gives us.

Next you need to realize that during this administration we have had 40 months of job growth which is a complete turn around from what was going on when he took office. Your investment advice is just as silly. I suppose you would advise buying Gold. You'll find out how wise that is when you try to eat it. Donut has been a pretty savvy investor for a long time and will live comfortably without your advice. Next you need to check history. Obama never had four years or really even two where he could do anything he wanted.

The only thing holy in the Middle East are the graves they put their people in.

Not that it is even accurate because people are just given up trying to find jobs. I have 2 kids, did very good in school one with an MBA still having a tough time trying to find a job. If your older then you never had an issue finding a job so what has obama done for that. Just employ more government officials not complaining about that but it isn't private sector jobs that pay real money or growth. Just another way for bigger government. I like the fact that Romney giving control over to the states, Fed wasn't designed to run everything. That's how it started this country, states govern themselves. Don't get me wrong I like some things about obama (oil independent) etc. But I don't believe in life time politicians.

There is a triple top in place with a double bottom around $5. After the peak in mid-Sept. , it feel sharply dipping below $9. About that time I said to hang in there, it would recover. That it did. However now, I can not remain bullish. CNBC's Pisani has just fininished his take on banks. The main point is that with interest rates as low as they are and with re-fis being the norm, banks are looking at lowered income going forward. As "yummy" as this was a year ago to have mehmet_tan2002 tell it, today that is not the case. If you are looking for a place to reallocate your cash and have a time horizon of a year...I strongly suggest you consider ALU. In 2011 they were awarded over 2,600 patents. Lite-Radio cube, a 3 minute video can be found at YouTube. $1.6 billion of cost-cutting that hits both top executives and the workforce. The forward quarterly reports will benefit.

SEC is unwilling or incapable of doing anything about this manipulation - many investors are leaving - look athe declining volume - these traders are destroying the integrity of markets. Confidence sentiment up to 2008 level, inflation is low (that means FED can keep interest rates low), JPM/WFC earnings beat, housing is decidedly getting better (both sales and prices), new jobless claims down to the lwoest level in 4 years - but the market ignored all of that?

See how they are inflicting fear again by taking us from the 9.20's straight down to hover around 9.11 again, 9 11 again for Bank of America share price of 9.11. Why do they choose that to inflict fear? Oh, while I was writing, they dropped it on down to 9.08.

They await to be re-born as dung beetles in six thousand years. What is the accounting on how much BAC has in stake for the multi-trillion hedge owed by Europe to itself and others? No reply forthcoming! Which banks actually have assets, that were documented debt yesterday, and due two years ago? All of them. Derivatives? Check out the dockets in five years. Plenty of time to move ones and zeros around again by then....call it QE 666 or 999. When sixes equal nines, you lose. BAC is a strong buy/sell at whatever the fix is in before your trade. Millisecond trading after hours should force you to consider, who or what owns my savings? Search bankruptcy and see how many investors don't know what they about to lose. Not really transparent after all.

In other words, the U3 (and U6) rate should have risen instead of declined. Why didn't it? Simple explanation: the long-term unemployed are being "removed" from the statistical measurement of the labor force. If the BLS considers you a "discouraged" worker, you are no longer compiled under the data for unemployed workers. This may look more positive for the upcoming presidential election if you are President Barack Obama, but it does nothing to facilitate economic growth. There is another dimension to the Bureau of Labor Statistics data which demonstrates its utter irrelevancy to the overall health of the economy. The numbers in the BLS report, or the claims by the Obama campaign regarding total jobs creation since the president took office, not to mention GOP candidate Mitt Romney's boast that as president, he would somehow "create" 12 million new jobs, miss what is most relevant to a comprehensive economic recovery in the United States. The real issue is the decline in purchasing power by the U.S. labor force, concomitant with a parallel increase in economic power of a very small financial oligarchy. As is well known by labor statisticians, frequently the new jobs created (or promised) are actually lower paying full-time jobs, or part-time positions with significantly reduced levels of compensation. The cumulative impact of this phenomenon has been the erosion in the size and collective purchasing power of America's middle-income labor force, leading to weaker consumer demand and a collapse in housing values. Neither President Obama nor Governor Romney has on offer a realistic and cogent plan to address the real core issue underlying the factors that have left the U.S. labor force diminished not only in its employee count, but more importantly, in its financial capacity. Until the latter issue is addressed, all the promises made by American politicians for a future economic recovery are political rhetoric and nothing more.</Msg><Username>jack_ste56</Username><Timestamp>1350070877225</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 15:41:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350070937897-339</Id><Topic><Title>*** RED FLAG Found in Friday's Jobs Report</Title><Username>jackcorso49</Username><Timestamp>1349798600056</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 12:03:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Is that the one that Obama wiped his bloody butt with?</Msg><Username>shortburner2012</Username><Timestamp>1350070937897</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 15:42:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350070950700-340</Id><Topic><Title>Even Fox News' professional liars know Obama has the election won.</Title><Username>mr.whizzard</Username><Timestamp>1350069650286</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 15:20:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What part of the word "GUARANTEED" do you not understand?</Msg><Username>mr.whizzard</Username><Timestamp>1350070950700</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 15:42:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350070967934-341</Id><Title>Obuma listened patiently and replied calmly to Romney, and everyone said he is a weak leader.</Title><Msg>and Biden imature for fighting back.</Msg><Username>debedus1345</Username><Timestamp>1350070967934</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 15:42:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350071064163-342</Id><Topic><Title>Obuma listened patiently and replied calmly to Romney, and everyone said he is a weak leader.</Title><Username>debedus1345</Username><Timestamp>1350070967934</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 15:42:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes, they want to have both ways.</Msg><Username>stock_fool</Username><Timestamp>1350071064163</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 15:44:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350071119535-343</Id><Topic><Title>Obuma listened patiently and replied calmly to Romney, and everyone said he is a weak leader.</Title><Username>debedus1345</Username><Timestamp>1350070967934</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 15:42:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Never mind what losers think.

Biden was shown as winning in only two polls. In fact, the others (including CNN) showed Ryan winning. There was overwhelming sentiment of Ryan winning with young people and women. So what, exactly, is it that Biden "won"? The Uncle Creepy prize? He looked like he was auditioning for the part of Joker in a Batman movie. His mannerisms were a huge turnoff to everyone except his lazy, government-dependent base, who wasn't really planning to vote in the election. And it won't matter if they do, because independents are flooding into the Romney camp and state polling offices are closing all over the battleground states with Romney far enough in the lead that Obama simply cannot win. Absentee ballots are overwhelmingly going out to GOP voters this year, and since the GOP actually won the votes on 2008 election day and Demcong had the pre-election absentee advantage then, you are looking at the reverse of your declared Obama landslide. Trumpet to your heart's content, loser boys. No amount of wishful thinking on your part can turn the tide against Americans who are turned off by the lawless, corrupt Obama/Biden regime.

Afgan, IRAQ ware, liberation of Middle east, secure Isreal. Biden did great job. Regarding Embassy security where do you get people if funding is cut cut by people like Ryan.. Regarding economy still I remember 2007 oct - 2008 mid , 600k, 700k, 550k, 700k job losses totaling nearly 4 million loss.

Reminds me of grad school (about a hundred years ago) when I kept hearing econ profs in the department lounge talk about how futures markets are inefficient predictors of future prices and they could develop price forecasting models that would do better. Oddly, none of them ever actually did it and became rich. Current offshore betting odds have Romney at around 2/1 (bet $1, win $2). I wonder how much of their money these guys are risking on their forecasting model.

"We don't have a setting across this country where if you don't have insurance, we just say to you, 'Tough luck, you're going to die when you have your heart attack,'" Romney told The Columbus Dispatch on Wednesday, explaining why repealing President Obama's health care reform law would not result in catastrophe for sick people who can't buy insurance. "No, you go to the hospital, you get treated, you get care, and it's paid for, either by charity, the government or by the hospital," Romney continued. "We don't have people that become ill, who die in their apartment because they don't have insurance." Lianne Valenti said she finds Romney's comment "frightening." Apparently Mitt has not heard of hospitals turning uninsured people away.

You've been pretending to read the paper again. Women's reproductive health issues are nowhere in politics. Killing babies by ripping them limb from limb is in the political sphere, but nobody's talking about mammograms or pap smears here. Killing babies by ripping their limbs off and pulling them out of the uterus piece by piece is not "women's reproductive health". It's brutal murder, and it is genocide in the way in which it is disproportionately imposed on minority babies by supposedly well-intentioned white mal-educated liberals. Brand it any way you wish, but don't expect that the majority of Americans accept your premise which, by the way, is wrong. Most Americans do not favor abortion and they abhor your view. And nobody with any moral compass would support it. Sorry, what you just said is reprehensible and irresponsible.</Msg><Username>flippant_1</Username><Timestamp>1350076946400</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 17:22:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350077075119-413</Id><Topic><Title>Keystone pipeline for what?</Title><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1350063642087</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 13:40:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Right liberty.

But no presidential campaign or super PAC is behind it. Rather, a new TV ad and Web video that warns of the ills of socialism while urging America to vote Republican next month is financed by Hungarian-born billionaire Thomas Peterffy. In the video, Peterffy recalls his childhood under socialism in Hungary, and says, "The nation became poorer and poorer. And that's what I see happening here." He warns that the United States, his adopted country, is embarking on a "slippery slope." He continues: "America's wealth comes from the efforts of people striving for success. Take away their incentive with badmouthing success and you take away the wealth that helps us take care of the needy. Yes, in socialism the rich will be poorer -- but the poor will also be poorer.

Asked if he'd voted to cut federal funding for security at U.S. embassies and consulates, Chaffetz responded, "Absolutely. Look we have to make priorities and choices in this country.... When you're in tough economic times, you have to make difficult choices. You have to prioritize things." Guess security at US Embassies and Consulates were not a Republican Priority but now they want to make a political issue of a situation they had a part in creating.</Msg><Username>imadtchdgr</Username><Timestamp>1350091722793</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 21:28:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350092157180-480</Id><Topic><Title>To non-white folks and others who polish my limo in a car wash facility</Title><Username>joeqd01</Username><Timestamp>1350084691578</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 19:31:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wiping your limo today, eating your lunch tomorrow.

Duh, you expect them to say, what? Reality is that sometimes taxes go up, sometimes they go down. Sometimes employment goes up, sometimes it goes down. Sometimes after taxes go up, employment goes down. Sometimes, as following the H.W. Bush tax increase, it goes up. Sometimes it doesn't do much of anything. No one has been able to produce a definitive statistical study showing a significant historical correlation between the two. Though, God knows, many have tried.</Msg><Username>jefatkinson</Username><Timestamp>1350093044079</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 21:50:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350093194859-483</Id><Topic><Title>Republicans Are Unfit for U.S. Leadership!</Title><Username>johnmjay</Username><Timestamp>1350088530089</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 20:35:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why do Commiecrats/Progs, aka Democrats, hate the founding concepts established by the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence?

Crop price &amp; income support programs (including CRP and other payments not to produce) and other safety nets and crop price support programs provided at serious cost to taxpayers (aka income redistributions) have been very popular and aggressively lobbied for and used by farmers since the New Deal. Currently, farmers are peeved with the Republican House for delaying a new Farm Bill containing such income redistribution. These days, farmer socialism is largely accomplished through taxpayer subsidized insurance against production and price risks. The ethanol subsidies and mandates have done wonders for corn prices and have redistributed a lot of wealth to corn farmers and investor farmland owners from the rest of us. (Crop price supports get discounted into farmland values - leases and sales. Roughly half the country's farmland is leased, often from retired farmers.) About the last thing farmers want is to lose their socialism.</Msg><Username>jefatkinson</Username><Timestamp>1350095227163</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 22:27:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350095291410-493</Id><Topic><Title>BAC - Time to Make Some Gains!</Title><Username>collinsstacey402</Username><Timestamp>1350092140393</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 21:35:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>well it looks like we are finally going to see some profits from our investment</Msg><Username>flynnacosta69</Username><Timestamp>1350095291410</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 22:28:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350095661890-494</Id><Topic><Title>Racist #$%$ zevoter's litany of lies aimed at demonizing Obama has FAILED.</Title><Username>take_out_the_white_trash</Username><Timestamp>1350093409031</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 21:56:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Amusing and so completely stereotypical of radical leftwing fringe lunatics, calling people racists when their own user name is a racist slur.
