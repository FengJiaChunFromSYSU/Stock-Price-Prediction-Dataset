Vying for a slice of the action, the country's second largest bank in terms of assets launched its Mobile Pay on Demand service last week. The mobile payment system allows the use of any smartphone or iPad as a point-of-sale terminal and is aimed at small businesses. With transaction fees set at levels similar to those currently charged by technology firms, Bank of America is no doubt looking to gain a strong footing in the payments market with this new offering. But does the bank really have its clients on board with this plan? Technology Firms Have The Upper Hand At The Moment Mobile-based payments solutions were ushered in by some of the largest technology firms over the decade, and since then these firms have had a strong grip on the industry. This has been a source of pain for credit card payment companies as well as banks as the credit card business represents a sizable part of their business models and the mobile payment systems were often advertised as significantly cheaper alternatives to the card payment systems. Banks have historically charged small businesses at least 3% of the transaction size as a per-swipe charge, besides additional monthly or annual fees. In comparison, mobile payment systems like those offered by PayPal cost the merchants between 2.7%-2.75% of the transaction amount per swipe with no monthly/annual fees. The lower charges by technology firms have put pressure on the banks' card payment charges in recent years - a situation aggravated by slowing economic conditions. And the banks have also lost a large number of small business customers to technology firms. This was despite the attempts by major banks like Wells Fargo and U.S. Bancorp to popularize their own mobile payment services</Msg><Username>cchaker</Username><Timestamp>1353564859317</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-22 01:14:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353565642879-6</Id><Topic><Title>the 410K newly unemployed , must be Bush's fault?</Title><Username>kilgares</Username><Timestamp>1353511108700</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 10:18:28 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"There are not 410,000 new unemployed.

Earnings season for the financial sector has been a mix. JPMorgan (NYSE: JPM) and Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) both reported positive earnings numbers. However, those numbers can be tricky – the banks are still laced with risks. Housing Turns a Corner? JPMorgan’s CEO Jamie Dimon and Wells’ CFO Tim Sloan both argue that this housing market has upside. “The housing market has turned the corner,” said Dimon. Sloan agrees: “We do believe that we’ve seen a turn.” JPMorgan and Wells Fargo both posted strong numbers last quarter, an indication that the banks are on the right track. JPMorgan’s mortgage-lending revenue was up 57%, and Well’s increased 50%. Another positive for the banks is the Federal Reserve’s desire to push down interest rates. Lower interest rates spur mortgage refinancing. Mortgage refinancing boosts net income for banks because they profit from the multi-thousand-dollar transaction cost. According to The Wall Street Journal: J.P. Morgan Chase said 75% of third-quarter mortgage volume came from refinancings; Wells Fargo said 72% of its applications during the quarter were for refinancings. Dimon’s and Sloan’s opinions about the housing market are nice to hear – but should investors interpret their words as a reason to go long the banking sector? No. Underlying Problems Despite positive numbers, the industry still has a number of problems. Low interest rate margins – JPMorgan’s net interest margin, the spread it makes on loans, fell to 2.43% from 2.66% one year prior. Wells’ dropped to 3.66% from 3.84%. If the Fed keeps its low interest rate policies in place, I do not see this trend reversing soon. Legal expenses – fallout from the financial collapse is still haunting large banks. For example, JPMorgan’s litigation costs increased by $684 million in the third quarter, mostly the result of increased “mortgage-related” legal issues. Written off loans – Large banks are still writing off mortgage loans made in the boom years. According to The Wall Street Journal: Millions of homeowners still owe more than their homes are worth and foreclosures remain high. Even though prices are up this year, they are still down by 30% nationally from the peak before the U.S. housing bust. Incoming lawsuits – this is perhaps the worst of all. Mortgage-related costs and litigation have cost seven major U.S. banks $76 billion since 2008, according to a report by Credit Suisse. Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) tops the list, with estimated costs that run to $39.1 billion through the end of the second quarter this year. Citigroup (NYSE: C) also faces trouble. According to an article I wrote entitled: “A Huge Sigh of Relief for Wells, Citi, and Bank of America:” Taking the average (of the $76 billion costs), this works out to be $10.86 billion per bank, and $2.9 billion per bank per year (assuming 3.75 years). Also, Fannie Mae (NASDAQOTCBB: FNMA) and Freddie Mac are asking large banks to repurchase $66 billion in mortgages made between 2006 and 2008. Repurchasing the loans would mean instantaneous losses for banks, which would be paying Fannie and Freddie for written down (worthless) assets. Bank of America already doesn’t have much breathing room. The bank posted just $340 million in net income last quarter, representing $0.00 per share. Citigroup also faces headwinds. These “put-backs” as they are called could cause Citi huge losses from its past reckless loans. It already set aside $1.2 billion last year as a provision. Finally, Citi paid a fine earlier this year for knowingly falsifying loans that it sold to Fannie and Freddie.</Msg><Username>mashiach</Username><Timestamp>1353595134603</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-22 09:38:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353595176896-17</Id><Title>New Finding U.S. Unemployment caused by Corruption</Title><Msg>SK Group chairman to stand trial By Song Jung-a and Christian Oliver in Seoul, Financial times Chey Tae-won, chairman of SK Group, South Korea’s third-biggest conglomerate, will stand trial for embezzlement, amid renewed investor concerns about whether South Korea is serious about cleaning up corruption in leading companies. Mr Chey’s trial will be an important test case for improved corporate governance at SK Group and in the broader economy, after a 2003 conviction for a $1.2bn accounting fraud landed him in jail for several months, but did not prevent him from returning to the chairmanship. South Korea’s president, Lee Myung-bak, himself a former conglomerate boss, granted Mr Chey a presidential pardon in 2008. Leading South Korean tycoons, including the heads of Samsung Electronics – Lee Kun-hee – and Hyundai Motor – Chung Mong-koo – have in the past also been convicted of corruption and other financial crimes, but they have often received lenient punishments because of their contribution to the country’s economic development. The prosecutors’ announcement happened just hours after SK Telecom pledged to triple its investment for this year to Won19,000bn ($16.5bn) and hire 7,000 new workers. The increase comes at Mr Chey’s request “to make aggressive investment plans for the sake of the national economy,” SK said. The charge against Mr Chey, who heads a conglomerate with interests ranging from telecommunications to oil refining, comes as he is poised to acquire Hynix, the world’s second biggest memory chipmaker by sales, in a deal valued at about $3bn. Prosecutors, who have not arrested Mr Chey, say he and his brother used more than Won200bn of company funds to cover losses made in personal investments in futures. “It is a typical example of tycoons’ moral hazard and abuse of power ... because the owner family of SK Group ignored the interests of the group companies and used their position to secure funds for their personal investments in options,” a prosecutor at the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office said in a televised briefing. Chey Jae-won, Mr Chey’s brother and vice-chairman, was arrested last month. SK Group says Mr Chey has not used any company money inappropriately and will prove his innocence in court. The scandal has wiped out nearly Won1,000bn of the Chey family’s stockholdings in SK C&amp;C, the group’s IT services company, since prosecutors raided the group’s offices in early November. The Chey family’s reputation was damaged in February when Chey Chul-won, the chairman’s cousin, received an 18-month jail term for smashing a baseball bat into a man who was protesting outside SK’s headquarters.</Msg><Username>waitin_for_read_my_lips</Username><Timestamp>1353595176896</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-22 09:39:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353595905268-18</Id><Title>THANKFUL FOR THIS DAY</Title><Msg>I am Thankful that the Republican Party has once again failed and refuse to leave the 1950's and join the rest of American in the new century. While they spout that they need to change they continie their endless dribble, lies, policatical postering to thier rabid base, being the Party of NO, attacks on Women, and miniorities, and all other activities that made them losers. Evidently working against the President and blocking any progress is a way to victory, regardless that it has cost them the last two elections, and a reduction in Congress. Evidently they feel that at some point that the Right to Vote will be eliminated for all but the radical Robutts and they will sweep into office. I am thankful for all the Radical Robutts posts. They provide an on going example of the Nazi like America they desire. I am thankful that the Majority of Americans have concluded that the Democratic Party offers the best hope for the future. I am thankful that we still have Freedom of and Freedom from Religion I am thankful that the Gov. of Fl. failed ,despite his best attempts, to exclude voters from the process falied and the voters of Fl. once again stood in line for hrs and voiced their support for the Democratic Party and rejected the Tea Party I am thankful for the Tea Party, Rush, Beck , and Fox news for providing America with an ongoing reminder of just how out of touch the Republican Party is. I am thankful for Flipper for his flexable values, lies, and willingness to take any position if he thought it would get him elected. This went a long way to convince Americans to not vote for him. I am thankful for the hardworking Latin Americans that realise that their vote counts and that the Democratic Party has remained and will remain their party of choice I am thankful for the members of the American RCC that rejected their leaders objections I am thankful for the Jewish Community that once again supported freedom for all.

All that in 5 days! What a dream come true. Now, if only Warren Buffett could have a week like that to convert his 7 plus dollar warrants of BAC. There would be some celebration and admiration in Omaha that weekend and many weeks afterward when looking back on it. BAC's 20 cent gap up on November 19, 2012 sure stands out and I wish so hard that it could be the dreamed for break away gap. I hope the 15 dollar BAC offering buyers can get their money back before the feared possible loss of the 15 percent level size capital gains tax rates may go away.
