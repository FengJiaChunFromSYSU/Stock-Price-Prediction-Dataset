Steve Boland, national mortgage outreach executive for Bank of America. “We understand our responsibility to help neighborhoods impacted by foreclosure and property abandonment to recover.” The bank’s announcement was underscored this week when two retired servicemembers who were injured serving in Operation Enduring Freedom were presented with keys to their new homes. In Tucson, Ariz., Eric Griego, his military veteran wife and 5-year-old daughter received the keys to their new three-bedroom, two-bath home, donated by Bank of America through the Military Warriors Support Foundation. In San Antonio, Texas, Matthew Sheffel, a single father of a 10-year-old daughter and 6-year-old quadruplets who was living in a remote cabin, will move into a more suitable family-sized home. It’s a gift from Bank of America through Operation Homefront. Already, more than two dozen homes have been donated under the program through the established relationships with these two organizations. Bank of America is in discussions with other non-profit groups serving military veterans to broaden the outreach. In addition, homes will be provided through property donations to affiliates of Habitat for Humanity and other affordable housing organizations.</Msg><Username>takealook2</Username><Timestamp>1345816673273</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 09:57:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345816866009-16</Id><Topic><Title>I JUST SOLD</Title><Username>garyjohnson34231</Username><Timestamp>1345814021428</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 09:13:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>mistake</Msg><Username>yranidiot78</Username><Timestamp>1345816866009</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 10:01:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345817090895-17</Id><Topic><Title>chance from $8.15 head to $8.45 bigger than drop to $7.75</Title><Username>station888canada</Username><Timestamp>1345809607656</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 08:00:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>told you $8 is a metal support level. head to $8.45, then $9</Msg><Username>station888canada</Username><Timestamp>1345817090895</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 10:04:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345817347033-18</Id><Topic><Title>I JUST SOLD</Title><Username>garyjohnson34231</Username><Timestamp>1345814021428</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 09:13:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>huge mistake of your life</Msg><Username>station888canada</Username><Timestamp>1345817347033</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 10:09:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345819557616-19</Id><Topic><Title>I JUST SOLD</Title><Username>garyjohnson34231</Username><Timestamp>1345814021428</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 09:13:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I am holding this one. 7.80 is where I barricaded.</Msg><Username>sym120bol</Username><Timestamp>1345819557616</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 10:45:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345820464275-20</Id><Topic><Title>Norwegian court sentences Anders Breivik to 10 to 21 years — for killing 77</Title><Username>dumpobamie</Username><Timestamp>1345818669395</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 10:31:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>but Japanese killed few thousand Americans, no punishment. and United state even want to kiss them.. hahahaha</Msg><Username>station888canada</Username><Timestamp>1345820464275</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 11:01:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345821414601-21</Id><Topic><Title>I JUST SOLD</Title><Username>garyjohnson34231</Username><Timestamp>1345814021428</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 09:13:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why sell now?

And it seems the majority of Clooney's high-powered Hollywood counterparts are also passing on the 2012 convention – a far cry from 2008’s showdown in Denver, Colorado which attracted dozens of A-listers including Oprah Winfrey, Sarah Silverman, Fallout Boy, John Legend, Cyndi Lauper, Ashanti, Fran Drescher, Ashley Judd, Rage Against the Machine, Aisha Tyler, Anne Hathaway, Susan Sarandon, Jon Hamm, Cash Warren, Jessica Alba, Fergie, Will.i.am, Kanye West, Matthew Modine, Kerry Washington, Stevie Wonder, Rosario Dawson, Jennifer Hudson, Shawn Johnson, Forest Whitaker, Star Jones, Wilmer Valderama, Daniel Dae Kim, Kelly Hu, Jamie Foxx, Ben Affleck, Jennifer Garner, Chevy Chase, Richard Dreyfuss, Melissa Etheridge and Pharrell Williams.

Charlie Rangel, a Democrat and Congressional Black Caucus member, says Vice President Biden’s recent "chains" gaffe was indeed a reference to slavery despite the Obama campaign's denial. Rangel told the The Perez Notes radio show: “Was he talking about slavery? You bet your #$%$ he was. Was he using the vernacular? Yes, he was. Did he think it was cute? Yes, he did. Was it something stupid to say? You bet your life it was stupid.” The 21-term congressman was responding to Biden saying last week that Mitt Romney's financial industry deregulation plans are “going to unchain Wall Street,” and are “going to put y’all back in chains.” The Obama campaign, criticized by Republicans and a few Democrats over the remarks, rejected the notion that the comment had racial overtones. Rangel said in the interview that black listeners would have laughed off the comments had somebody of their own race made them because “we would know deep down they may be beating the hell out of us, but they ain’t thinking about putting us into any chains.” The congressman also called a Democrat-backed super PAC TV ad suggesting Romney was responsible for a woman’s cancer death “a stretch” but seem resigned to the tough tactics, saying, “If you want to win, you’ve got to play this filthy, obscene game.”</Msg><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1345852249577</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 19:50:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345852499349-83</Id><Title>Democrats are Fakes..What a joke.

"The practice has become so widespread that StatusPeople, a social media management company in London, released a Web tool last month called the Fake Follower Check that it says can ascertain how many fake followers you and your friends have," the Times reports.

The Republican Party platform committee now includes a provision calling for a constitutional amendment banning all abortions, without an exception for rape or incest. This is basically Missouri senatorial candidate Todd Akin’s position. (At least the GOP platform doesn’t assert that women’s bodies automatically reject “legitimate” rapists’ sperm.) Paul Ryan, Romney’s selection for vice president, has co-sponsored 38 anti-abortion measures while in the House of Representatives, including several containing no exception for pregnancies caused by rape or incest. But the GOP’s fanaticism goes far beyond the its growing absolutism about abortion. Ryan’s proposed budget, approved by almost all House Republicans, is also an exercise in fanaticism. It replaces Medicare with vouchers that won’t possibly keep up with rising healthcare costs — thereby shifting costs directly on to the elderly. That budget also harms the poor and rewards the rich, but does little or nothing to reduce the federal budget deficit. Over 60 percent of its spending cuts come out of programs for lower-income Americans. Its tax cuts for the rich reduce revenues by $4.6 trillion over the decade while saving the typical millionaire hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. The GOP’s looniness doesn’t even stop there. Republicans remain unwaivering in their support of state laws allowing or encouraging the profiling of Latinos. And unrelenting in their war against gay rights. It’s not just women, seniors, budget hawks, the poor, Latinos, and gays who are catching on to the Republicans’ extremism. Americans who don’t fall into one of these categories are becoming alarmed, too — as they should. Although the GOP lurch to the right-wing margin of America may bode well for Democrats this coming Election Day, it bodes ill for America. The capture of one of our great parties by fanatics is nothing to celebrate. A democracy needs at least two sane political parties. R.R. PS: Any wonder the kind of posts against President Obama are the lowest and ugliest at Yahoo board. They come from GOP fanatics that best represent the new "leadership" of the GOP.</Msg><Username>giovannijay</Username><Timestamp>1345860899197</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 22:14:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345861345435-104</Id><Topic><Title>You stupid Obama Loving Turds Go Suck Obama's C - O - C -K elsewhere this is the Bac board!!</Title><Username>shit_clowns</Username><Timestamp>1345855492508</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 20:44:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The useless Obama loving fool drones on well into the night.

Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) is relying upon to reform Medicare no longer thinks it will work. Henry Aaron, now of the Brookings Institution, got the chance to tell Ryan exactly why at a recent Capitol Hill hearing. Aaron and former Urban Institute president Robert Reischauer came up with the idea of "premium support" in 1995, after the failure of then-First Lady Hillary Clinton's bid to reform the health care system. The basic idea is simple: let people pick their health insurers in the private market, subsidize the premiums, and competition will drive down costs. That's the theory behind Ryan's plan, recently endorsed by Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) in a white paper the two wrote. It differs from Aaron's original vision -- in part because it has fewer protections for beneficiaries -- but the essential concept is the same. Aaron said this isn't the time to test it out. "In the years since Bob Reischauer and I put this Idea forward, I've changed my mind," Aaron said at a hearing of the House Ways and Means Committee last week. The big reason is that Aaron has seen no evidence since the two men came up with the idea that their assumptions have been borne out. A key assumption was that the insurance industry or government would figure out how better to adjust risk among companies so that if one insurer suddenly was saddled with an unusually expensive population, it would share the costs with other insurers or the government. That would keep costs down because it removes some of the incentive to cherry-pick healthier customers or shun sicker ones. But in the case of Medicare Advantage, similar to premium support in that Medicare pays a private insurer to cover someone, the attempts at risk adjustment have raised costs by about 8 percent, Aaron noted. On top of that, although there are many Medicare Advantage plans in existence, they are not cheaper than traditional Medicare, and there's little to suggest they will get cheaper. "The evidence to date is not encouraging," Aaron said, noting a recent study that isolated the effects of competition on Medicare Advantage costs from government-related influences. "After controlling for all those factors, Medicare Advantage plans are more expensive than is traditional Medicare."</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1345867012578</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 23:56:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345867018046-110</Id><Topic><Title>In Obama Democraps trust</Title><Username>dumpobamie</Username><Timestamp>1345866869820</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 23:54:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yeah i just love the stealing of 700 billion from Medicare part, we already know what happened when the government supposedly BORROWED from SSN! at least the Republicans have a plan to save medicare</Msg><Username>baconregis</Username><Timestamp>1345867018046</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 23:56:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message></Date>
