The difference is Bush managed the crisis and he handled the job. Obama hasn't. BTW, the only war we are not able to win is the one the Democrats were in favor of. Afghanistan! Another dose of reality, the Clinton surplus the liberals brag about came from that improperly managed tech bubble, that was allowed to careen out control. Combined with off the books borrowing from Social Security, and the neglect and failure to make appropriate expenditures to counter the increasing incidents of terror perpetrated by Al-Qaeda around the world. In other words, it never really existed except on paper. And, how do you have a surplus while you are still running up the National Debt as Clinton was? Bush, upon entering office, immediately called for investigations into Fannie and Freddie that were held up in committee or filibustered at very turn by Democrats and a handful RINOs. Bush continued to call for and urge congress to investigate these GSE’s throughout his entire presidency. No action was taken. Those investigations had the potential to expose the whole mortgage back security scam before it became critical. Thank Barney Frank, Barack Obama and Chris Dodd for leading the opposition to those requested investigations. Bush never had a super majority in congress as Obama was privileged to have for two years, and wasted on the ideological legislation of Obamacare, rather than on fixing the economy. While Obama sat on his hands waiting for Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi to push though his health care nightmare, the economy continued to fall deeper and deeper into despair. Spending reeled out of control with government sinking it’s tentacles deep into the private sector arena with business choking regulations and bailouts for campaign donors of Obama. Had Obama put aside his ideological nonsense and focused on a private sector based recovery plan we would not still be in this dire recession. This is Obama's mess, in all this time as president he and his party still refuse to take responsibility, and he continues to blame everything under the sun but himself. Yet Democrats blame Bush for everything that transpired in his first nine months. Double standard idiocy! Obama is no leader! Obama is without one original cogent idea! Obama has damage hundreds of thousands of families beyond repair. He's just a sniveling whiner! And now he wants to sue the banks! What a feeble ideologically blinded mind this president has! The fact that the Clinton staff vandalized the White House and government computers and offices, and dumped and scrambled files, before leaving tells you the juvenile mind set of that administration. And Bill Clinton used the full power of the oval office and the presidency to pressure a young fat intern into being his human humidor at the expense of the entire country. A despicable self-absorbed old pervert by any measure. I have no respect for this man nor anyone who does.</Msg><Username>carburetorkid</Username><Timestamp>1348932571756</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 11:29:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348932716765-89</Id><Title>Obama sucks</Title><Msg>Got it?</Msg><Username>pokerface_liar</Username><Timestamp>1348932716765</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 11:31:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348933238678-90</Id><Topic><Title>BUSH WAS HANDED A REAL MESS BUT HE KNEW HOW TO HANDLE IT AVERAGE INCOME GREW 18%</Title><Username>carburetorkid</Username><Timestamp>1348932571756</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 11:29:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>OH ONE MORE THING HE PAID TAXES ON 100 MILLION OF THE 10 TRILLION HE STOLED..WHAT A PIECE OF SH-- !!!!

There will be some additional litigation expense accrued in the third quarter of 2012 in light of this settlement, but we also view this as manageable. Additionally, BAC noted that its third-quarter earnings will be affected by $1.9 billion in pretax negative fair value option (FVO) and debt valuation adjustments (DVA) related to the tightening of the company's credit spreads, as well as a previously noted $800 million charge for changes in the U.K. tax rate and its effect on the company's deferred tax asset valuation. We had already anticipated that both of these charges would affect quarterly earnings. On balance, we view the class action settlement as a positive step for BAC toward resolving its multitude of legal issues. However, given that many other outstanding legal issues remain, we believe these will continue to create headwinds for the company over a near- to intermediate-term time horizon, from the perspective of both management attention and earnings generation. We expect BAC's core earnings to modestly improve but remain, potentially, below higher rated peers for the next several quarters. That said, the company's improved capital and liquidity position continues to provide a buffer for BAC to resolve and absorb additional legal settlements similar to the one announced this morning. All opinions expressed are those of Fitch Ratings.</Msg><Username>jedbs2</Username><Timestamp>1348933821134</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 11:50:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348933954688-94</Id><Topic><Title>BUSH WAS HANDED A REAL MESS BUT HE KNEW HOW TO HANDLE IT AVERAGE INCOME GREW 18%</Title><Username>carburetorkid</Username><Timestamp>1348932571756</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 11:29:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>history will prove this text 100% true..</Msg><Username>milesed18</Username><Timestamp>1348933954688</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 11:52:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348933954917-95</Id><Topic><Title>BUSH WAS HANDED A REAL MESS BUT HE KNEW HOW TO HANDLE IT AVERAGE INCOME GREW 18%</Title><Username>carburetorkid</Username><Timestamp>1348932571756</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 11:29:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>history will prove this text 100% true..</Msg><Username>milesed18</Username><Timestamp>1348933954917</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 11:52:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348934129835-96</Id><Topic><Title>Romney Dodged Combat in Vietnam.

(2) Median nominal income did grow from $41,186 in '00 to $48,855 in '09, up 18.6%. Don't have the figures handy, but expect that average nominal income grew by more than that due to rising inequality. But "real" median income (adjusted for inflation) fell from $54,841 to $52, 195 over the same period. In other words, adjusted for inflation, the median family lost ground during the Bush terms. If you want a real shocker, google up "median net worth, history" and see what happened during Bush's terms.</Msg><Username>jefatkinson</Username><Timestamp>1348940858808</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 13:47:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348940980196-113</Id><Topic><Title>Electoral College poll: Obama - 332.

When I arrived at Lackland AFB for training on a bus full of other suckers, I mean new recruits, it was the middle of the night. We were ordered off the bus and lined up. Then, some miserable T.I. (training instructor) handed each of us a yellow T-shirt, told us to put them on, and then informed us that until we were issued proper uniforms (a few days later), we were not yet 'airmen' and should answer to and refer to ourselves as 'rainbows'. Then we were herded into a ragged formation and marched off into the darkness to the following tune: "Rainbow, rainbow, don't be blue My recruiter screwed ME too!" ROTFLMAO I doubt that military service will turn out to be your cup of tea either.</Msg><Username>fish2kill</Username><Timestamp>1348972686888</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 22:38:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348972829285-219</Id><Title>Does this sound like a Junta that thinks it's going to win the election???</Title><Msg>Obama administration makes plea to defense contractors not to warn employees about possible layoffs due to looming budget cuts, offering to cover legal fees in compensation challenges, as Republican cites federal law violation. If you vote for the Demcong King "I Won", this is what your vote is buying. Propaganda, obfuscation, pure lies of the highest order, and certain calamity when he continues down his ruinous path of destruction. It's a wasted vote. Obama isn't going to give you anything - he's just going to keep lying to you until he finishes ripping the Constitution to shreds -- then you'll only have the rights he wants to grant you, and most of the Demcong is useless so they won't get anything.</Msg><Username>flippant_1</Username><Timestamp>1348972829285</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 22:40:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348973808767-220</Id><Topic><Title>You stupid idiot Bag Holders...</Title><Username>brokerscredittroubles</Username><Timestamp>1348881902866</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 21:25:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>They're using it...
