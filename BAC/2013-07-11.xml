Friday is the last day the Commodity Trading Futures Commission (CFTC) can decide on the issue, as a broad temporary relief for foreign companies expires. Having no rule in place would cause regulatory chaos and invoke the wrath of already critical politicians. The issue has split the commission, pitting Chairman Gary Gensler against a fellow Democrat, Commissioner Mark Wetjen, who wants the agency to rely more on foreign regulators. But the two were now close to a deal, the source said. "It looks very positive, there's agreement in principle on most of the major issues," "To (Gensler's) credit and to Mark's credit they were able to get in a room together over several days and we all knocked this out," the source added. Still, important detail needed to be ironed out in the coming days, the source stressed. Gensler has insisted foreign companies comply with the CFTC's new rules to prevent risk abroad from hitting America, while foreign regulators had said the agency should rely on similar rules being drawn up in Euro</Msg><Username>cchaker</Username><Timestamp>1373521565256</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 01:46:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373522390912-6</Id><Topic><Title>Bank America still sitting on 1.5 Trillion in bad mortgages and rising rates..

Here we go: Despite the Fed’s massive injections of liquidity into the financial system, there is remarkably little lending going on. Part of this may be that businesses do not want to take out loans given the unfavorable business climate. On the supply side, banks hold an incredible $1.5 trillion of excess reserves just sitting on bank balance sheets. The $8.3 billion mortgage settlement tells banks that they can lose any mortgage loan if the government decides to take it away. Why make any loans under these circumstances? Bank of America – one of the hardest hit mortgage lenders by federal regulators – has decided to exit the home mortgage business altogether.

Even more incredible is how CCUR just increased its dividend by 100% and now pays a yield of 6.1%, the highest out of all profitable, debt-free, NASDAQ tech stocks! CCUR at its current price of $7.87 has an enterprise value/revenue ratio of only 0.74 and could rapidly double or triple in value! Major consolidation is beginning to take place in the pay-TV industry, with rumors swirling about the next cable TV operator to be acquired. CCUR is one of the top tech vendors serving pay-TV operators. CCUR is the video on demand (VOD) market share leader with a VOD reach of 50 million households. CCUR also holds the largest market share for start-over/look-back network DVR services. Plus, CCUR provides the leading Big Data Analytics solution used by pay-TV operators, with CCUR's technology tracking the behavior of 35 million pay-TV subscribers. CCUR also has new content delivery network (CDN) multi-screen video delivery solutions that were just deployed by Time Warner Cable and Virgin Media! ARRS was rumored to be interested in acquiring CCUR in the past and with industry consolidation gaining huge momentum, CCUR could become a top takeover target! While CCUR has been growing revenues, reducing operating expenses, improving gross margins, and reporting rapidly growing operating and net profits - its top two pay-TV technology rivals SEAC and HLIT have been reporting declining revenues and large losses! CCUR's gross margins last quarter of 59.1% well exceeded SEAC's margins of 53.7% and HLIT's margins of 45.4%, yet SEAC is trading with an enterprise value/revenue ratio of 1.74, which would value CCUR at $15.05 - and HLIT is trading with an enterprise value/revenue ratio of 1.04, which would value CCUR at $10.07. CCUR will be $15+ soon and is the biggest steal on Wall Street below $10!</Msg><Username>wozof477</Username><Timestamp>1373547937274</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 09:05:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373548346234-28</Id><Title>country wide credit</Title><Msg>would someone kindly shed some light on CWC .As a division of BAC it has had significant problems which now appear to be mostly behind them---Question does and or can CWC now make a contribution to the growth and profitability of BAC?

The rapidly improving fundamentals easily support $35, the price it achieved several times before (the last time in 2010), but DRAM is now significantly stronger and having explosive earnings potential for its only 1.7 million outstanding shares (1.4 million share float). Two main reasons for these assertions - they are easy to corroborate by any serious value investor: 1……..Memory prices have almost doubled this year and were 70% higher in the quarter to be reported soon vs. the previous quarter. Traditionally, the memory business was it’s main business having been a pioneer and a respected company since 1967. DRAM prices continue to literally explode during the current quarter and are expected to continue to go up into 2015 due to manufacturing shortages and high demand. 2……..AMD and DRAM recently announced in May (5/8/2013 AMD and 5/12/2013 DRAM) that they have agreed on a memory manufacturing partnership. This partnership includes Dataram Corporation as an AMD memory-manufacturing partner to produce AMD's new Gamer Series memory. Gamer Series memory is compatible with AMD and Intel platforms, supporting both AMP and XMP memory profiles. "AMD Radeon RG2133 Gamer Series Memory is armed with features designed to outperform the competition on any task," said Roman Kyrychynskyi, product director, Graphics Business Unit, AMD. "Designed with multi-platform compatibility in mind, the AMD Radeon RG2133 brings cutting-edge technology, as well as uncompromising quality and compatibility for PC gamers. "AMD and Dataram have worked together to significantly enhance the dynamic background load-and-save feature in order to create a seamless, non-volatile RAMDisk experience," said Jason Caulkins, CTO, Dataram. "This underscores AMD and Dataram's continued dedication to delivering the highest-performing memory products.</Msg><Username>ntofive</Username><Timestamp>1373555919711</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 11:18:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373556200911-53</Id><Topic><Title>There has been no civilization that has thrived and survived in economic structure based on capital markets, credit system, and...</Title><Username>arcanos70</Username><Timestamp>1373555811008</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 11:16:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So you got your divorce right after you took all your wife's credit cards away from her?

You would have been better off putting more domestic automated factories together, laying off more workers and giving them service sector jobs and having Ben send them the money directly.

You are the racist. Anyone who sees another person as a racist is a racist himself. Look at the overall picture and I'll ask you. Who was the aggressor in that situation? Zimmerman was only trying to find out what Trayvon was doing in that community. The real fault was the police. In the past, the police was called and they never responded. The aggressor was Trayvon. He had no marks on hs face and he was using his strangth with attempt to kill Zimmerman by slamming his head into the concrete. If I was in the jury I would see Zimmerman not quilty simply because Trayvon was the aggressor. If he hadn't gone after Zimmerman with fists blazing, he would be alive today.</Msg><Username>bondholder44</Username><Timestamp>1373575098182</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 16:38:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373575537601-99</Id><Topic><Title>As I said before.....</Title><Username>stevens1958</Username><Timestamp>1373567895786</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 14:38:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Pardon me for reminding you, but as you also said before (as recently as July 1st, in fact), $14 by last Monday's close.

A 6-year old girl can impart the same 'glide slope' to a brick if she's able to chuck it 10 feet from a 5-foot high porch.</Msg><Username>fish2kill</Username><Timestamp>1373595808796</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 22:23:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373596384354-143</Id><Topic><Title>As I said before.....</Title><Username>stevens1958</Username><Timestamp>1373567895786</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 14:38:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Are you having flash backs to 'nam? I thought the commercial airlines were supposed to have better glide raio than fighter, something about the wing shapes- did they drop a thrust reverser ROFLMFO. oooooohhhhh wings I could use a basket full of spicy chicken wings and some beer about now. Anyway, yeah I thought someone may have hit the throttle when turning around for some social reason or to get something to eat during landing. The cokpit is supposed to be as conversationally sterile as a date with shutupstellas but the FAA didn't phrase it like that.
