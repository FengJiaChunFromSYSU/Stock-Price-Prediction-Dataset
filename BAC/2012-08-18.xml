With the economy in freefall he made two choices that are the main reason the economy still sucks almost 4 years later. Number one. Stimulus package that ended up being a trillion dollar payoff package for those that supported him. "Shovel Ready" projects to put millions to work A COMPLETE LIE. Number two. He used every resource available to jam a 2800 page legal monstrosity of a health bill down everyone's throat instead of focusing on jobs. That was his opportunity and he chose to turn his back on the American worker to pay off his Cronees and create the mess that is Obamacare.

That is a ridiculous statement as much as to say that money is just paper, or that the flag is only a piece of cloth. The physical makeup is irrelevant. It is what it represents and what you can to with it. Pieces of paper called money gets you food, clothing, shelter and medical care to the extent that sometimes money means life itself. Huge gains from BAC stock that is "just paper" could mean all that plus a lifestyle change. You are applying "usual" market conditions and logic to an unprecedented situation. You think Buffet is a perma bull? He is a bull on individual companies that he has analyzed with his vast and experienced resources more than you ever could. He is bullish on BAC because of the fundamentals. They are fundamentals like existed with BAC and C trust preferreds three and a half years ago and which returned tremedous gains to those wise enough to recognize a highly unusual opportunity.</Msg><Username>mrstan4089</Username><Timestamp>1345268314139</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 01:38:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345268409116-15</Id><Title>The Obama Plunge Protection Team doing Damage Control</Title><Msg>Not a good week for Obama and key wealthy Obama supporters are calling for something bold to stop the bleeding</Msg><Username>tulsaturd</Username><Timestamp>1345268409116</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 01:40:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345270357160-16</Id><Topic><Title>The Obama Plunge Protection Team doing Damage Control</Title><Username>tulsaturd</Username><Timestamp>1345268409116</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 01:40:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>When the going gets tough, Obama usually goes golfing</Msg><Username>bushrulz</Username><Timestamp>1345270357160</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 02:12:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345270377769-17</Id><Title>"If you've been successful you didn't get there on your own."</Title><Msg>Kiss my a--.

Don't get a hernia trying to elevate the level of dialogue here...take this pay-dirt directly to the Romney-Ryan debate prep team. Have you decided on which debate convention you'd like to stage ours under? English Parlimentary? (in which case, I may need to request a slight continuance....my powdered wig is at the groomer's for its annual flea and tick bath). American Parlimentary? (which I suspect is your patriotic preference). Collegiate? (or am I giving you unearned credit?). Got a proposition and a Speaker in mind? What about the judge(s)?

In this age of speedy communications and easy access to information... what you're saying though partially true... could only come from a fanatic right winger zealot. The GOP hopes of winning in major elections is dimming fast for 2 reasons. First, by the information age that gave to most people instant communication and access to the facts in a most timely manner. Second, the stats show that by 2042 the white aglo-saxon majority will become a minority. Times are against the GOP. It's unescapable no matter what they do. The end is already in sight for the GOP as a dominant party that has been mainly successful for decades only through campaigns of lying, smearing, namecalling and trickery in winning elections. You must of one heck of a sad character- a blinded zealot - devoid of any reverence for the life fellow humans to post such a thing!</Msg><Username>giovannijay</Username><Timestamp>1345340487850</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 21:41:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345340807712-185</Id><Title>Will Obama's 15 Member panel allow me to have my hip replacement surgery?

DeSoto Parish Sheriff Rodney Arbuckle said his detectives had been monitoring the group before Thursday's shootout in Laplace, a suburb of New Orleans. Two deputies were killed and two more wounded. Arbuckle said Saturday his detectives and the work of other law enforcement agencies discovered the suspects were heavily armed adherents to an ideology known as the "sovereign citizens" movement. The FBI has classified "sovereign citizens" as people who believe they are free from all duties of a U.S. citizen, like paying taxes. The FBI considers them a danger for making threats to judges and law enforcement, using fake currency and impersonating police officers."</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1345341959693</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 22:05:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345342408858-190</Id><Topic><Title>The Tea Bag nut-sack sucKKKers are a toxic menace</Title><Username>urbansquall</Username><Timestamp>1344289032065</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 17:37:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Please, for the love of God, stop!
