What a joke! Not a hope in hell. Half of the country does not want him. No sway with Washington. We missed a unique opportunity to get the country back on its feet. Now we are faced with recession, an incapable government that fails to reach the people. So 50% +/- 1% voters see what happens next. Since the election the great middle class has lost about 10% of their retirement value, the great majority a lot more and more to follow with time as Obama fails time and time again to secure a positive future this could easily quadruple. Watch the next set of jobless numbers, as economic activity continues to suffer the consequences of an inadequate. With the massive economic loss associated with Obama countless jobs are being lost. The coal industry the republicans promised to save, that Obama chided them about has been throttled in past week. We are left with a hoaxer, inconsequential idealist that half the country does not want to fret away the interests of this great nation.</Msg><Username>ontopform007</Username><Timestamp>1352961249372</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 01:34:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352961265770-10</Id><Title>Chris Whale</Title><Msg>This guy is the one that has been negative on bofa since forever, right?

Obama won nearly 62 percent of the Electoral College, a landslide by any measure. Gee, did we make a mistake not selecting your "unique opportunity" candidate? The country...the middle class..the jobless numbers..the coal industry....your concern for country and countrymen is touching.......and a gd crocodile lie. Pay your fair share of taxes, and quit whining and pretenting care about anything other than your money and your own selfish, worthless hide.

Virtually every American president since Dwight Eisenhower has had a Middle Eastern country that brought him grief. For Ike, it was Lebanon’s civil war and Israel’s Sinai invasion. For Lyndon Johnson, it was the 1967 Six-Day War. For Nixon, it was the 1973 war. For Carter, it was the Iranian Revolution. For Ronald Reagan, it was Lebanon. For George H.W. Bush, it was Iraq. For Bill Clinton, it was Al Qaeda and Afghanistan. For George W. Bush, it was Iraq and Afghanistan. For Barack Obama’s first term, it was Iran and Afghanistan, again. And for Obama’s second term, I fear that it could be the full nightmare — all of them at once. The whole Middle East erupts in one giant sound and light show of civil wars, states collapsing and refugee dislocations, as the keystone of the entire region — Syria — gets pulled asunder and the disorder spills across the neighborhood.

Create a baseline in which all levels of taxpayers see no change in their tax. 2. Leave the dividend tax rate at 15% but tighten the definition of what is a qualified dividend. 3. Leave the capital gains rate at 15% but cap the amount that qualifies for this rate to 10% of the total capital gain realized in one tax calendar year. Two thirds of the additional revenue generated by the cap should be specifically earmarked for debt reduction. This cap should have an automatic increase mechanism tied directly to the actual decrease in debt that occurred prior to enactment of the cap. 4. A health care loan system should be established and be a requirement to receive Medicare or Medicaid. The health care loan should establish a first lien on the estate. 5. The federal government should “annuitize” a portion of the Social Security trust fund. The federal government should still be the overall administrator. Models would need to be run to determine the best place to apply. A guess may be to offer the social security annuities to a portion of the baby boomers, possibly those 50-60 years old. This could be the transition group between an old and a new social security system. It could be feathered out maybe down to 40 if need be. What would it cost the federal government to create a federal government administrated private annuities for the 50-60 age group using today’s dollars? 6. Eliminate all existing corporate/business tax and replace with a tax on gross sales. 7. Eliminate corporate/business tax code credits and deductions. Institutionalize “pork” as a replacement with the caveat that pork cannot produce debt. 8. Create a 50% tax rate for corporations, businesses and individuals that attempt to shift or change income/revenue stream more than 15% based on the previous 5 years tax returns. A legitimate retirement exemption would apply.</Msg><Username>saving_grandma</Username><Timestamp>1352990768185</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 09:46:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352990880507-64</Id><Topic><Title>BAC reiterated Average Analyst Price Target is 10.15</Title><Username>shhc</Username><Timestamp>1352989645992</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 09:27:25 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>up 2% in 10% with comments coming to stabilize the markets-watch bac to go up 5% to 10% in a month!!!!!</Msg><Username>shhc</Username><Timestamp>1352990880507</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 09:48:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352990904005-65</Id><Title>Obama to speak again today at 1 pm.

Nowhere has the crash of the mighty Romney-Ryan Zeppelin been felt more keenly than here on the BAC board. Among the confirmed victims are notables like mrstan, flippant, tulsa, and paris, but many others are missing and with each passing hour, hopes for their survival fade. Barring notification by their next-of-kin, we may never know the final tally of victims, but it is certain that many other BAC luminaries were consumed by the flames, and others may be grievously injured and languishing in burn wards, too disfigured or in too much pain to be identified or questioned. With so much of this nation in mourning, and the prospects for hydrogen-filled airships so bleak, let us take a moment from our busy schedules to remember these patriots who gave so much of themselves, and to re-dedicate ourselves to providing lighter-than-air juggernauts for the surviving leadership of the GOP. Already a new and improved vessel has taken to the skies over our nation's Capitol, and cheering throngs of grateful citizens are saluting the courage and dedication of those brave aeronauts Messrs. McCain-Graham as they attempt to return air travel to the values and traditions (and technology) of The Founding Fathers. Their new airship, which combines the tried-and-true technology of hot-air ballooning with a revolutionary flame-retardant skin of Rice Paper, may yet point the way for the continued domination of light-than-air travel by our Republican leadership. Lifted by a heady mixture of heated rhetoric and human flatulence, and drifting at the mercy of shifting political winds, their bold initiative points the way back to the future of neocon air travel. This proud and grateful nation can only hope that Boo-Hoo Boehner throws caution to the winds and accepts their kind offer of a free aerial tour of the District of Columbia. ROTFLMAO and if they lose altitude, they can always drop sandbags on the right side of Congress to save themselves.</Msg><Username>fish2kill</Username><Timestamp>1352992636109</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 10:17:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352992640849-81</Id><Topic><Title>OBAMA'S REVENGE - HE HATES AMERICA AND WHAT WE STAND FOR</Title><Username>whitest_white</Username><Timestamp>1352989588467</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 09:26:28 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I BELIEVE IT</Msg><Username>romney_rocks</Username><Timestamp>1352992640849</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 10:17:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352992705959-82</Id><Title>Negative interest rates in Japan--will force money out of Bonds--</Title><Msg>and into the Stock markets--but better yet--will keep the payment on the US debt below PAR--and help with the so called Fiscal Cliff..---HUGE RALLY COMING</Msg><Username>shortburner2012</Username><Timestamp>1352992705959</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 10:18:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352992811781-83</Id><Title>Oil will move up 5.00</Title><Msg>and GASL will move to 30.00--now at 20.00</Msg><Username>shortburner2012</Username><Timestamp>1352992811781</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 10:20:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352992858148-84</Id><Title>OBAMA -HONEY I AM SHRINKING THE BIG BANKS?</Title><Msg>WHERE IS THE TRUMP ?</Msg><Username>theworldview</Username><Timestamp>1352992858148</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 10:20:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352992897502-85</Id><Title>TNA is a strong buy</Title><Msg>back to 51.00--then a new high as the Fiscal Fart gets solved</Msg><Username>shortburner2012</Username><Timestamp>1352992897502</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 10:21:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352993062722-86</Id><Topic><Title>WHEN WILL OBAMA TELL US WE ARE GOING INTO NEW RECCESSION-TOO MUCH BAD DATA</Title><Username>theworldview</Username><Timestamp>1352992198505</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 10:09:58 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Has nothing todo with socialists but all with endless greed countrywide financial,GS,JPM ,oilwars and printing $ and endless debt.</Msg><Username>joeschoft</Username><Timestamp>1352993062722</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 10:24:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352993608203-87</Id><Title>Isn't it fun to watch</Title><Msg>The Republican party coming apart. As witnessed on this site the idiot base they so impraced has now been shown to be the cause of chronic loss of elections. The policy of having the ONLY objective of winning the Whitehouse blew up in their faces. Being the party of NO only resulted in the majority of Americans saying no to the Republicans. Now we see some Republicans attempting to distance themselves from the bigiots and irreational and harmeful polices that led to their defeat, but the effort is too little to late, the Cancer has spread to the critical organs of the Republican body and they will have a VERY difficult time of ridding themselves of the infestion that they allowed in and pandered to. They most likely do not have the ability , even if you accept that they have the will, to remove the cancer of ignorance that is killing them. So every real Democrat should rejoce with the continued posting of the raddical rabble, with every broadcast of Fox News, With ever broadcast of El Blim-Bo Rush, with every White Board rant of Beck, and every time a Republican makes yet another dumb statement, because they serve as a ongoing reminder of how far the Republican Party has fallen due to the actions of their base and leaders. For the few REAL Republicans left I have emphany with your situation. but how much longer can you remain a member of a party that continies to be so out of touch with reality? Maybe your contributions could be more effective in the Democratic Party.</Msg><Username>carolyne47</Username><Timestamp>1352993608203</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 10:33:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352993852074-88</Id><Topic><Title>Obama wants to DESTROY wealth ..... not even REDISTRIBUTE it!</Title><Username>dumpobamie</Username><Timestamp>1352990639052</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 09:43:59 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thank you for your continued posts .............. while facts continue to show they are lies they do serve to reminde the people of America that The Republican Party has Bigiots, and liers as their base.</Msg><Username>carolyne47</Username><Timestamp>1352993852074</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 10:37:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352993967645-89</Id><Title>Pain ahead for BAC</Title><Msg>Head and shoulder pattern detected.

The hilarity between the ECB and Greece never ends. Since the Eurocrats and other politicians are running out of cans to kick in Greece, they just changed the rules (again). Greece no longer has to meet its overlord’s debt-to-GDP demands in 2020…it has been extended to 2022. There, problem solved. Greece is not alone – the rest of the Eurozone is slowing as well. Recent data across the region suggests that Thursday’s GDP data will be less than bullish. Data from Eurostat showed industrial production fell 2.5% in September, which was the worst drop since 2009. On the year, output dropped 2.3% after a 1.3% decline in August. Economists “only” missed the industrial production number by 25% as they expected a 2.0% fall. The 2.8% month-on-month decline in production of non-durable consumer goods was the steepest since January 2000. French auto production fell 2.7%. German auto production fell 2.1%. Industrial production in Portugal plummeted 12% in September alone. Industrial production in Ireland plunged 12.6% in September. Greece is in an outright depression as its recent GDP data showed a staggering (annualized) GDP fall of 7.2%. Although the news sounds depressing I’m sure our European friends are keeping their collective chins up. After all, they know that the “next” Eurozone Summit will solve it all. Like Japan’s QE11 is, umm, surely going to fix Japan…Summit 11 (or is it 25?) at an ultra-exclusive resort will solve it all in Europe.</Msg><Username>rhinoinchgo</Username><Timestamp>1352994613756</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 10:50:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352994690510-94</Id><Title>FISCAL CLIFF = TAXAGEDON!!!</Title><Msg>Enjoy-Congress should be toast by year's end!</Msg><Username>rhinoinchgo</Username><Timestamp>1352994690510</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 10:51:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352994691384-95</Id><Topic><Title>I Am Up 400% Since Obama Took Office, Stop The Crying, Obama Is Pro Wealth</Title><Username>fireundersmoke</Username><Timestamp>1352994574095</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 10:49:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He did this for his reelection ,but paid with $6000B its a shame.</Msg><Username>joeschoft</Username><Timestamp>1352994691384</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 10:51:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352994840039-96</Id><Title>OBAMA- HONEY WHY ALL THE JUMPERS TODAY?NEW RECCESSION</Title><Msg>OH NOT MY FAULT</Msg><Username>theworldview</Username><Timestamp>1352994840039</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 10:54:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352995030293-97</Id><Title>Make Haliburton Pay for the Bush Wars</Title><Msg>and make them bring the soldiers back to life as well</Msg><Username>buddhazenpeace</Username><Timestamp>1352995030293</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 10:57:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352995452689-98</Id><Title>Everyone who is printing money and making so much debt went ASAP in jail.</Title><Msg>Put Bsh and Obama for the rest of their live in Jail.</Msg><Username>joeschoft</Username><Timestamp>1352995452689</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 11:04:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352995516687-99</Id><Title>The U.S. is Insolvent Thanks Obama</Title><Msg>Bankruptcy is your legacy</Msg><Username>frankster1955a</Username><Timestamp>1352995516687</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 11:05:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352995535452-100</Id><Topic><Title>Stock chart patterns</Title><Username>pearliekollarjkpe4663</Username><Timestamp>1305210668000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2011-05-12 10:31:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>great trading tool</Msg><Username>sarahsmithm268</Username><Timestamp>1352995535452</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 11:05:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352995569784-101</Id><Title>Mitt Romney PAID 15% in taxes, Is someone blind?</Title><Msg>The 39% argument is malarkey.

Do something on capital gains either by capping the amount of capital gains, or re-qualifying more capital gains as ordinary income.

If it is that easy to see what put this country in such a deep hole, why is it so hard to remove those things?? All Americans must first agree on what is causing this mess under Bush and the new things causing a bigger mess for the future. 10,000 people per day are retiring, this is our future problem we need to fix, there will never be enough money to pay the benefits for all the baby boomers. Social Security and Medicare benefits must be cut for everybody, not just people under 55. Medicare covers hundreds of things that every private insurance company does not cover or only covers a small part. My past attack on $7,000 Electric Wheelchairs covered by Medicare should be stopped. A Regular Wheelchair costs about $400 dollars, Medicare RENTS those wheelchairs for an average cost of $1,200 each.

The president can only do so much. These governors, senators, congressmen, bankers and businessmen were here many moons before Obama and they raped the country, lined their pocket books, screwed the middle class and believe they can convince us now that it is Obama's fault. What has Paul Ryan, Eric Cantor, John McCain, Lindsay Graham actually done in the last 4 years other than bulls%%#T us? They mouthpiece and lip service about jobs...Have they delivered? The answer is no. They have a responsibility to their constituents and have immerse this country in useless investigations about bull s##t. Useless dimwits.... blame Obama for this and that. Obama is not running again and I am sure he will be calling kicking butt and calling out names this time.</Msg><Username>reggie.thoma</Username><Timestamp>1352996279779</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 11:17:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352996389243-116</Id><Title>Fiscal responsibility DOES NOT = Government Policies(quite the opposite!!)</Title><Msg>Kinda like a BIG OXY#$%$!!!</Msg><Username>mrj.premier</Username><Timestamp>1352996389243</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 11:19:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352996674665-117</Id><Topic><Title>Pitty Ponzi move today, won't last long</Title><Username>rhinoinchgo</Username><Timestamp>1352992613359</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 10:16:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That did not last long</Msg><Username>mrj.premier</Username><Timestamp>1352996674665</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 11:24:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352997079832-118</Id><Title>Wake the F up America!!!</Title><Msg>Regarding all the third world Rag Head and Indian sub-human animals that are working in here at BofA.

Next time you see one of these sub-human Indian animals or the like in your office you now know you are looking directly at the enemy. These animals have such hatred for Americans and should be completely avoided. What more do you Americans need to realize the evil you are dealing with, I mean are you really that F stupid? Did you already forget what these animals did to your family and friends on 9-11? I cannot urge all you financial firms enough of the need to remove this evil from within your company as "THEY ARE THE ENEMY AND NOT YOUR FRIENDS!!!. Do not make them feel like they belong here because they do not, they are only here to steal from Americans and are laughing behind our back at our culture and how they are taking advantage of us. You can thank BofA and other financial firms throughout NY City that are mostly responsible for bringing these evil sub-human animals in the country!!!!</Msg><Username>thevoiceofthepeople11</Username><Timestamp>1352997079832</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 11:31:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352997132541-119</Id><Topic><Title>7000% GAINS POTENTIAL FOR UBRG, MAJOR NEWS ANNOUNCEMENT UBRG TODAY</Title><Username>goodpennies</Username><Timestamp>1352403650114</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 14:40:50 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What makes millionaires is thinking outside the box.

What in pratell can it be? By Henry Blodget | Daily Ticker – 23 hours ago In the wake of the presidential election, a wave of petitions have been submitted to the White House in which citizens of various states are announcing their desire to "secede" from the United States. These citizens are so fed up with the country, in other words, they want to opt out and start their own. Yahoo's Jeff Macke, who often sympathizes with the right-wing view of things, says this secession chatter actually helps Democrats--because it makes Republicans look like crazy people. The reality here is that there's no legal mechanism by which states can secede from the nation. The White house is being good-spirited by offering to respond to any petition that gathers more than 25,000 signatures, but the most this gesture will do is make the signatories feel listened to. Joe Weisenthal, Deputy Editor at Business Insider, likens these secession petitions to "comments on an Internet chat board." They're just a handful of Americans exercising their First Amendment rights to bellyache, not proposing anything serious. And leaving aside the legality of secession, when you think about the reality of what it would involve--economically, militarily, and practically--the petitions do seem ridiculous. Yes, there are important problems we need to address in this country. Yes, the electorate is sharply divided, at least at the extremes. Yes, compromise won't be easy. But working together is what has made the United States Of America the richest and most powerful country in the world. UNITED STATES OF AMERICA(yeah right!!!!) UNITED???? Far from it I think it can officially be call now the DIVIDED STATES OF AMERICA(DSofA)</Msg><Username>mrj.premier</Username><Timestamp>1353000250481</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 12:24:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353000261250-160</Id><Title>Fraud and Corruption is Acceptable in the Obama Administration Google Corzine, Gensler connection</Title><Msg>Absolutely pathetic and the liberal run media is of course silent</Msg><Username>tulsaturd</Username><Timestamp>1353000261250</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 12:24:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353000290395-161</Id><Title>To All Americans Democrats and Republicans UNITED We Stand DIVIDED We Fall</Title><Msg>stop fighting each other!

(In 2008 it hit the ICEBERG!!!) Eurozone back in recession as official figures show 0.1 percent quarterly contraction in Q3 Associated PressBy Pan Pylas, Associated Press | Associated Press – 6 hours ago LONDON (AP) -- The 17-country eurozone has bowed to the inevitable and fallen back into recession for the first time in three years as a sprawling debt crisis took its toll on the region's stronger economies. And with surveys pointing to increasingly depressed conditions across the eurozone at a time of high unemployment in many countries, there are fears that the recession will deepen, and make the debt crisis even more difficult to handle. Official figures Thursday showed that the eurozone contracted by 0.1 percent in the July to September period from the quarter before as economies including Germany and the Netherlands suffer from falling demand. The decline reported by Eurostat, the EU's statistics office, was in line with market expectations and follows on from the 0.2 percent fall recorded in the second quarter. As a result, the eurozone is officially in recession, commonly defined as two straight quarters of falling output. "We can dispense with the euphemisms and equivocation, and openly proclaim that the euro area economy is indeed in technical recession," said James Ashley, senior European economist at RBC Capital Markets. Because of the eurozone's grueling three-year debt crisis, the region has the focus of concern for the world economy. The eurozone's economy is worth around €9.5 trillion, or $12.1 trillion, which puts it on a par with the U.S. economy. The region, with its 332 million population, is the U.S.'s largest export customer, and any fall-off in demand will hit order books. While the U.S has managed to bounce back from its own savage recession in 2008-09, albeit inconsistently, and China continues to post still-strong growth, Europe's economies have been on a downward spiral — and there is little sign of any improvement in the near-term. The eurozone has managed to avoid returning to recession for the first time since the financial crisis following the collapse of U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers, mainly thanks to the strength of its largest single economy, Germany. But even that country is struggling now as confidence wanes and exports drain in light of the debt problems afflicting large chunks of the eurozone. Germany's economy grew a muted 0.2 percent in the third quarter, down from a 0.3 percent increase in the previous quarter. Over the past year, Germany's annual growth rate has more than halved to 0.9 percent from 1.9 percent. Perhaps the most dramatic decline among the eurozone's members was seen in the Netherlands, whose economy shrank 1.1 percent on the previous quarter. Five eurozone countries are in recession — Greece, Spain, Italy, Portugal and Cyprus. Those five are also at the center of Europe's debt crisis and are imposing austerity measures, such as cuts to pensions and increases to taxes, in an attempt to stay afloat. As well as hitting workers' incomes and living standards, these measures have also led to a decline in economic output and a sharp increase in unemployment. Spain and Greece have unemployment rates of over 25 percent. Their young people are faring even worse with every other person out of work. As well as being a cost to governments who have to pay out more for benefits, it carries a huge social and human cost. Protests across Europe on Wednesday highlighted the scale of discontent and with economic surveys pointing to the downturn getting worse, the voices of anger may well get louder still. "The likelihood is that this anger will continue to grow unless European leaders and policymakers start to act as if they have a clue as to how to resolve the crisis starting to unravel before their eyes," said Michael Hewson, markets analyst at CMC Markets. The wider 27-nation EU, which includes non-euro countries, avoided the same fate. It saw output rise 0.1 percent during the quarter, largely on the back of an Olympics-related boost in Britain. The EU's output as a whole is greater than the U.S. It is also a major source of sales for the world's leading companies. Forty percent of McDonald's global revenue comes from Europe - more than it generates in the U.S. General Motors, meanwhile, sold 1.7 million vehicles in Europe last year, a fifth of its worldwide sales.</Msg><Username>mrj.premier</Username><Timestamp>1353002254412</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 12:57:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353002501595-187</Id><Title>TO DEMOCRATS EDUCATION IS AN INDOCTRINATION OPPORTUNITY</Title><Msg>That's why they support it!</Msg><Username>america_divided_by_obama</Username><Timestamp>1353002501595</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 13:01:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353002514753-188</Id><Topic><Title>1/2 of America divided into Republicans and other 1/2 Democraps: you'll see who survives and who will start to try and move into the</Title><Username>king1mrchess</Username><Timestamp>1353002167174</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 12:56:07 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>the division in the land is the fruit of turning away from God.

How about is there anyone here who is even aware of what the Christian fundamentalist beliefs are, as regards Israel in particular and the world at large? Surely many are aware of such leading figures and institutions as Jerry Falwell and his Moral Majority, James Dobson with the Family Research Council, Pat Robertson's Christian Coalition, and my personal favorite Jack van Impe and his witchy wife Rexella? They all support Israel only because they believe, and are trying to covertly and disingenuously force YOU to believe also, that Jesus will only come down to earth if Jersusalem is the capital of Isreal, and then He will invoke the 'end-of-days' and the 'Rapture', where everyone in the world will BURN...except the Fundies, of course.

The classified briefing was held on Wednesday before the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee - of which Senator McCain is a member - and lasted three hours. It featured testimony by officials from the State Department, the Pentagon, the CIA and the National Counterterrorism Center. During part of the briefing, McCain was holding a press conference demanding answers about the administration's handling of the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya on Step. 11 that killed four Americans, including US Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens. McCain called on Congress to launch Watergate-style hearings to get to the bottom of what happened.</Msg><Username>reggie.thoma</Username><Timestamp>1353024240400</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 19:04:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353024279285-271</Id><Topic><Title>WHAT GIVES???

This is a great analogy for what just happened to the gop: LEFT BEHIND IN A F4RT CLOUD.</Msg><Username>biggusdikkus12</Username><Timestamp>1353029168253</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 20:26:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353029226462-294</Id><Topic><Title>WE ARE LOOKING AT THE START OF WWIII AS OBAMA ROCKS ON HIS HEELS</Title><Username>failure_in_chief</Username><Timestamp>1353015879174</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 16:44:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You mean they might start without us???</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1353029226462</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 20:27:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353029376403-295</Id><Topic><Title>when i was poor i ate beans and tortillas</Title><Username>victory_val_2007</Username><Timestamp>1353014588321</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 16:23:08 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Skinned a big ol' smokewagon".

The politicians haven't even started to negotiate - they're just posturing in the media. Petraeus and Libia have taken enough spotlight in the news that those two issues are now taking priority away from the Fiscal Cliff. And those self-serving politicians (both sides) aren't about to skip their holiday vacations to address our silly problems. Make no mistake, there will be a compromise and a solution, mostly kicking the can yet further down the road. But that solution won't haven until January or, more likely, February. That means that investors must plan on an increase in the Capital Gains rates. Every investor with a gain would be stupid not to sell at 1/2 the tax rate. Every day without a solution the Stock market will decline. And as gains turn into losses, there will be a rush for the door. I expect the Dow to be down 500 points a week until the end of the year. New tensions in the middle-east will only make things worse. The EU is now officially in a recession. The FHA is now going under. Increasing regulations... If you have gains, lock 'em in. We're headed to $7. Sell now, book your gains at 1/2 the tax rate, then buy back in January after the wash sale. Simple logic.</Msg><Username>ca_fatboy</Username><Timestamp>1353030189939</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 20:43:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353030472488-303</Id><Topic><Title>Teabagger Rage is SOOOOO Entertaining</Title><Username>biggusdikkus12</Username><Timestamp>1352422151245</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 19:49:11 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>#$%$ libtard!!</Msg><Username>dumpobamle</Username><Timestamp>1353030472488</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 20:47:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353030537836-304</Id><Topic><Title>Yes, Obama is still an amateur president</Title><Username>dumpobamie</Username><Timestamp>1353030392471</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 20:46:32 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Fox News"= Discredited.
