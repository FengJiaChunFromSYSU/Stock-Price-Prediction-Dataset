"All right, there are 47 percent who are with him, who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you name it. That, that's an entitlement. And the government should give it to them. And they will vote for this president no matter what." Romney goes on to say that "these are people who pay no income tax. 47 percent of Americans who pay no income tax. So our message of low taxes doesn't connect." He says his job "is not to worry about those people. I'll never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives." Romney says he has to convince the "five to ten percent in the center" to vote for him, adding that members of this group vote sometimes based on "emotion, whether they like the guy or not." Gaffemeister Mitt steps in it AGAIN.

These are the early stages of the government debt crisis more to come...The socialists and communists are working hard to sour the public opinion on business and corporations in favor of the government so when the panic comes they will push for totalitarianism and nationalization of everything and all wealth and power to the government basically ending America as we know it.

You distrust a government and think it is going to take over the very institutions that feed it, the rich and the corporations. No matter which side you think is most corrupt they are owned by and motivated by money. Next you condemn the very institutions you support and say the power has to be given back to some "individual" as if the individual can accomplish anything without banding together as a group. Unless you are looking for a strong dictator " The individual, can't build that". Even those individuals in the top 1% can't return the country to prosperity alone. There is no reason to believe they are smarter or more creative than some craftsman at the bottom of the economic scale. Unions are nothing more than "individuals" coming together so they can assert some economic power. If the union can not protect the workers then the only institution they can turn to for grievance is government which is a poor substitute for bargaining. Your illogical mutterings are all over the landscape. Yes the supreme court decision should be reversed and there should be campaign spending limits so money doesn't own the government but voting for a republican government isn't going to accomplish that. Neither party is trying to destroy the economy or the dollar. It may be that misguided beliefs like supply side economics might have that effect but it isn't because those that support it want that outcome.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1347970727092</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 08:18:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347970817565-65</Id><Topic><Title>Why is everyone selling??

Some entities must have used HFT's to bring BAC down for the lunch time and Fast Money halftime crowd and continues blunting every attempt to get back up right now it seems. That is pure manipulation to let BAC go back up to one penny from the gap down price of $9.30 this morning to only $9.29 right before lunchtime EST thus far and then keep it under the thumb through lunchtime EST and still thus far. You can see all the myriad of fillings between the bid and ask today MYRIAD's They show up with tenth of a penny and worse price differences probably shorting right when it is approaching to bust up through key intraday chart levels. 40 Billion dollars a month to buy Mortgage Backed Securities says the Fed a few days ago. Who is shorting BAC right now? Are they wanting in lower, still? HFT's are mind boggling. I don't have much more of my hair to pull out of my head today after so many intraday chart shenanigans being seen thus far.

I didn't think so, here it is.</Title><Msg>President Obama’s small bounce in the polls following the Democratic National Convention has all but vanished in Tuesday’s Gallup daily tracking poll. Obama takes 47 percent support among registered voters over Romney's 46, according to the poll. Obama’s lead widened to 7 points in the days following the Charlotte, N.C., convention earlier this month, but Tuesday’s data show the race returning the level where it’s been throughout most of the contest. Prior to the conventions, Gallup’s poll had been almost completely static, with each candidate averaging 46 percent since May. The president's approval rating also dipped back below 50 percent for the first time since the convention. Forty-nine percent said they approve of the job the president is doing, compared to 45 who say they disapprove. That’s still slightly better than the last few months, when Obama hovered around break-even and occasionally dipped into negative territory. If the race is indeed returning to equilibrium, that’s welcome news for the Romney campaign, which has endured a number of high-profile missteps in recent weeks.</Msg><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1347997877702</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 15:51:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347997995390-252</Id><Title>OBAMA INHERITRED HIS OWN DISASTER AND DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO FIX IT</Title><Msg>Bush was handed an economy heading into recession, 8 years of unfettered fomenting terrorism around the world (including the ignored 1993 attack on the World Trade Center) culminating in 9/11, a collapsing tech bubble and an energy trading meltdown crisis directly attributable to the previous years of poorly managed regulation. The difference is Bush managed the crisis and he handled the job. Obama hasn't. BTW, the only war we are not able to win is the one the Democrats were in favor of. Afghanistan! Another dose of reality, the Clinton surplus the liberals brag about came from that improperly managed tech bubble, that was allowed to careen out control. Combined with off the books borrowing from Social Security, and the neglect and failure to make appropriate expenditures to counter the increasing incidents of terror perpetrated by Al-Qaeda around the world. In other words, it never really existed except on paper. And, how do you have a surplus while you are still running up the National Debt as Clinton was? Bush, upon entering office, immediately called for investigations into Fannie and Freddie that were held up in committee or filibustered at very turn by Democrats and a handful RINOs. Bush continued to call for and urge congress to investigate these GSE’s throughout his entire presidency. No action was taken. Those investigations had the potential to expose the whole mortgage back security scam before it became critical. Thank Barney Frank, Barack Obama and Chris Dodd for leading the opposition to those requested investigations. Bush never had a super majority in congress as Obama was privileged to have for two years, and wasted on the ideological legislation of Obamacare, rather than on fixing the economy. While Obama sat on his hands waiting for Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi to push though his health care nightmare, the economy continued to fall deeper and deeper into despair. Spending reeled out of control with government sinking it’s tentacles deep into the private sector arena with business choking regulations and bailouts for campaign donors of Obama. Had Obama put aside his ideological nonsense and focused on a private sector based recovery plan we would not still be in this dire recession. This is Obama's mess, in all this time as president he and his party still refuse to take responsibility, and he continues to blame everything under the sun but himself. Yet Democrats blame Bush for everything that transpired in his first nine months. Double standard idiocy! Obama is no leader! Obama is without one original cogent idea! Obama has damage hundreds of thousands of families beyond repair. He's just a sniveling whiner! And now he wants to sue the banks! What a feeble ideologically blinded mind this president has! The fact that the Clinton staff vandalized the White House and government computers and offices, and dumped and scrambled files, before leaving tells you the juvenile mind set of that administration. And Bill Clinton used the full power of the oval office and the presidency to pressure a young fat intern into being his human humidor at the expense of the entire country. A despicable self-absorbed old pervert by any measure. I have no respect for this man nor anyone who does.</Msg><Username>carburetorkid</Username><Timestamp>1347997995390</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 15:53:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347998062274-253</Id><Title>Romney made a bad investment</Title><Msg>in running for president.</Msg><Username>sirifuture</Username><Timestamp>1347998062274</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 15:54:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347998110394-254</Id><Topic><Title>OBAMA INHERITRED HIS OWN DISASTER AND DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO FIX IT</Title><Username>carburetorkid</Username><Timestamp>1347997995390</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 15:53:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Pothead !</Msg><Username>sirifuture</Username><Timestamp>1347998110394</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 15:55:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347998198073-255</Id><Topic><Title>Obama was caught whispering his REAL plans to his Russian buddies</Title><Username>dumpobamie</Username><Timestamp>1347995700816</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 15:15:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You will find out.

Romney did not spend 20 years attending a church where the pastor said "God Damn America". We know the religious beliefs of Romney...those of Obama are questionable. 2. Romney's mentors and associates did not have Socialist or Communist backgrounds or histsories. Obama's did and do. Obama's intent is socialism. Romney's is not. 3. Romney is a businessman capable of making touch decisions, organizing government to function in an efficient manner and most importantly, surrounding himself with CAPABLE ADMINISTRATORS. Obama's experience is in areas of community organizing and listening to idiots no smarter than himself advise him to use Czars to run our government! 4. Romney was not raised to be a Chicago politician. He can be trusted. Obama only knows how to be a Chicago politician..cannot be trusted to anything by lie, threaten and intimidate. There are several other good reason to vote for Romney. However, all I need is the first 2 listed above. That's all you should need too, unless you want to learn how to speak Arabic and pray five times a day.

If yours is worth more, feel free to cast stones. With all due respect to your considered analysis, there were a few times I got to fire people who would come in with less than stellar results, just all talk and self-promotion and self-branding, and put down someone else in the mistaken belief that it somehow elevated them in the eyes of the world. They weren't team players, they were "all in" for their own glory. And the glory was all in their own mind, and nowhere else except where they could convince the less talented. They were cons. Spoke eloquently, did little if anything productive. Monumental thinkers with no achievable vision. Projected themselves onto greatness, generally bothering productive people with regular requests for meetings, so they could tell people how important they were because they were meeting with so and so. Essentially valueless to the enterprise. Poison to a productive environment. You might be in their class. You have the gall and soulless despair to think that your attempts at disparagement have great import because they're projected on a successful man when he's done remarkably well for himself by any measure or judgement, as you live your life of cynicism and lies, surrounding yourself with self-proclaimed victims and idiots, and you apparently fancy yourself to be their most articulate chief and spokesman. Chief of the victims and idiots.

Then you're party clown leaders are gonna have to go find some other novelty to gin up voter participation, like a three legged dog that pees out his left ear, wears a union leash, and only dumps in the yards of the 1%.</Msg><Username>flippant_1</Username><Timestamp>1348022639750</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 22:43:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348022721974-370</Id><Title>you guys will be happy very soon BAC</Title><Msg>Will fly to the sky,, it is a promise.</Msg><Username>stevens1958</Username><Timestamp>1348022721974</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 22:45:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348022770909-371</Id><Title>muhamads momma has sex with mules</Title><Msg>and muhamad sucks donkey d--k</Msg><Username>tom.foolery2</Username><Timestamp>1348022770909</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 22:46:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348022815422-372</Id><Topic><Title>Mitt sees himself as part of the monied elitist 1% that were born to rule over the plebeian 47%</Title><Username>cosmo_vitelli</Username><Timestamp>1347944569768</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 01:02:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Not a hint of an apology from Mitt.
