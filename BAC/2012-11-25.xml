Many schools, labeled by Democrats as Racist, say they can't afford costly support programs, including tutoring, child care and transportation for teens who may live just a few miles from school but still too far to walk while pregnant or with a small child. Those statistics have led frenzied Democrats, licking their chops over the year's new voter crop, to push for greater adherence to a 1972 law that bans sex discrimination in federally funded education programs and activities, according to a new report by the National Women's Law Center. Fatima Goss Graves, a single mother of 22 children and grandmother to 66 children. the center's vice president of education and employment, says offering pregnant teens extra support would ultimately save taxpayers money by helping them become financially independent and not dependent on welfare. Ms. Goss could not finish her speech, being unable to contain her laughter after making that statement.</Msg><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1353850275230</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-25 08:31:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353850605714-17</Id><Topic><Title>★★★★★ Welcome to the Re-Election of President Obama ★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★</Title><Username>ebonics4gfy</Username><Timestamp>1352183530544</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-06 01:32:10 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Now sane tax policy</Msg><Username>runningcloud1</Username><Timestamp>1353850605714</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-25 08:36:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353851728404-18</Id><Title>I'M PREPARED TO GO OVER THE FISCAL CLIFF LET'S DO IT OBAMA BOY!</Title><Msg>NO TAX INCREASES WE WANT CUTS!</Msg><Username>whitest_white</Username><Timestamp>1353851728404</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-25 08:55:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353851734662-19</Id><Title>A Christmas gift idea for you and yours</Title><Msg>Buy Nvidia (NVDA) stock then buy tablets with Nivdia chips for all your friends and relatives.</Msg><Username>saving_grandma</Username><Timestamp>1353851734662</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-25 08:55:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353851794052-20</Id><Topic><Title>What Was Mein Führer To Do?</Title><Username>sarcasm_unt_witticism</Username><Timestamp>1342721499341</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-19 14:11:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And bump...

All you have to do is lay out enough silage and they come running. That’s why I became an operative working with Democrats. With Democrats all you have to do is make a lot of noise, lay out the hay, and be ready to use the ole cattle prod in case a few want to bolt the herd. Eighty percent of the people who call themselves Democrats don’t have a clue as to political reality. What amazes me is that you could take a group of people who are hard workers and convince them that they should support social programs that were the exact opposite of their own personal convictions. Put a little fear here and there and you can get people to vote any way you want. The voter is basically dumb and lazy. The reason I became a Democratic operative instead of a Republican was because there were more Democrats that didn’t have a clue than there were Republicans. Truth is relative. Truth is what you can make the voter believe is the truth. If you’re smart enough, truth is what you make the voter think it is. That’s why I’m a Democrat. I can make the Democratic voters think whatever I want them to.”</Msg><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1353857280244</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-25 10:28:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353857416414-44</Id><Title>WHY IDIOTS AND LOUDMOUTHS POST ONLY HERE</Title><Msg>They can hide behind the computer screen and show the world what they really are............</Msg><Username>tgofirstclass</Username><Timestamp>1353857416414</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-25 10:30:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353857638906-45</Id><Topic><Title>WHY IDIOTS AND LOUDMOUTHS POST ONLY HERE</Title><Username>tgofirstclass</Username><Timestamp>1353857416414</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-25 10:30:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>They feel right at home with the other lazy and loudmouth non-working fools</Msg><Username>tgofirstclass</Username><Timestamp>1353857638906</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-25 10:33:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353857712859-46</Id><Topic><Title>WHEN YOU WATCH THE IDIOTS OVERSEAS RIOTING TO KEEP ENTITLEMENTS IT'S EASY TO SEE HOW OBAMA GOT REELECTED</Title><Username>america_divided_by_obama</Username><Timestamp>1353852425515</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-25 09:07:05 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sad to report the lazy non achievers continue their bashing of the achievers who made this Country great!

GOP Sen Lindsay Graham, SC, considers sequester, if it occurs, will devastate the USA military. He also considers capping income tax deductions the money raising route, not increasing tax rates on the rich, because “job creation” would be impeded. Sen Durbin also feels that we can make meaningful changes to Medicaid and Medicare, but he considers Social Security not involved in national debt matters; argues, though, the top tax rate must be increased. Graham, re Benghazi, says the attack was not video/film motivated. He also cited communications that showed embassy personnel in Benghazi sought reinforcing weeks before the attack occurred. UN ambassador Rice criticized. Roundtable—Matthew Dowd anticipates a short term deal; Ruth Marcus of Washington Post considers the House rigid re the matter (fiscal cliff is ‘the matter’) Changing subject, Marcus credits the Egyptian president and the Muslim Brotherhood as helpful re the Gaza situation. Dowd’s view re the GOP in coming months—it must have candidates and views reflecting the current USA climate, not expect the USA to change towards GOP right wing views. Marcus feels the GOP is capable of change; Joe Klein, of Time, says the GOP must become, again, the party of the middle class. Actor/activist Ben Affleck is distressed by conditions in the Congo. He speaks of 3 million deaths, and little engagement by USA. He spoke, too, of an aid group in trouble that was assisted by govt security forces—no “bribe” money wanted, it turns out the unit was the one trained by USA. Ages 23 and 24, the 3 members of the USA military in Afghanistan who made the ultimate sacrifice—South Carolina, Minnesota and Arkansas their home states. Sponsors—N Y State economic development—twice. Dell and IBM, also twice. National car rental (once), life insurance and natural gas pressure groups, latter group two spots. Etrade, one rich car ad, one Chevron, also mentioning shale as source of USA natural gas. No BAC, but yes Etrade.

All you have to do is lay out enough silage and they come running. That’s why I became an operative working with Democrats. With Democrats all you have to do is make a lot of noise, lay out the hay, and be ready to use the ole cattle prod in case a few want to bolt the herd. Eighty percent of the people who call themselves Democrats don’t have a clue as to political reality. What amazes me is that you could take a group of people who are hard workers and convince them that they should support social programs that were the exact opposite of their own personal convictions. Put a little fear here and there and you can get people to vote any way you want. The voter is basically dumb and lazy. The reason I became a Democratic operative instead of a Republican was because there were more Democrats that didn’t have a clue than there were Republicans. Truth is relative. Truth is what you can make the voter believe is the truth. If you’re smart enough, truth is what you make the voter think it is. That’s why I’m a Democrat. I can make the Democratic voters think whatever I want them to.”</Msg><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1353880525104</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-25 16:55:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353880840617-80</Id><Topic><Title>The danger to america is not obama but a citizenery that is capable of entrusting a man like him with the presidency of the united states!</Title><Username>zevoter22</Username><Timestamp>1353879471953</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-25 16:37:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And do you feel proud about the fact that the average Democratic voter can be led around by the nose by people like you?
