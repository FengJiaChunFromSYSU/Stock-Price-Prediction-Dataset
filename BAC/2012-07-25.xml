Oh, by the way, got your contribution to my Social Security Check today, thanks. Also got my $106 accrued interest from the US Banks and a $160 monthly payoff plus interest from Chase. In a couple of days there will be another $1300 monthly interest check from Barkley. It is great how fast this money keeps coming in from all of these banks. It has become a buyer's market for homes here in Michigan and as you know in California. I heard this morning the housing picture across the country in really looking up. In Michigan, buyers are seeing the home value because they about to buy a bigger house for a smaller interest payment then they had before. My son sold his house after the second viewer and now he's without house - none available. Most likely will move in with us while they continue to look. Looked at a bank own house yesturday that will be up for aution soon. The house has a value of $275,000 and the real estate says it will be sold for about $325,000. Not only are the banks taking in foreclosed houses, but they are making money on the sale. California is the important one because of CountyWide. BAC as you know, have been paying off some of their outstanding debt making them a more profitable bank in part because of CountryWide. My sister-in-law who lives in California says it's a buyers market there much like it is in MIchigan. I believe you should be a buyer instead of a basher. The future looks very bright with BAC.</Msg><Username>m.inally</Username><Timestamp>1343221303052</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 09:01:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343222785914-35</Id><Title>50% of Dow futures is Caterpillar-------50% of NSQ futures is Apple</Title><Msg>Don't be fooled by futures.</Msg><Username>bejupete</Username><Timestamp>1343222785914</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 09:26:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343222931458-36</Id><Title>today close $7.19 hahahaha GREEN</Title><Msg>if 2 percent AAPL investor sold thier stock and come on BAC boat, BAC will be $9 within one week.</Msg><Username>station888canada</Username><Timestamp>1343222931458</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 09:28:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343224453000-37</Id><Title>CEO of Grocers on CNBC looked STONED..</Title><Msg>Smoking too much of that organic bud</Msg><Username>scalpelxpert45</Username><Timestamp>1343224453000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 09:54:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343225045150-38</Id><Title>Housing Depressed Still - Down 10% - KBH Home Builder Tanking</Title><Msg>Growth and recovery?

Things are really THAT bad in Europe. Reuters reported that Greece will need another debt restructuring as it set to miss 2020 spending targets by as much as 30 billion euros. The miss will likely cause the IMF to pull out of the second bailout agreement, leaving the Eurozone and the ECB to shoulder the 100 billion euro burden. In addition, the Spanish situation is proving to be a colossal economic blunder. The Spanish 5-year/10-year curve actually inverted on Tuesday, meaning yields on shorter-term notes exceeded yields on longer-term debt. Yes, we will soon be seeing a full scale bail out. Could things really get THAT bad in the US? With continued poor domestic numbers like the awful July Richmond Fed Manufacturing Survey and forecasted downward expectations in Friday’s GDP, the domestic economic situation isn’t nearly as rosy as those in charge would like us to believe. And the almighty Apple will be no help. Earnings released after Tuesday’s close revealed that it missed Wall Street’s estimates by ($9.32 per share v. $10.35 forecast). But none of this matters, because buyers emerged in large numbers near the close of Tuesday’s trading session cutting earlier losses in half. What sparked the rally? A mere report from the Wall Street Journal (again) that the Fed may soon make “key decisions” (again) next week or in September. Of course, this isn’t really anything new or different from what’s been said before, but any talk of Fed action makes the stock buyers rush out in full force…again. So, yes, the joke is on all of us. Trade well and follow the trend, not the so-called “experts.” Behold the age of infinite moral hazard! On April 2nd, 2009 "CON_gress"(yep a bunch of CONS!!! sounds about right) forced FASB to suspend rule 157 in favor of deceitful accounting for the TBTF banking mafia.</Msg><Username>rhinoinchgo</Username><Timestamp>1343225363389</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 10:09:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343225681738-42</Id><Title>Indices Should Go Red on Exceptionally Weak Housing Data Coupled With Exceptionally Weak Earnings - BAC WILL Suffer</Title><Msg>THis BAC trading hoax is going to implode.</Msg><Username>brazentrader</Username><Timestamp>1343225681738</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 10:14:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343225992435-43</Id><Title>Wall Street Legend Sandy Weill: Break Up the Big Banks</Title><Msg>Too big to fail should be allowed to fail.

For it is written and...... the writing's on the wall. As shares continue to become less and less valuable (diluted as low as 4.92 recently) eventually they will succumb to being worthless and of no value at all. They are replaceable with fresh shiny new ones as are the new shareholders that will purchase them. In the mean time, you, your capital loss and your retired shares will get a headline medal or something for being loyal martyrs &amp; new buyers of the new shares will silently giggle for taking the fall for them. This is how it works.</Msg><Username>brazentrader</Username><Timestamp>1343231944178</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 11:59:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343232428720-87</Id><Topic><Title>Break up banks?

It’s the sick man of finance that isn’t going to get better in its present state. It would be prudent for shareholders, good for taxpayers and even better for the global financial system. As its stands now, it’s too big to succeed, has more financial migraines than California and Illinois combined and needn’t be a candidate for another public bailout. Been there, done that. As one of the world’s largest banks with the biggest U.S. branch network, brokerage/wealth management division and the top municipal-bond underwriter, it’s a behemoth that’s difficult to manage and a poor value proposition in its present structure. The bank just posted its second straight quarterly loss, partially due to a $2 billion write down of mortgage follies, which are far from over. The value of its parts — the commercial bank, retail operations, Merrill Lynch, credit-card unit (disclosure: I have a BoA credit card) — are likely worth more than its whole. Estimates of the break-up value range from $29 to $53 a share, potentially liberating up to $170 billion in value. It’s been trading under $20 a share for the past year and trails smaller rivals Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase, which have been trading at double BoA’s stock price. One bad decision after another in the last decade didn’t translate to “bigger is better” at BofA. It took more than a trillion dollars from the Federal Reserve and U.S. Treasury to keep it afloat after the 2008 meltdown. With unknown mounting liabilities in mortgages and related securities, it’s in many ways where GM was five years ago. It will need to spin off some units to survive. Here are some other key reasons: It will continue to be swamped by mortgage security losses. No one quite knows when this will end since the bank will likely be in and out of court over the next decade or so. Of 17 leading jumbo mortgage securities firms, BofA had the worst delinquency rates. The bank will be tied up for some time trying to manage its liability in this area. The resources won’t be available for another bailout. According to an analysis by ProPublica, when you add in the loan to Merrill, the Fed pumped more than $3 trillion into BofA during the last bailout. Now that BofA is even bigger with the assumption of Merrill and Countrywide (another abyss), it will take even more capital to keep BofA afloat during the next crisis. I doubt if many on Capitol Hill or in the Fed will have a stomach for that. Break-ups make sense. Bigger is not necessarily better, although small can be beautiful. Witness the recent break-up of Motorola into two separate entities or Fortune Brands. Smaller companies are more nimble, more innovative and not held back by the sins of the holding company. The stock market embraces the new firms by bidding up shares. Rebranding can boost shareholder value. How many analysts still honestly think that by putting “Bank of America” in front of Merrill Lynch boosts Merrill’s brand value? Given the bank’s myriad black eyes and continued pummeling, the nation’s largest wealth-management firm will do much better if it’s weaned from its troubled parent. BofA’s investment, brokerage and wealth management units posted a $1 billion profit in the fourth quarter. Putback risk. These two words have a repugnant sound to them and suggest that BofA may have to buy back billions of faulty loans. What’s their total projected liability? It’s impossible to say as mortgage insurers, investors and attorneys general elbow their way into court to flail at BofA. As if these weren’t enough reasons, there’s one more wild card. Assuming that Julian Assange’s WikiLeaks organization has some dirt on BofA, will it be the straw that broke the elephant’s back? Did BofA executives know that they were issuing toxic mortgage securities? Did they know that robosigning and using a proxy for mortgage ownership through MERS perhaps wasn’t legit? I don’t know the answer to these nettlesome legal questions, but someone will have to pin down the culpability for the mortgage meltdown. Mary Bottari, who is director of the Real Economy Project of the Center for Media and Democracy, summed it up nicely: “BofA is a weak institution with a lot of liability.” Instead of funding a public relations SWAT team to defend against whatever WikiLeaks produces, BofA should spend its money on break-up specialists and investment bankers who can re-value and spin off profitable and money-losing units as stand-alones. Meanwhile, Fed and Treasury Department mandarins now poring over Dodd-Frank financial reform regulations need to trigger a BofA break-up. They only need be guided by two ominous words that they’ve heard before: systemic risk. The bank is still too big to fail, but not too big to be broken up. « Previous PostNext Post »Comments6 comments so far | Comments RSSJan 21, 2011 12:46 pm ESTDon’ think they need to dismember anything – just a surgical removal of the leftover countrywide cancer. As I recall, there was a provision for just that when the Feds pleaded with BofA to buy the toxic countrywide. Countrywide is still a holding company and can be sliced off and left for bankrupt without affecting BofA. This step is still a safety net and the trigger will be pulled in the near future. BofA still needs more time to siphon off all the remaining good assets out of the holding company.</Msg><Username>nasa_rss</Username><Timestamp>1343242340189</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 14:52:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343242840746-140</Id><Title>Final Hour Profit Taking Begins - XLF Just Now Breaking to the Downside on HFT Block Selling</Title><Msg>Manufactured volume interest low here.
