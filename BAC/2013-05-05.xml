It's twisted, really. If you were there, perhaps one could take you seriously. But no, you're just repeating propaganda, and you weren't there, and you don't know. Your statement about subprime is evidence of your lack of knowledge. Read some history, and not the revisionist kind written by Obama and his ilk trying to escape blame for what they caused. Sophisticated buyers not only demanded those components, they in fact designed them. When they blew up, they made lots of claims of victimhood that have so far fallen on deaf ears in the courts, and with very good reason given the perfectly documented complicity of the supposed victims. Any settlements to date on that specific topic are tiny and more about avoidance of legal costs (which every plaintiff plays to) versus an admition or proof of any guilt. It's hard to take your comments seriously when they are full of unfounded supposition and regurgitation of false propaganda.</Msg><Username>anotherobamafailure</Username><Timestamp>1367762371203</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-05 09:59:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367762694616-10</Id><Topic><Title>Right wing extremists have become a huge problem for America</Title><Username>nogoodpete</Username><Timestamp>1365185805340</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 14:16:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>None, but liberaldies isn't concerned with facts; he's just promoting his failed ideology on the next round of unsuspecting nitwits.

No memory loss on my side, and I am not saying that there aren't some subtle truths buried in your original &amp; subsequent posts. The problem is that the false aspects buried the true elements. Were you to have said that the govt regulation which enjoined the banks from making only prudent loans encouraged an environment of greed and corruption, then you would have been far more accurate. To the point, the aftermath has demonstrated there were incredibly sloppy/fraudulent drive-by CDO/MBS rating processes, horribly inaccurate/fraudulent appraisals, 5 minute apps with lots of blanks, and the credit policy lessons of thousands of years were thrown out the window on account of the supposed wisdom of the Fair Isaac credit scoring model (fico), where fico-only loans would actually be rejected if there was any documentation in the loan package of ability to repay (other than fico). It doesn't take much imagination to see why this model turned out to be utterly worthless since the product was predicated on the fundamentally incorrect assumption an ever-rising market, and the asset value turned out to be highly volatile toward the negative. These products and others like them were not decisions of the banks alone, but decisions made cooperatively between the banks, the GSEs (Fannie/Freddie), the secondary markets packagers who didn't even originate loans, and the private party buyers of the MBS packages.</Msg><Username>anotherobamafailure</Username><Timestamp>1367767451582</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-05 11:24:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367767896637-14</Id><Topic><Title>GUTLESS OBAMA GUILTY OF NEGLIGENT HOMICIDE OF 4 BRAVE AMERICANS IN BENGHAZI</Title><Username>whitest_white</Username><Timestamp>1367625623463</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 20:00:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Certainly speaks to the character of the man, doesn't it.
