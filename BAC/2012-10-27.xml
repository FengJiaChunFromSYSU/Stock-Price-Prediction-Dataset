That does not mean he's an expert on EVERYTHING. As everyone knows, the military is clearly favoring Romney. Also, nothing I said about Powell was disrespectful of him. What exaclty did I say that you interpret as being disrespectful of him? I said it is Obama's handlers who are desperate. Powell supported Obama in 2008, so you think that if he was so sure that he should endorse Obama again, then he would have done it sooner, when Romney began advancing in the polls so much. It kinda looks like he had to be asked - out of desperation that his campaign has been completely caught off guard by Romney's late in the game advances. I support Romney, but I can't explain why he's gained so much so quickly. At first, I thought it might be an abberation in certain states but it has been widespread. No matter which side you support, the phenomena of Romney's advance is remarkable. I think overall he is still a bit behind and I was not hopefull that he would catch up, but the way he has been going now I think he has a very good chance of pulling off a win. We'll see.</Msg><Username>mrstan4089</Username><Timestamp>1351314937545</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 01:15:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351316333293-9</Id><Title>Obama and Hillary Clinton Deserve to be Thrown in PRISON for HIGH TREASON</Title><Msg>Guilty as Sin</Msg><Username>obama_sucksass</Username><Timestamp>1351316333293</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 01:38:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351316384375-10</Id><Topic><Title>Father of ex-SEAL: Those who denied request for help at consulate 'murderers of my son'</Title><Username>jerrpatterson</Username><Timestamp>1351313334942</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 00:48:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama is Guilty of High Treason</Msg><Username>obama_sucksass</Username><Timestamp>1351316384375</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 01:39:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351316430548-11</Id><Topic><Title>Massive Cover-up at the Highest Levels in Washington including Obama</Title><Username>jerrpatterson</Username><Timestamp>1351313067150</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 00:44:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama is Guilty of High Treason</Msg><Username>obama_sucksass</Username><Timestamp>1351316430548</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 01:40:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351317683537-12</Id><Topic><Title>Father of ex-SEAL: Those who denied request for help at consulate 'murderers of my son'</Title><Username>jerrpatterson</Username><Timestamp>1351313334942</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 00:48:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>if obummer admin.

The premise is absurd. The trash heap of American history is littered with the wreckage created by Presidents whose primary credential for the job was their prior business experience. They include Warren G. Harding (newspaper publisher); Herbert Hoover (mining); and George W. Bush (oil and baseball). Harding's administration was among the most corrupt in history; he rewarded business and political allies (known as "The Ohio Gang") with lucrative insider contracts and deals, and gave us the Teapot Dome scandal. Hoover believed in "The Efficiency Movement" (government was 'inefficient' and riddled with waste that could be identified and eliminated by 'experts'), and gave us the Great Depression and the Bonus Army Massacre (well, that was actually MacArthur's gift to the nation, but Hoover failed to even reprimand him for the slaughter of US Army WW I veterans seeking the service bonuses Congress had promised them). Bush (quite possibly the only individual who ever LOST money in both oil and baseball) gave us the Great Recession and the Iraq War (undeclared, of course), and can't even travel abroad because he faces arrest and prosecution in the Hague for war crimes. All of them regularly appear at the top of everyone's list of "Worst American Presidents". Based upon Romney's track record in business, we can reasonably expect that he will bust unions, suppress worker wages, steal their pensions, reduce their health coverage, saddle their companies with debt, outsource their jobs, fire them in droves, limit their unemployment benefits, and reward his cronies handsomely for helping him do so. Not surprisingly, his 5 largest [visible] contributors have been the 5 largest banks. Rather than being seen as a 'credential', Romney's vaunted business experience should exclude him from serious consideration as our next President and Commander-In-Chief. ROTFLMAO but maybe Obama could create a Cabinet post for him, something like "Secretary of Snake Oil and Fort Knox Golden Tablets".</Msg><Username>fish2kill</Username><Timestamp>1351345831243</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 09:50:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351346236260-46</Id><Topic><Title>Bank of America Corporation</Title><Username>candyfkp31334</Username><Timestamp>1351343353713</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 09:09:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I was really looking for some great news.

A community organizer, a rabble rouser with no practical experience, raised by marxists, befriended by terrorists and supported by convicted felons. A virtually non-existent (by other professors' observation) educator who not only never showed up for that job, he also never showed up for his state legislature job and never showed up for his US Senate job, and hasn't shown up for his job as president, either. There is so much evidentiary support that someone of Obama's experience and background could NEVER reach the oval office that one has to really wonder: How did it happen? This isn't a Joe Citizen, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington kind of thing. The underbelly of the election of 2008 has a sinister implication that the American people detected early on. How many reporters had their lives/families threatened to cause them to so openly eviscerate their career principles in favor of open, discernable emotional support for a carnival barker? The easy comparison is the requirement for substantial weeping during the North Korean official mourning period for Kim Jung-Il. People who didn't weep openly and prolongedly were executed. In fact, one was just executed this week with a mortar round. And the abandonment of intelligence by people like stark &amp; fish in favor of propaganda... I mean, they are such purveyors of crap and tripe, and up until they crawled out from under their liberal rocks, it was hard to believe that a human mind could be bent to such vile purpose. But we now understand that there is no low, no human defilement, that these people will not stoop in order to install their king, their human god ruler, the one who makes their otherwise meaningless lives suddenly meaningful. They want their little piece of the pie. Just give us a few people we can torture and rule over, so that we can justify our existence, they say. They say they are well-intentioned, but the results say otherwise. The motivation says otherwise. But it is the words -- when you set fire to the strawman, throw out the unsubstantiated tripe, and decide to shoot through the human shields they always use -- that give them away every time. How did anyone put a community organizer in the Oval Office? Propaganda. Just. Like.

Right now, the federal government owns 500,000,000 shares of GM, or about 26% of the company. It would need to get about $53.00/share for these to break even on the bailout, but the stock closed at only $20.21/share on Tuesday.

Long, but clearly explains why..have a nice day all!</Title><Msg>Just who is it that would vote for Obama? Why would someone vote for Obama? The answer lies in the difference between TRUE Americans and those that are NOT true Americans. A TRUE American is someone who is a hard working tax payer or who has lost their job, HATES being on government assistance and is constantly looking for a job to work – someone who knows the history of our great country – someone who appreciates their freedom and the role our military has played in this. A TRUE American can be an entrepreneur. Someone who wants to better themselves and achieve more in their life through innovation and risk – or someone who tries to always do the right thing and works hard for a company to put their kids through school and put food on the table. A TRUE American is a kind, respectful person who believes in family values, Capitalism, personal freedom and the ability to pursue their happiness in just about any way they wish. As the famous saying states “America is the land of the free and the home of the brave”. America is sports, entertainment, a historic Hollywood, the Statue of Liberty, Mount Rushmore, Old Faithful, the Grand Canyon, New York City, Chicago, LA, Dallas and Miami! America is a great and storied country that was built on the principles of the Constitution, personal liberty and Capitalism as a form of economy. THIS is the formula – NOT the crap Obama is trying to shove down our throats! Obama wants to drastically change the formula that has worked for the past 222+ years – and will work AGAIN for another 200+ years – as long as the government gets out of the way. A true American would NEVER vote for Obama – Obama is AGAINST all that is represented by a TRUE American. So who will vote for Obama? Those Receiving Entitlements – Hey if you are getting the Obama check, and you are NOT working, and you are loving it – you have no ambitions – why would you vote against Obama? But if you have any type of dreams of “bettering” yourself – then you might want to reconsider your vote – or you’ll get welfare type pay the rest of your life. Is this what you want? Illegal Immigrants – This group would love for Obama to get re-elected – because everything points to Obama granting amnesty to all Illegals – either before the election in an effort to buy votes – or after the election – just to SCREW over the taxpayers a bit more. Most of these illegal immigrants would go on the government dole – further building Obama’s base of voters. Blacks – Obama has done NOTHING for blacks – other than further enslave them into government entitlements and destroying any type of ambition that may have existed specifically among the black youth. Will most blacks still vote for Obama and his pretty smile again? Probably a good percentage will – but if you RESEARCH what he is really doing to you – I hope you will vote for someone else who can give you an opportunity to better yourself – through Capitalism – unlike the state run Socialism that Obama offers to you and your kids. The Youth – You see Obama traveling to the colleges and wooing the college kids with his smile, jokes and promise to help them get out of their Student Loans – another attempt to buy votes – but little do the #$%$ know it is all to only screw them over in the long run – which is what this despot Obama will do – mark my words. The Useful Idiots – These people are all over the place. Visit any political blog or forum and you will see a display of stupidity that is shocking to witness – these are the people who will vote for Obama no matter what he says or does – they just HATE the Bush administration so badly that they are brainwashed to believe Obama is the answer. In the words of Michael Savage – “Liberalism is a mental disorder” – no doubt! Obama needs millions of useful idiots and he has them. The Unions – Obama loves the unions and the unions love Obama. These are public sector unions like teachers, state workers, auto industry and many other unions that campaign and work for the Democrat strategy of entitlements. They try to milk the tax payer of every dime possible as they set up unrealistic and unsustainable pension plans, health plans and bonuses. All TAX PAYER DOLLARS! Sickening! Democrat, Power Hungry Lemmings – These are the other Democrats in the House and Congress who have no clue about what the TRUE America represents. They are Communist, America hating people who are trying their best – along with Obama – to destroy America, the middle class and all that made our country great. These pathetic losers always talk of how bad Capitalism is – yet they enjoy the benefits of Capitalism each and every day as they enrich themselves at the expense of the hard working tax payers. Over time all of these people need to be identified and voted OUT of office as soon as possible. TERM LIMITS is a MUST! These are the groups that will be voting FOR Obama. They represent millions of people. America is now made up of MILLIONS of people who are unaware of what is really going on. They don’t care. They only care about themselves and what benefits they can get. They are watching American Idol, MTV and Dancing with the Stars. They know nothing of our great history or our great Constitution. They are clueless. Millions of these people don’t care about learning the English language or learning the many different American cultures. It is very clear that the Democrats and their supporters are trying to push the TRUE America right down the drain and replace it with a European style Socialist Dictatorship that would be NOTHING like our TRUE America and EVERYTHING like the failed dictatorships of the past and present. I strongly feel True Americans will defeat Obama in a landslide. The MILLIONS of hard working Americans in this country are sick and tired of this government’s chicanery. The corruption and free ride ends on Novermber 6th. The American government will again be governed for the people – in the shadow of the Constitution and with Capitalism as our driving force!</Msg><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1351348913824</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 10:41:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351349140230-65</Id><Title>Romney will eliminate taxes on dividends, interest &amp; capital gains?</Title><Msg>Wow.

The problem with the typical GOP blind fanatic followers' has a faulty brain circuitry wiring and it apparently is developed during its growth in childhood in the family environment. The good news is that with the coming generation that is gradually changing... though slowly. The trend is against them and that is why the super rich 1% will spend all the money and use any means to win. The strategists seem to be aware of it. They're desperate and it's showing by their lies, and pouring money in ads that is not even connected with the serious issues of our time but... spreading fear that capitalism and freedom their issue.

Are you saying that the risk of having someone like Palin run this country was any sort of choice? My god man, do you even comprehend the ramifications of something like that happening? And tell me, while we're talking politics, do you think corporations are people too? This country will be in the #$%$ as long as there is big money buying our leaders. EVERY incumbant, except for maybe Bernie Sanders, needs to be voted out and lobbying needs to be outlawed period. It is scary to me to think that someone like the Koch brothers could have ANY influence over any powerful political figure in this country. When the supreme court 2010 citizens united decision was upheld it opened the floodgates to massive corporate spending in elections and gave birth to super pacs, which was the final nail in the coffin for any impartial decision making by the peoples' lobbyist which is our senators and congressmen. These politicians go to Washington with their main objective being to line their pockets and those of their friends and family. It surely isn't to help the people. We are nothing more than a necessary nuisance to them. I am NOT, by any means, an Obama lover and this will be the first time in many years that I will not vote. I just hope I can make it to retirement without our country imploding.

Referring to one of them as an "ex-SEAL instead of a "paid mercenary" or "hired gun" isn't a crime either, although it ought to be at least a misdemeanor. Most American presidents, from Washington and Madison to Reagan and Bush, have embraced and endorsed the use of mercenaries whenever it suited their purposes. I'm sorry for that father's loss, but it doesn't sound like he's reviewed the terms of the contract his son signed. I'm also not buying any hankies for the neocons to dry their crocodile tears with. Many of them are the same jerks who cheered when Bush plunged us into Iraq, and the rest of them are guilty both by association, and by their silence over the body count from THAT little foreign folly. Very few of them seemed the least concerned about the Colorado theater victims, except to the extent that they worried their access to automatic assault weapons and high-capacity ammo clips might be restricted. No, what the right is really sobbing about is that Obama keeps refusing these cheap invitations to war, even the nice ones like I'm sure Libya would be if we'd just give it half a chance. I'll bet a better businessman would give it a shot.

We were in the one of the worst recessions we had seen in recent times, close to a depression. The fiscal system was collapsing. Wall Street was in chaos, we had 800,000 jobs lost in that first month of the Obama administration and unemployment peaked a few months later at 10 percent. So we were in real trouble. The auto industry was collapsing, the housing was start[ing] to collapse and we were in very difficult straits. And I saw over the next several years, stabilization come back in the financial community, housing is now starting to pick up after four years, it’s starting to pick up. Consumer confidence is rising.” Summarizing the past four years under Obama, Powell said “Generally we’ve come out of the dive and we’re starting to gain altitude.” He acknowledged that problems remain, saying “The unemployment rate is too high, people are still hurting in housing but I see that we’re starting to rise up.”</Msg><Username>ebonics4gfy</Username><Timestamp>1351369634946</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 16:27:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351369732570-145</Id><Topic><Title>★★★★★ Nine days until the Re-Election of President Obama ★★★★★</Title><Username>ebonics4gfy</Username><Timestamp>1351365705998</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 15:21:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Are you going to keep making a fool out of yourself using "bury obama" after Obama wins again?</Msg><Username>ebonics4gfy</Username><Timestamp>1351369732570</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 16:28:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351369973753-146</Id><Topic><Title>Why in the world would anyone put a community organizer in the Oval Office?</Title><Username>flippant_1</Username><Timestamp>1351347213527</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 10:13:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What a well written and factual post.

Romney has earned the name "Flip Flop." The much respected Colin Powell voices his concern about Romey's ever-changing policies. At one point in the interview Powell referred to Romney's policies as a "moving target" More from the CBS interview" Powell expressed his concern about Republican candidate Mitt Romney's changing positions on international affairs. "The governor who was saying things at the debate on Monday night ... was saying things that were quite different from what he said earlier. I'm not quite sure which Gov. Romney we would be getting with respect to foreign policy." "One day he has a certain strong view about staying in Afghanistan but then on Monday night he agrees with the withdrawal, same thing in Iraq. On almost every issue that was discussed on Monday night, Governor Romney agreed with the President with some nuances. But this is quite a different set of foreign policy views than he had earlier in the campaign. And my concern ... is that sometimes I don't sense that he has thought through these issues as thoroughly as he should have." Powell also said that he has given close consideration to Romney's domestic policies. "As I listen to what his proposals are especially with respect to dealing with respect to our most significant issue, the economy, it's essentially let's cut taxes and compensate for that with other things but that compensation does not cover all of the cuts intended or the new expenses associated with defense."</Msg><Username>ebonics4gfy</Username><Timestamp>1351371396737</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 16:56:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351371690293-154</Id><Topic><Title>Why in the world would anyone put a community organizer in the Oval Office?</Title><Username>flippant_1</Username><Timestamp>1351347213527</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 10:13:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You are a ignorant American...

He's so worried about what every other country in the world thinks, according to surveys conducted by academic panty-wetters, that he'd gladly sell out his grandmother's arsenal for a pair of footy pajamas and the assurance that the rest of the world will like us better. The strawman is the idea that we should care what others think about us. If you pick a homeless guy up off the street, buy him dinner, and take him to the shelter so he doesn't freeze to death, do you really care what everyone else thinks about you for helping the guy lying in the gutter when they wouldn't? Of course not. Fish is an idiot. He proves it constantly. He lacks common sense and moral conviction, which is why his panties are constantly wet.'

However, once they become wealthier, they abandon ourr progressive principles. Too bad for them, for they are also being hated by the wealthy. So, they have no representation in either side. I want to change that and the only way to do so is to make middle class poor again, forever. This way, they will turn Liberal again.

George makes all of his money off of misery, much of which he causes through political leftist agendas, knowing full well that they never end well. He's also a felon. Once he has his agenda and puppets in place, all he has to do is wait and collect. The Koch brothers, on the other hand, are patriots, simply trying to get America back to what it was before the socialists and hippies came over the wall. I worry for your grandchildren too. With so many ill-informed mindless minions begging at the trough of liberalism, those progeny who feed alongside you with your liberal talking points, your lack of faith in human nature and defeatism will have no chance whatsoever. And by the way, corporations are nothing if not people. There are hundreds of millions of people who earn their living from corporations. They know everyone in positions from the mailroom all the way up to the CEO. They don't always agree with the boss inside the business, and outside the business we're all even. So let's please stop with the drivel about corporations are not people. That is the ONLY thing corporations are. Without people, corporations cease to be. Citizens United upended the monopoly of leftist network news to be the sole determinant of what's important in elections. If not for the CU ruling, you wouldn't know about many of Obama's faults (it's quite a robust list). You wouldn't know that he's brought the American economy into a spiral that is circling the bowl and leaving skid marks. You wouldn't know that he ditched the decision on Benghazi because he wanted to go to bed and didn't want it to interfere with his Middle-East-Loves-Us narrative. You wouldn't know that he's never released his records and never been vetted like every other president in history. No, without CU, you would have an Obama who is your dEar Leader, and you wouldn't be able to criticize him without being blasted by the state-controlled media. What you see as all despondency and bad news is, in fact, the best thing that has ever happened in your lifetime.</Msg><Username>flippant_1</Username><Timestamp>1351382668504</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 20:04:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351383052584-217</Id><Topic><Title>Intelligent, educated and smart people will undoubeadly vote for Progress, which means re-election</Title><Username>joeqd01</Username><Timestamp>1351374667762</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 17:51:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Funny idiotass - you completely misunderstood the thread.

Yep, I put my enormous brain in a blind trust the first time I ever heard Obama speak. Now I've forgotten the lawyer's phone number, oh dear, whatever shall I do? And all those years I spent formulating my own opinions - what a colossal waste of time! Then again, how was I to know that one day flippant_1 would come along and supply me with a full complement of them, and not even trouble me for my input? ROTFLMAO a little while ago he mangled a metaphor about buying dinner for a homeless guy without being concerned about what others think in a lame effort to belittle anyone who cares what other countries think about the United States. Yeah, a strong leader who couldn't care less about what others think of our actions would be just the thing to strengthen our standing in the world. How about this guy, who in May 1935, when asked what he could do to improve the situation of Catholics in the USSR so as not to provoke a quarrel with the Pope, replied with the devil-may-care attitude flippant_1 holds in such esteem, “The Pope? How many divisions does he have?” As for his metaphor about the homeless guy, the neocon approach to that situation would be to wave a fist full of dollars at passing women and tell them that if they'd disrobe, he'd give the money to the guy so he could buy himself a meal. (Thank you, Donald Trump). If flippant could trouble himself to look for facts and supporting evidence before he fired up his rhetorical boom-box, he'd have looked at my message history and found plenty of critical comments I've made about Obama and Democrats. Of course, that would have impeded or undercut his practice of putting words in the mouths of others and then attacking them for those words. ROTFLMAO look up 'milk-sop', you ball-smuggler, and then see if you can find a nice frock in your size.</Msg><Username>fish2kill</Username><Timestamp>1351384796729</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 20:39:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351384933900-225</Id><Topic><Title>....TEXAS STEAK HOUSE....what an experience with the cowboys..the place was packed</Title><Username>urichey</Username><Timestamp>1351384301271</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 20:31:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Texas is a nice little COUNTRY.....just be selective where you want to go and ask the locals ...</Msg><Username>urichey</Username><Timestamp>1351384933900</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 20:42:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351385166853-226</Id><Topic><Title>I will commit suicide IF Obama win again !</Title><Username>kingofvietnam</Username><Timestamp>1351379412523</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 19:10:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>May your sole rest in peace.

Bush wasn't a bad guy for going to war, he was a bad guy for being persuasive enough to convince ALL of congress to go to war. Including Mr. Obama. He wasn't a bad guy for reaching across the aisle to work with the biggest liberal douchebag democrats of all time, he was a bad guy for going along with them instead of b*tch slapping them back into the stone age. We on the right are not happy with W, either. We hate that he compromised on the things we felt were most important, and as a result, people who couldn't afford houses got them (thank you Demcong), and the rest of us got the shaft and the bill and the unemployment. He spent money that we didn't have on nation building that we didn't want, when most of us would've preferred to just don our sunglasses for a brief flash from the middle east and then resume our day. So the sad fact is that none of us got what we wanted, which brings us to where we are now. So now we have 4 years of hatred spewing from Obama (and 4 years of hatred of America from the middle east). 4 years of blaming somebody else, schoolyard bullying, and formation of the master race comprised solely of liberals. Most importantly, 4 years of more debt at a faster pace than anybody in recorded history. Evah. And 4 years without a budget, except for the one that Bush got passed that Obama signed in March 2009. That was it. Since then, no budget, just spend spend spend. And borrow borrow borrow. So if you think Romney will be bad for you, then I can assure you that he will be your worst f*ing nightmare. He will propose a budget, negotiate it, and pass it. He will act within the law. He will still kick #$%$ and take names. And the little man-child former president will slink into oblivion in the gang-infested shooting gallery known as Chicago. Check that -- he's ditching Chicago and going to see if he can get stoned with his homies in Hawaii.</Msg><Username>flippant_1</Username><Timestamp>1351388011510</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 21:33:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351388126147-251</Id><Topic><Title>Who Votes For Obama?

You see, you used the trickle down redux, as though your flawed version of history, given to you by the same people who brought us Jimmy Carter, was somehow correct. It's demonstrably false to anyone who lived through it with their head outside of their nether region. So, to my point, you were spoon fed a lie, and you consumed it and you now spew it out as though it were somehow original thought. It isn't. And it's wrong, like I said. Sorry for the deflation. I see through everything you write to its original source. I know where it's coming from, and I know who influenced you.

We were in the one of the worst recessions we had seen in recent times, close to a depression. The fiscal system was collapsing. Wall Street was in chaos, we had 800,000 jobs lost in that first month of the Obama administration and unemployment peaked a few months later at 10 percent. So we were in real trouble. The auto industry was collapsing, the housing was start[ing] to collapse and we were in very difficult straits.

It would be nice though if you refrained from telling Paris what to do or who to listen to. She and I can communicate directly if the spirit moves us, and on occasion it has. Besides, most of my two major careers (test engineering and writing) involved inciting people to think uncommonly, so I abandoned hope a long time ago of winning any popularity contests. One of my few friends even suggested that I sue Dr. House for character infringement; like the good Doctor, I could give a squat what others think of me, and draw my sense of self-worth from just being right so often. A major theme of the book I'm currently working on is that common sense so often isn't; instead it's often a refuge for people too lazy or stupid to do their own thinking or test their assumptions or formulate their own solutions to problems and issues. Another of its themes is that we all have blind spots, synaptic gaps in our thinking and view of the world around us that cause us to keep running into 'unseen' obstacles. Only by forcing ourselves to adopt different perspectives can we reduce the injuries to our selves and others caused by fumbling around in the dark or staring at ourselves in funhouse mirrors. But 'Progressive fighters like [me]'? ROTFLMAO now I'm going to have to get some business cards made with my name and 'Certified Anarchist' on them.
