It's because his administration runs the White House like it's Chicago, effectively further tarnishing the downward spiral of the image of the White House started by the Bill Clinton/Monica mess. People should be able to trust their government and to hold it in highest respect. The Obama administration, with behind the scenes direction by communist Valerie Jarrett, (who has a 24-hour, around-the-clock security detail, with five or six agents full time????) has the transparency of a ten foot steel wall. The only thing half way keeping this evil group in check is the House of Representatives..and now they are backed in a corner with no choice but to give on key major fiscal cliff issues with nothing in return but promises from Obama which always have a way of evaporating.

(NTWK), a worldwide provider of global IT and enterprise application solutions, today reported financial results for its fiscal 2013 first quarter ended September 30, 2012. Fiscal 2013 First-Quarter Financial Results Total first quarter revenue rose to $11.1 million, the highest first quarter in the company's history, as a result of higher services revenue and a recovery in licensee revenue. This compares with total revenue of $6.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2012. "NetSol's record first quarter revenue underscores the success of our initiative to build out service and delivery capabilities in Bangkok and China," said Najeeb Ghauri, CEO of NetSol. "Our record results also reinforce the continued demand for our core leasing solution throughout Asia, where we have recently completed a number of NFS(TM) implementations." License revenue increased to $3.2 million from $1.1 million in the comparable first quarter of fiscal 2012, representing new agreements with fortune 500 companies in the Asia Pacific Region. Maintenance revenue was $2.0 million, approximately in line with the same period last fiscal year. Services revenue grew to $5.8 million from $3.1 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 as a result of new consulting and customization projects and increased contribution from NetSol's Virtual Leasing Services subsidiary jointly acquired during the second quarter of fiscal 2012. Total operating expenses for the fiscal 2013 first quarter amounted to $3.8 million, down sequentially from the fourth quarter, although up from $3.0 million in the fiscal 2012 first quarter. The increase is principally due to hiring additional NFS and Vroozi personnel and larger headcount as a result of the VLS acquisition. Operating income for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 rose to $1.5 million, compared with an operating loss of $826,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 2012. NetSol achieved net income of $929,000 for the fiscal first quarter, equal to $0.12 per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $1.5 million, or $0.26 per share, in the comparable period of the prior fiscal year. This includes a deduction of net income by $332,000 for non-controlling interest, compared with $137,000 in the comparative period. Weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding for the period was 7.6 million shares, compared with 5.6 million shares for the first quarter of fiscal 2012. The net EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure), was $2.5 million for the fiscal 2013 first quarter, versus a loss of $234,000 for the fiscal 2012 first quarter. The reconciliation of net EBITDA to net income, the most comparable non-GAAP financial measure, as well as a further explanation about adjusted EBITDA, is included in the financial tables at the end of this news release. NetSol's cash and cash equivalents balance rose to $8.0 million at September 30, 2012, compared with $7.6 million at June 30, 2012. 2012 First-Quarter Highlights: • Received new orders for NetSol Financial Suite (NFS(TM)) solution from two new customers, representing more than $4 million in combined license, maintenance, and service billings; • Won a new contract in Europe to provide a Point-of-Sale solution to an existing bank client to support their entry into vehicle finance; • Completed NFS implementations in China with Mercedes-Benz Leasing, Chongqing Auto Finance and JAC Santander; • Completed a custom projects including one LeaseSoft migration project with a European Bank ; • Secured and delivered a leasing and finance consulting project with a Mexico-based subsidiary of one of the largest commercial truck manufacturing companies in the world and completed a consulting engagement with Mercedes-Benz China; • Signed a new contract in the area of information security with a leading telecom company in Pakistan and added a contract to implement a transport department automation system with the government of Punjab. The agreements are collectively valued at approximately $0.7 million; and, • Added key sales, marketing, and implementation personnel to further drive global market penetration and increase delivery and support capability. Most recently, Vroozi welcomed Ivy Montgomery, formerly of SAP, as vice president of marketing. Business and Financial Outlook "With our growth initiatives underway, combined with our new business pipeline visibility, I am ever confident that we will hit our revenue and profitability targets for fiscal 2013, especially considering that NetSol's second half of the year has historically been a stronger period than the first half," Ghauri said. The company maintains its financial guidance, anticipating growing total annual revenue to a range of approximately $46 million to $49 million for fiscal 2013, and achieving earnings per diluted share of approximately $0.80 to $1.00 for the year. .........FYI.......MORE NTWK HIGHLIGHTS: - Company projects Doubling/Tripling revenues and net income by 2015 - Significant Institutional investor ownership and growing - Insiders bought over 5% of the Outstanding shares the last 2 years and never sold a single share - Total share count is only 7.5 million shares.

Confirm for yourself the facts stated and well known throughout the Houston Cancer Center medical Community and likely occurring at all major large American city medical centers. Hundreds of thousands of medical workers will tell you. It's not a secret. American taxpayers are being used as fools and often by rich non-American patients hiring the transporters to bring them in thru any border available. I didn't say Canadians were crossing the border for free care-learn to read- "people from all around the world"- but now that you mention it, some Canadians may be coming across for free care also. ABC News reported an estimate of 90 BILLION a year in Medicare/Medicaid fraud and that didn't include the free care gotten by medical sneak-ins, which could be hundreds of billions per year. So, as the cost for care for non-American Sneak-in Medical Tourists is added, American families and Legal Citizens will be affected as funds will be described as limited and the Obama Death Panels will deny care.</Msg><Username>sadyearswaiting</Username><Timestamp>1352906874133</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 10:27:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352906885634-59</Id><Title>retard fool "kingofvietnam" is an Obama bashing LOSER FOOL!!

(Which may go a long way toward explaining why they can afford good universal health care and we can't.) That leaves 705 for China (143), Russia (72) and everybody else. So, as long as the aforementioned Brits, French, etc don't attack, we should be able to take on the rest of the world combined and fight 'em to a draw. It isn't enough. Like Romney, I'm uneasy.

MADRID/LISBON (Reuters) - Police and protesters clashed in Spain, Italy and Portugal on Wednesday as millions of workers went on strike in organized labor's biggest Europe-wide challenge to austerity policies since the euro zone debt crisis erupted three years ago. Hundreds of flights were cancelled, schools were shut, factories were at a standstill and trains barely ran in Spain and Portugal where unions held their first joint general strike. Stoppages in Belgium interrupted international rail services. Workers also protested in Greece and France against austerity policies that have taken a heavy economic toll and aggravated mass unemployment. But the demonstrations organized by the European Trade Union Confederation seemed unlikely to force hard-pressed governments to change their cost-cutting strategies. In Spain, 118 people were arrested - including two allegedly with material to make explosives - after confrontations at picket lines and damage to storefronts. Riot police fired rubber bullets at protesters in central Madrid in one brief clash. Some 74 people were hurt. "In austerity, there is only depression and unemployment," Fernando Toxo, head of Spain's biggest union, Comisiones Obreras told tens of thousands of demonstrators in central Madrid. Even non-union workers jointed protests and marches. "This isn't about politics or unions. This is social and economic. If we have to shut down the country we'll shut it down," said 24-year-old Mariluz Gordillo, a non-unionized phone operator at El Corte Ingles department store in Madrid. In Rome, scuffles broke out between police in riot gear and demonstrators who threw stones, bottles and fireworks at police. About 60 demonstrators were detained. Protesters occupied Pisa's mediaeval Leaning Tower for an hour, hanging a banner reading "Rise up. We are not paying for your crisis". Police charged into hundreds of protesters outside Parliament in Lisbon, with Portuguese television showing live footage of people being beaten. At least two people were seen being detained by police, who said they had charged in response to a barrage of stones from protesters. DEEPENING RECESSION In Portugal and Greece - both rescued with European funds and under strict austerity programs - the economic downturn sharpened in the third quarter, data showed on Wednesday. Portuguese unemployment jumped to a record 15.8 percent while in neighboring Spain, one in four of the workforce is jobless. Greece's economic output shrank 7.2 percent on an annual basis in the third quarter as the debt-laden country staggers towards its sixth year of depression. Close to 26 million people are unemployed in the European Union while governments take aim at spending on treasured universal health care and public schools. "Things have to change... Money has ended up with all the power and people none. How could this happen?" said Esteban Quesada, 58, a hardware store owner in Barcelona who closed his shop to join the protests in Spain's second city. Throughout southern Europe governments are trying to put public finances back on track after years of overspending. Portugal and Greece have cut pensions and, with Spain, have slashed public sector wages as well as spending on hospitals and schools. Italy and France are also under pressure to control their budget deficits. EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn praised Spain on Wednesday for making progress in trimming its budget but acknowledged many Spaniards are struggling. In Spain, most of the savings have been gobbled up by higher interest payments on the national debt, swollen by the cost of rescuing banks after a real estate bubble burst in 2008. Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank, said in a report on Wednesday that the euro zone debt crisis is still the number one risk to German banks and insurers, and the situation had not improved from last year. Promises from the European Central Bank to support sovereign bond prices for countries that seek aid have brought some relief to Spain and Italy in the capital markets. On Wednesday Italy sold 3-year bonds at the lowest borrowing cost in two years.</Msg><Username>rhinoinchgo</Username><Timestamp>1352924740933</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 15:25:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352924955860-228</Id><Topic><Title>The future of the USofA (EUROPE BURNING DOWN!!!!)</Title><Username>rhinoinchgo</Username><Timestamp>1352924740933</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 15:25:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Anti-austerity strikes sweep southern Europe By Feliciano Tisera and Daniel Alvarenga | Reuters – 36 mins ago GLUED UP Protesters jammed cash machines with glue and coins, and plastered anti-government stickers on shop windows around Spain. Power consumption dropped almost 13 percent with factories idled. More than 600 flights were cancelled in Spain alone, mainly by Iberia and budget carrier Vueling. Portugal's TAP cancelled about 45 percent of flights. In Greece, which saw a two-day strike last week as parliament voted to approve new cuts, hundreds of strikers rallied peacefully in central Athens, holding aloft giant Italian, Portuguese and Spanish flags and banners proclaiming "Enough is enough." In France, five trade unions organized marches in more than 100 cities but did not call for a strike. Left-wing critics of Socialist President Francois Hollande said he has failed to address the concerns of French workers who have the same fears as their counterparts in southern Europe. "It's an unconditional surrender," hard left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon said on France 2 television.</Msg><Username>rhinoinchgo</Username><Timestamp>1352924955860</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 15:29:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352925051453-229</Id><Title>Happy(not really) 1 week anniverasry after the election!</Title><Msg>ITS BEEN ALL DOWNHILL SINCE THEN! ;^(.......</Msg><Username>rhinoinchgo</Username><Timestamp>1352925051453</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 15:30:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352925074528-230</Id><Topic><Title>PANIC SELLING OR OBAMA TAXES?</Title><Username>theworldview</Username><Timestamp>1352924604955</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 15:23:24 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>HIS WAY OR SHUT GOV -STOCK MARKET DOWN</Msg><Username>theworldview</Username><Timestamp>1352925074528</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 15:31:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352925106386-231</Id><Topic><Title>PANIC SELLING OR OBAMA TAXES?</Title><Username>theworldview</Username><Timestamp>1352924604955</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 15:23:24 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This is what happens when more than half of the electorate are ignorant enough to re-elect an incompetent President..

Accused by the Pope of the most foul heresies: "accusations of denying Christ, spitting and urinating on the cross, and devil worship." The order was disbanded, their rich and many properties and monies confiscated, and of the tens of thousands of "knights" , many were killed and hounded into exile. "In the end, the only three accused of heresy directly by the papal commission were Jacques de Molay, Grand Master of the Knights Templar, and his two immediate subordinates; they were to renounce their heresy publicly, when de Molay regained his courage and proclaimed the order's and his innocence along with Geoffrey de Charney. The two were arrested by French authorities as relapsed heretics and burned at the stake in 1314. Their ashes were then ground up and dumped into the Seine, so as to leave no relics behind."</Msg><Username>spmoran32</Username><Timestamp>1352931246520</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 17:14:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352931346267-307</Id><Title>*****God is punishing Obama and his supporters for trying to ruin this great nation, that he built.</Title><Msg>Feel his power.</Msg><Username>jbstocktalk</Username><Timestamp>1352931346267</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 17:15:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352931399677-308</Id><Title>****The market went up on the hopes that Mitt Romney won.

Did you catch egg splattered all over the face of Scott Nations TECHNICALLY around the Trade of the Day on Monday on Fast Money the day before the election? I hardly ever watch it anymore up until then because they have been so wrong on too many occasions for my patience. He says, get this, he says..."I am buying the Bank of America Jan 10 dollar calls". He says it would be sickening to watch the stock fall from 10 dollars on down again but the Jan 10 dollar calls are only 50 cents. Fast Money trade of the day. You want to tell me how Scott Nations thinks losing 70 percent of your money in one week is better than losing 10 percent of your money? How is that Scott? When will he come back out from under a rock and show his face on TV again? January next year unless BAC is back up above 10 dollars a share again by then? HOW BLATANT. He should say something right now because there is no telling how many 100's of thousands of people saw him say such a thing about such a high profile stock that touches-2-out-of-every-3-people company like Bank of America....hooooeeeeeyyyy. Is he trying to get that egg off his face and suit coat and trousers and television stage and television camera and the studio audience? I understand trading but that regular stock versus call option buying blab he gave on there that day with respect to Bank of America was so lame unless something turns this stock back up above 10 dollars and does it lightning speed before people throw packs and packs and pecks and pecks of rotten tomatoes at him the next time he shows his Pearl Drops toothpaste mug.

Your negativity won't make anything better.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1352934803255</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 18:13:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352934864187-327</Id><Title>Obama says the Economy is Doing Great and therefore we should Hike Taxes</Title><Msg>Is he blind or just stupid?</Msg><Username>happy_bagholder765</Username><Timestamp>1352934864187</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 18:14:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352934913430-328</Id><Topic><Title>Raising capital gains tax will ONLY scare investors away</Title><Username>kingofvietnam</Username><Timestamp>1352929984643</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 16:53:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nevada foreclosures up 90% in October...when the built up of Nevada foreclosure dam breaks the people of Las Vegas will run for higher ground...lol</Msg><Username>vieweroutrage</Username><Timestamp>1352934913430</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 18:15:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352934995780-329</Id><Topic><Title>★★★★★ Welcome to the Re-Election of President Obama ★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★</Title><Username>ebonics4gfy</Username><Timestamp>1352183530544</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-06 01:32:10 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Don't let it off of the front page.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1352934995780</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 18:16:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352935059369-330</Id><Topic><Title>Wingnuts you can stop talking like you are so tough and powerful</Title><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1352934803255</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 18:13:23 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The never endng pity party !</Msg><Username>sirifuture</Username><Timestamp>1352935059369</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 18:17:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352935067744-331</Id><Title>Believe Me Obama Will Take Us Off the Fiscal Cliff</Title><Msg>He is counting on it and try to pin it on the republicans.

Jarrett graduated from Northfield Mount Hermon in 1974. She earned a B.A. in Psychology from Stanford University in 1978, and a Juris Doctor (J.D.) from the University of Michigan Law School in 1981.[6] In 1983 Jarrett married William Robert Jarrett, son of famed Chicago Sun-Times reporter Vernon Jarrett. She attributes her switch from a private to a public career to their daughter Laura's birth and her own desire to do something that would make the daughter proud.[7] To one reporter's e-mailed question about her divorce, she replied, "Married in 1983, separated in 1987, and divorced in 1988. Enough said."[7] In a Vogue profile, she further explained "We grew up together. We were friends since childhood. In a sense, he was the boy next door. I married without really appreciating how hard divorce would be."[7] William Jarrett died of a heart attack en route to the hospital November, 1993.[8]</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1352943103172</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 20:31:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352943147167-383</Id><Topic><Title>The method of the fringe-right: Sling and dump.</Title><Username>lying_teabag_sakkk_sukkker</Username><Timestamp>1347065775163</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 20:56:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And they still don't realize they have lost.</Msg><Username>hd.callahan</Username><Timestamp>1352943147167</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 20:32:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352943246547-384</Id><Topic><Title>★★★★★ Welcome to the Re-Election of President Obama ★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★</Title><Username>ebonics4gfy</Username><Timestamp>1352183530544</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-06 01:32:10 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hail to the Chief!</Msg><Username>hd.callahan</Username><Timestamp>1352943246547</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 20:34:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352943269879-385</Id><Title>Is it safe yet to buy financials ?</Title><Msg>The consensus is NO !

Her major area of expertise has been to help President Obama “fundamentally transform” the United States into a socialist paradise. Toward that end, for instance, Jarrett helped recruit to the Administration such luminaries as the self-identified communist revolutionary Van Jones (as green jobs czar), the Alinskyite radical Mark Lloyd (as chief diversity officer within the Federal Communications Commission), and the die-hard advocate of wealth redistribution Cass Sunstein (as regulatory czar). But for the task of striking a bargain with the America-hating Islamic supremacists in Iran, it is difficult to identify any qualifications Jarrett posesses apart from the fact that she was born in that country and lived there till age 5. Jarrett’s weak resumé in that regard might well explain not only why the Administration tried so hard to keep a lid on her talks with Iranian leaders, but also why Obama refused to back Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu’s call for a clearly defined “red line” beyond which Iran’s nuclear program would not be permitted to progress. Like so many Obama appointees, Valerie Jarrett bears the unmistakable imprint of the president’s ideology. She is a leftist to her core, with notable personal ties to the communist movement. Jarrett’s maternal grandfather, for instance, was a Chicagoan named Robert Taylor, who in the 1940s was involved with such communist fronts as the American Peace Mobilization and the Chicago Civil Liberties Committee. Also a member of these groups was Frank Marshall Davis, the communist journalist who in the 1970s would mentor a young Barack Obama.</Msg><Username>tulsaturd</Username><Timestamp>1352944650415</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 20:57:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352944733109-393</Id><Topic><Title>Is it safe yet to buy financials ?</Title><Username>kingofvietnam</Username><Timestamp>1352943269879</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 20:34:29 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>We foresee a chaotic behavior of the market once stupid Americans learned to adjust to the reality of Obamacare and higher taxation.</Msg><Username>kingofvietnam</Username><Timestamp>1352944733109</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 20:58:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352944763804-394</Id><Topic><Title>“After we win this election, it’s our turn.

Nothing you can do about it except learning a few tricks how to survive. Here's how you grow potatoes in your own bath tub: Cut like about 3 jumbo potatoes, each into inch cubes. Fill your bath tub with 1 bag of fertilizer first. Now layer all the potatoe cubes about 3 inches apart. Now cover all those potatoes with another bag of fertilizers. Voila, now you can take your shower like usual and as you do so you will grow some potatoes too. Just so you know, IF you grow potatoes indoor, it normally takes like 6 weeks to harvest.</Msg><Username>kingofvietnam</Username><Timestamp>1352948771796</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 22:06:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352948880857-408</Id><Topic><Title>85 Billion dollars a month is put in by the Fed and LACK of a multicent uptick rule leaves the input teetering and tottering.</Title><Username>bluesky_there_to_here</Username><Timestamp>1352930723256</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 17:05:23 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>DOES ANYONE KNOW WHERE THIS MONEY S GOING BECAUSE Bank of America stock is taking way too long to get above 10 dollars.

For one thing, I think it was most foolish to begin this bailout back in 2008 with no multicent uptick rule in place. Did you see back when Germany was facing crisis from this credit crisis, they immediately banned shorting financials. Merkel has her DUCKS IN A ROW when it comes to hanky panky that is PERPETRATED on investors and countries when there is no multicent uptick rule in place or just when there no ban on shorting of financials. IT IS TIME FOR A QUICK CHANGE, who needs the uncertainty hanging over currently very easy to short financials. Who? How unbelievable to think they think we are blithering idiots that can't remember that one of the first things that the new Securities and Exchange Commission did back in response to the Stock Market Crash of 1929 was to put in the multicent uptick rule (1/8 tick is about 12 cents). Why do we allow these people to continue to pillage and suck our capital DRY? How come those investment banks and the largest trading firms had whole quarters in which not a single trading loss day occured? That is impossible unless there is a system rigged against the client or the retail invesotor. IMPOSSIBLE if the field was more level.

Tensions are growing in Washington as the year-end "fiscal cliff" approaches, and in his first press conference since June, President Obama confirmed that he would not compromise on allowing Bush-era tax cuts for the wealthy to expire while extending tax cuts for the middle class. The president's budget plan would raise $1.6 trillion in revenue, including new revenue from tax increases on Americans making more than $250,000 a year. Congress could soon reach a familiar gridlock as a combination of tax cuts, spending initiatives and unemployment benefit extensions are set to expire on January 1. Obama, who is expected to launch Congressional negotiations at the end of the week, said today that Congress must "provide certainty" to middle-class families making less than $250,000 year that their taxes will not go up. After that, Obama said, lawmakers can set a structure to deal with tax reform and entitlements in order to stabilize the deficit. Republicans are generally opposed to any tax increases, but Obama said that some members of the GOP have suggested that a modest tax increase on the wealthy "is not going to break their backs." Progressives in Obama's base are applauding the president's budget plans but warn that Washington's obsession with cutting spending could threaten the nation's economic recovery. In a statement promoted by the nonpartisan research and education center Institute for America's Future, 350 prominent economists called on Congress to boost government spending to stimulate the economy instead of imposing austerity measures. "As even Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke recognizes, it is long term unemployment, not excessive deficits or debt, that is now inflicting the greatest human toll and economic damage," the economists argued. "Polls show that voters agree joblessness and a bad economy are much higher priorities than deficits." Government spending to improve infrastructure, clean-energy growth and the nation's ailing education system will create jobs, improve the lives of Americans and, over time, generate the tax revenues needed to fix the deficit, the economists argued. Teresa Ghilarducci, director of the Schwartz Center for Economic Policy Analysis at The New School and a co-signer on the statement, said today that economic recovery requires government action to spur the economy and encourage banks and corporations, which are sitting on massive sums of cash due to economic uncertainties, to free up those resources and create jobs. "The problem now is slow growth that has created the 7.9 percent unemployment rate," Ghilarducci said. "Any austerity, any budget cuts will just make that worse." Ghilarducci estimates that $120 billion in aid to struggling state governments could create about a half-million jobs in the next year. Note: It was unwise for Pres. Obama to extend it the last time. He was too soft with the wild fanatic GOP in his first term. No more Mr. Nice Guy! He has no third term to run this time. Kick them in their shins!</Msg><Username>giovannijay</Username><Timestamp>1352953563997</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 23:26:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352953729913-433</Id><Topic><Title>MY RIGHT WING FRIENDS - THE ELECTION IS OVER AND YOU LOST</Title><Username>farawaylife</Username><Timestamp>1352948199372</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 21:56:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What Romney is doing is further tearing this country apart.

The survey by the Pew Research Center and the Washington Post found 51 percent of those polled said they don’t think President Barack Obama and Congress will be able to agree on a package of tax increases and spending cuts to replace the automatic reductions in government spending and the expiration of the Bush-era tax cuts scheduled for Jan. 1. Thirty-eight percent said they expected Obama and Congress to cut a deal. If lawmakers fail to reach a deal, 53 percent said Republicans in Congress will bear responsibility, compared with 29 percent who said Obama will be at fault and 10 percent who chose both sides. The fiscal cliff refers to a $607 billion combination of automatic spending cuts and tax increases scheduled for 2013 that were enacted as part of an agreement to raise the federal debt limit. More than two-thirds of those polled, 68 percent, said the automatic spending cuts and tax increases would have a major effect on the economy, and 62 percent said it would be mostly negative. In addition, 44 percent of respondents said the fiscal cliff would have a significant impact on their personal financial situation and 60 percent of those said it would be mostly negative. The survey of 1,000 adults was taken Nov. 8-11 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.7 percentage points. PS: President Obama should do as he plans for what's good and right for our nation and what's good for the preservation of a strong middle class. There is no strong America without the middle class as the super rich 1% are mainly concerned with money and power alone. The President's aim should be what's in our best national collective interest and his legacy. Vile GOP is anti-American and dangerously political at the risk of ruining America as they demonstrated amply with the destructive acts and behavior of GWB!</Msg><Username>giovannijay</Username><Timestamp>1352954484448</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 23:41:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352954733551-437</Id><Topic><Title>Michelle Bachman said today, she will make Obama become a 2 term President.</Title><Username>reggie.thoma</Username><Timestamp>1352954421986</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 23:40:21 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hey Reg, don't you find Michele Bachman attractive?
