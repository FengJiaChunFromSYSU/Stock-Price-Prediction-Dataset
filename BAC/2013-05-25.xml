Republicans had little choice, given that the economy has gained considerable strength over the past 18 months. Today, the federal budget deficit is shrinking rapidly and tax receipts are rising. Consumer confidence and spending are up, as are auto and housing sales. Stocks are near all-time highs. Such improvements give U.S. policymakers some rare breathing room, even if the nearly 12 million people still out of work don't discern the brighter picture. While unemployment is at 7.5 percent, it's down from the 10 percent of October 2009. Also, recent job creation in the private sector has been relatively strong. Republicans, who earlier stressed the weak recovery and what they depict as Obama's economic mismanagement, are now busy denouncing his administration on several fronts: for allowing the IRS to target conservative groups for extra tax scrutiny; for engaging in an alleged cover-up on the nature of a deadly terrorist attack on a U.S. post last September in Benghazi, Libya; and for secretly seizing records of journalists from The Associated Press and Fox News."

At all. Or financial institutions. Deposits are used for lending to business and consumers. That's where the interest comes from that is used to pay the depositors. It doesn't just sit there. Now, if you want to tax it, THEN you are taking money out of the economy. You give it to government, who exacts NO VALUE from the process of wasting 75% of it on government bureaucracy. The value lost to the economy is tremendous, because everyone agress that government is the least productive enterprise in existence. Goods are not created, and people are paid for rubber stamping things that would have happened anyway and for harrassing taxpayers who pull the wagon. So doing what you advocate is the worst possible means of stimulating the economy. It has the exact opposite effect. The only way to advocate your position is to lose all semblance of reality and live in a utopian dream world, a world that does not exist anywhere.</Msg><Username>obamalipsync</Username><Timestamp>1369497590815</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-25 11:59:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369498703442-40</Id><Topic><Title>More proof Trickle down does not help the economy</Title><Username>gar4one</Username><Timestamp>1369309349219</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 07:42:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Corportions use to pay 40% of the total federal tax now its 13% of what they don't off shore and the American public has to make up the difference.

Yes, the deposits do not just sit there... they do help. But why would a company borrow or expand if they are not selling goods? Jobs and wages are the most important in getting the economy to improve. It is supply and demand. If consumers have money to buy things then businesses hire and expand. If the middle and lower class in unemployed or stagnant then the demand for goods will not improve and businesses will not hire or expand.</Msg><Username>jbk1089</Username><Timestamp>1369501150447</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-25 12:59:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369505726631-43</Id><Topic><Title>More proof Trickle down does not help the economy</Title><Username>gar4one</Username><Timestamp>1369309349219</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 07:42:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Republican congress just gave themselfs a raise for what ?

Unfortunately the prospect of playing lion tamer with 3 teams of vicious lawyers holds little appeal at the moment. It is May, and I am killing a few fish, and no flies or bait are being sacrificed in the cause, and for the moment this suffices. BTW you'll no doubt recall that one of the predictions of my testicular piracy model of human transactional behavior was that fortunes would be made on negative, that is less than zero, margins. An offshoot of that postulate was that when Keynsian economists finally freed P/E ratios from the tyranny of reality, the ever-expanding universe of fraud and deceit would inevitably carry them towards infinity, and Behold! ROTFLMAO I guess Whole Foods is gonna get a pass....just remembered that Monsanto and the Air Force were co-conspirators in the Agent Orange Follies. Some retreat-monkey just won a disability claim against Monsanto for pesticide exposure....but I still must not be feeling too good if I feel like kissing a Frenchman.....</Msg><Username>fish2kill</Username><Timestamp>1369537035456</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-25 22:57:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369537829139-72</Id><Title>Mason your kids still enforcing that restraining order?</Title><Msg>If they are T.S. but you ought to pull your head out of your obama and find something else to do, for your posting here is pure obamacrap and worthless</Msg><Username>zevoter01</Username><Timestamp>1369537829139</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-25 23:10:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
