He visited billionaire elites, raising millions of dollars campaigning for democrats at $32,500 a plate meals of only the finest, rarest endangered ingredients while the poor starved. His motorcade disrupted traffic, leaving thousands of cars idling in traffic while emitting tons of unnecessary pollution. There were so many complaints about this "president of the poor and underprivileged" displaying wasteful and extravagant behaviors at taxpayers expense that he relented and had the limo swing by a soup kitchen to rub elbows with the needy. But when he got there, there was no-one. The manager of the soup kitchen apologized, saying that they had run out of rice and beans. Obama, obviously puzzled and bothered as to why the wealthiest nation on earth cannot feeds its underprivileged, was indignant at his loss of a photo op, and as he stormed back into the limo he said, "They couldn't just feed them cake?" "Let them eat cake!"

Later mention of House GOP view—the president got his tax increase a few months back with small increase in tax rate for the affluent. Yes the president wants a quality “gun control” bill And any “chained” CPI index consideration of future social security increases depends upon being part of a larger package including “compromises” Then g f Will started, with statement that China does have leverage with N Korea, especially via its provision of oil to North Korea. ABC’s Martha Raddatz, recently on the Korean peninsula, feels “best result” of the anticipated N Korean rocket launch would be a quick fall into the ocean. Paul Krugman considers the job growth report bad news, blames “sequester” and the return of FICA payments to its prior 6.2 per cent rate. David Stockman of Reagan govt fame feels “Washington is failing”; Krugman considers employment figures do or should represent work force aging (compared with a decade ago, etc). Greta van Susteren of “Fox” blames “regulations” for hurting small business and blames Congress for “doing nothing” when it “should be working”. Krugman—how dare there be mention of “higher interest rates” in a declining economy? Instead of indignation re Atlanta teachers cheating re student test scores, it was pointed out that linking student test scores to teacher salaries and tenure is unwise. Sponsors—oil pressure group again, Chevron, Xerox returns, GE twice, Ameriprise (closest financial sponsor), and yes Pacific Life and United Health Care, the latter gently pushing worker health improvements as desirable.

Your strawman suggests that a minimum wage job should be the end goal, rather than the entry level that it actually is. The idea - for those too stupid to understand - is to get experience and move out of minimum wage, so I guess we all know that raising the minimum wage will increase your salary as a fryboy. You prove that NO liberal ever thinks beyond the end of their nose, but each is consistently filled with completely worthless emotion, and constantly makes stupid emotional decisions. So why would anyone be concerned about making minimum wage a "living wage" if the point of minimum wage jobs is to be an entry point for the inexperienced on which to gain experience? Your ideas are nothing more than value destroyer and job killers. You might want to silence yourself before you sprain that teeny tiny emotion-laden propaganda-filled brain.</Msg><Username>anotherobamafailure</Username><Timestamp>1365369136293</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-07 17:12:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365369248666-40</Id><Topic><Title>Kim Young Un is the guy I admire the most !!!!</Title><Username>kingofvietnam</Username><Timestamp>1365282399899</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 17:06:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>My God I can't believe I'm agreeing with you!</Msg><Username>parisonr</Username><Timestamp>1365369248666</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-07 17:14:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365369639695-41</Id><Topic><Title>The ruling few</Title><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1365367543393</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-07 16:45:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I dunno, Obama only called on the super-rich.

Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Chicago Public Schools board members want us to believe that they must close schools to save money, but that is simply not true. They are choosing to close schools while sending millions of dollars to Wall Street. Every year, CPS pays approximately $36 million in toxically high interest rates, linked to so-called swap contracts, to banks like Bank of America and Goldman Sachs. These arrangements, in which CPS pays a fixed interest rate to the banks — typically between 3.5 and 5.25 percent — to protect itself against fluctuating interest rates in the bond market, were supposed to save CPS money. But the arrangements backfired — and became morally reprehensible — when the banks crashed the economy and the Federal Reserve slashed interest rates to bail them out. Now the banks are profiting greatly from the federal bailout, but Chicago’s schools get nothing — no such relief for them from crippling high interest rates — even as the banks continue to extract millions of dollars from CPS. Big banks were saved by public money, but many Chicago communities are besieged by record high unemployment and foreclosure rates. After jeopardizing our jobs and our homes, now these banks are coming for our children’s schools. We need a mayor who will stand up to Wall Street and fight for our communities. But rather than demanding that these banks renegotiate the swap deals, as other cities successfully have done, Emanuel is choosing to close 54 schools. CPS claims the closures will save an average of $60 million a year for 10 years — numbers that many studies have shown are based on unrealistic assumptions, such as the district being able to sell 50 percent of shuttered schools. At the same time, CPS fails to account for the cost to the children who must cross new g</Msg><Username>falcon8185</Username><Timestamp>1365381381881</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-07 20:36:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365381826798-64</Id><Topic><Title>“This is the best response to Newtown and gun violence in the country,”</Title><Username>dumpobamie</Username><Timestamp>1365380910938</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-07 20:28:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>As long as I have mine, sure.

He's lazy and believes he's entitled to not be part of the food chain or affected by chaos. No such place in the universe, but good luck passing bills to try and make it happen. The only difference between the society of progressives (aka, Detroit), and a polite society -- is a properly armed populace. Ask Switzerland -- you know, the neutral country. Your such arrogant fools, you liberal - er, progressive --cliff divers.</Msg><Username>anotherobamafailure</Username><Timestamp>1365381826798</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-07 20:43:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365382012035-65</Id><Topic><Title>“This is the best response to Newtown and gun violence in the country,”</Title><Username>dumpobamie</Username><Timestamp>1365380910938</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-07 20:28:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Coming from an emotional trainwreck, I guess that's actually a compliment.

The only reason you're blind to it is because you are too emtional. You desperately want to believe that Obama is your little Adolf who can deliver you from all the evils of the universe.
