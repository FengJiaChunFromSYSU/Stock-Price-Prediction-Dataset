MISLEADING and FALSE. See here for documentation on these points. The answer depends on what the claim in this e-mail actually is. The e-mail makes it appear that Wayne Allyn Root said Barack Obama did not attend Columbia University. But if you read the original sources of Root’s quotes (interviews in the New York Times and Reason Magazine), all Root claims on the matter is that he does not remember Barack Obama from his time at Columbia. In Reason Magazine, Root actually makes declarations that assume Obama was there at the time, only in different social circles. The e-mail MISLEADS on this account. The e-mail promotes the claim that no one remembers Obama at Columbia, but at least three specific recollections of Obama by Columbia students and one recollection of Obama by a Columbia professor have been uncovered. What’s more, you can read a piece by a young Barack Obama in the school paper for yourself. Finally, Columbia University itself has specifically declared Obama to be a Columbia graduate. Any claim that Barack Obama didn’t attend Columbia is FALSE.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1345987446265</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 09:24:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345989404390-17</Id><Topic><Title>More and more rejections for having an obama campaign event</Title><Username>zevoter22</Username><Timestamp>1345988674160</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 09:44:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The university declined the request for a number of reasons including class cancellations, which UVA estimates could be more than 186 classes on the second day of school.
