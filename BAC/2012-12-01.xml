He said ending the Bush-era tax breaks at the same time that $1.1 trillion is cut from the budget could be for the best in the long-term. “We will get a lot more deficit reduction if we do the fiscal cliff,” the former Vermont governor said on MSNBC’s Morning Joe. “I actually think the markets will reward the fiscal cliff over a period. “There will be some panic and some moaning and groaning, but the fiscal cliff is not a real cliff, it’s a slope, and you are going to get the biggest bang for the buck in terms of deficit reduction.” Dean said the economy will be able to withstand the effects of the cliff. “Yes, we will go into two quarters of recession,” he said. “But we are in deep trouble here, somebody’s going to have to pay the bill and it is going to have to be all of us, and you get a much better tax bang if you go back to Bill Clinton’s tax rates.” Despite his views, Dean said he believed the two parties in Washington will reach a deal to avoid the cliff. “But the deal has to be the right deal,” he said. “And I still believe that it’s safer, if you’re on the progressive end of the political spectrum, to go over the fiscal cliff than it is to agree to some of the things they’re talking about.” Dean said one of the advantages of going over the cliff would be that there would be some cuts in defense spending, which would not happen otherwise because “defense contractors are in practically every congressional district.” He also said there would have to be some “cuts in human services,” which he didn’t like, but he accepted that “everyone is going to have to put something on the table here.” Dean was adamant about one thing that should not be on the table: raising the Medicare-eligibility age, as that would make it virtually impossible for people aged 65 to 67 to get affordable health insurance. However, he said he had no objection to raising the retirement age when it came to Social Security. And he said the other situation that must not be allowed to come to pass is an increase in tax rates now, with a promise of cuts to come. “This has to be a comprehensive package with spending cuts now — including entitlement cuts.” Dean claimed that marginal tax rates have little to do with investment. “If you go up to 70 percent, yeah, you’re talking some serious stuff that has something to do with investment, but what we’re talking about is a relatively minor adjustment from 35 percent to 39.6.”</Msg><Username>giovannijay</Username><Timestamp>1354389080449</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-01 14:11:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354389177255-64</Id><Title>Nationalize the Banksters</Title><Msg>Got money?</Msg><Username>bobbyconch</Username><Timestamp>1354389177255</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-01 14:12:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354389705104-65</Id><Title>IMO</Title><Msg>New investors, new eyes please read this AAPT is getting their house in order.

Obama campaigned on a balanced approach to reducing our deficit, and I aree with that theory. He just presented a proposal to the Republicans that doubled the tax increases to 1.6 trillion, added 50 Billion in stimulus spending, and wants free reign on raising the debt ceiling at his whim. I am not a brain surgeon, but this is the PRESIDENT of the US playing games with our economy, the futures of our children and plunging the US into a deep recession. Republicans, stand up; If this man is unable to be a leader then you must lead for the future of our Country. For all that voted this man back into office, which is beyond comprehension to me, you deserve to get whatever comes your way.

Thus, I think the politicians will come up with the least hurtful to the market solution.</Msg><Username>nasa_rss</Username><Timestamp>1354397560947</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-01 16:32:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354397611504-74</Id><Topic><Title>$10 in the first week of Christmas - MERRY CHRISTMAS</Title><Username>nasa_rss</Username><Timestamp>1354380112531</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-01 11:41:52 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>bump...</Msg><Username>nasa_rss</Username><Timestamp>1354397611504</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-01 16:33:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354397639524-75</Id><Topic><Title>We need to hit $11.36 just to match Book Value of Citi Group</Title><Username>nasa_rss</Username><Timestamp>1354385896821</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-01 13:18:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>bump...</Msg><Username>nasa_rss</Username><Timestamp>1354397639524</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-01 16:33:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354397681199-76</Id><Title>BAC has proven to be an investment winner</Title><Msg>Selling at only 0.48 book value that trend should continue.</Msg><Username>nasa_rss</Username><Timestamp>1354397681199</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-01 16:34:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354397759443-77</Id><Title>Durable Competitive Advantage, more smaller banks going under, the future bodes well for BAC</Title><Msg>It will be more profitable than ever as smaller firms bite the dust.</Msg><Username>nasa_rss</Username><Timestamp>1354397759443</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-01 16:35:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354397871869-78</Id><Title>Hurray for Regulations, they are making BAC stock holders rich</Title><Msg>Smaller banks are going BK.

He doesn't expect to get everything he wants for Christmas. The republicans are so use to getting their way like spoiled brats that they can't cope with the idea that they are finally going to have to give a little or suffer a lot. Congress has an end date for doing business too, If they aren't going to get the bill to his desk he doesn't need to be there. For the lame duck session all they need to do is pass the senate bill to extend the middle class tax cuts. No good reason to be holding 98% of Americans hostage as a bargaining chip. If they don't pass the bill then they roll back all of the taxes to the Clinton era plus all programs get cut across the board 10%. That takes a lot of money out of the economy but would balance the budget. You might also note that congress has no say about where those cuts are made either. They threw that problem to the president and his administration. The GOP Congress which was the most unproductive in history has made themselves a bed they don't want to lie in. Their vanity was their downfall because they were so sure they would win the election and get the senate that they put all the eggs in the white house basket. One thing Congress did accomplish is they shortened their working year next year to 136 days. Lets not hear complaints about the president not being on the job. Write you Congressman. sending letters to Obama in Hawaii won't do anything, Congress has to pass the bill before he can sign it and the hold up i in the GOP where he has no leadership role. You might make an appeal to Nancy Peloshi. She is the one who Boehner has to deal with.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1354400363759</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-01 17:19:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354400814558-86</Id><Title>Has Michelle Obama done anything good for America ?</Title><Msg>In my very humble she seemed to cost us a lot !</Msg><Username>kingofvietnam</Username><Timestamp>1354400814558</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-01 17:26:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354400870514-87</Id><Topic><Title>MY THOUGHTS ON THE FISCAL CLIFF....</Title><Username>parisonr</Username><Timestamp>1354393997121</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-01 15:33:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama has had four years to get a handle on the economy you've got to wake the Hell up.

The republicans lose because entitlements like social security, Medicare, the VA and retirement programs are not part of the budget. They don't get cut. The military takes a big hit as does every other department and every pork program. Then you are going to have to go to Congress and ask for money instead of asking for cuts. Your deficit problem is solved. No more passing it on to the kids but how do you get out of the resulting recession or depression? That would be the cold turkey approach. Obama has the GOP where they have to take responsibility for cuts and Obama gets credit for taxing the rich. Played like a violin. Democrats take over everything in 2014. The only thing Obama can do wrong is get involved with the GOP negotiations. Right now the average American pays lower taxes than in the 80's. Too many years living on the trickle down credit card with low taxes. None of Obamas tax increase are on the first 200-250,000 of income.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1354401475205</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-01 17:37:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354401578924-93</Id><Topic><Title>Mason and Warren and Larry, Oh My</Title><Username>starkdirt</Username><Timestamp>1354335194501</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 23:13:14 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Maybe it's in wrong hands already...and needs righting.
