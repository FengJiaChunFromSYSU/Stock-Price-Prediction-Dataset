It is not all about the presidential election. It is also about the gains in the House and Senate the repubs will make as a result of Romney's campaign because he has played hardball and will be pitching the balls harder and faster as election day nears. He'll play dirty if necessary, and he will bring out dirt on Obama, and that in turn will galvanize repubs. Read the news... it is all over that even incumbent repubs will be replaced with farther right tea party repubs with more extreme and more deeply entrenched views. As much as the dems complain about the current repubs in Congress, after the elections they will look back and wish that they had compromised with the previous lot because the new lot will be ever more difficult to deal with.</Msg><Username>mrstan4089</Username><Timestamp>1343966844155</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-03 00:07:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343967478557-4</Id><Topic><Title>The fringe-right idiot rectal drips are in gush mode tonight.

The leftist insulting sarcasm when they cannot forumate an intelligent argument. I see it all the time on MSNBC. It has become a liberal signature. "Laughing" has become the ultimate insult when you've got nothing of substance to say. What you apparently fail to realize, or else you would not be "laughing" so much is that win or lose, Romney will hurt Obama. Romney will play dirty, he will fight, he will use that billion dollars to trash Obama. In the meantime, if you read the news, you would know that repubs will gain seats in the Senate. Even worse for dems and repubs, a significant number of moderate repubs will lose to extremist tea party repubs, with more extreme and more deeply entrenched views. How do you think Obama will make out with that? The thing is, Romney with all the money he has at his disposal and more money to come from ultra rich super pac donars, and his willingness to get down and dirty, will hurt Obama so much in public opinion and that coupled with the shift in power to the tea party will make his second term, if he wins, a bigger loser than the first term.</Msg><Username>mrstan4089</Username><Timestamp>1343967478557</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-03 00:17:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343967829617-5</Id><Topic><Title>Harry Reid: -- "Word is out," Romney hasn't paid taxes in 10 years</Title><Username>go_choke_charlie</Username><Timestamp>1343948468318</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 19:01:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Your dead logic professor won't be voting. And, it doesn't matter what YOU think, either. You are obviously a mindless Fox zombie incapable of realizing how stupid Willard is for continuing to refuse disclosure, AND how stupid the repugs are for not vetting him properly. Talk about the village idiot! Had the repugs known Willard would be this stupid about disclosing his assets, he would have been barred from the selection process. The VOTERS are fed up with Romney's continuing refusal to show what he's got, where it is, and what he's paid taxes on, or not paid taxes on. Who cares about logic? This issue is about Willard hiding what he's got. The issue is not a new one, but Harry Reid just served it up with savvy.

Obama is not electable because of his use of executive privilege to cover up the truth about fast and furious. When he ran for election, he promised to change things. In particular, he promised greatly increased transparency. Yet he has exercised exec privilege more than Clinton and more than Bush... a lot more. That nondisclosure could very well cost him the election, as Romney will have a field day pointing it out. A friend of mine suggests that Romney is sand bagging on his tax returns so that in a public debate with Obama, he can offer to provide the tax returns dems have clamored for... if Obama releases the fast and furious info.

That popular vote margin of R-46% - D-44% looks terrific colored in on a map.....and doesn't mean a thing. The only number that matters is 270: the number of electoral votes needed to win. Right now, despite all that Red, it gives Obama 217, Romney 191, and leaves 130 as 'undecided' (the all-important "swing" states that include Wisconsin, Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Virginia, North Carolina, Florida, and a few smaller outliers). The electoral votes of these states are what will decide the outcome of this election. Most electoral college maps also include for each candidate the probability, expressed as a percentage, that he will achieve the required 270 electoral votes.

Take a look at any current Electoral College map, and then tell us who's going to fire Obama, and where and how they're going to do it. Forget about the popular vote, and pay some attention to what counts. Right now, most electoral college maps show Obama with 217 firm, Romney with 191 firm, and 130 all-important swing votes still in play. The outcome will hinge on the popular vote in the key industrial swing states like Wisconsin, Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Virginia, and it is there that Romney's Run For The Roses ends. A week ago, before Mitt's Most Excellent Foreign Adventure, he was enjoying a 47% - 44% lead over Obama in those key states. A week later, following his embarrassing attack of Prancing Pony hoof-in-mouth disease, those numbers have flipped in Obama's favor, and the spread is growing. Romney's cameo appearance at the Wailing Wall in headgear that didn't exactly fit him reminded me of that infamous photo of Dukakis sitting in a tank wearing a helmet that made him look like Mr. Bean in a race car. Besides insulting nearly every country he visited (except Israel, which certainly didn't endear him to his base), undermining US foreign policy, and pulling the covers off his cultural elitist view of the world, his refusal to release his tax returns and Ann's Olympic follies are not playing well with the working class.

"While we don't release exact sales numbers, we can confirm reports that it was a record-setting day," Steve Robinson, Chick-fil-A's executive vice president of marketing, said in a statement. At least one location had to close early after nearly selling out of chicken. At others, lines snaked around buildings and patrons waited upwards of two hours to snag their chicken sandwiches and show their support for Chick-fil-A CEO Dan Cathy's comments supporting traditional marriage. "We are very grateful and humbled by the incredible turnout of loyal Chick-fil-A customers on August 1 at Chick-fil-A restaurants around the country," Robinson said. "We congratulate local Chick-fil-A Owner/Operators and their team members for striving to serve each and every customer with genuine hospitality." At the Chick-fil-A in Augusta, Georgia, about 150 miles from the franchise's Atlanta headquarters, the lunch line wait was hours long. And after a day of lines that snaked around the building, the restaurant had to turn away part of the dinner crowd, closing two hours early due to low supplies After an outpouring of support for Cathy and his company during Wednesday's Appreciation Day, gay activists are taking to the streets, or rather the Chick-fil-A parking lots, around the country for National Same Sex Kiss Day at Chick-fil-A on Friday to protest the chicken chain's opposition to the LGBTQ community. Same-sex couples are being urged to take photos and videos of themselves kissing outside of Chick-fil-A restaurants nationwide. About 11,000 have said on Facebook that they will attend the event. The Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day event had about 55 times that many Facebook attendees. Although the restaurant chain has become a rallying cry for people on both sides of the marriage debate, Chick-fil-A has aimed to stay out of the politics and controversy stemming from its CEO's comments. "The Chick-fil-A culture and service tradition in our restaurants is to treat every person with honor, dignity and respect –regardless of their belief, race, creed, sexual orientation or gender," Robinson said in a statement. "We understand from news reports that Friday may present yet another opportunity for us to serve with genuine hospitality, superior service and great food."</Msg><Username>calm_reason</Username><Timestamp>1344018998659</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-03 14:36:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344019164546-130</Id><Topic><Title>Obama told us the Deficit would be cut in half by now what happened?</Title><Username>humblehawk88</Username><Timestamp>1344018529245</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-03 14:28:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama has no solutions.
