The decision "disses" children, she said. During last week's presidential debate, Romney vowed to cut federal funding for PBS while acknowledging it's the home of popular "Sesame Street" character Big Bird. "Kids Pick the President: The Candidates," with videotaped questions for the candidates from youngsters nationwide, debuts Oct. 15 on the children's channel. Afterward, an online poll asks kids to make their pick. Romney's campaign said "he simply didn't have time. He couldn't fit it in his schedule," Ellerbee said Monday. His decision is disappointing because "answering kids' questions directly shows respect for the several million kids who will vote in Nickelodeon's 'Kids Pick the President' campaign," she said. "That's several million kids who actually want to get involved in the democratic process," Ellerbee said. "They don't deserve to be dissed. But former Gov. Romney also blew off Letterman and Big Bird, so I guess we're in good company."</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1349755208639</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 00:00:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349755484892-2</Id><Topic><Title>Officer Claims State Department Rebuffed Security Pleas in Libya</Title><Username>barackalinski</Username><Timestamp>1349753710062</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 23:35:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well...ISN'T IT?</Msg><Username>barackalinski</Username><Timestamp>1349755484892</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 00:04:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349755740905-3</Id><Topic><Title>Mitt the ....Man?</Title><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1349752785534</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 23:19:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The man lacks intellect and ability to think deep. He is lost in details and loves a showoff of superficiality. And the world is moving in the opposite direction. He thinks the old ways of threatening nations with weapons are still effective like it was 30-50 years ago! He can easily make himself the laughing stock of the world... should he continue behave and speak by shooting from his hip.... as he has been doing during his campaigning for the last 12 months. The worst is that he seems eager to satisfy and even impress the GOP right-fringe ignoramus... at a time when the world youth rising to raise serious and deeper questions and connectivity and communication progress is making the world at large more in tune with the modern times and realities. Romney appears more like a snake-oil salesman... talking smooth and glibly while saying superficial and offensive things in an impressive manner devoid of essence and substance.</Msg><Username>johnmjay</Username><Timestamp>1349755740905</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 00:09:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349756078622-4</Id><Topic><Title>Mitt the ....Man?</Title><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1349752785534</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 23:19:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Mitt is a MAN!

The Cesar E. Chavez National Monument becomes the 398th unit in the National Park Service system, and the first honoring a Latino born later than the 1700s, the Park Service told CNN. It’s no coincidence the move comes less than a month before Election Day, as the president maintains a strong lead among Latinos. A big turnout among Latino supporters in states where the race is close could help Obama win re-election against GOP challenger Mitt Romney. F YOU OBAMA!

The DVD shows footage of a woman acting in a SM porn scene, which Gilbert claims is Obama’s mother ‘Ann Durham’. Gilbert states that Barack Obama’s real dad is communist Frank Marshall Davis, something Ann Durham knew all along but kept secret. Chairman of the Republican party in Alabama, Bill Armistead, has seen the documentary already and says: “That film is absolutely frightening. I’ve seen it. I verified that it is factual, all of it.

"We have already signed Eddie up as part of our "Dead or Alive-Sign-em Up" program. Eddie was Czar material." According to the Broward Sheriff’s Office, Archbold, of West Palm Beach, and several other Democrats signed up to eat $1 plates of a variety of insects at Ben Siegel Reptiles in Deerfield Beach. After eating dozens of giant cockroaches, Archbold was declared the winner of an ivory-ball python. He had also entered a superworm-eating contest earlier in the night.</Msg><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1349784171559</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 08:02:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349784451541-39</Id><Topic><Title>Don't believe the lie that Romney beat Obama in debate and consequently jumped huge in the polls</Title><Username>cosmo_vitellii</Username><Timestamp>1349769424724</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 03:57:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Feel free to doubt yourself, #$%$.

Now he agrees with what President Obama is doing and would back those same ideas. Romney would lie, cheat, steal and even change to becoming a Democrat again to win this election. The only thing Romney will not do is stop hiding his money from paying taxes to the U.S., he will always keep his money in the Cayman Islands and Swiss bank accounts. We will never see his 2009 tax returns because he took the Swiss bank account amnesty.. There is no reason to keep money out of the U.S. other than cheat on his taxes.. Romney is the man who sent American Jobs to China, Mexico and India, that is how the rich get richer.</Msg><Username>fireundersmoke</Username><Timestamp>1349792466556</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 10:21:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349792650669-91</Id><Title>BAC looks good for this and next year</Title><Msg>With housing market healing, BAC will recover in price this and next year.</Msg><Username>stockbug2010</Username><Timestamp>1349792650669</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 10:24:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349792666083-92</Id><Topic><Title>FOR ENTERTAINMENT PUPOSES ONLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</Title><Username>jimtalkner</Username><Timestamp>1349792181591</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 10:16:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hey use for both DEM and REP camps TOO- it works for wall street also..............</Msg><Username>jimtalkner</Username><Timestamp>1349792666083</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 10:24:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349792681405-93</Id><Topic><Title>price support</Title><Username>vger44</Username><Timestamp>1349788469410</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 09:14:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So far it looks like ~$9.30 is holding up.

Ryan and his Tea Party terrorists pass a bill to add more money to the defense budget after President Obama ends the war in Iraq. Ryan votes to remove rights and benefits for women so that money can be used for defense. Women should know Republican men (the boys club) will they them what they can do with their bodies.

There's that gap from $9.10 to $9.20 to consider. And Algo's and HFT's love to close gaps whereever possible. So if this current dip is any indication I'd say a test of $9.20 is setting up, with the intent being to bust it and shove the bid south to the $.9.10 area, which is a stronger support area. I'm just added a bit here at $9.23 to my longer term basket, and have bids in at staggered lower areas of ~$9.15 and ~$9.05 area. Longer term it's all good...but over the day to day time you can expect the Algo's/HFT's to have their way with all the participants in the Finny sector.

Saefong, MarketWatch And while there are many factors that will influence oil in the months ahead, most of them point to the likelihood of prices falling to levels closer to $60 to $50 a barrel — or at least not making any sort of lasting impression at $100 in the fourth quarter. “Given the backdrop of slowing global demand and rising non-OPEC production, the odds are that Brent heads to below $100 as we get towards the end of the year, which will also pressure WTI to stay closer to $60 to $50,” said Kirk McDonald, senior research analyst at St. Louis-based Argent Capital Management. Overall, the selloff in West Texas crude oil has been “due to the converging bearish themes of lethargic economic data, lackluster oil demand and the continuing trend of rising domestic oil production,” said Smith. “Meanwhile, signs of slowing in China and a euro-debt crisis that rumbles on and on provide little reason to be bullish right now.” U.S. field production of oil has climbed to its highest level since 1996, according to Energy Information Administration data. Production is currently at more than 6.5 million barrels per day. See the EIA’s latest production data. “The renaissance in domestic production is real and can be attributed to improved exploration and production techniques as well as higher prices,” which enables the economic recovery of previously known reserves, said Michael Peterson, managing director of energy research at MLV &amp; Co. At the same time, “industry capital has rotated back to the U.S. en masse because there is no fear premium to operating,” with the U.S. and Canada the safest places to make large capital investments in projects, said Neal Ryan, managing partner at Ryan Oil &amp; Gas Partners LLC. The largest area of output growth among oil producers who are not part of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is North America, according to the EIA, which expects production there to increase by 1 million barrels per day in 2012. See the EIA’s Short-Term Energy Outlook Report from September. Oil should be “at the $60 to $50 level in the fourth quarter as long as Israel doesn’t employ a preemptive attack on Iran,” said Zahir. And, barring any specific supply-shock scenarios, Peterson said the likelihood of significantly higher WTI oil prices in 2012 is “limited” to less than 25%. When asked if $100 or $60 oil prices are more likely, Peterson replied: “$60 is more likely near-term,</Msg><Username>fairvalue23</Username><Timestamp>1349796438369</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 11:27:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349796487877-126</Id><Topic><Title>Merkel going to meet friends in city of Athens in Greece......</Title><Username>flashcrashcoming</Username><Timestamp>1349756598898</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 00:23:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>shoot - its already here - by listening to ( some of the 47% ) ha ha will start a war - but fact - they think they are owed - free cars - free homes - an free education - you wonder what their parents - ever taught them about hard work .!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</Msg><Username>da23533</Username><Timestamp>1349796487877</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 11:28:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349796494960-127</Id><Title>Oil $50: Pros analysts Oil at $50 Credit Suisse analysts Oil at $50</Title><Msg>Oil $50: Pros analysts Oil at $50 Credit Suisse analysts Oil at $50 - the analysis argues that demand would fall along with trading activity and that any recovery would be “halting fragile and painfully slow.” The report points to the fall in oil prices witnessed in 2008, when Brent prices plunged from a record high level in the space of a few months.

The bid got taken from ~$9.27 to $9.04 in 5 minutes time. Nuts...HFT's and Algo machines make this sort of thing almost scary normal. All you can do is keep your eyes peeled and wait for it.....wait for the moment....then hit and hit fast. Bid now $9.11. It's freaky how fast the market reacts these days...the machines read the head-lines via real-time news shifting algo's and just react...no thought...no human involvement at all it seems. Just machines playing off of other machines with wee humans running around beneath their feet. Bid now $9.14.

The Algo's read the real-time news feeds and react in an instance to whatever comes across the tape. There's no thinking going on, and very little human involvment. This is why you see such sharp up's and down's. Humans don't react like that, nor that fast. All you can do is wait for the moment, understand it for what it is (as a human being), and play off it. I grabbed a $9.05 tranche because of this dip...and just bailed at $9.21 with 16pennies in hand for ~10 minutes of work. Thank you machines! Heh! Now let's see if they try to walk the bid back down.

Yes, the challenge is tough in the stock market. Unless you're good at the game, one has no chance of winning. Suing the bank will get you nowhere but you will lose more money while suing. You're either a grown up or in need a lot of learning and experience. I made money on BAC since the bottom in March 2009 with at least 7 trades ALL with profits. Keep in mind that this is a zero-sum game. Many lose and few win in this game. No money comes from elsewhere than winners taking it from the losers. You need to learn much more than what apparently know now. You can't compete with a lot of smart and experienced guys and make easy money in the stock market. Even if you have beginners luck in a strong up-trending market/stock... that won't count as learning but may end up thwarting your education and preparation.</Msg><Username>giovannijay</Username><Timestamp>1349813283796</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 16:08:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349813323029-253</Id><Title>DOW down 109 pts? but but DIDN'T HE SAID HE CREATED 4 MILLION JOBS and hosted DINNER in NYC</Title><Msg>What did he do wrong?</Msg><Username>urichey</Username><Timestamp>1349813323029</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 16:08:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349813416584-254</Id><Topic><Title>What BAC Shareholders Do Not Know</Title><Username>davenportchase623</Username><Timestamp>1349784793395</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 08:13:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Maybe a reality show..</Msg><Username>marlin.moore90</Username><Timestamp>1349813416584</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 16:10:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349813605096-255</Id><Topic><Title>DOW down 109 pts? but but DIDN'T HE SAID HE CREATED 4 MILLION JOBS and hosted DINNER in NYC</Title><Username>urichey</Username><Timestamp>1349813323029</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 16:08:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Look...never believe a jigger when he says the check is in the mail...</Msg><Username>milesed18</Username><Timestamp>1349813605096</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 16:13:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349813689022-256</Id><Title>Libya &amp; Obama</Title><Msg>Obama is done, he cost U.S. lives, and tried to cover it up.

She also claimed Washington acts as apologists for the Taliban by downplaying their links to Al Qaeda and the strength of their organization. "I chose this subject because, one, I can't stand that there is a major lie being propagated," Logan said.

Obama blew a perfect good opportunity for a nice little shooting war, and for American soldiers to demonstrate how to die nobly in another pointless provocation of radical Islam. Do you think we'd have gotten out of that scenario with less than 4 Americans dead, or do you think it might have cost a few more? Same story in Syria; American defense companies should be getting rich delivering heavy weapons to the Syrian rebels, but no, Obama the Obstructionist got in the way of another great Afghanistan-style adventure. For all the criticism of the 'leading from behind' comment about Obama's foreign policy, I see nothing wrong with his strategy of sending other lemmings over cliffs like these first, and hanging back to see if the popularity of that movement wanes before it's America's turn to jump.

R-Money's most self#$%$-ured lying can't hide the fact that he does not care for the 47% of the population and his primary interest remains to reduce taxes for himself and his 1% super rich friends!</Msg><Username>giovannijay</Username><Timestamp>1349837030147</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 22:43:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349837417668-317</Id><Topic><Title>Romney flip flops back to being pro choice</Title><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1349836739481</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 22:38:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Even if he is not intentionally lying... it's a bad sign that he can't even understand that what he is doing is counter to gaining respect and trust.

Prevarication, falsification, fabrication are all familiar tactics that have been employed by Mitt R-Money without much consequence to him ever since he entered public life, thanks to the inviolable taboo in the mainstream media against calling out a liar (unless, of course, he lies about sex). Yes, President Obama ought to have been better prepared for R-Money's barrage of blather and bull. The Republican's own chief advisor, Eric Fehrnstrom, had glibly described the “Etch-a-Sketch” strategy they would deploy in the general election, to make swing voters forget the “severe conservative” of the primaries. Romney executed that pivot on Wednesday night, but he could do so only by spouting literally dozens of provably fraudulent assertions — which various diligent fact-checkers proceeded to debunk. Knowing that he is vulnerable on taxation and the budget for many reasons, including his own peculiar and secretive tax history, R-Money made several contradictory claims regarding his economic plan. He has no plan to lavish $5 trillion in tax breaks on the wealthy. He won't cut taxes for the rich at all. He vowed to provide tax relief to the middle class and won't increase their tax burden. He swore that his tax cuts would not increase the deficit. Finally, he said that with all of that, he would grow the economy enough to shrink and eventually eliminate the deficit — without raising taxes on anyone. And he claimed that there are several studies proving he can fulfill all of these conflicting promises — even though he refuses to provide any specific tax proposals beyond a broad tax cut. There is no study proving that R-Money can do what he promised, and among his lies is his description of editorials in the Wall Street Journal as "studies" of his plan. The most complete and unrefuted study of his claims remains the Tax Policy Center's bipartisan report on the Romney plan, which shows that there is simply no way to pay for his $5 trillion, across-the-board tax cut without raising taxes on the middle class. None of the alternative studies he has cited proves otherwise — and some of them actually amass additional evidence that he is wrong. Undoubtedly he knows all that. He knows that eliminating the estate tax, a mainstay of his plan, will benefit the rich enormously and almost nobody else. He also knows that when he claims economic growth alone will erase the deficit, without raising taxes, he is inventing impossible numbers. As The National Memo's Howard Hill demonstrated yesterday, the assumptions behind his claims are ridiculous. For the numbers to work, he would have to create not 12 million jobs, as he promised to do by 2016, but 162 million — more than the total current U.S. workforce. Or else the jobs created would have to pay more than $443,000 per year on average, which is even less likely than Rafalca winning the dressage medal at the next Summer Olympics. At the same time, R-Money accused the president of increasing the federal debt by an amount that is "almost as much â€¦ as all prior presidents combined." This charge, which he leveled before, is patently false and by now R-Money must know it. The prior debt, mostly run up by George W. Bush and his Republican congressional cronies, stood above $10 trillion when Obama took office. The debt is now just over $16 trillion, mostly due to costs incurred by Bush and by Obama's successful effort to prevent a Depression. Having essentially disavowed the health care reforms that were his sole significant achievement in his single term in elected office, the former Massachusetts governor suddenly claimed ownership of Romneycare. Presumably, this will make him more appealing to swing voters, too. But he still wants to do away with Obamacare, except for the parts that are popular. For this maneuver, he must misrepresent his own proposed federal health care overhaul. He says there will be no change to Medicare for current beneficiaries, but repealing the Affordable Care Act will deprive them of free preventive care, increase their costs for prescription drugs and do irreparable harm to Medicaid, which provides assisted care for nine million destitute Medicare patients. But Romney has been lying about the Affordable Care Act for years, according to his own former advisor Jonathan Gruber, the chief intellectual architect of Romneycare. Nearly a year ago, Gruber complained that Romney's attempt to draw a sharp distinction between the Massachusetts legislation and Obamacare was phony. He told Capital New York in November 2011 that "they're the same #$%$ bill. He just can't have his cake and eat it too. Basically, you know, it's the same bill. He can try to draw distinctions and stuff, but he's just lying." Lying again? Indeed, the falsehoods flowed on every conceivable subject. Concerning energy, Romney claimed that "about half" of the renewable energy firms that received federal assistance under Obama administration programs went bankrupt — a claim that cannot be justified by any measure. Of the 28 firms that got federal loans or loan guarantees, three went under, representing less than 11 percent — and less than 5 percent of the funds committed. (This assertion was so blatantly untrue that the Romney campaign withdrew it the next day.) The examples cited above hardly exhaust the deep well of dishonesty in the Republican campaign. What Romney has done presents a fundamental challenge to the American political media. Will news outlets hold him accountable for baldly misleading voters? Are they capable of confronting his continuous mendacity with basic facts? Some have made a beginning, while others have scarcely tried. If that isn't their responsibility, then they no longer have any purpose at all."</Msg><Username>giovannijay</Username><Timestamp>1349838578573</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 23:09:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349838692864-324</Id><Title>Oct. 9, Gallup Poll of REGISTERED voters: Obama - 49% --- Romney - 46%</Title><Msg>Not a poll of "likely" voters, but a poll of REGISTERED voters.</Msg><Username>j.farragut</Username><Timestamp>1349838692864</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 23:11:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349838958184-325</Id><Title>Can't stand seeing your master Obama trailing??
