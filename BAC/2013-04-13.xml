Specifically, by the wall street bankers who borrowed the money to do it (and came up with the money to elect the current administration,). Witness ALL world markets turning over and running down and are NOT able to get to all time highs. These include the biggest economy in the world, China, who's economy and stock market did not come close to the their highs in 2007 of 31,352 THAT YEAR. During it the dow was at 14k we had a dollar that was 1.25 not a euro that was 1.31, it is now .82. DO THE MATH, 35% currency hit translates directly over to when you sell your shares what you get in DOLLARS - 1.25 minus .82 is .43 and THAT IS 35%. This doesn't not translate to a recovering economy with us macro data at the moment coming in today at a four year low. If you factor in companies like SOLARA, the NASDAQ is still half of what it was in the year 2000. At 3300 and remember it was at 5000 then FOURTEEN YEARS LATER THAT IS NOT A RECOVERY GET IT THROUGH YOUR THICK HEADS ON THIS BOARD. It is no where near all time highs and the stocks in it like Msft, intc, orcl and others still at 20 dollar area.

I correctly gave him three names. The sole reason it is harder for the market to double now than it was in 1926 is simply that population growth is arithmetic. On the tax issue. Due to the loop holes in the tax code highest earners effective tax rate was around 45% during Ike's terms. But during each of the three presidential terms I mentioned marginal rates were significantly dropped which led to big market gains. Most dramatic was in coolidge's terms. When rates were dropped from 61% to 24% the market quadrupled. Finally our market has done well, despite this administration's anti capital policies, because of surging earnings which is the result of accomodating monetary policy and a resiliency on the part of US corporations by lowering their cost structures.in the face of great uncertainty re: obamacare, regulations and taxation. The result, of course, is high unemployment, wealth accumulation offshore and corporate profits at 11% of GDP - an historic high. Not exactly what Obama wanted.</Msg><Username>jhitcher2011</Username><Timestamp>1365868946603</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-13 12:02:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365869944243-50</Id><Topic><Title>obama's arrogance allows him to prove his ignorance is expanding daily</Title><Username>zevoter22</Username><Timestamp>1365869236764</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-13 12:07:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why is it that NONE of you SW rectal drip aliases ever promote ANYTHING?
