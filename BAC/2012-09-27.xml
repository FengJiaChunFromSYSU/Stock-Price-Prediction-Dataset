What does this sound like? (From AP, released at 3:30 PM YESTERDAY, 9/26/12) ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE (AP) — The White House said Wednesday that President Barack Obama considers the deadly assault on the U.S. consulate in Libya a terrorist attack. White House spokesman Jay Carney said it is "certainly the case that it is our view as an administration, and the president's view, that it was a terrorist attack." Four Americans were killed in the attack, including Chris Stevens, the U.S. ambassador to Libya. Kilgares, I'm starting to think I underestimated your qualifications to be a high-level GOP operative. You shoot from the hip, don't trouble yourself with facts, and make sure every statement supports the overarching GOP philosophy, to make sure Obama is a one-term president. Yep, you'd fit right in with the Romney team.

I knew this not based just on the polls but the type of personality of Mitt who shoots from the hip every time he speaks. His easy and comfortable life and becoming a boss without putting in the hard work required apparently all contributed and conditioned him to be #$%$-sure of himself and make untruthful statements. Accordingly he sorely lacks one most important leadership requirement. THINKING before SPEAKING can be suicidal in any candidate for an important leadership position especially in our modern times. He will be his own undoing in this race, let alone the fact is that he is lacking in many other ways and even unpatriotic. I also think... Mitt will sink more in his own quicksand... in the debates with President Obama.</Msg><Username>giovannijay</Username><Timestamp>1348769446835</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 14:10:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348769685992-165</Id><Topic><Title>Presidential candidates need to be even more transparent in their dealings.

The result?... 8% unemployment, $1.2 trillion deficits, and a sluggish 1.3% GDP... all while investment capital flees offshore and dives into shelters (Apple's Wozniack was the latest billionaire to announce that he's fleeing the U.S. economy... to Australia). Today's stimulus is historically massive... the fed's printing press is running at an un-precedented rate... and Obama's government is borrowing 40 cents out of every dollar the government spends... ... still... no growth, high un-employment... and massive deficits. Why? very simple. Everybody with investment capital (wealthy americans and corporations) is scared to death of the magnitude to which Barak Obama hates them, hates capitalism, hates that they HAVE investment capital and is threatening to tax the cr@p out of them... ... it's no wonder our capitalist system... the system that built America's wealth in the first place... has COMPLETELY SEIZED UP. Meanwhile, Singapore (the place that the brazillian facebook founder fled to) is keeping taxes low, has NO capital gains tax, has more millionaires per capita than any country on earth, low un-employment, and outstanding growth. The difference is simple... Singapore doesn't punish wealthy people... they nurture them and give them incentives to deploy their capital into productive, jobs-producing industries. The fuel of capitalism is investment capital... and so long as America employs a president who hates and punishes those with the investment capital we need to build businesses and employ Americans... it isn't going to matter HOW much monetary and fiscal stimulus Obama and Bernanke hurl at our economy... ... it simply isn't going to work... and they aren't going to change... Obama has hated capitalism and colonialism ALL HIS LIFE. 4 more years like the last 4 years, and we're Greece, people...

We don't want to see those causing the problem in the first place to take leadership... now that President Obama carried the heavy burden of getting our nation out of the deep hole dug by the GWB/GOP regime who have given us 2 wars, the 911 tragedy and financial disaster all within 8 years!!!!</Msg><Username>giovannijay</Username><Timestamp>1348781289570</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 17:28:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348781525101-225</Id><Topic><Title>MITTEN ROMNEY IS A GOOD REPRESENTATION OF REPUCANS</Title><Username>farawaylife</Username><Timestamp>1348781270825</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 17:27:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"GREEDY, LIARS AND BIGOTED FOOOOLLLLS" and ARROGANT IDEOLOGUES who even after disaster are SHAMELESS and have NOT LEARNED the lessons of their IDIOTIC ACTIONS AND BEHAVIOR!</Msg><Username>giovannijay</Username><Timestamp>1348781525101</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 17:32:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348781569161-226</Id><Title>OBAMA LIED ABOUT BENGHAZI ATTACK BECAUSE HIS CAMPAIGN IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE LIVES LOST THERE</Title><Msg>Benghazi attack is a national disgrace!</Msg><Username>bury_obama</Username><Timestamp>1348781569161</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 17:32:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348781736177-227</Id><Topic><Title>Early voters tend to be educated, informed and motivated voters -- the kind of people who would probably find a way to vote no matter what; the vast majority of which are Republicans.</Title><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1348776734049</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 16:12:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Is there anything other than Fox?!!!..have a nice night!

This is what the cyberattacks are about, God plus Jesus plus solar flares protecting His Children. Everyone wants to blame others or take credit for what God is doing to banks greed, exploitation of peoples wages and affliction against His Children. This is what's up. God and Jesus added to the Sun's energy, substance, power and light which is added to our atmosphere, light, air, water, earth and beings, to perform His will and judgement. Solar Flares, CME’s and sunlight, sun’s energy, radiation and substance added to Water, air, and food with God, His word, His Son, His Son's Blood and Holy spirit, truth, purity and righteousness, is coming for Bank of America and all that exists in the universe, Earth , All heavens and beyond, Past present and future, Eternally and NO-ONE can remove Him from there in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen! Solar Flares and CME's Plus God, Jesus and the Holy Spirit in the Light and energy of the Sun is upon the wage earner exploiters of Bank Of America and other banks as the Lord being a swift witness against them and those who support them, as well as All others for a blessing or curse, to each his own reward for what they have done to others and continue doing so without repentance when asked to. Matthew 3:11 I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance, but He who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. The Reign and Indignation of God Isaiah 66:14 When you see this, your heart shall rejoice, And your bones shall flourish like grass; The hand of the Lord shall be known to His servants, And His indignation to His enemies. 15 For behold, the Lord will come with fire And with His chariots, like a whirlwind, To render His anger with fury, And His rebuke with flames of fire. 16 For by fire and by His sword The Lord will judge all flesh; And the slain of the Lord shall be many. 17 “Those who sanctify themselves and purify themselves, To go to the gardens After an idol in the midst, Eating swine’s flesh and the abomination and the mouse, Shall be consumed together,” says the Lord. Psalm 21:9 You shall make them as a fiery oven in the time of Your anger; The LORD shall swallow them up in His wrath, And the fire shall devour them. Psalm 89:46 How long, LORD? Will You hide Yourself forever? Will Your wrath burn like fire? Isaiah 9:19 Through the wrath of the LORD of hosts The land is burned up, And the people shall be as fuel for the fire; No man shall spare his brother. Ezekiel 21:31 I will pour out My indignation on you; I will blow against you with the fire of My wrath, And deliver you into the hands of brutal men who are skillful to destroy. Ezekiel 22:21 Yes, I will gather you and blow on you with the fire of My wrath, and you shall be melted in its midst. Ezekiel 22:31 Therefore I have poured out My indignation on them; I have consumed them with the fire of My wrath; and I have recompensed their deeds on their own heads,” says the Lord GOD. Ezekiel 38:19 For in My jealousy and in the fire of My wrath I have spoken: ‘Surely in that day there shall be a great earthquake in the land of Israel, Malachi 3 The Coming Messenger 1 “Behold, I send My messenger, And he will prepare the way before Me. And the Lord, whom you seek, Will suddenly come to His temple, Even the Messenger of the covenant, In whom you delight. Behold, He is coming,” Says the Lord of hosts. 2 “But who can endure the day of His coming? And who can stand when He appears? For He is like a refiner’s fire And like launderers’ soap. 3 He will sit as a refiner and a purifier of silver; He will purify the sons of Levi, And purge them as gold and silver, That they may offer to the Lord An offering in righteousness. 4 “Then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem Will be pleasant to the Lord, As in the days of old, As in former years. 5 And I will come near you for judgment; I will be a swift witness Against sorcerers, Against adulterers, Against perjurers, Against those who exploit wage earners and widows and orphans, And against those who turn away an alien— Because they do not fear Me,” Says the Lord of hosts. 6 “For I am the Lord, I do not change; Therefore you are not consumed, O sons of Jacob. 7 Yet from the days of your fathers You have gone away from My ordinances And have not kept them. Return to Me, and I will return to you,” Says the Lord of hosts. “But you said, ‘In what way shall we return?’ Do Not Rob God 8 “Will a man rob God? Yet you have robbed Me! But you say, ‘In what way have we robbed You?’ In tithes and offerings. 9 You are cursed with a curse, For you have robbed Me, Even this whole nation. 10 Bring all the tithes into the storehouse, That there may be food in My house, And try Me now in this,” Says the Lord of hosts, “If I will not open for you the windows of heaven And pour out for you such blessing That there will not be room enough to receive it. 11 “And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, So that he will not destroy the fruit of your ground, Nor shall the vine fail to bear fruit for you in the field,” Says the Lord of hosts; 12 “And all nations will call you blessed, For you will be a delightful land,” Says the Lord of hosts. The People Complain Harshly 13 “Your words have been harsh against Me,” Says the Lord, “Yet you say, ‘What have we spoken against You?’ 14 You have said, ‘It is useless to serve God; What profit is it that we have kept His ordinance, And that we have walked as mourners Before the Lord of hosts? 15 So now we call the proud blessed, For those who do wickedness are raised up; They even tempt God and go free.’” A Book of Remembrance 16 Then those who feared the Lord spoke to one another, And the Lord listened and heard them; So a book of remembrance was written before Him For those who fear the Lord And who meditate on His name. 17 “They shall be Mine,” says the Lord of hosts, “On the day that I make them My jewels. And I will spare them As a man spares his own son who serves him.” 18 Then you shall again discern Between the righteous and the wicked, Between one who serves God And one who does not serve Him. Malachi 4 The Great Day of God 1 “For behold, the day is coming, Burning like an oven, And all the proud, yes, all who do wickedly will be stubble. And the day which is coming shall burn them up,” Says the Lord of hosts, “That will leave them neither root nor branch. 2 But to you who fear My name The Sun of Righteousness shall arise With healing in His wings; And you shall go out And grow fat like stall-fed calves. 3 You shall trample the wicked, For they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet On the day that I do this,” Says the Lord of hosts. 4 “Remember the Law of Moses, My servant, Which I commanded him in Horeb for all Israel, With the statutes and judgments. 5 Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet Before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord. 6 And he will turn The hearts of the fathers to the children, And the hearts of the children to their fathers, Lest I come and strike the earth with a curse.”</Msg><Username>mark_p93561</Username><Timestamp>1348789285770</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 19:41:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348789306126-267</Id><Title>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 4YRS INTO OBAMA GDP IS 1.3% -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</Title><Msg>-----------------------------------</Msg><Username>talking.monkeyy</Username><Timestamp>1348789306126</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 19:41:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348789369892-268</Id><Topic><Title>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 16 TRILLION IN DEBT ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------OBAMA PROMISED TO CUT THE DEFICIT IN HALF ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</Title><Username>talking.monkeyy</Username><Timestamp>1348789174975</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 19:39:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What will you try next?

Why did Countrywide change my 5.75% mortgage loan, I Locked-in at, to 6.25% right before signing escrow, without discussing it with me 72 hours prior as loan documents states must be done? 2. Why did Countrywide tell me I couldn’t afford the cheaper loan and that they thought they told us prior already, when I called during signing? 3. Why did Countrywide change my loan to one I doubted my wife and I could afford, when my family was going to have nowhere to live if we didn’t sign? 4. Why did Countrywide tell us their copy machine was broken when we signed our lock-in agreement? 5. Why didn’t Countrywide give us a copy of our Lock-in agreement document when we asked for it since the beginning of our mortgage? 6. Why did Countrywide sell our note to Bank of America that we did not want to do business with nor support, and not hand deliver the note? 7. Why are we forced to do business with Bank of America and forced to allow them to service our loan? 8. Why did Bank of America ignore us on 5 modification attempts to our previous lock-in agreement and only answered and told once that we didn’t qualify? 9. Why does Bank of America deny our QWR for all Loan, escrow, Lock-in agreement, and 6 modification attempts, documents? 10. Why does Bank of America Bank of America threaten to foreclose, selling our note, and actually put our loan into default with pre-foreclosure, still denying us our QWR? 11. Why is it legal for real estate companies and internet sites allowed to show our house available in pre-foreclosure, for 2/3 the cost I purchased it for, at a monthly mortgage half of what I am being forced to pay? 12. Why is it ok for Bank of America to foreclose on my mortgage when the amounts due are the same amounts our houses estimated worth has depreciated, due to Real Estate company’s, Countrywide’s and Bank of America’s practices of unequal, racial, judgmental, predatory lending for greed of money with house flipping and greed of money, no matter who it puts on the street and causes to be homeless? 13. Why is it ok for the home builder to tell us they’re not going to fix the cracks in our stucco unless they can fit a nickel inside it? 14. Why is it ok for banks to exercise their legal document rights, ignoring and denying the consumer their documented rights when the consumer cannot afford the greed of an attorney? 15. Why does everyone, banks, governments, other nations and countries think they can do what they do against Americans and God’s true Children everywhere, and get away with it, without judgment from God? 16. Why did the American Government bail out these banks with tax payers money, for doing these things to Christian Americans that choose to be the True Children of God?

Nothing bad that happens will be Obama's fault, not at 5 years, 6, 7 or even 8 years if he is re-elected. He will go out of office still saying that all his failures were Bush's fault.

(PINKSHEETS: AAPT) -- Early projections by AAPT forecasted an on-shelf presence in 40,000 retail stores by year's end; however, owing to the WOW response to presentations of its patent pending food bars for dogs -- NutraBar™, ChompBar™ and MuttBar™ -- the company's estimates have been revised upward to 60,000 stores by year's end. AAPT President Lisa Bershan shared: "No one has said, 'I don't want the bars' and so our sales team keeps closing accounts like the $1.2B SSI, Inc. distribution company and their 500 markets in Northern California and Nevada. There are 250,000 more retail stores that carry pet products and we should be in all of them -- it is what it is." The reaction to the bars by dogs has been nothing short of an addiction -- once a dog gets a taste there is no stopping their craving for more. The investment in extruders, forming machines, packaging machines and facilities made by the company will easily keep the supply chain and the nation's 78 million dogs filled with BARS. Which brings us to three truths: The first is that dogs will always be hungry and the second is that we are the one and only dog bar maker and finally, neither of those truths are going to change anytime soon.</Msg><Username>maxeileen</Username><Timestamp>1348798551067</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 22:15:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348798643348-299</Id><Topic><Title>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- OBAMA IS A LIAR -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</Title><Username>talking.monkeyy</Username><Timestamp>1348787786919</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 19:16:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>hey jfarggot just do what the libtard media tells you.

How about stop avoiding the question about Obama's college records. Wouldn't you want to know if he lied by claiming he was a foreign exchange student to get free tuition? That would be fraud and show that he did not value his US Citizenship very much, until it served him better to allow him to run for President. Seriously, wouldn't you want to know if he lied and committed a fraud? Would that not cast a saddow on his character? Or would you vote for him even if he were jack the ripper?
