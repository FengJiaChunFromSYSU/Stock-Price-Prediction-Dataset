Not only have they tried, and failed, to smear and slander Obama since he entered the arena of national politics, but they also tried, and failed, to smear and slander Obama's parents, his wife, his children, his teachers, and his associates Libertydies presented verified facts about Bush's ridiculous (lack of) military service. In response, the ultra-extremist far-right turd-slinging and turd-eating liars, like this low-life fool obamasync, throw up the same lying idiocy that they used when attempting to slander and smear Obama before his re-election. Obviously, obamalipsync, and the rest of the legion of liar extremists, are unable to refute Libertydies report because Libertydies posts are spot on. The level of desperation among ultra-extremist far-right fools is astonishing.

They are arguing about which kind of arsonist is the most evil: the kind who use explosives; the kind who use blowtorches and accelerants; the kind who use BIC lighters and old newspaper, or the kind who use matches and a candle. The only thing they can agree upon is that this catastrophic blaze could only have resulted from arson (and horrors, it may have been two or more arsonists working in concert!!!). The discussion gains urgency as they focus on the definitions and exceptions for each category of arson: whether M-80's and Roman candles deserve patriotic exemptions; whether vodka is an accelerant; whether Zippos are as deadly as BICs; whether incense is a candle, and whether Japanese Perpetual Matches pose any threat whatsoever since they perpetually fail to ignite. Soon the neighbors are yelling at each other to be heard above the roar of the inferno and the screams of tenants still trapped inside. Flaming dogs and cats are racing out the front door of the building, and mothers and children are leaping from upper story windows and landing on tools and hoses and ladders and tools left by an irresponsible maintenance crew. Finally the fire department arrives, but can't gain access to the blaze due to the crowd, who by now, steadfastly refusing to be distracted from their citizen's crusade to classify arsonist and limit their selection of ignition sources.</Msg><Username>fish2kill</Username><Timestamp>1366562741850</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-21 12:45:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366562812410-22</Id><Topic><Title>Liberals love to import terrorism through uncontrolled immigration</Title><Username>dwacorn</Username><Timestamp>1366555395123</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-21 10:43:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You didn't state any true and supportable facts.

The fire finally dies out; the injured and dead are removed from the scene, and the fire department departs. Suddenly, one of the neighbors shouts and points to flames coming from the adjacent apartment building, and screams in disbelief: "Oh my God, that's my building! Somebody DO something!" Proud of their success in putting out the first blaze, his neighbors race next door, quickly conclude that a serial arsonist is at large, and then begin to discuss which one of them should call the fire department. On the lawn in front of the now-smoking basement of the former apartment building, two survivors are having their own conversation: (#1): "Ralph! Thank God you're alive! Ain't we lucky to live in the best darned country in t the world? We're gonna be getting a brand-new apartment, and I'll bet the developers will have it up in under two weeks!

Most states today are not common law states. For example only those nine states that still allow common law marriage are common law states (Alabama, Colorado, Kansas, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Iowa, Montana, Washington, Utah and Texas). All "law enforcement" against the two brothers was done by FBI, local, and state police. Please get your facts straight since it is clear you and little z don't have a clue about Posse Comitatus. But, if an actual insurrection ever occurred in the USA I'd bet that the Posse Comitatus would be ignored as the preservation of our nation is more important than the any conservative (or liberal) interpretation of the law.</Msg><Username>lastfirst011</Username><Timestamp>1366585219558</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-21 19:00:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366585566077-50</Id><Topic><Title>Robin Williams on Boston</Title><Username>carburetorkid</Username><Timestamp>1366476844873</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-20 12:54:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>YEP YOU'RE RIGHT!</Msg><Username>carburetorkid</Username><Timestamp>1366585566077</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-21 19:06:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366586050516-51</Id><Topic><Title>9/11 Was the Darkest Day for America in Over 60 Years</Title><Username>kooper156</Username><Timestamp>1366561567353</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-21 12:26:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The only relevency is that "owns" in your sense really means 9/11 occurred on Bush's watch.

Hence Truman's commitment to help the French with less than 200 advisors.

Their stalling and attempt to bring down a president has cost us a lot. You might look at the age demographics when you consider the percentage of workers Hitch. Lots of baby boomers who enjoyed the low taxes and long term unemployment benefits that have no intention of returning to work. Ikes role was the foot in the door, Who developed the domino theory? I'll agree LBJ was terrible and a puppet of the military industrial complex. One of my least favorite presidents but Nixon was even worse as far as his war policy goes. By the way the budget deficits are going down and below a trillion now or haven't you noticed?

Why have you chosen to start slanting your knowledge to a political agenda? It seems that in the last few years you have taken to using a real bias in choice of information you want to present even when I know you know better and have more complete information: like declaring Ikes role was minimal when he was responsible for the development of the policy that led us in to and justified the Vietnam war. I know you know the history. You were the person on the board who warned of the problem with derivatives 6 months before the game collapsed and you understand the abuse in the system. You know how BAC was abused by the Goldman crowd and why we have to have huge reserves today but you remain mute on the subject.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1366597530661</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-21 22:25:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366599440884-76</Id><Topic><Title>9/11 Was the Darkest Day for America in Over 60 Years</Title><Username>kooper156</Username><Timestamp>1366561567353</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-21 12:26:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Lib, as someone else pointed out here, Since '46 the US had a policy of containing communism. Truman was the first president to assist the French in repelling communism in Viet Nam. Ike followed suit but no US troops engaged in combat. Under Kennedy and Johnson, troop strength lept from under 1000 to more than 1/2 million. Ergo, the dems "own" that war. The labor participation rate is the lowest it has been in 30 years. That is largely due to a policy of fostering the nanny state. You said it yourself, " long term unemployment benefits" discourages work. BTW, low taxes encourages work. High taxes discourages work. You've got it backwards. If the reps hadn't retaken the house in '11 one can only imagine what our deficits and debt would be under this fiscally challenged president's social agenda. Yes, deficits are less but that is due increased receipts because of a resilient of corporate America. Maybe the deficit will close below $1 trillion but it will still require borrowing abroad and that includes China.</Msg><Username>jhitcher2011</Username><Timestamp>1366599440884</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-21 22:57:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366600501300-77</Id><Title>This Week's Big Winner</Title><Msg>CCUR is probably the most undervalued stock with the biggest upside potential on the NASDAQ.

I tend to react, not crusade. I don't think I have ever initiated a political dialogue here. If I seem to have become more caustic and entrenched it is because I am responding to comments from the left which are sweeping generalizations or gross misrepresentations Few people appreciate the continuum of events like the slow involvement in Nam that started with HST. Or take the inane comment, "The GOP owns 9/11." Should we forget that in 1998 the head of the CIA's counter intelligence unit informed Clinton of a plot brewing? Sure it happened on Bush's watch but could Clinton have been more vigilant? An your comment that the GOP owns every afterwards was a sweeping generalization. Who do you think controlled the Whitehouse and congress in '09 - '10 when much of the groundwork for our economic funk was laid admist a massive build up in debt and deficits? On BAC, I don't own the stock. I sold 9/08 after having owned it since '91. But I still watch it. When someone here asks an honest question about the stock I'll try to answer it if no one else does. BAC is still mired in litigation. More troublesome is its growth prospects are unclear, particularly given Q1 revenue drop. Too, the new regs are about to hit the industry biggies. All considered they will need those reserves. But clearly, BAC is a better company now that it was a few years ago. It's a value play but without the dividend income.</Msg><Username>jhitcher2011</Username><Timestamp>1366602371581</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-21 23:46:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
