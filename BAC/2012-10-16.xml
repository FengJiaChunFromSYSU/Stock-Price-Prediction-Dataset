Some of these machines are made (Diebold) by guys who are known to be staunch Republicans. I just can't trust these people because they would do ANYTHING to win... many show sociopathic signs. I'm told there are many such voting machines in the swing states. Democrats act like sissy. The Florida fiasco in the 1999 election was proof and they lost the election by 536 votes when you know errors alone were in the ten thousands of votes that were thrown out by operatives. They will use anything and everything to win. They hate Obama to the extreme... and I am very concerned about this election at times. I know Obama will win but not in a rigged election that the GOP can orchestrate behind and under cover!</Msg><Username>giovannijay</Username><Timestamp>1350362248954</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 00:37:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350362299663-4</Id><Topic><Title>Beware of Republican election fraud.</Title><Username>urbansquall</Username><Timestamp>1349098668930</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 09:37:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It certainly is a sad commentary on the state of this once great nation that a !@#$%^ Chicago #$%$ with zero experience gets elected, commences to trash the country, does a hell of a good job trashing the country, and is competitive for re-election.

Because the CPI will be announced at 5:30 a.m., the market will probably pull back at around 5:10 a.m. for safety sake, due to profit taking. If the CPI is acceptable, market will gap up at 6:30 a.m, pushing BAC very close to $10 (look at the high demands for October 2012 options). Hence, BAC will push the market higher because it is, after all, a momentum stock with large volume. Market tends to gap down at 6:30 a.m. If that remains to be the case, hopefully you can cover your short positions to minimize your losses or take a bit of profits. Why are some shorts so negative about the general market right now? I'd like to know because I want to maximize my gains. I really think this election year may help the stock market to continue to rally until November. And BAC has enough catalysts to hit or surpass $10 this week.</Msg><Username>fbi4hire</Username><Timestamp>1350379851427</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 05:30:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350380821750-18</Id><Title>OBAMA THE GREAT DIVIDER...YOUR MESSIAH STRAIGHT FROM THE PITS OF HELL!!!</Title><Msg>Any sane man knows you don't lay with a queer!!

In pro-union Wisconsin, Walker won by a country mile. But worst of all for Mr. Obama, several recent polls show Romney competitive in Illinois -- Obama’s home state. Romney is actually winning by a landslide in the suburbs of Obama’s Chicago. Even in Cook County, the country’s biggest Democratic stronghold, Romney leads by double digits among independents (43-31) and white voters (53-40).

The board of directors named Michael Corbat its new chief executive. President and Chief Operating Officer John Havens also resigned. Shares of Citigroup [C 36.66 1.91 (+5.5%) ] slid in pre-market trading following the announcement. "Citigroup is well-positioned for continued profitability and growth, having refocused the franchise on the basics of banking," Pandit said. Citi's board of directors praised Pandit's "leadership, integrity and resilience in guiding Citi through the crisis and positioning it well for the future." Corbat was formerly the chief executive of Citi's Europe, Middle East, and Africa division. ================================== This should be great for BAC.</Msg><Username>low_mac</Username><Timestamp>1350390540369</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 08:29:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350390685029-48</Id><Title>9.55 open</Title><Msg>going that way right now!

In April of 1983, a suicide bomber crashed a truck into the US Embassy in Beirut, Lebanon, and detonated a bomb that killed 63 people, including 17 Americans. Among them were 8 CIA agents, including the CIA's top Middle East analyst and Near East director, Robert C. Ames, Station Chief Kenneth Haas and most of the Beirut staff of the CIA. Others killed included William R. McIntyre, deputy director of the United States Agency for International Development, two of his aides, and several Marine Security Guards. Lebanese victims included clerical workers at the embassy, visa applicants waiting in line and nearby motorists and pedestrians. An additional 120 or so people were wounded in the bombing. That incident happened on Ronald Reagan's watch. His tough response? He denounced the "vicious terrorist bombing" as a "cowardly act," saying, "This criminal act on a diplomatic establishment will not deter us from our goals of peace in the region." Two envoys, Philip C. Habib and Morris Draper, continued their peace mission in Beirut to discuss Lebanese troop withdrawals with a renewed sense of urgency. The next day, Ambassador Dillon, who had narrowly escaped injury in the bombing, said: "Paramount among the essential business is our work for the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanon." It is only by securing Lebanese government control over the country "that terrible tragedies like the one we experienced yesterday can be avoided in the future." Also on that day, that notorious peace-nik and cringing liberal, Sen. Barry Goldwater (R, Ariz.) said, "I think it's high time we bring the boys home." Following the attack, the embassy was moved to a supposedly more secure location in East Beirut. However, on September 20, 1984, another car bomb exploded at this embassy annex, killing twenty Lebanese and two American soldiers. No one called for Reagan's head, or denounced him for lacking testosterone. The rap, what little of it there was, was taken by the CIA. Granted, it wasn't an election year, but it's worth noting the similarities between the Beirut and Libyan embassy incidents, and the stark disparities in the assignment of blame. It perfectly illustrates the one-way street that neocons call their own. ROTFLMAO the cowardly men we should worry about are the ones like you: chicken hawks who jeer from the safety of the sidelines and toss trash at their own quarterback when he gets sacked.</Msg><Username>fish2kill</Username><Timestamp>1350395241296</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 09:47:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350395349164-97</Id><Topic><Title>OUR GROUP WILL BE BUYING 400 MILLION TODAY</Title><Username>midnight_riderssss</Username><Timestamp>1350393627121</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 09:20:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>shorts are toast.....

You post says it! If not so, I apologize. This year alone I've traded 4 times already with great profits and have shares still to trade and profit, in my port. It's sad that you won't do the hard work. But then we need many losers like you... so that us, the few, keep winning. Sorry, but such is life... Smart money has to take dumb money as this is the ultimate zero-sum game... now increasingly becoming global. A word to the open minded. One needs to do a lot of work not only about the market, psychology and risk/money management... but on one's personal shortcomings. It's very hard and challenging but it can be done and is very rewarding. Sure it requires a lot of time and a lot of hard work. But once one reaches that plateau... life's a peach! It's not the money, but the fulfillment of having beat one's own weaknesses as the market is so counter-intuitive and looks so easy to those who can make easy money while totally unprepared faced with the smart ones who know how to play the game. C'est la vie. Life is beautiful. GLTU... But you are responsible yourself... to meet the enemy (yourself!) and beat her/him first to become a winner in this game. There's no other way to win in this most challenging game!</Msg><Username>giovannijay</Username><Timestamp>1350398527843</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 10:42:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350398679893-117</Id><Title>Whats Breakup value BAC and Citi?

In fact, to illustrate the 'fog of war' principle at work in these kinds of incidents, consider this: nearly 20 years after the bombing, in a September 2001 FRONTLINE interview, Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger said the U.S. still lacked "actual knowledge of who did the bombing" of the Marine barracks. But it suspected Hezbollah, believed to be supported in part by Iran and Syria. Hezbollah denied its involvement.

Both called their respective incidents tragedies, and both speculated about possible perpetrators (Reagan suggested Syria, Iran, and Hezbollah as the culprits, though all denied responsibility). That uncertainty remained, despite the fact that the US had far more embassy and military infrastructure in place that it has now in Libya, and the quantity and quality of information from Beirut was vastly superior to what the skeleton crew at the Libyan embassy could gather and disseminate. In fact, in 2001 Cap Weinberger still couldn't say for certain who was responsible for the attack. (See my reply to bury_obama). Neither Obama nor Reagan retaliated militarily, and both stressed that America's goal was to get the governments of the countries in which the attacks occurred to step up and behave as responsible members of the international community. Speaking of Reagan, in the first debate of the 1984 season, Mondale kicked his butt, and everyone started speculating about Reagan having Alzheimer's. Reagan came back strong in the second debate, the one in which he said he was not going to exploit age and experience to take advantage of Mondale's youth and inexperience, and won a second term. Romney supporters are the ones who should be on pins and needles tonight; it's a town meeting format, and we all know how good Romney is at connecting with Joe Six-Pack.

Supreme Court refuses Republican request to halt early voting in Ohio days before election By Associated Press, Updated: Tuesday, October 16, 1:56 PM COLUMBUS, Ohio — The Supreme Court sided with Democrats on Tuesday in refusing to block a decision over disputed early voting days in the battleground state of Ohio, giving President Barack Obama’s campaign a victory three weeks before the election. The court refused a request by the state’s Republican elections chief and attorney general to get involved in a battle over early voting on the three days before Election Day.Obama’s campaign and Ohio Democrats sued the state officials over changes in state law that took away the three days of voting for most people but made exceptions for military personnel and Ohioans living overseas. Democrats in their lawsuit cited a recent study saying nearly 105,000 people voted in the three days before the election in 2008. They argued everyone should have the chance to vote on those three days. And they said eliminating the opportunity for most Ohio residents to vote in person on those days, while giving military or overseas voters the chance to do so, leads to unequal treatment. Attorneys for the state said many laws already grant military personnel special voting accommodations, such as requirements for states to send absentee ballots to them 45 days before the election. And they argued local boards also need those three days to prepare for the election. On Oct. 5, a federal appeals court reinstated voting on the weekend and Monday before the election and returned discretion to set hours on those days to local boards of elections. Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted appealed that ruling to the Supreme Court last week. He said it opened up the chance for Ohio’s 88 county boards of elections to set different rules, while at the same time ordering that all voters be treated the same. Before the changes to the Ohio law, local boards of elections set early voting hours on the three final days. And voting hours varied among the state’s counties. Husted had been accepting boards’ recommendations for hours on the disputed days in the event his appeal wasn’t successful. Shortly after the high court’s decision, he directed boards to be open on the Saturday, Sunday and Monday before the Nov. 6 election. He also set uniform hours. Bob Bauer, general counsel for Obama for America, praised the Supreme Court decision. “We now turn our full attention to educating Ohio voters on when and how they can vote along with presenting the clear choice they face when selecting their next president,” Bauer said in a statement.</Msg><Username>mr.whizzard</Username><Timestamp>1350411887516</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 14:24:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350411908840-236</Id><Topic><Title>Hillary says Obama Regime's differing accounts of the Libya attack were due to the 'fog of war.'</Title><Username>dumpobamie</Username><Timestamp>1350397728476</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 10:28:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>that could be possible hours but not days still giving out misinformation.

Romney came across as an in-command CEO and effective leader, laying out his plan energetically and in impressive detail. Paul Ryan gave concise, bullet-point responses that you’d hear in a business meeting. He was far easier to follow than Joe Biden who, many observed, was filibustering rather than debating. Biden’s contentiousness also said something about the activist mindset of many supporters of Big Government. In "Freedom Manifesto," we point out that the bigger government gets, the greater the tendency towards divisive, grievance politics that inflame resentments and undermine trust. Big Government creates a highly political environment where interest groups—young and old, rich and poor—compete for government resources and political favors. Rewards go all too often to those who scream the loudest. Biden’s constant interruptions of Paul Ryan are not so far afield from the tactics of far left activists like Occupy Wall Street. Both are better at loudly expressing indignation than making a cogent argument. In other words, the differences seen in the debates were not simply those of style but of values.Americans are sensing this, which is why they are turning off to the Obama campaign. It should have surprised no one when, after President Obama’s failed performance, his campaign responded by ramping up the divisive rhetoric, accusing Mitt Romney of being a “liar” and unleashing an overly aggressive Joe Biden on Paul Ryan.</Msg><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1350415069362</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 15:17:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350415152343-280</Id><Topic><Title>BAC stock action weak today!!!</Title><Username>rloos15</Username><Timestamp>1350403462514</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 12:04:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>We have about another 40 minutes left before market closes and we are a long way from your $9.65 predicted close for BAC.????</Msg><Username>rloos15</Username><Timestamp>1350415152343</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 15:19:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350415399554-281</Id><Topic><Title>Mothers Read:Bush And Republicans Friends Were Moammar Kadafi And Osama bin Laden</Title><Username>fireundersmoke</Username><Timestamp>1350405218020</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 12:33:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Tell that to the Stevens family.

News Saturday's poll offered plenty of explanations for Obama's durability in Ohio. For one, the president's resilience there could be a testament to his robust field operation. By a roughly 3-to-1 ratio, the Obama team claims more campaign offices statewide than Romney. The fruits of Obama's ground game may be discernible in the poll: among the nearly 20 percent of Ohioans who said that they have already voted, 76 percent of them cast their ballots for the president. Romney, on the other hand, leads Obama among those who have not voted yet, 51 percent to 45 percent. What's more, PPP's findings underscore what's been so paramount to the president's standing both in Ohio and in neighboring states. Fifty-four percent of Ohio voters said they support the bailout of the U.S. automotive industry, long a significant source of support for Obama throughout the Rust Belt, while 37 percent said they remain opposed. On the question of which candidate would be better for the auto industry, 50 percent of Ohio voters gave the nod to Obama compared with 43 percent who said Romney. And a majority of Ohio voters, 51 percent, said they trust Obama more on the economy, while 46 percent said they preferred Romney. Obama's approval rating has improved since PPP's Ohio poll in late-September, which showed a narrow plurality of the state's voters disapproving of his job as president. In Saturday's poll, 50 percent of Ohio voters said they approve of Obama's job performance, while 48 percent said they disapprove. Romney's own personal standing has gotten slightly worse: 51 percent of voters there have an unfavorable view of the former Massachusetts governor, up from 49 percent in September. While Romney's surge in many polls this week showed a narrowing of the gender gap, PPP's latest survey found Obama widening his lead among Ohio women. The president leads by 12 among female voters in the state, a big bump from his slim 2-point edge late last month. PPP did not survey Ohio last weekend, so it is unclear what immediate damage Obama incurred there for his flat performance in the Oct. 3 presidential debate. But it's possible the president was at least partly redeemed by his running mate: 46 percent of Ohio voters said Vice President Joe Biden was the winner of Thursday night's vice presidential debate, while 37 percent gave the edge to Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI). PPP conducted its survey Oct. 12-13 using automated interviews with 880 likely Ohio voters. The poll has a margin of error of 3.3 percentage points.</Msg><Username>surreal.deal</Username><Timestamp>1350417149397</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 15:52:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350417160757-303</Id><Topic><Title>All in at 9.45</Title><Username>tomd100</Username><Timestamp>1350416851227</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 15:47:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So you bought about 30,000 shares?

News Sunday, Oct. 14, 2012 Although President Barack Obama has seen solid leads evaporate in the last week, a poll released Saturday night suggests that Ohio may continue to serve as a firewall for his campaign. The latest survey from Democratic-leaning Public Policy Polling (PPP) shows Obama leading Mitt Romney among likely Ohio voters, 51 percent to 46 percent. That's little change from PPP's pre-debate poll of Ohio two weeks ago, which showed Obama up 4. The PollTracker Average currently shows Obama holding a small lead over Romney in Ohio, 47.5 percent to 47.2 percent. Obama has outperformed Romney in Ohio throughout this campaign. By the end of September it looked like the president was poised to walk away with the Buckeye State's 18 electoral votes. But a successful outing in the first presidential debate breathed new life into Romney's campaign, and the Republican nominee has subsequently either narrowed or erased Obama's leads both nationwide and in swing states. Saturday's poll offered plenty of explanations for Obama's durability in Ohio. For one, the president's resilience there could be a testament to his robust field operation. By a roughly 3-to-1 ratio, the Obama team claims more campaign offices statewide than Romney. The fruits of Obama's ground game may be discernible in the poll: among the nearly 20 percent of Ohioans who said that they have already voted, 76 percent of them cast their ballots for the president. Romney, on the other hand, leads Obama among those who have not voted yet, 51 percent to 45 percent. What's more, PPP's findings underscore what's been so paramount to the president's standing both in Ohio and in neighboring states. Fifty-four percent of Ohio voters said they support the bailout of the U.S. automotive industry, long a significant source of support for Obama throughout the Rust Belt, while 37 percent said they remain opposed. On the question of which candidate would be better for the auto industry, 50 percent of Ohio voters gave the nod to Obama compared with 43 percent who said Romney. And a majority of Ohio voters, 51 percent, said they trust Obama more on the economy, while 46 percent said they preferred Romney. Obama's approval rating has improved since PPP's Ohio poll in late-September, which showed a narrow plurality of the state's voters disapproving of his job as president. In Saturday's poll, 50 percent of Ohio voters said they approve of Obama's job performance, while 48 percent said they disapprove. Romney's own personal standing has gotten slightly worse: 51 percent of voters there have an unfavorable view of the former Massachusetts governor, up from 49 percent in September. While Romney's surge in many polls this week showed a narrowing of the gender gap, PPP's latest survey found Obama widening his lead among Ohio women. The president leads by 12 among female voters in the state, a big bump from his slim 2-point edge late last month. PPP did not survey Ohio last weekend, so it is unclear what immediate damage Obama incurred there for his flat performance in the Oct. 3 presidential debate. But it's possible the president was at least partly redeemed by his running mate: 46 percent of Ohio voters said Vice President Joe Biden was the winner of Thursday night's vice presidential debate, while 37 percent gave the edge to Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI). PPP conducted its survey Oct. 12-13 using automated interviews with 880 likely Ohio voters. The poll has a margin of error of 3.3 percentage points.</Msg><Username>surreal.deal</Username><Timestamp>1350422402427</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 17:20:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350422519662-344</Id><Topic><Title>Obamanomics</Title><Username>ilikeil1111</Username><Timestamp>1273170964000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2010-05-06 14:36:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obamanomics:16Trillion$$$$plus debt.

The Democrats wanted to make the country look as bad as they could to insure that a Democrat would be elected. It was a devious plan that unfortunately worked too well. It amazes me how Pres. Bush is blamed for the financial crisis, when in fact its congress that administers the funds, and at the time Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were being overseen by Maxine Walters, Barney Frank, and Chris Dodd. They ran the oversight committee. Not the president. President Bush wanted to reform Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, but was blocked by the Senate "Democrats", claiming there were no problems at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The democrats are guilty of being insidious liars, because it was they who wasted two years up to the “crisis” in Oct 2008, not president George bush.

The far left ideologues quickly defend Obama as not being a Communist, Socialist, or Marxist; he's definitely not a Capitalist, instead of trying to label him, let's just say what we know about him. When Obama thinks about freedom, he sees a world in which some people, due to personal initiative and good fortune, will do better than others, and he's right. But Obama sees that as oppressive, and unfair. Where you see freedom, liberty and the pursuit of opportunity for all Americans to achieve their personal goals for a better life, Obama sees greed and bigotry. Obama believes that it’s his mission to promote "equality of outcome" (Social Justice) over "equality of opportunity (Freedom). This worldview makes Obama a very dangerous man, who's the greatest threat to your personal liberty, and that's something the Progressives can't defend him against.</Msg><Username>compaqashley</Username><Timestamp>1350423140827</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 17:32:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350423222717-354</Id><Topic><Title>BAC will hit over $10 tomorrow</Title><Username>tomd100</Username><Timestamp>1350416326318</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 15:38:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Mark, the anal-ists are anally right!

DISHONORABLE, HARMFUL and INCITEFUL SPEECH is against peace between people and nations. I fully agree with that. The GOP fanatics are taught to generalize, label, hate, and incite and attack. That can't be taken as free speech. One is cornered and can't stay silent and you can see that it leads into real problems. They abuse and exploit free speech in everything they do and call it just politics and business-as-usual. That BEHAVIOR IS VILE AND UNACCEPTABLE. Their leadership did that same thing to the President and at the expense of obstructing progress in our economy. They act against the larger good and should not be tolerated.

Met Office in the Media: 29 January 2012 29 01 2012 Today the Mail on Sunday published a story written by David Rose entitled “Forget global warming – it’s Cycle 25 we need to worry about”. This article includes numerous errors in the reporting of published peer reviewed science undertaken by the Met Office Hadley Centre and for Mr. Rose to suggest that the latest global temperatures available show no warming in the last 15 years is entirely misleading. Despite the Met Office having spoken to David Rose ahead of the publication of the story, he has chosen to not fully include the answers we gave him to questions around decadal projections produced by the Met Office or his belief that we have seen no warming since 1997. For clarity I have included our full response to David Rose below:A spokesman for the Met Office said: “The ten year projection remains groundbreaking science. The complete period for the original projection is not over yet and these projections are regularly updated to take account of the most recent data. “The projections are probabilistic in nature, and no individual forecast should be taken in isolation. Instead, several decades of data will be needed to #$%$ the robustness of the projections. “However, what is absolutely clear is that we have continued to see a trend of warming, with the decade of 2000-2009 being clearly the warmest in the instrumental record going back to 1850. Depending on which temperature records you use, 2010 was the warmest year on record for NOAA NCDC and NASA GISS, and the second warmest on record in HadCRUT3.”</Msg><Username>jefatkinson</Username><Timestamp>1350428002216</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 18:53:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350428007225-389</Id><Topic><Title>Don't forget:</Title><Username>tiffinytl</Username><Timestamp>1345838055405</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 15:54:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The question remains.

[we will] have no time to think, no means of calling our miss-managers to account but be glad to obtain subsistence by hiring ourselves to rivet their chains on the necks of our fellow-sufferers...

Lying is when you say you are in favor of choice at one point and saying you would repeal roe vs wade at another or that you have a secret plan to create 12 million jobs in 4 years or that you are going to eliminate the deficit while lowering taxes for everyone,without cutting the military, medicare and social security. Or that you were an effective bipartisan governor of Massachusetts or that your medical reform provides for people with preexisting conditions when it does not or that your opponent took the work out of welfare. When did Romney pay his taxes? Did he use tax amnesty in 2009 to clean up his tax problems? Why does he keep his money offshore if he wants to be president of the USA? When and why did he pull his investments out of china? Was he or was he not the CEO of Bain Capital when he signed forms saying he was. Was he a citizen of Massachusetts when he ran for governor but paid taxes as a citizen of Utah? Does hunting once when you were 15 make you a lifetime hunter? When your adult son owns a gun does that make you a gun owner?

Medicare . . . and, now, choice. Mitt Romney’s trail of lies during the first Presidential debate was appalling enough. But, last week, my jaw nearly dropped to the floor when Mitt claimed he was unaware of any legislation he’d push for to limit access to abortion. Just who does Mitt Romney think he’s kidding? This is the man who pledged to pack the Supreme Court with justices who’d overturn Roe v. Wade — a decision he says marks one of the darkest moments in Supreme Court history. This is the man who has said he supports de-funding Planned Parenthood and ending insurance coverage for birth control. This is the man who won’t take a position on whether a fetus should be considered a person — essentially making abortion a criminal act. If that’s not frightening enough, there’s a line out the door of anti-choice Members of Congress who would jump at the chance to help Mitt obliterate a woman’s right to choose. In the Senate and the House, we have rooms full of men deciding what women can, and can’t, do with our bodies. Remember Georgetown Law School student Sandra Fluke’s grilling before an all-male panel of Senators? We need women in the room — women, like me, who have faced the painfully difficult decision of whether to have an abortion; women who know from personal experience that we will never have true equality if we don’t have reproductive rights. That’s why I’m working tirelessly to help elect more women to Congress. As Co-Chair of Women LEAD, I’m making sure women running in tight races across the country have the support they need to win. Why is this so important? Because right now, just 1 in 5 Members of Congress are women. That means that most of the policies made that affect women’s health care and our ability to access safe and legal abortion are made largely by men. On November 6th, we have an opportunity to change that. Mitt’s real views on women’s health care are so far out of the mainstream that he feels he needs to lie about them to get elected. But, remember, he has plenty of company in the Senate and the House."

No: it will be held inviolate by this people; and, as Joseph Smith said, ‘The time will come when the destiny of this nation will hang upon a single thread. At that critical juncture, this people will step forth and save it from the threatened destruction.’ It will be so” (Journal of Discourses, 7:15). Now another witness, John Taylor, third president of the Church: “When the people shall have torn to shreds the Constitution of the United States, the elders of Israel will be found holding it up to the nations of the earth, and proclaiming liberty and equal rights to all men, and extending the hand of fellowship to the oppressed of all nations” (The Gospel Kingdom, Deseret Book Co., 1943, p. 219). This is part of the program. A final witness is from George Q. Cannon, former member of the First Presidency, who said that “the day will come when the Constitution and free government under it will be sustained and preserved by this people” (Journal of Discourses, 23:104.) Now, I declare to you that if we are not in the beginning stages of the fulfillment of this prophecy, we are at least in the stages where we are preparing for its fulfillment.

"Sure, the managers have messed up big time, but the athletes haven't, and our job is to go to work for the athletes."
