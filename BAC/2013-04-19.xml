Even Al-Qaida is backing away from this recent string of man-made disasters, and they've claimed responsibility in the past for natural disasters like earthquakes and floods. No, it's becoming increasingly clear that these bombings and fires and explosions and shootings are the results of either human stupidity and incompetence, or of an inhuman new species of homegrown mongrel mutants. The products of toxic chemicals and toxic families and toxic environments, this pistoff horde of loners and losers has been neutered in one fashion or another by the systematic destruction of the social contract in this country, and it's made them both mean and insane. Behold the new zombies: undead and unafraid, blank-eyed and lusting after our balls instead of our brains, able to pass for a human at least part of the time, cyber-skilled and ready to harvest a dozen randomly selected scrotes in a flash when the urges overcome them. No, Al-Qaida KNOWS crazy, and they want nothing to do with this new American army. Unfortunately, my testicular piracy model predicts that this bad movie is about to get even worse, because another army is coming after the ball-smugglers: our government, hell-bent on exterminating the zombies at any cost (and remember, the zombies look a lot like we do). Tonight I'm flat out of things to laugh about; instead, I extend my deepest condolences and sympathies to the friends and loved ones of the deceased victims, and my sympathies, regrets, and wishes for speedy and full recoveries to all of the injured victims, their loved ones, and their friends.</Msg><Username>fish2kill</Username><Timestamp>1366348067470</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-19 01:07:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366349684592-3</Id><Topic><Title>Remember how nasa_rss was posting non stop about how BAC was going to earn 35 cents and surge to $13?</Title><Username>mytek3806</Username><Timestamp>1366347466797</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-19 00:57:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Because Boston bombers are whites?</Msg><Username>obamahusseins</Username><Timestamp>1366349684592</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-19 01:34:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366349738880-4</Id><Topic><Title>now gun shots at MIT</Title><Username>extrader</Username><Timestamp>1366340971592</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 23:09:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Civil war</Msg><Username>obamahusseins</Username><Timestamp>1366349738880</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-19 01:35:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366349882965-5</Id><Topic><Title>Oreilly bashed Obama, now what?

Some food for thought Another formula to see if this company would be considered a VALUE is this: (Profit margin + Forward ADR) / Profit Margin. Anything over 10 tells you the company is currently under valued. Meaning its selling on SALE.

The Air Farce then 'forgot' to mention and/or denied this trivial detail for 40 years, or 10 years past my initial diagnosis with herbicide-induced COPD.

First names /"Yo" worked fine with every one of those class actors, and it's most important to focus on the task at hand when the engines are running, armed birds are ready to launch, and you're screaming at a pilot to unbuckle and get the f out of the way so you can jump into his live ejection seat ("Ya big baby, fuggedabout the stinkin' seat pins!") and do an AIM-7 hot-tune.

Still, while I'm on the subject of drones, I just gotta ask: now that the real Thunderbirds are no longer flying (too expensive and not worth putting the lives of real pilots at risk), how long will tit thake the AF to put 4 or 5 Predators into Thunderbird livery and over our stadiums again?</Msg><Username>fish2kill</Username><Timestamp>1366399824457</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-19 15:30:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366400117637-151</Id><Title>OMG...YTRV --NEWS OUT</Title><Msg>HUGE</Msg><Username>alldsrt</Username><Timestamp>1366400117637</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-19 15:35:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366400563866-152</Id><Topic><Title>Bush served in the military, he served in the National Guard, Serving in the military is the opposite of being a draft dodger, seems like I am stating the obvious, but you have to stay the obvious with some of the people on this board.</Title><Username>ironbar_2</Username><Timestamp>1366386370105</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-19 11:46:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He was a pilot but when the national guard started testing pilots for drugs he stopped going.

At 11.50 that is only 435 million shares or 2.5 days volume, so hardly in perpetuity as you put it. They can keep it for a week or two unless they buy back is bigger and I missed that news, which I doubt. 435 million shares out of 10.82 billion is barely a dent about 4%. I am long, but make little out of this petty buy back. Now if it was 15 billion buy back, 12% of flat, you got something.

Bush sought entry into the officer corps of the Texas Air National Guard, which would minimize his chances of being dispatched to Vietnam. Despite scoring low on the entrance exam, Bush was accepted. The controversy over his military service has concentrated on whether his father, George Herbert Walker Bush who was a U.S. Congressman at the time, exerted influence to ensure his son obtained a 'soft' posting in the National Guard and whether he completed his duties sufficiently to justify his honorable discharge in 1973. "Bush signed a six-year "military service obligation," he was required to attend at least 44 inactive-duty training drills each fiscal year beginning July 1. But Bush's own records show that he fell short of that requirement, attending only 36 drills in the 1972-73 period, and only 12 in the 1973-74 period." [1] Bush was assigned serve at the Houston Air National Guard base between 1968 and 1973. Bush graduated from flight school in November 1969 and undertook a further six months training in the F-102 fighter-interceptor. Between June 1970 and April 1972 he flew frequently with his unit. However, in May 1972 he sought and gained approval to move to Alabama to work on the U.S. Senate campaign of Republican Party candidate, Winton Blount. While in Alabama Bush was obliged to continue his duties with another National Guard unit. After failing to have an annual physical examination Bush was removed from flight duty on August 1, 1972. Bush's military records reveal that he did not do any duty between April 16 and October 28, 1972 and missed training altogether in December 1972 and February and March 1973. There were no records of him having served with any unit in Alabama. It is a requirement of members of the National Guard that they accumulate a minimum of 50 service points in a year.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1366429455502</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-19 23:44:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366429584298-210</Id><Topic><Title>Bush served in the military, he served in the National Guard, Serving in the military is the opposite of being a draft dodger, seems like I am stating the obvious, but you have to stay the obvious with some of the people on this board.</Title><Username>ironbar_2</Username><Timestamp>1366386370105</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-19 11:46:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>On May 2, 1973 one of Bush's superiors noted that "Lt. Bush has not been observed at this unit during the period of report. A civilian occupation made it necessary for him to move to Montgomery, Alabama. He cleared this base on 15 May 1972 and has been performing equivalent training in a non-flying status with the 187th Tac Recon Gp, Dannelly ANG Base, Alabama." However, no records for service in Alabama exist.[2] Subsequently Bush spent 36 days in May, June and July 1973 on duty, accumulating 41 points. According to the Boston Globe, he was then awarded 15 'gratuitous' service points - enough to get him across the 50 service points threshold. His last service day was July 30, 1973 and - while originally due to serve through to November 1974 - was honourably discharged early to enable him to attend Harvard Business School. [3] Furthermore, a U.S. News analysis showed that "during the final two years of his obligation, Bush did not comply with Air Force regulations that impose a time limit on making up missed drills. What's more, he apparently never made up five months of drills he missed in 1972, contrary to assertions by the administration."</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1366429584298</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-19 23:46:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
