You diluted this board with all your #$%$ that I have to scroll to page 5 to fine some useful information. Now,I'm a new investor and looking for some comments or info on BAC. If you have anything worth mentioning great let's share. If not then go back to your mommy's basement, play with your Play Station or whatever you nerds like you do and get off this board. And if you don't, I'll tell your mommy that you're playing with matches.

From Fridays opening high area of ~$9.65 back to this level is ordinarily and impressive p/b, but for BAC, C (as it's been doing much the same) and the other Finny's it seems par for the course. The entire cohort moves under the control of Algo's and HFT's and all the rest that play the sector players either individually or via the more popular EFT's that really are the basis of all the roiling. But it is what it is. I'd say look for a test of the $9.10 area, which over the last 10 sessions or so has shaped up as a firm support level. Let's see how it plays out.

With the Co-Op network, a person has access to free ATM's nationwide. Also, I have found the interest rate on home loans and auto loans at numerous credit unions beat the interest rates for home loans and auto loans at BAC in Las Vegas, Nevada; San Diego, California; and Phoenix, Arizona. A word to the wise: Do not fall for dealer financing. I would never pay a double-digit interest rate for an auto loan. One can secure a better interest rateby finding his own financing at a local credit union. I found credit unions will take on more risk than a bank generally.</Msg><Username>oh_my_2012</Username><Timestamp>1349700229935</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 08:43:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349700346481-20</Id><Topic><Title>I will speak until someone pulls the plug on me.

Challenges the industry faces are unlikely to show any signs of abating, particularly the pressure on profit margins from low interest rates and increasing competition for loans. Wells Fargo &amp; Co. (WFC) Chief Financial Officer Timothy Sloan told investors at a conference in early September the bank's net interest margin, essentially the profit margin from lending and investing, could fall 17 basis points in the third quarter. Banks will likely continue to cut cost to improve profitability, but shareholders will want to see signs of sustainable growth. Barclays analyst Jason Goldberg said in a research report he expects third-quarter earnings per share "at the median bank to increase at a double-digit clip" from the third-quarter a year earlier, and by 2% from the second quarter. He expects modest loan growth, lower net-interest margins, mixed fee income, higher mortgage revenue and higher market-related revenues. Regional banks make most of their money with loans, and mortgages and business loans have been growing. That, along with cost cuts, will lift profits. But Stifel Nicolaus predicts earnings would grow 18% at large cap banks and only 7% for small caps because small banks are seeing increased competition for loans from bigger banks. Low interest rates have enticed more home owners to refinance their mortgages, and, along with government refinance programs, will add to mortgage-banking revenue at most banks. "Mortgage activity is running better than an already strong [second quarter]... and gain-on-sale margins reaching new historical highs," Citigroup analyst Keith Horowitz said in a research report. Capital markets matter most for the nations biggest banks like J.P.Morgan Chase &amp; Co. (JPM) and Citigroup Inc. (C), and revenue from underwriting and trading are expected to improve from a dire quarter a year ago when the debt rating of the U.S. government was downgraded and the struggle of European governments to find a solution for the euro zone's sovereign-debt crisis scared off investors. Equity-market volumes have remained soft, pushing stock trading revenue down, but securities underwriting and trading revenue from bonds, currencies and commodities -- the bigger part of capital markets -- are expected to be up. For the big banks, there is a downside to improving earnings because every quarter they have to take an accounting charge called debt or debit valuation adjustment when they do well and the price of their own bonds rises. "Expect sizeable DVA losses this quarter," Morgan Stanley analyst Betsy Graseck wrote in a report. COMPANIES TO WATCH: Bank of America (BAC)--Reports Oct. 17 Wall Street Expectations: Analysts expect the bank to report earnings of seven cents a share, though several have said a loss is possible due to one-time charges for litigation and other issues. Revenue is expected to be $22 billion. A year ago, Bank of America reported earnings of 56 cents a share on revenue of $28.5 billion. The shares are up 67.6% year-to-date and 23.8% since reporting the prior quarter's earnings on July 18. Key issues: On the last day of the quarter, Bank of America announced it was settling financial crisis-era litigation over its acquisition of Merrill Lynch. The $2.4 billion settlement, along with other charges for debt valuation adjustment and U.K. taxes, added up to a charge of 28 cents a share, when the prior consensus earnings estimate was 13 cents. (The consensus remains positive because items included in analyst estimates vary.) With a mixed backdrop on capital-markets activity and falling interest rates pressuring lending profits, expectations are not high. But continued expense reductions could help and improving credit quality could allow for a generous release from loan loss reserves, adding to earnings.</Msg><Username>highlowsel</Username><Timestamp>1349707569484</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 10:46:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349707693100-83</Id><Topic><Title>Seen this Alert?</Title><Username>debbrajaq602077</Username><Timestamp>1349704685192</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 09:58:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks for this guys!</Msg><Username>bates_anne556</Username><Timestamp>1349707693100</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 10:48:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349707793437-84</Id><Topic><Title>I'm right here, fish2kill</Title><Username>mrstan4089</Username><Timestamp>1349003242847</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-30 07:07:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>didn't get to reading this till now - ok - 5 stars for your time of service - an my mistake - I also never found the Pearl Of The Orient - in those rice paddies - from Da Nang to China Beach to Marble Mountain hero- nah - did have chicken dinners stopped more than once - with 122's or 140's hitting the bases - an scurring for cover - but for the most part - compared to allot - made it ok .!!!!</Msg><Username>da23533</Username><Timestamp>1349707793437</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 10:49:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349707916918-85</Id><Topic><Title>Seen this Alert?</Title><Username>debbrajaq602077</Username><Timestamp>1349704685192</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 09:58:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Great , i just subscribed!</Msg><Username>haynes_jeanette559</Username><Timestamp>1349707916918</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 10:51:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349707925678-86</Id><Topic><Title>GOING GREEN</Title><Username>ryanmilliron</Username><Timestamp>1349705073675</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 10:04:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It is likely as BAC started an up-leg in uptrend last Thursday and that is continuing.

Saefong, MarketWatch And while there are many factors that will influence oil in the months ahead, most of them point to the likelihood of prices falling to levels closer to $60 to $50 a barrel — or at least not making any sort of lasting impression at $100 in the fourth quarter. “Given the backdrop of slowing global demand and rising non-OPEC production, the odds are that Brent heads to below $100 as we get towards the end of the year, which will also pressure WTI to stay closer to $60 to $50,” said Kirk McDonald, senior research analyst at St. Louis-based Argent Capital Management. Overall, the selloff in West Texas crude oil has been “due to the converging bearish themes of lethargic economic data, lackluster oil demand and the continuing trend of rising domestic oil production,” said Smith. “Meanwhile, signs of slowing in China and a euro-debt crisis that rumbles on and on provide little reason to be bullish right now.” U.S. field production of oil has climbed to its highest level since 1996, according to Energy Information Administration data. Production is currently at more than 6.5 million barrels per day. See the EIA’s latest production data. “The renaissance in domestic production is real and can be attributed to improved exploration and production techniques as well as higher prices,” which enables the economic recovery of previously known reserves, said Michael Peterson, managing director of energy research at MLV &amp; Co. At the same time, “industry capital has rotated back to the U.S. en masse because there is no fear premium to operating,” with the U.S. and Canada the safest places to make large capital investments in projects, said Neal Ryan, managing partner at Ryan Oil &amp; Gas Partners LLC. The largest area of output growth among oil producers who are not part of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is North America, according to the EIA, which expects production there to increase by 1 million barrels per day in 2012. See the EIA’s Short-Term Energy Outlook Report from September. Oil should be “at the $60 to $50 level in the fourth quarter as long as Israel doesn’t employ a preemptive attack on Iran,” said Zahir. And, barring any specific supply-shock scenarios, Peterson said the likelihood of significantly higher WTI oil prices in 2012 is “limited” to less than 25%. When asked if $100 or $60 oil prices are more likely, Peterson replied: “$60 is more likely near-term,</Msg><Username>fairvalue23</Username><Timestamp>1349710366558</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 11:32:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349710413859-100</Id><Title>Oil $50: Pros analysts Oil at $50 Credit Suisse analysts Oil at $50</Title><Msg>Oil $50: Pros analysts Oil at $50 Credit Suisse analysts Oil at $50 --- the analysis argues that demand would fall along with trading activity and that any recovery would be “halting fragile and painfully slow.” The report points to the fall in oil prices witnessed in 2008, when Brent prices plunged from a record high level in the space of a few months.

President Obama may well celebrate a second term in Chicago next month, but the conventional wisdom underestimates the difficulty he faces, as his campaign has distinct problems with all three elements. His defense of his record is exceptionally weak, his effort to define Mitt Romney is nearly exhausted, and his vision for the next four years — perhaps the most important — has been largely missing from his effort this year. Defense of the incumbent’s record Four years ago, Obama expressed great confidence that he would be running amid renewed prosperity; he famously told Matt Lauer, “One nice thing about the situation I find myself in is that I will be held accountable. You know, I’ve got four years...If I don’t have this done in three years, then there’s going to be a one-term proposition.” In February 2009, even most Republicans would probably have predicted that by 2012, the country would be feeling much more prosperous, with much lower unemployment. Friday’s jobs report brought much-needed good news, with the 114,000 new jobs in the payroll survey meeting economists’ expectations and bringing unemployment down to 7.8% — but that was fueled by 582,000 part-time jobs. GDP growth is at a meager 1.3%, gasoline is averaging $3.78 per gallon nationally and the foreclosure rate is only slightly below 2011’s 17-year peak. Any fan of Obama who tells you he expected the country to be in this condition at this moment is either lying to you or lying to themselves. Still, Obama’s poll numbers have overcome the economic gloom for much of the year, because many Americans concluded he was doing the best he could after stepping into a bad situation. Probably the single most effective line of the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte was Bill Clinton’s declaration, “no President — not me, not any of my predecessors — no one could have fully repaired all the damage that he found in just four years.” It’s one thing to express a resigned acceptance about the state of the economy to a pollster months or weeks away from Election Day; it’s another to affirmatively embrace four more years of the same economic policies, and accept the risk of four more years of similar results, inside the voting booth. Paul Solman, the business and economics editor for PBS’s “NewsHour,” believes that the long-term unemployed — those who have stopped looking for a year or more, but say they want a job, a figure reaching about 7 million — should be included in the public definition of unemployed, as should the “discouraged workers,” those looking for work sometime in the past year but has stopped looking for work. JOBS6N_1_WEB Spencer Platt/Getty Images People looking for jobs speak with potential employers at the Brooklyn Job Fair. Throw in those working part-time who want full-time work and cannot find it, and our calculation of America’s “unemployed” booms from 12.1 million to an ungodly 27 million. As we approach the day of decision, Americans may look the scale of continuing economic pain and wonder if Clinton was right, that this is really the best anyone could reasonably expect. Defining the opposition For much of the year the Obama campaign excelled at this, perhaps better than any other incumbent presidential campaign before. But they and their SuperPAC allies may be victims of their own success in this area. By running ads painting such an unappealing, monstrous portrait of Romney — callous, uncaring, incompetent, selfish — they set the lowest of bars for the Republican nominee when he walked onto the debate stage Wednesday night. Once Romney came across as knowledgeable, clear and deeply concerned about the state of the country, the entire vilification campaign of summer and early fall looked shaky and less convincing. The man standing before the country didn’t match the Gordon-Gekko-meets-Thurston-Howell-III caricature at all. After this week’s debate, millions of Democrats were left wondering about the attack lines left unused by the President — why didn’t he mention Romney’s “47%” remark, or the layoffs at companies under Bain Capital or the years of tax returns that the GOP nominee hasn’t released? But Obama had two good reasons to hesitate. One of the factors helping Obama overcome the lousy economy is most Americans’ sense that he is a decent, likeable, good-natured man. Obama often wisely let allies and surrogates act as his most relentless attack dogs. It is one thing to attack a man in the now-ubiquitous, incessant form of television attack ads, with the scathing demonization tied to the aspiring national leader by only the rote declaration that “I approved this message”; it is another to do so to his face, with 60 million people watching. Another reason to hesitate — and something to watch for in the remaining Romney-Obama debates — is the risk that Romney might deftly refute the criticism by asking why an incumbent’s presidential campaign, during a time of war and economic pain, is so obsessed with tax returns from years ago. Negative attacks on Romney have taken Obama’s reelection hopes far, but they’ve probably taken him as far as they can go. Offering a compelling vision for the second term This is usually one of the most challenging aspects for an incumbent, because he needs some reasonable explanation as to why each big proposal or idea wasn’t achieved in the first term. There’s some evidence that this is Obama’s strongest area, when he chooses to flex those muscles; as Emily Ekins, the director of polling for the Reason Foundation, pointed out to me, in one survey Obama actually outscored Romney by 9% points on which candidate has “vision for a successful future.” The most uplifting portions of Obama’s speeches from about 2007 to about late 2009 were his descriptions of the America to come: one where every child is getting a quality education, where every college student can get a diploma without crushing debt and then step into a good job. By “asking” the wealthy to pay “a little bit more” — somehow the IRS never appears in these happy visions — a plethora of new “investments” keep America competitive in the global economy, and we zip along on high-speed rails and in fuel-efficient cars produced by General Motors, with a shiny infrastructure replacing perpetually-cited “crumbling roads and bridges.” Obama’s problem is that after four years on the job, that ideal America doesn’t seem any closer, and might even seem further away than in 2008. He also doesn’t talk about that vision as much as he used to. Some of that may be because the public — or perhaps even Obama himself — doubts he’ll be able to deliver much in the coming years. Obama’s first term can be neatly divided into two halves. The first, before the midterms, saw Obama passing a slew of big legislative initiatives: the stimulus, the Affordable Care Act, Dodd-Frank financial reform. But the public largely disliked or was indifferent to those proposals, generating the huge GOP comeback in the 2010 midterms. The second half of Obama’s term, dealing with a GOP-controlled House, showcased Washington stuck in neutral, unable to push policy to the left or right. A persistent cliché is that Americans like divided government, but that theory applied better during the peace and prosperity from 1994 to 2000 under President Clinton and a GOP Congress. When the country is at war and struggling, the arguments of a divided Washington sound like the grinding of gears. Barring some dramatic change in the outlook for (often-gerrymandered) House races, Obama will still be dealing with Speaker John Boehner in January 2013. Obama has suggested that his reelection could “pop the blister” of partisan passions in Washington, but that theory envisions Republicans capitulating and accepting tax increases, an immigration bill they deem amnesty, and so on. So the choice before Americans is a rerun of the gridlock of the past two years, or something different — a Republican-controlled Washington, but with a President Romney whose record, demeanor and style is quite different from that of George W. Bush. None of this means that the task remaining before Romney isn’t difficult. But for most of this general election, the race featured an incumbent and a poorly-defined caricature. The debates demonstrated that no one can make the case for a candidate better than the candidate himself — not the SuperPACs, not the national party, not the surrogates nor the running mate. Only Romney himself could look the voters in the eye and demonstrate that he had the knowledge, the composure, the deftness and the concern they wanted to see. Romney’s message was simple but resonant — if we can get more Americans in jobs, we’ll see dramatic improvement in our budgetary, debt and social conditions. If, by Nov. 6, Americans conclude they believe Romney can deliver on that vision, then the conventional wisdom of just a few weeks ago may prove spectacularly wrong. Romney may not just win, he may win handily.</Msg><Username>fdr_fdr_fdr_fdr</Username><Timestamp>1349717945869</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 13:39:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349717985025-133</Id><Topic><Title>5 Romney Boys to Join the Military to Serve our Country?</Title><Username>jbhdallas2000</Username><Timestamp>1349717664893</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 13:34:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Are you on drugs??

Again, you want to focus on somewhat longer-term trends, not monthly numbers. Over the past year the employer survey says that we’ve added 1.8 million jobs, or 150,000 a month: And this number is likely to be revised up. This is substantially more than the number of jobs we need to keep up with population growth, which is currently something like 90,000 a month. (The number used to be higher, but baby boomers are getting old — the same thing that affects the household survey.) So the two survey are saying the same thing: job growth fast enough to make gradual progress on the employment front. Not fast enough; it will take years to restore full employment, and we should, um, end this depression now. But the progress is real.

Sounds nefarious. Not quite. No money from the "Trust Fund" was withdrawn. By reducing rates paid to hospitals, health insurance plans, and other medical providers (not physicians, by the way -- a mistake being made by media all over the place), the "draw" out of the fund is reduced by $716 billion between federal fiscal years 2013-22 (it was $449 billion between 2010-19 when the ACA was signed in March 2010). If the ACA is implemented as passed, then $716B less will be withdrawn over those ten years, meaning the Medicare Trust Fund will have about eight more years of solvency than if the ACA had not been signed into law.

He is wrong and Romney is correct. Doctors are dropping Medicare patients left and right because of the reductions in payments. This will continue. Obama is pushing granny over the cliff in her wheelchair, thinking that he he will somehow save her by doing so. If Krugman were capable of growing a brain (he is not), he might learn a thing or two about fundamental market dynamics and the impact on human behavior. Unfortunately, he is no more than a trumpeter for the stupid, the intellectually lazy, the incompetent. Use him as much as you want.

No body took any money out of the medicare accounts all they did was reduce expenses. If you want to compare it to home finances it is more like you got the grocery store to charge you less because you buy so much and then can use the surplus to eat out more, Not that you only pay 75% of the bill unilaterally.

According to an analysis by the Tax Foundation, from 2002 to 2006 the average rate of state and local taxes in Massachusetts rose from 9.6 percent to 10.2 percent (compared to the national rate, which rose from 9.5 percent to 9.7 percent). Romney later said, while campaigning for the presidency, "we didn’t just slow the rate of growth of our government, we actually cut it." However, by most measures, state government spending increased in Massachusetts during Romney's governorship. Job growth in Massachusetts rose at a rate of 1.5 percent (compared to the national average of 5.3 percent), placing Massachusetts 47th of the 50 states in new job creation over the course of Romney’s term. Massachusetts experienced one of the highest levels of net out-migration of any state during Romney's term. Romneys health care plan depended on federal subsidies. The state of Massachusetts raised $500 million in new revenue during Romney’s first year in office from fees, more than any other state surveyed. Romney proposed 33 new fees along with increases in 57 existing fees, resulting in higher costs for birth certificates, new car purchases, driver’s learning permits, firearms permits, professional licenses, and billboards advertising, as well as for many state services. He also increased a state gasoline fee originally intended for cleanup of contamination around underground fuel storage tanks. The two cents per gallon increase made for a total effective state gasoline tax of 23.5 cents per gallon, generating about $60 million per year in additional revenue (surpluses of $40 million over the costs of the cleanup program).[3] Opponents said many of the fees posed a hardship on those who could least afford them, such as fees for the state to provide certification of blindness and a photo identification card for the blind.[35] The proposal also called for a $50 fee for tuberculosis tests and a $400 fee for those who tested positive (the tuberculosis fees were rejected by the legislature).</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1349738507331</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 19:21:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349738532632-285</Id><Title>Obama admits to Hollywood: Can't keep up the act every day...</Title><Msg>OBAMA: Everybody here is, eh, incredible professionals.

Colleagues at work or political staffers are there to do a job, not to bond. “Mitt is always the star,” said one Massachusetts Republican. “And everybody else is a bit player.” He has little patience for idle chatter or small talk, little interest in mingling at cocktail parties, at social functions, or even in the crowded hallway. He is not fed by, and does not crave, casual social interaction, often displaying little desire to know who people are and what makes them tick. “He wasn’t overly interested in people’s personal details or their kids or spouses or team building or their career path,” said another former aide. “It was all very friendly but not very deep.” Or, as one fellow Republican put it, “He has that invisible wall between ‘me’ and ‘you.’” Referring to the time later when Romney was governor of Massachusetts, a Democratic lawmaker recalls, “You remember Richard Nixon and the imperial presidency? Well, this was the imperial governor.” There were the ropes that often curtailed access to Romney and his chambers. The elevator settings restricted access to his office. The tape on the floor told people exactly where to stand during events. This was the controlled environment that Romney created. His orbit was his own. “We always would talk about how, among the legislators, he had no idea what our names were—none,” the lawmaker said, “because he was so far removed from the day-to-day operations of state government.” Vanity fair</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1349752785534</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 23:19:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349752865665-345</Id><Title>Stop buying GAS at these prices</Title><Msg>And START BUYING AMMO before the prices go UP!</Msg><Username>obamistan</Username><Timestamp>1349752865665</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 23:21:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349753192576-346</Id><Topic><Title>Mitt the ....Man?</Title><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1349752785534</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 23:19:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I gotta hand it to you traitor, you are a real dedicated alinski-ite.
