I don't think I believe him. He was very specific about all of the sub-groups of the 47% he wrote off. He was even very specific about the percent of all of those people that he wrote off. If he "didn't mean it," then why say it at a $50,000 per plate dinner? Will he now say," I'm sorry you paid $50,000 to hear me say something I did not mean?"

It says he'll cut tax rates 20%. That is 5 trillion over 10 years. He denied that in the debate. He thinks he can create 12 million jobs but he doesn't say over what time period or how. Obama has created over 5 million in 3 years and started out WITHOUT 30 straight months of employment growth but with 850,000 jobs a month being lost. Unemployment for college grads over 25 is 4.1%. Total unemployment is 7.8% and dropping. Romney's campaign flyer repeats the same debunked lies about taking work out of welfare and taking 716 million out of medicare. Neither of which Obama did. No money has been taken out of Medicare. Payments were reduced to providers that much. That is cost reduction. Increase funding to education. Pass health care on the the states as an unfunded mandate to create Obama care in every state. No details. Tell me how the states can afford that. Most of the other things he promises Obama has already done like: Increase ties in latin America. Open new markets, curtail unfair trade practices of china, consolidate agencies, increase energy production. Don't give me a song and dance about oil from federal lands being better than oil from private lands or that producers are going to switch areas just because they have more public oil land leases. We are in an oil boom and rig use is way up and oil companies have millions of acres of unexplored public land under lease already. How many capped wells do you think are sitting in the gulf waiting to be put in to production? Goes on to call for globalization creating a "Reagan economic zone" (NAFTA) Go back to dirty energy (there is no such thing as clean coal) while companies are switching to natural gas because it is cheaper, cleaner and more plentiful not because of any regulations Obama has put on the coal industry. Cap spending at 20% of GDP (curtailing spending has the same effect on the economy as increasing taxes, it takes money out of circulation) It says he will "immediately" cut government by 5%. In the debate he said he would do that by attrition not immediatley. I suppose he could do that by letting the fiscal cliff programs go in to effect. whether he does it or lets the sequestering do it the effect is the same. Of course he is also going to spend another two trillion on the military that no one knows where it will come from. What does this guy really think he is going to do and how does he think he is going to do it? The president isn't a King you know, and he says he will do it all without raising taxes. If you believe all that you believe in Santa Claus and the tooth fairy. Face reality. Romney is just a snake oil salesman. All he has to offer is a return to the trickle down policies that already failed.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1349502079940</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 01:41:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349517761215-11</Id><Topic><Title>Mitt Romney invited Taiwan/China to invest in Bain Capital in 1984 to exchange to pressure US Corp. to outsource jobs to China!</Title><Username>savvy_investor123</Username><Timestamp>1349500660517</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 01:17:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>To invest in bain capital...do you know how stupid that sounds...ilmfao...you running your own stupid pack lie...well that's #1 on the stupid list....if you'd grow up in southern ohio we teached you not to lie...ilmfao f--kin faget,,</Msg><Username>milesed18</Username><Timestamp>1349517761215</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 06:02:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349517761234-12</Id><Topic><Title>Mitt Romney invited Taiwan/China to invest in Bain Capital in 1984 to exchange to pressure US Corp. to outsource jobs to China!</Title><Username>savvy_investor123</Username><Timestamp>1349500660517</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 01:17:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>To invest in bain capital...do you know how stupid that sounds...ilmfao...you running your own stupid pack lie...well that's #1 on the stupid list....if you'd grow up in southern ohio we teached you not to lie...ilmfao f--kin faget,,</Msg><Username>milesed18</Username><Timestamp>1349517761234</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 06:02:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349518803985-13</Id><Topic><Title>Romney now leads in Florida, Virginia and one poll has him up in Ohio!!</Title><Username>obama_sucksass</Username><Timestamp>1349465150259</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 15:25:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Romney up in "all swing state" american can't stand 4 more years of the jigger from chic-ago..known as bath house baracko...the gay blade...ilmfao</Msg><Username>milesed18</Username><Timestamp>1349518803985</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 06:20:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349518804042-14</Id><Topic><Title>Romney now leads in Florida, Virginia and one poll has him up in Ohio!!</Title><Username>obama_sucksass</Username><Timestamp>1349465150259</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 15:25:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Romney up in "all swing state" american can't stand 4 more years of the jigger from chic-ago..known as bath house baracko...the gay blade...ilmfao</Msg><Username>milesed18</Username><Timestamp>1349518804042</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 06:20:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349518804355-15</Id><Topic><Title>Romney now leads in Florida, Virginia and one poll has him up in Ohio!!</Title><Username>obama_sucksass</Username><Timestamp>1349465150259</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 15:25:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Romney up in "all swing state" american can't stand 4 more years of the jigger from chic-ago..known as bath house baracko...the gay blade...ilmfao</Msg><Username>milesed18</Username><Timestamp>1349518804355</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 06:20:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349519827209-16</Id><Title>WHERE IS THE OBAMA GIRL...SHE TOLD FOX NEWS THAT SHE WASN'T GOING TO VOTE FOR THE LYING CHIC-AGO JIGGER...</Title><Msg>The best thing obama had saw throuht the socialist lying...</Msg><Username>milesed18</Username><Timestamp>1349519827209</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 06:37:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349519827223-17</Id><Title>WHERE IS THE OBAMA GIRL...SHE TOLD FOX NEWS THAT SHE WASN'T GOING TO VOTE FOR THE LYING CHIC-AGO JIGGER...</Title><Msg>The best thing obama had saw throuht the socialist lying...</Msg><Username>milesed18</Username><Timestamp>1349519827223</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 06:37:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349519827228-18</Id><Title>WHERE IS THE OBAMA GIRL...SHE TOLD FOX NEWS THAT SHE WASN'T GOING TO VOTE FOR THE LYING CHIC-AGO JIGGER...</Title><Msg>The best thing obama had saw throuht the socialist lying...</Msg><Username>milesed18</Username><Timestamp>1349519827228</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 06:37:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349521768796-19</Id><Title>NEW POLL GALLUP.

The F-22 is an overpriced, under-performing dog. The official price is given as $143 million per copy; in truth, it is something north of $500 million. It has failed to deliver on most of its alleged performance advantages (stealth, maneuverability, supersonic cruise); it can be detected at long range by ground radars (though it IS pretty hard to detect with airborne radars), can pull about 9 positive Gs (though pilots can only tolerate that much for a couple of seconds, and the F-14 could pull +7.5 Gs), and can't carry enough fuel for sustained supersonic cruise). A little history lesson regarding US fighter aircraft might be in order. 9/10s of the competition to place a front-line fighter into the inventory is political, not technical. The Air Force and Navy never wanted to share a common top-tier fighter; the McDonnell-Douglas F-4 Phantom upset that political order by being so good in so many varying roles that after the Navy demonstrated its capabilities, Congress killed the Air Force's vaunted 'Century Series' of fighters and shoved the F-4 up their tailpipe. Later, the Air Force marshaled their political clout, won their case for the McDonnell-Douglas F-15 Eagle, and avoided getting 'stuck' with the Navy's vastly superior Grumman F-14 Tomcat. The Tomcat was so feared that it could ground an enemy's air force just by turning its radar on. Mounting the radar transmitter from it onto an F-16 would have turned the Falcon into a potent aerial threat suppressor, even if it lacked a radar receiver or missile system. Just turn the system on, keep the opposition on the ground, and send in the Tomahawks, Nighthawks and Raptors to kill them in their hangars and revetments. This time around, Lockheed sold Congress (or should I say 'bought Congress?") on the "Joint Strike Fighter" concept: two variants of a single airframe. For a fraction of the money spent on the program, a far better solution and cheaper solution would have been to upgrade the F-14 with modern avionics, stealth technology, and engines. The biggest problem with that solution is that it would have been too cheap. The primary interest of Congress is in making sure huge piles of high-technology welfare money lands in their districts. Before you dismiss my comments as uninformed opinion, note that I am a former F-4 radar weapons systems technician (Westinghouse AN/APQ-100/-109 radar) with extensive front-line combat mission support experience, and was also a [civilian] Certified Instructor for the F-14's Hughes AWG-9 radar weapons systems. Some of my Air Force friends also went on to support the radar weapons systems of the F-15 Strike Eagle and F-16 Falcon, and to a man, we agree that the Joint Strike Fighter is political boon-doggery at its finest, but a massive disappointment in terms of cost, performance and reliability. ROTFLMAO the stealthiest thing on an F-22 or F-35 is the truth.</Msg><Username>fish2kill</Username><Timestamp>1349525638597</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 08:13:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349526001505-23</Id><Topic><Title>It is true Obama was on the golf course when the drone was given to the Iranians</Title><Username>kilgares</Username><Timestamp>1323782518000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2011-12-13 08:21:58 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>LOL funny you should bring up a golf course in this discussion, kilgares,because you couldn't tell an air superiority fighter from a hole in the ground.

During the one sided debate, Romney kept bringing up the jobs numbers as the main reason one should give him their vote. I believe the jobs numbers yesterday (especially if followed by better ones just prior to the election), will assure an Obama win. Even though I believe the numbers were bogus, the stupid public can't differentiate between what's true and what's false. Most of them don't know about "lies, damn lies, and statistics." After all, 1/2 of the population have an I.Q. under 100. That, in conjunction with a Press that is bound and determined to get Obama elected, does not bode well for Romney's chances.

The worst of the worst are still the oil companies: always deep expressions of regret from them that the price of gasoline remains so "stubbornly high", and always more lies about the reasons why their best efforts can't seem to bring it down: not enough crude, refineries switching their seasonal blend for gasoline, weather-related refinery and distribution system damage, refinery maintenance and upgrades, and so forth. All of these are either untrue, or easily foreseeable and fixable, or both. The reason gasoline prices are soaring is that the oil companies maintain their stranglehold on its supply, and therefore on consumers, with their contrived 'refinery problems'. They whine about evil EPA regulations that have prevented them from building new refineries (a handy fig-leaf that disguises their delight at a ready excuse not to increase refining capacity), weather-related damage, shortages of crude (especially that buzzword subset of crude, "domestic crude") yada-yada-yada, high world-market crude prices, etc. The 'problems' could be cured by coupling their federal subsidies with mandatory increases in refining capacity. Right now, they're sitting on a goldmine: refine the crude, whether domestic or imported; sell the refined products overseas at even higher prices than they could command on the domestic market; and then claim they aren't getting enough domestic crude.

I was also shocked at the 9.65 level. That was the open I believe when it raced above 10 last month. My thoughts are a lot of profit taking and those who bought last september bailed. Also there is huge cost to shorts/call writers if this gets above 10. They are F ' d if that happens. I thought closing above the 1460 on the S&amp;P was going to open the flood gates for buyers. We held it but I believe we continue to go up from here. I trade the options so I am not investor long term. Just really really confused by this move Friday.

"I didn't mean it." "I care about everybody 100%." Anybody buy that?

(AP) — Georgia Rep. Paul Broun said in videotaped remarks that evolution, embryology and the Big Bang theory are "lies straight from the pit of hell" meant to convince people that they do not need a savior. The Republican lawmaker made those comments during a speech Sept. 27 at a sportsman's banquet at Liberty Baptist Church in Hartwell. Broun, a medical doctor, is running for re-election in November unopposed by Democrats. "God's word is true," Broun said, according to a video posted on the church's website. "I've come to understand that. All that stuff I was taught about evolution and embryology and Big Bang theory, all that is lies straight from the pit of hell. And it's lies to try to keep me and all the folks who are taught that from understanding that they need a savior." Broun also said that he believes the Earth is about 9,000 years old and that it was made in six days. Those beliefs are held by fundamentalist Christians who believe the creation accounts in the Bible to be literally true.

Please read the following and begin to use the new terms defined: "About 400 new words were added to the 12th edition of the Oxford Concise Dictionary, reflecting the ever-changing nature of the English language. The words added are all now in common usage, but may or may not last to the next edition (remember cassette player? it's so old-fashioned, it's not in this dictionary). Some of the words are well-known to those who follow the news, such as sexting (sending sexual text messages or pictures) and cyberbullying (harassment over the Internet). Others are a bit specialized, such as noob (properly spelled n00b, a shortened form of "newbie" or somebody who's new to a game or forum; usually used in a derogatory sense). The Oxford Concise Dictionary is a much shortened form of the Oxford English Dictionary, which stands as the self-proclaimed exhaustive dictionary of the English language with 600,000 words. The Concise dictionary has "only" 240,000 entries and tries to eliminate words no longer in current usage. In this edition, words that were shown the linguistic door included S-VHS, script kiddie, and brabble (a noisy quarrel). Words that were welcomed include the following: Retweeting: resending somebody's tweet using Twitter Mankini: a one- piece bathing suit for men, with a T-back (think Borat) Jeggings: tight trousers for women that look like denim jeans. Woot: (typically spelled "w00t") an on-line way to say "hooray," typically in a celebratory manner ("w00t! I fragged your n00b butt!") Upcycle: to recycle into something worth more that the original. Masonberry - More common vernacular currently in use - previously "Dingleberry". din·gle·ber·ry (dnggl-br) n. Vulgar Slang 1. A piece of dried feces caught in the hair around the #$%$. 2. An incompetent, foolish, or stupid person. Warrenberry - See above definition of Masonberry. Stanberry - Also see above definition of Masonberry." Later...

Finance)</Title><Msg>Officials reject conspiracies on unemployment rate By CHRISTOPHER S. RUGABER and SCOTT MAYEROWITZ | Associated Press WASHINGTON (AP) — When conspiracists suggested Friday that the Obama administration had engineered a sharp drop in unemployment to aid President Barack Obama's re-election, the response was swift. Career government officials, economists and even some Mitt Romney supporters issued a collective sigh. The staffers who compute the U.S. unemployment rate work in an agency of the Labor Department. Officials who have overseen the work say it's prepared under tight security with no White House input or supervision. "To think that these numbers could be manipulated. ... It's impossible to do it and get away with it," said Keith Hall, a former commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the agency that calculates the unemployment rate. "These numbers are very trustworthy," said Hall, who was appointed by President George W. Bush and whose four-year term ended in January. The figures that produce the unemployment rate are crunched by several dozen people at the bureau. The only BLS employee appointed by the White House is the commissioner, who operates independently of the White House. The job is now vacant but is being handled by Acting Commissioner John Galvin, who has worked at the BLS for 34 years. Yet conspiracy theorists came out in force Friday after the government reported a sudden drop in unemployment a month before Election Day — to 7.8 percent for September from 8.1 percent in August. Their message: The Obama administration would do anything to ensure a November victory, including manipulating unemployment data. Labor Department officials, joined by Democrats and some Republicans, called the charges implausible. That didn't stop the chatter. The allegations were a measure of how politicized the monthly unemployment report has become near the end of a campaign that's focused on the economy and jobs. The conspiracy erupted after former General Electric CEO Jack Welch, a Republican, tweeted his skepticism five minutes after the BLS announced the unemployment rate at 8:30 a.m. Eastern time. "Unbelievable jobs numbers..these Chicago guys will do anything..can't debate so change numbers," Welch tweeted, referring to the site of the Obama campaign headquarters. The drop in unemployment was announced two days after Obama's lackluster performance in his first debate with Romney. Republican Rep. Allen West of Florida soon announced via Facebook that he agreed with Welch. "Somehow by manipulation of data we are all of a sudden below 8 percent unemployment, a month from the presidential election," West wrote. "This is Orwellian to say the least." The Obama administration was forced to defend Labor's statisticians and economists against accusations that came without supporting evidence. "No serious person ... would make claims like that," said Alan Krueger, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers. The monthly jobs report is prepared with raw data collected by Census workers. The workers interview Americans in about 60,000 households or visit them door-to-door. People are asked whether they're employed and, if so, whether their jobs are full or part time. The Census workers gather other information about the respondents' education, age and gender and ask whether they're self-employed. Most of the interviews are done in the week that includes the 19th day of the month. The resulting pile of data is transferred securely by Census to BLS about a week before the jobs report is due. The office suites where the report is prepared and compiled goes on lockdown. Employees can't access the area without a hard pass. Staffers working on a paper copy of the report are expected to keep it under lock and key if they aren't at their desk — even when they go to lunch. The security isn't just about keeping the data free of political pressure. The unemployment figures, if leaked early, could improperly move financial markets. Tom Nardone, a 36-year veteran of the BLS, oversees the report's preparation. The goal, Nardone said, is to make the report as accurate and "apolitical" as possible. "We strive to be like Joe Friday, just presenting the facts," he said. A draft of the report is completed by early Wednesday before the Friday when it's released. Several groups of staffers review it. That Wednesday is usually the earliest that the commissioner of the BLS gets involved. On Thursday afternoon, the report is sent to the White House's Council of Economic Advisors. Krueger provides a copy to the president. Hilda Solis, Obama's labor secretary, doesn't see the report until around 8 a.m. Friday, a half-hour before its public release. A week later, Labor releases the raw data on its website. Many academics use the data, which is stripped of all identifying information, for their own research. The commissioner is the BLS' only political appointee. And even he or she operates independently of the presidential administration. The Obama administration has selected a new commissioner: Erica Groshen, a vice president at the New York Federal Reserve. She has yet to be approved by the Senate. On Friday, Romney refrained from discrediting the government data. But plenty of conservatives did that work for him. Conn Carroll, an editorial writer at the Washington Examiner, tweeted: "I don't think BLS cooked numbers. I think a bunch of Dems lied about getting jobs. That would have same effect." Rick Manning, communications director of Americans for Limited Government and a former public affairs chief of staff at the Labor Department, said "anyone who takes this unemployment report serious is either naive or a paid Obama campaign adviser." Rep. Paul Broun, a Georgia Republican, weighed in with a statement saying the report "raises questions for me, and frankly it should be raising eyebrows for people across the country." Conspiracy theories are nothing new for Obama. He has been dogged by discredited claims that he wasn't born in this country and that he is Muslim. On Friday, one leading Republican sided with Obama's team in rejecting the latest accusations. "Stop with the dumb conspiracy theories. Good grief," Tony Fratto, a strategist who was a top communications official in the Bush White House, tweeted.</Msg><Username>dawg_earl</Username><Timestamp>1349564866401</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 19:07:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349566143952-179</Id><Title>REPUCANS ARE FUNNY - THEY LEFT OBAMA WITH A BIG POOP</Title><Msg>and they have audacity to complain that he is not cleaning up their mess fast enough.

The difference is Bush managed the crisis and he handled the job. Obama hasn't. BTW, the only war we are not able to win is the one the Democrats were in favor of. Afghanistan! Another dose of reality, the Clinton surplus the liberals brag about came from that improperly managed tech bubble, that was allowed to careen out control. Combined with off the books borrowing from Social Security, and the neglect and failure to make appropriate expenditures to counter the increasing incidents of terror perpetrated by Al-Qaeda around the world. In other words, it never really existed except on paper. And, how do you have a surplus while you are still running up the National Debt as Clinton was? Bush, upon entering office, immediately called for investigations into Fannie and Freddie that were held up in committee or filibustered at very turn by Democrats and a handful RINOs. Bush continued to call for and urge congress to investigate these GSE’s throughout his entire presidency. No action was taken. Those investigations had the potential to expose the whole mortgage back security scam before it became critical. Thank Barney Frank, Barack Obama and Chris Dodd for leading the opposition to those requested investigations. Bush never had a super majority in congress as Obama was privileged to have for two years, and wasted on the ideological legislation of Obamacare, rather than on fixing the economy. While Obama sat on his hands waiting for Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi to push though his health care nightmare, the economy continued to fall deeper and deeper into despair. Spending reeled out of control with government sinking it’s tentacles deep into the private sector arena with business choking regulations and bailouts for campaign donors of Obama. Had Obama put aside his ideological nonsense and focused on a private sector based recovery plan we would not still be in this dire recession. This is Obama's mess, in all this time as president he and his party still refuse to take responsibility, and he continues to blame everything under the sun but himself. Yet Democrats blame Bush for everything that transpired in his first nine months. Double standard idiocy! Obama is no leader! Obama is without one original cogent idea! Obama has damage hundreds of thousands of families beyond repair. He's just a sniveling whiner! And now he wants to sue the banks! What a feeble ideologically blinded mind this president has! The fact that the Clinton staff vandalized the White House and government computers and offices, and dumped and scrambled files, before leaving tells you the juvenile mind set of that administration. And Bill Clinton used the full power of the oval office and the presidency to pressure a young fat intern into being his human humidor at the expense of the entire country. A despicable self-absorbed old pervert by any measure. I have no respect for this man nor anyone who does.</Msg><Username>carburetorkid</Username><Timestamp>1349569185459</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 20:19:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349569612459-181</Id><Topic><Title>"Officials reject conspiracies on unemployment rate" (from Yahoo!

No. You have restored something you already had, right? So you have to look at "net" gain and do the plus minus with jobs lost and jobs regained. Are you still with me, Libs? Good, so the REAL jobs number is less than one tenth of the ridiculous number Obama and his minions are trumpeting. But it is still worse than that, because if you look at the QUALITY of jobs that are coming back, they pay WAY LESS than the jobs we lost. If you used to make 80K a year, and are out of work for 6 months and then have take a job paying 40K a year are you happy? I don't think so. Oh but you are counted as a great success story by Obama, so turn that frown upside down cuz Obama sez Happy days are here again! Democrats need to get off the "GOP LIES" chant because nothing compares to this mega-whopper that Obama crows about every friggin day. And for the 23 million unemployed, hearing this bullsh-- every day has got to be salt in the wound. Obama has abandoned the unemployed to push Obamacare and Green Energy and is using statistical fakery to back the biggest LIE of the 2012 campaign.</Msg><Username>the_power_inyou</Username><Timestamp>1349576999626</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 22:29:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349577842763-204</Id><Title>NOVEMBER 6, IS COMING..THE TRUTH SHALL BE REVEALED...ILMFAO</Title><Msg>THE TRUTH IS ...ROMNEY/AMERICA 1 OBAMA/muslim brotherhood-0</Msg><Username>milesed18</Username><Timestamp>1349577842763</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 22:44:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349577842794-205</Id><Title>NOVEMBER 6, IS COMING..THE TRUTH SHALL BE REVEALED...ILMFAO</Title><Msg>THE TRUTH IS ...ROMNEY/AMERICA 1 OBAMA/muslim brotherhood-0</Msg><Username>milesed18</Username><Timestamp>1349577842794</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 22:44:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349578239157-206</Id><Topic><Title>Why I will NEVER vote Obama ?</Title><Username>kingofvietnam</Username><Timestamp>1349575673247</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 22:07:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama is a #$%$'er.</Msg><Username>nasa_rs</Username><Timestamp>1349578239157</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 22:50:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349578870040-207</Id><Topic><Title>LOL unemp down?

They wasted a lot of valuable time thinking that good times will come back. They will not and as Dodd &amp; Frank gets implemented, it's only going to become more obvious that the old profitability levels are gone for good. BAC must reduce headcounts and cut compensation more aggressively than they have been doing so far. Reduce costs and use that money to increase dividends and do buybacks. The sooner they do this the better off the bank will be.</Msg><Username>sm081969</Username><Timestamp>1349579110087</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 23:05:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349580502962-210</Id><Title>So many of SW's Rectal Drip Aliases refer to the Jobs Report as "cooked books."</Title><Msg>Why is it that so many of the SW rectal drip aliases posting about the drop in unemployment numbers refer to the report as "cooked books."

That's funny. Obama spent almost a trillion dollars on tax breaks for green energy firms and half of them are now bankrupt.

Me thinks you may have "multiple personality disorder", SW... you may want to get yourself checked out by a qualified health care professional soon. In order for to be taken seriously, SW, you need to answer a few questions, otherwise everything you post will be taken as nonsense: How long have you been pretending to be a veteran? (You know, your "kingofvietnam" id...) Is that why your kweer life partner left you? Did he notice your fudge chute was always full of Masonberry jam? How many browsers you got open? How many trousers you got open? How many of your ids are currently signed in to yahoo at this moment? How many of those ids are you using to converse with yourself? How do you spell "loser""? How many times a day does dumpobamie lick the splurt off of your face? How much do you enjoy licking my crack? And...what's the difference between a "bung diving crack licker" and a "skinflute player"? And finally, given all the above, how can ANYTHING you post ANYWHERE be taken seriously, SW? LMFAO Later...
