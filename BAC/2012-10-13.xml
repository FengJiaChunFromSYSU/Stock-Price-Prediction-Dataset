I am independent but you are correct in saying there will be no jobs if Obama is re-elected. It is not just Romney supporters, but there is no incentive to expand and hire when you know the fruits of your labor will be taxed to hell and back. Also, the uncertainty of the repercussions of Obamacare have businesses and prospective employers in limbo, wondering how much more it will cost them to provide insurance to employees. Yes, you are correct in saying there will be no jobs as long as Obama is president. Success should be rewared and not penalized.

PETERSBURG -- There are two million Hispanic voters in Florida. It's a constituency that has the power to shift a tight election, so both political parties have tried to sway the Hispanic vote their way. President Barack Obama has held a comfortable lead with Hispanics. But now there has been a significant shift in the polls. An exclusive Tampa Bay Times/Bay News 9 statewide poll shows many Hispanic voters dropping their support for Obama. Last month, 52 percent of Hispanic voters polled said they would vote for the president. That has now dropped to 44 percent. Romney picked up some ground among Hispanics, from 43 percent to 46 percent. And the number of undecided Hispanic voters has doubled from 5 to 10 percent.</Msg><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1350141730448</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-13 11:22:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350141756935-60</Id><Topic><Title>Romney supporters threaten "we won't create any jobs" if the President is re-elected!</Title><Username>andym_30054</Username><Timestamp>1350136005129</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-13 09:46:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Agree....that is my point exactly.

It is stupid to think that employee won't get hired simply because an extra 5-10% of the profit will be taxed, and if that employee wasn't hired it must mean hiring said employee would not have been that profitable in the first place.

Our most prosperous years were when we had higher tax rates than we do now. Your silly assumptions about sky high taxes are ill conceived and untrue. Present tax rates could easily be raised on the top earners with no disincentive to investment. Romney even plans to increase taxes. He just chooses to do it by deceit and fees, closing "loopholes" . The bottom line is there will be no faster recovery without more revenue being brought in and both parties intend to get more from one segment of society or the other. Romney and Ryan plan to pass the costs on to individuals and states to cut federal costs with more unfunded mandates higher personal costs for medical care and reductions in social security benefits in the future. Romney and Ryan have also stated they do not expect to have a balanced budget in the next 8 years. Obama has been increasing jobs for 40 months, has cut medical costs, and preserved medicare and social security in the short term and with the slightest cooperation from the GOP could solve both of those problems. Businesses are reaping record profits and the wealthy are increasing their share of the take by unfair tax rates that benefit investment and ownership over labor short changing the middle class working man.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1350141928580</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-13 11:25:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350142176127-63</Id><Title>The ultimate job creator is the customer</Title><Msg>Why do you think we court China and India?

(1) Farmers aren't about to "rest their fields" with current very high grain prices. As a matter of fact, they're bidding for tillable pasture land to put even marginal land into crop production. (2) On a per-capita basis, farmers have perhaps been the largest receivers of socialistic income/wealth redistributions since the New Deal. Far from being against socialism, they have been very aggressive in lobbying for and using the various socialistic Farm Programs. (3) To imply that, without gov involvement such as the gov enforced acreage restrictions we've had in the past, farmers will withhold production capacity in order to get prices up is silly. Individual farmers will produce while encouraging their neighbors to cut.

I followed the blog on WSJ, and nowhere did they say that. You've been dreaming again. Did Joe's "hard wood" comment get you too excited and you need to clean out your shorts now? You just keep proving that the Pravda-loving socialist crowd will say anything -- ANYTHING -- to get power over people's lives. And you aren't going to get it. The only thing being talked about from this debate in the non-Madcow and non-Tingles Matthews media is little Joey demeaning his own office with his absurd and irreverent behavior in the face of a serious discussion about the thousands of people who have died in the US, Mexico, Afghanistan, and Libya at the hands of the lawless &amp; corrupt Demcong Obama Junta, and oh yeh, failing to mention his running mate (soon to be referred to as the "unindicted co-conspirator"). Looks like everybody in the Demcong is trying to distance themselves from Barry Soetero. It was pretty obvious that little Joey wants the big show, and he's not fit for it. The only thing he's suited for is being the carnival barker at the freak show.

RYAN who wants to control every women's body, maybe they like that, RYAN Voted against equal rights for women, maybe they like that. RYAN Votes to kill Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and anything Americans need, RYAN Votes for wars, More defense spending, he could care less about the troops. It Is Crazy to put a man like RYAN one heartbeat away from the President, we would see a Great Depression Bigger Than The One In 1929.. We Should not be thinking about voting for RYAN for VP, We should be voting RYAN out of Congress, we don't need any more of this country destroyed.</Msg><Username>fireundersmoke</Username><Timestamp>1350177727971</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-13 21:22:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350177790456-172</Id><Topic><Title>3 more weeks Obama can have a presidential library</Title><Username>kingofvietnam</Username><Timestamp>1350162856065</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-13 17:14:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No Obama as President.

Mitt Romney needs to realize that when you try to stand on both sides of an issue, you stand for nothing.” - Rick Perry “They (voters) want to know what’s the truth.

That doesn’t wash.” - Rick Santorum “Pick any other Republican in the country. He is the worst Republican in the country to put up against Barack Obama.” - Rick Santorum “Gov.

And was it U.S. jobs created for United States citizens?” - Sarah Palin “If you’re not sure about whether to support Mitt Romney, whether you’re liberal, or whether you’re very conservative, you ought to be excited, because he’s been on your side at one time or another. So I’m not completely misunderstood. I’m not as excited as I am desperate.” - Louie Gohmert (Republican U.S. Rep from Texas) “We’re not going to beat Barack Obama with some guy who has Swiss bank accounts, Cayman Island accounts, owns shares of Goldman Sachs while it forecloses on Florida and is himself a stockholder in Freddie Mae and Freddie Mac while he tries to think the rest of us are too stupid to put the dots together” - Newt Gingrich “Now I have no doubt that Mitt Romney was worried about pink slips — whether he was going to have enough of them to hand out because his company Bain Capital with all the jobs that they killed, I’m sure he was worried that he’d run out of pink slips. There is something inherently wrong when getting rich off failure and sticking it to someone else is how you do your business and I happen to think that’s indefensible.” - Rick Perry (Republican Gov. of Texas) “I believe most Americans want their next President to remind them of the guy they work with, not the guy who laid them off.” - Mike Huckabee “And we thought nobody could fill John Kerry’s flip-flops! … [Romney's record was] “anything but conservative until he changed all the light bulbs in his chandelier in time to run for President.” - Mike Huckabee</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1350186187621</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-13 23:43:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350186579810-196</Id><Topic><Title>Justice and foreign polidy</Title><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1350181370834</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-13 22:22:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I can't believe he has said such a thing!
