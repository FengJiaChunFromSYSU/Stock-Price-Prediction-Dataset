We don't kill people over any religion and we would never even think to attack or kill anyone over some dumb movie. People who still live by 5th century rules should not be using 21 century smartphones and TV technology to change their life style, that just makes you look more like Americans. Here in America we still have people who live in the past, we call them Civil War Republicans, we can live with them also. The Murder of Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans who spent their lives fighting for freedom for the people in Arab nations was WRONG and you and your muslim brothers know it was wrong. Those responsible for their deaths will soon see American justice, there is no place to hide for them.</Msg><Username>fireundersmoke</Username><Timestamp>1347770947693</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 00:49:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347771938051-5</Id><Topic><Title>"dumpobamie" is a true انمشخصشا muslim brother.

Really? What are the people who are killed in mid and late term abortions? Are they property or subhuman with no rights? I thought Ultrasounds proved years ago that these people are humans. My cousin gave premature birth at 6 months to twins and they survived and are now in college. Obama and other liberals continue to vote for partial birth abortions up to the ninth month and even have voted to deny life saving techniques to those few people who survive abortions. These are special human beings with great potential and should be given civil rights including the most basic one the right to life. Its a human child and its murder!</Msg><Username>spanktrison</Username><Timestamp>1347771938051</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 01:05:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347772520126-6</Id><Topic><Title>Why do the racist, facist, s*h*!*t* for brains repugnant republican fools ever post anything supporting Romney?

Republican right to work states are trying to turn the U.S. into another Mexico, no rights and low pay. Some of those Civil War Republicans found their way into our Congress, we will soon be rid of them and get this country back on track. The Republicans destroyed this country and would not waste their time going after their friend Osama bin Laden. President is rebuilding this country, without the needed help from Congress and he had the time to take out Osama bin Laden. Keep Republicans burning for another 4 years, reelect President Obama, he is the only choice for middle class, poor, Women, Blacks, Hispanic and retired people in this country.

Wade Supreme Court decision, legalizing abortions under most conditions throughout the United States. Where were you people when Bush had the White House, Supreme Court and the Congress? There never seem to be many posts about abortion when a Republican is in office. Seems every time a Republican is in office we go to war and kill tens of thousands but I know you think that is OK. Bush has his private war with Iraq and he sent thousands of Americans to their death, I know you think that was OK. We don't know why some women have an abortion but I know it must be very hard for them to make that decision. I am Pro Life but I don't have the right to make that decision, only women should have that choice to make, we do not know why and we should not have the right to ask them why, it is their right and their right alone.</Msg><Username>fireundersmoke</Username><Timestamp>1347775320344</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 02:02:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347775962380-8</Id><Title>Democraps are the biggest jokes around.

Oh what we did not know back in '08 has opened the eyes of the masses to a rude awakening we now live. The very sobering and revealing 2016the movie exposes this emperor for all that he believes. This is a must see for anyone who wants to know what is behind obama's plans for the country. Too bad this was not told prior to '08.

Let's focus on your military experience so we can better understand your expertise in the areas of military strategy and foreign affairs. The tricky part of understanding your diatribe against Obama (who BTW is the President of the United States and Commander-In-Chief of its armed forces) is how Romney figures into it. As a private citizen with no official standing whatsoever, what is Romney doing meddling in affairs of state? Meeting with foreign security services and foreign leaders on foreign soil are hardly activities in which US private citizens should be engaging.....in fact, if you or I were to do so, we'd very likely be greeted upon our return to US soil by federal agents and arrest warrants. Do Mitt's magic underwear grant him special dispensation from laws that apply to regular citizens? If Mitt took an oath of office, would the undies also serve as crossed fingers?

One brother is poor and lives in Africa. The other is rich and lives in America. One lives in a shanty in a slum in Nairobi on dollars a month. The other lives at the most exclusive address in the world — 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Sound like a fictional Hollywood screenplay, one the Left would eat up? But it gets better. It turns out that the rich American brother made his fortune writing about his own life, and about the father from Kenya he didn’t really know. The poor African brother wrote a book about his own life, too, and about his father he didn’t know. The rich brother is a man the world knows: President Barack Obama. The poor brother is a man the world doesn’t know — George Obama. To make this story even richer, it turns out that the wealthy American brother has not bothered to help his poor African brother. Not a bit. Indeed, President Obama has not even bothered to get to know, let alone help, his struggling brother George. The two met briefly when they were younger, back when Barack Obama was searching for his identity and selling what he discovered to an American publisher. At the National Prayer Breakfast this past February, President Obama gave an eloquent speech explaining why his faith informs his desire to serve the public, and why government should play a role in helping the less fortunate among us. This is what he said in front of some of the nation’s most distinguished religious leaders: “But part of that belief comes from my faith in the idea that I am my brother’s keeper and I am my sister’s keeper; that as a country, we rise and fall together.” I guess he was talking about his metaphorical brother. He certainly wasn’t talking about his real-life half brother, George. So why do we know so little about this brother and President Obama’s refusal to help him? Why hasn’t the media covered the story more fully? Can you imagine what fun they’d be having if the poor, estranged brother was Mitt Romney’s? But much more important than the media’s silence is the question why President Obama hasn’t bothered to help his brother George. Even the president’s harshest critics give him credit for being a solid family man and a great father, husband, and role model to his two beautiful daughters. Why doesn’t he want Malia and Sasha to know their uncle? There are several possible explanations. One possible motivation is sheer shame. It is certainly true that George Obama made some bad decisions in his life, decisions that led him to the life he now leads in the slums of Nairobi. He admits to grave mistakes in his youth, to trouble with gangs and alcohol, and attributes much of it to not having a strong male authority in his life. But isn’t this precisely the kind of person President Obama would want to champion, especially if he is related by blood? There may be, however, a more profound reason we don’t know George. One that has more to do with ideology than with pathology. In his book no one has read, Homeland, George Obama has the temerity to suggest that if Barack Obama had been born and raised in Kenya rather than America, the life he has lived would be much different. Being born in the greatest, richest, freest country — one where free markets prevail — has allowed Barack to exercise his talents and achieve greatness. For his new movie, 2016: Obama’s America, Dinesh D’Souza interviewed George. It was remarkable not for what George said about his brother (he had not a single bad thing to say about him) but about the anti-colonial mindset that drove his father and that animated his brother#$%$ book, Dreams from My Father.</Msg><Username>carmenchicago2</Username><Timestamp>1347804282995</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 10:04:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347806877810-61</Id><Topic><Title>The Navy Seals have been outspoken in their condemnation of Obama; 2 of the 4 Americans killed Tuesday were Ex Navy Seals</Title><Username>tmc7212</Username><Timestamp>1347745964261</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 17:52:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I support the SEALS who don't support the LYING TRAITOR TERRORIST BARACK H U S S E I N O B A M A!</Msg><Username>obamistan</Username><Timestamp>1347806877810</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 10:47:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347806948876-62</Id><Topic><Title>The Navy Seals have been outspoken in their condemnation of Obama; 2 of the 4 Americans killed Tuesday were Ex Navy Seals</Title><Username>tmc7212</Username><Timestamp>1347745964261</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 17:52:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Who is Obama again?

Judicial Watch reports that Hezbollah commander Ali Mussa Daqduq, who tortured and killed 5 U.S. soldiers in Iraq and was detained by U.S. forces in early 2007, will be freed by an Iraqi court--the inevitable, and predictable, result of an Obama administration decision to hand him over to Iraqi authorities rather than bring him to Guantanamo Bay. Judicial Watch summarizes the pathetic abdication of justice by the Obama administration: We all knew this would happen back in December when the commander-in-chief handed over the Lebanese militant, Ali Mussa Daqduq, to Iraqi officials. A mainstream newspaper presented it as a “dilemma” for the president as American troops prepared to exit Iraq. Daqduq had been in U.S. military custody in Iraq since 2007 for his involvement in a carefully orchestrated plot that killed, kidnapped and tortured American military officers. The atrocities took place in a city called Karbala, south of Baghdad in early 2007. Around a dozen terrorists dressed in U.S. military uniforms opened fire on Americans after approaching a camp in five sports utility vehicles resembling U.S. transports. One U.S. soldier died at the scene and four others were kidnapped, tortured and executed. Daqduq, a Hezbollah commander, was the mastermind. But President Obama didn’t want to remove the terrorist from Iraq without permission from the country, in order not to violate its sovereignty. He also refused to take Daqduq to the U.S. Naval base in Guantanamo Cuba, which houses other high-value terrorists, because the facility is an anathema in the Middle East and Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki would not approve the “unacceptable” Guantanamo option. So Obama handed Daqduq over to the Iraqis even though several members of congress pointed out that it would be the same as freeing him. Apparently, Iraq pinky promised to hold him accountable for murdering our soldiers. No one, probably not even Obama, really believed that and this week a national newswire story confirmed it.</Msg><Username>obamistan</Username><Timestamp>1347807138730</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 10:52:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347807201830-66</Id><Topic><Title>Someone said Reverse split when BAC reach @$10 level</Title><Username>flashcrashcoming</Username><Timestamp>1347805112218</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 10:18:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What would be the purpose of that????

Its the tradition market starts falling when everyone sees averything green everywhere, same happened in 2007. When everyone sees green MMs and experienced traders start thinning out keeping the media positive while retailers are still buying expecting sharp turnaround. Opportunities become more lucricative to them but it never holds or turn back for long. It seems alarming because media is showing that more money is likely to come in from bonds to stock market due to FED stimulas. I am feeling it may be the time for profit taking for institutions and MMs when all are getting in when they see AAPL over $700, BAC over $10. You know, this is the time when everyside looks green and no one believes the market could be red for long again. lets see how the second half of month goes.../ GLTA</Msg><Username>ashraf5278</Username><Timestamp>1347810250186</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 11:44:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347811281816-73</Id><Title>How to use ignore on this board</Title><Msg>If you click ignore on every single political post, soon enough the board will clean up.</Msg><Username>longtermguy91</Username><Timestamp>1347811281816</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 12:01:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347811441304-74</Id><Topic><Title>How to use ignore on this board</Title><Username>longtermguy91</Username><Timestamp>1347811281816</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 12:01:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yup</Msg><Username>da23533</Username><Timestamp>1347811441304</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 12:04:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347811527330-75</Id><Topic><Title>NEXT WEEK WILL BE AGAIN GREAT FOR BAC</Title><Username>stevens1958</Username><Timestamp>1347770503373</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 00:41:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>bac is the best buy in the dow... great opportunity. mho.</Msg><Username>george.murphy3</Username><Timestamp>1347811527330</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 12:05:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347811584740-76</Id><Title>This is just the beginning</Title><Msg>The main thing keeping down the financial stocks was EuroFear.

Uncle Ben came out with the best possible QE3 we could have imagined. Focused on mortgages and open-ended. The explicit goal is to goose home and stock prices. He thinks this will improve employment. He is probably right. It will also make BAC stockholders rich. Uncle Ben doesn't mind goosing BAC stock price. He realizes that if the banks are doing better they will lend out more money and spur economic growth. The moral hazard issue is off the table now. BAC stockholders have been punished enough, he thinks. Stock went from 50 to 5. If it goes up from here, it's OK. Stress tests are intense and BAC passes with flying colors. Soon we see dividend increase and/or share buyback. Look for $13 by the end of this year, at least. $15 by March of next year, $20 by January 2014. We will probably reach $30 by January 2015.

Historically, the government employs more people today than at any time in history. We've also learned that massive deficits and high unemployment are part of today's economic reality. 100 years ago, when the private sector dominated hiring, our country was accumulating immense wealth and prosperity. Similarly, global economies that are government-intensive (eg: socialist economies) typically experience economic decline over time (soviet russia, cuba, europe, venezuela, etc) whereas economies that spur hiring via the private sector flourish economically (Hong Kong, Singapore, Germany, etc.) We also learned via Obama's stimulus programs that such jobs are fleeting (most hired under those programs are once again, un-employed) and simply run up the national debt as un-employment remains above 8%. The question is, will America ever re-learn that when it comes to economic prosperity, Capitalism (eg: private sector emphasis) has ALWAYS trumped socialism (eg: emphasis on the public sector). November's election is, more than any in history, about Capitalism VS Socialism. I hope that history is our guide and we do the right thing.</Msg><Username>bjspokanimal</Username><Timestamp>1347817244576</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 13:40:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347819118528-93</Id><Topic><Title>How's That Hope and Change Thingy Going?</Title><Username>roboklerk</Username><Timestamp>1313938827000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2011-08-21 11:00:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>prove your claim, if indeed you can! and i refer to more than your "deck chairs" comment</Msg><Username>kentcardinal_02</Username><Timestamp>1347819118528</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 14:11:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347819245225-94</Id><Topic><Title>Why shouldn't we become a full blown communist nation like Obama wants?</Title><Username>spanktrison</Username><Timestamp>1347159130178</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-08 22:52:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>prove your claim, if indeed you can! and i refer to more than your "mentor" comment</Msg><Username>kentcardinal_02</Username><Timestamp>1347819245225</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 14:14:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347819598194-95</Id><Topic><Title>This board</Title><Username>vanelli_italiano</Username><Timestamp>1321811929000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2011-11-20 12:58:49 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yes double by 3l dec 2ol2, 2ol2</Msg><Username>kentcardinal_02</Username><Timestamp>1347819598194</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 14:19:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347819650277-96</Id><Topic><Title>Obama ahead of Republican Mitt Romney by 50%-39%</Title><Username>dexter.bernanke</Username><Timestamp>1347816373921</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 13:26:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>thank you for that bit of truth</Msg><Username>kentcardinal_02</Username><Timestamp>1347819650277</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 14:20:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347819835434-97</Id><Topic><Title>If Obama is Reelected, Think of the Mess He'll Inherit</Title><Username>haleakala09</Username><Timestamp>1347817276469</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 13:41:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ah yes, a witticism (sic) the peanut gallery chortles</Msg><Username>kentcardinal_02</Username><Timestamp>1347819835434</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 14:23:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347819922474-98</Id><Topic><Title>The Navy Seals have been outspoken in their condemnation of Obama; 2 of the 4 Americans killed Tuesday were Ex Navy Seals</Title><Username>tmc7212</Username><Timestamp>1347745964261</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 17:52:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>just maybe navy seals on payroll of gop, ever think of that???</Msg><Username>kentcardinal_02</Username><Timestamp>1347819922474</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 14:25:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347820045094-99</Id><Topic><Title>the shoe shine monk///ey boy must be gotten rid of asap</Title><Username>big_triceratops</Username><Timestamp>1347815022885</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 13:03:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>i can but shake my head re shameful racism</Msg><Username>kentcardinal_02</Username><Timestamp>1347820045094</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 14:27:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347820099930-100</Id><Topic><Title>So as Protesters everywhere burn the American Flag and the Israeli Flag Obama refuses to meet with Israel</Title><Username>carmenchicago2</Username><Timestamp>1347778228969</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 02:50:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>why should usa president meet with jews???</Msg><Username>kentcardinal_02</Username><Timestamp>1347820099930</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 14:28:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347820170705-101</Id><Topic><Title>WHEN ARE AMERICANS OUT-OF-SEASON OVER THERE FROM BEING KILLED...ASK PRES.

To understand why Obama hates the private sector, one only needs to look at the influence of his father (anti-colonialist) and stepfather Frank Davis (outspoken, card-carrying Communist). Obama's basic belief is that anyone who is incentivized by the desire for "profits" will achieve them by "exploiting" their employees... ... that's why he believes that the only jobs that respect workers are those created by the government... which is part and parcel to Socialism... his primary ideology. Listen to Michelle Obama's speech at the convention. She praised a half dozen employee occupations... teachers, social workers, firemen, etc..... but not ONE SINGLE occupation that is unique to the private sector. Obama is the first, true, socialist to run our country. The result: High un-employment, sluggish growth, and deficits that are MASSIVE in scope. 4 more years of THIS, and we're greece... ... in fact, if Obama continues these $1.2 trillion deficits for just 3 more years, our debt-to-GDP ratio will exceed that of Greece.

His remarks were an impassioned election-season plea from a world leader who insists he doesn't want to insert himself into U.S. politics and hasn't endorsed either candidate. But visibly frustrated by U.S. policy under President Barack Obama, the hawkish Israeli leader took advantage of the week's focus on unrest across the Muslim world and America's time-honored tradition of the Sunday television talk shows to appeal to Americans headed to the polls in less than two months.</Msg><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1347843358626</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 20:55:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347843768735-172</Id><Topic><Title>I AM SICK OF THE LIBERAL MEDIA ALWAYS HAVING TO HOLD OBAMA'S HAND AND MAKE EXCUSES FOR HIM</Title><Username>us.debt_crisis</Username><Timestamp>1347738433483</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 15:47:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama is not the one that bothers me but all the people in this country who believe they deserve everything for free.
