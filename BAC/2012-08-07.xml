Bush for putting you right where you are today. Dubya sure knew how to be a great president..lied to the American public, got us involved in two wars, never got Bin Laden when he had the chance, and got rich on being in office..along with his buddy Dick Channey. Yeah, go thank him for digging this creater this nation is in today, and while you are at it, ask him about Wall Street deregulation and running amock, ask him about what happened to your pensions, and ask him about all those jobs he sent overseas so him and his buddies could make a buck off the carcusses of the middle class, ask him about environmental deregulation that led to the blow out in the Gulf of Mexico, ask him about national response to an emergency such as New Orleans while you are at it. Ask Murdock about Kannapolis, NC and what he was allowed to do to them and their pensions, and finally go ask your boy Mitt why he hid his money off shore and now refuses to divulge his tax returns for the last ten years. And you want this guy for President! Another boy George if you ask me. Just another Republican.</Msg><Username>jburke2133</Username><Timestamp>1344312536086</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 00:08:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344314225532-3</Id><Topic><Title>Tough to find a job under Obama regime</Title><Username>kingofvietnam</Username><Timestamp>1344299040621</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 20:24:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama put in where we are today - four years later and the dems still blame Bush.

Again you twist your uniformed opinion into a "fact" as liberals are famous for doing when they have no logical arguments of any substance. There are plenty of other ways to prove it. Say a check made payable to the IRS (I doubt he would make a charitable donation to the Treasury if he didn't have to), a statement from his tax accountant, etc. Wrong again, Einstein, there are indeed other ways, or are you going to deflect again by making up a different reason now like you have been doing on all your senselss posts? You are a biased illogical idiot.

Reid is a total futz. It is like the liberals all drank the same coolaid to make up crap when they cannot formulate a logical lucid argument to support what they want to believe. They start making up rumors and representing their unsupported twisted opinions as undeniable facts. The only undeniable fact is that they are idiots. Before the libs dump on me, I am not a republican, and I bash repubs who do the same thing. I just see repubs doing a lot less fact twisting than liberals. And liberals seem to alway have to be smug and throw in insults and sarcasim - just watch MSNBC and you will see what I mean. A lot more if it happens there than on FOX.</Msg><Username>mrstan4089</Username><Timestamp>1344315505760</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 00:58:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344316202942-7</Id><Topic><Title>Tough to find a job under Obama regime</Title><Username>kingofvietnam</Username><Timestamp>1344299040621</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 20:24:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Waaaa, waaa, waaa, where is my mommy? Bush caused all our problems, waaa, waaa, waaa. Grow up and get off it. Obama may have inherited a mess, but he owns it now and he is NOT up to the task to do anything about it. He simply does not know what to do, lacks the confidence, and spends too much time listening to Pelosi and Reid, who are two of the biggest idiots to inhabit the village. We are where we are, good or bad there is nothing we can do about the mistakes that got us here. So stop crying about it, that gets us nowhere in this country to be a bunch of wet nosed sniveling babies. The question is, now that we find ourselves in this mess, who is best to lead us out of it? Someone who lied his way into office by making any and every promise he could as a candidate but delivered on none, or someone who has a track record of contrinbuting to the economy? Both have pros and cons but Obama has proven that he simply has no clue. Oh, and about Bush putting us in this position.. what about a certain now retired congressman who delcared at the height of the realesate bubble that there was no sign of a bubble? Many experts give him a healthy dose of credit for the housing bubble because as a liberal of course he wanted everyone to realize the American dream of home ownership, whether they could afford it or not. I am not a Bush fan, just the opposite. I think he was the worst idiot the white house has ever seen, but dems in congress deserve an equal helping of blame for where we are today.</Msg><Username>mrstan4089</Username><Timestamp>1344316202942</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 01:10:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344317392643-8</Id><Title>Real Americans can see through the Liberal smoke screen</Title><Msg>Rich guy!!

Pelosi and her husband abused insider laws a few years ago and bought a lot of stock in a little know solar company then, and when Obama was elected and started to go on about "solar power" everyday, they sold that stock (see SEC Form 4's). But retail investors who did research and found this about Pelosi prior her selling, were lured into buying the same stock too (much like recent FB con job), and today they all were screwed and lost everything and now the company is BK'd.

Even if he was fit, Obama is head and shoulders above anything this fish out of water has to offer.</Msg><Username>toomuchspin4322</Username><Timestamp>1344361641895</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 13:47:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344362112886-121</Id><Title>BUY IMBALANCE= GET MORE NOW 10++++</Title><Msg>no more negatives -profitable!!</Msg><Username>monett4</Username><Timestamp>1344362112886</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 13:55:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344362281105-122</Id><Title>ROMNEY THE RIGHT CHOICE FOR ALL AMERICANS</Title><Msg>His Father: George W. Romney, former Governor of the State of Michigan He was raised in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan He is married to Ann Romney since 1969; they five children. Education: B.A. from Brigham Young University, J.D. and M.B.A. from Harvard University Religion: Mormon - The Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter-Day Saints Working Background: After high school, he spent 30 months in France as a Mormon missionary. After going to both Harvard Business School and Harvard Law School simultaneously, he passed the Michigan bar exam, but never worked as an attorney. In 1984, he co-founded Bain Capital a private equity investment firm, one of the largest such firms in the United States . In 1994, he ran for Senator of Massachusetts and lost to Ted Kennedy. He was President and CEO of the 2002 Winter Olympic Games. In 2002, he was elected Governor of the State of Massachusetts where he eliminated a 1.5 billion deficit. Some Interesting Facts about Romney: Bain Capital, starting with one small office supply store in Massachusetts, turned it into Staples; now over 2,000 stores employing 90,000 people. Bain Capital also worked to perform the same kinds of business miracles again and again, with companies like Domino's, Sealy, Brookstone, Weather Channel, Burger King, Warner Music Group, Dollarama, Home Depot Supply, and many others. He was an unpaid volunteer campaign worker for his dad's gubernatorial campaign 1 year. He was an unpaid intern in his dad's governor's office for eight years. He was an unpaid bishop and state president of his church for ten years. He was an unpaid President of the Salt Lake Olympic Committee for three years. He took no salary and was the unpaid Governor of Massachusetts for four years. He gave his entire inheritance from his father to charity. Mitt Romney is one of the wealthiest "self-made men" in our country but has given more back to its citizens in terms of money, service and time than most men. In 2011 Mitt Romney gave over $4 million to charity, almost 19% of his income.... Just for comparison purposes, Obama gave 1% and Joe Biden gave $300 or .0013%. Mitt Romney is Trustworthy: He will show us his birth certificate He will show us his high school and college transcripts. He will show us his social security card. He will show us his law degree. He will show us his medical records. He will show us his income tax records. He will show us he has nothing to hide. Mitt Romney's background, experience and trustworthiness show him to be a great leader and an excellent citizen for President of the United States. You may think that Romney may not be the best representative the Republicans could have selected. At least I know what religion he is, and that he won't desecrate the flag, bow down to foreign powers, or practice fiscal irresponsibility. I know he has the ability to turn this financial debacle that the current regime has gotten us into. We won't like all the things necessary to recover from this debt, but someone with Romney's background can do it. But, on the minus side, He never was a "Community Organizer", never took drugs or smoked pot, never got drunk, did not associate with communists or terrorists, nor did he attend a church whose pastor called for God to damn the US. You should know the difference between the men running for America's top office. Does Obama/Biden deserve 4 more years?

And I stayed at Holiday Inn Express in Phoenix more than once.</Msg><Username>longtermgull</Username><Timestamp>1344372189726</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 16:43:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344372229178-154</Id><Title>Hey, "bury obama," you were supposed to dye your hair orange before shooting up that temple!</Title><Msg>We have a tradition to uphold.</Msg><Username>dal.sause</Username><Timestamp>1344372229178</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 16:43:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344372305200-155</Id><Topic><Title>Well the Cucking Funts took that down</Title><Username>chiti888</Username><Timestamp>1344370072505</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 16:07:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>its called free market deal with it</Msg><Username>testcdburner</Username><Timestamp>1344372305200</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 16:45:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344372508629-156</Id><Title>IS WILLARD THE CULT PRIEST GOING TO SHOW HIS TAXES...</Title><Msg>Or is he going to drop of the race so he doesn't have to go to jail for tax evation ?</Msg><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1344372508629</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 16:48:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344372514152-157</Id><Title>US GOV blew past there subject limit</Title><Msg>go usdebtclock US Government day's are numbered before COMPLETE SHUT DOWN.

The emails released by the Daily Caller detail the elimination of over 20,000 pensions back in 2009 when the Obama administration implemented its bailout plan. The key difference is that the 20,000 retirees who lost their pensions were non-union members, while conversely, union workers “saw their pensions topped off and made whole.” GOOGLE IT!</Msg><Username>bury_obama</Username><Timestamp>1344375046392</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 17:30:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344375074406-171</Id><Topic><Title>Who's got a big, fat greasy wiener for me?

Was it accidental or an orchestrated effort? Who profited and why? To get some background on this financial crisis read Fannie Mae &amp; Freddie Mac Crash or look at the video Video: Subprime loans “affirmative action”. Senator Schumer Leaks Negative Financial Information Lance Fairchok gives the first part of this compelling argument in an article called The Crime of the Century: The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 For months, Senate Democrats have been leaking negative financial information -- exploiting market sensitivities for political gain -- choreographed to burst precisely when it would do the most damage. Senator Chuck Schumer ignited this by leaking a letter regarding the lending practices of troubled Indy Mac. Indy Mac failed when the Schumer letter caused a "liquidity crisis," where depositors withdrew over a billion dollars. Over three thousand people, half its employees, lost their jobs in the resulting collapse. As a member of the Senate banking committee, Schumer knew the impact on the market. He used confidential regulatory information and set the stage for the "crisis" the Democrats prosper from today. Power is everything, and those who suffer for Democrat ambition matter not at all. Schumer knew exactly what he was doing. Susan Schmidt with the Wall Street Journal explains that Senator Schumer released these letters publically. Sen. Schumer released publicly letters he sent to bank regulators and to the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco. "I am concerned that Indy Mac’s financial deterioration poses significant risks to both taxpayers and borrowers," the senator wrote, warning that "the bank could face a failure if prescriptive measures are not taken quickly." Link Some have speculated that Senator Schumer leaked the Indy Mac information as a way to reduce stock prices for his investor friends. Although this is possible, his motivation may have been more political in nature. A conspiracy to hasten the economic crash and to churn the stock market is certainly in the realm of possibility. In the past, economic downturns have tended to favor the Democratic Party. What makes this more interesting is Senator Schumer's staunch support of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as seen in the Fox News Special Report on the Banking Crisis. It should be noted that Schumer is the only Senate Democrat who sits on both the banking and finance committees. Because of the committee position and the fact he is the number 3 member of the Senate majority leadership he is privy to a great deal of information and knowledge of what the information can do. What Did the Disclosure Accomplish? So why does Senator Schumer, who so adamantly supported these questionable loan practices, now leak a letter regarding the lending practices of Indy Mac just months before the election? Lance Fairchok says there are four reasons: Distract the voter from the reality that the Democrat-controlled congress is so bumbling and corrupt that its approval ratings are in the single digits. Save failing Democratic-supported mortgage companies Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae and avert, for a time, their disastrous effect on the economy and the Democratic Party image. Confuse the electorate into believing that the Republicans are to blame for the financial meltdown, while in reality it was they who have been calling for oversight. Create the impression that Obama is a reformer, which he most certainly is not. Only Senator Dodd (D-CT) and John Kerry (D-MA) have received more money in campaign contributions from Freddie and Fannie than Barack Obama. Does it make sense for a person that has publically supported Fannie and Freddie to release a letter about the imminent failure of Indy Mac? Since Senator Schumer sits on the banking and finance committees, surely he would have known this disclosure would cause wide spread panic and very likely hasten the collapse of Indy Mac. Could there be something else at foot? It is very likely that the Senator knew about the troubles at Fannie and Freddie, so it stands to reason that this was an effort to create the type of economic chaos that would favor Obama. The Role of the ABX Index in the Economic Crash An Ed Lasky article called Hedge Funds, Politics, and the Market Crash tells about Hedge Funds role in the economic crash. Again there are links to Schumer and a powerful far left billionaire. the heart of the mortgage mess is uncertainty regarding the value of subprime mortgages. The ABX Index is used to determine the value of these securities: it is a benchmark of the market for all the home loans issued to borrowers with weak credit. A collapse of this index leads to these home loans being marked down in value. … The Wall Street Journal has noted that there is criticism "that the ABX is manipulated by hedge funds". So when the ABX subprime mortgage index crashed, so did our economy. What hedge fund managers profited by this crash? One of those that made huge profits was the legendary hedge fund manager, George Soros, who has been a political powerbroker of unrivaled influence within the Democratic Party. Soros made $100's of millions if not billions off the economic crash. Soros's hedge fund is based overseas and therefore escapes much scrutiny and regulation. Hedge fund managers only pay 15% tax on their income where we pay up to 35% on income tax. Senator Schumer was among the Senate Democrats who recently led the fight against taxing hedge funds at a higher rate. Why would he protect these managers? Maybe because in the first half of 2007, Senator’s Schumer’s Campaign Committee raised nearly $2 million from executives and employees of private equity and hedge funds. Economic Terrorism? The last piece in this puzzle is articulated by Neal Cavuto in HotAir’s “Economic terrorism”: Huckabee wonders if someone’s trying to drive the market down. Huckabee tells of a very respectable trader who saw massive trading in the last hour of trading for the first 12 days of October. He thinks this may be economic terrorism, and he suggests that the government to look into the issue. This questionable activity could just computer programs kicking out trades, but on the other hand could be something very suspect. It is widely understood that economy problems would break the election in Obama's favor. So it’s entirely possible that someone with deep pockets could churn the stock market. Could a liberal billionaire, like a George Soros, manipulate the market in an effort to impact the election? How much money would it take to make the markets so volatile? Did this volatility continue after Neal Cavuto’s interview with Mike Huckabee? Reaping the Benefits! So we have Senator Schumer publically disclosing Indy Mac financial troubles, which leads to a run on the bank. Then the media picks up the Indy Mac story followed by the exposure of the Fannie and Freddy troubles. George Soros, the far left hedge fund manager, profits handsomely from the crash. Someone churns the stock market in the last hour of trading for 12 days. Could this churn have been from a Soros type billionaire for more profits or to help Obama's chances in the election? After the financial crash became public, the Democrats, with the help of the main stream media, successfully assigned the blame to the Republicans and to Bush’s economic policies. This, despite the fact, that three of the primary causes of the crash were the Community Reinvestment Act, the lack of oversight of Freddie and Fannie and possible Hedge Fund manipulation. Certainly the first two if not the third of these failings can be fairly laid at the doorstep of the Democrats. Yet in the wake of the financial crisis, Obama surged in the polls from an essentially even race to more than a 5 point lead. Clearly, the reasons for the Fannie and Freddie failures should be investigated. But in addition, Federal authorities should also investigate the issues presented in this paper. If true any of these events strike at the heart of our election process. Are they coincidences, or are they part of an orchestrated effort similar to those espoused by Saul Alinsky?

That is based on the increasing number of breakouts since Friday Aug. 3, 2012. Eleven breakouts within 3 sessions! That is quite a positive sign, for st. Accordingly the internals of the larger market are growing stronger. The market environment is becoming positive... unless of course it is NOT interrupted by some negative headline news. Please note: One must do one's own dd work in any specific chosen area of interest- indiv. stocks, etfs, index, etc. Based on T/A alone, I'm not too enthusiastic about the short term prospects of BAC unless the improving market environment also impacts its pps performance.

Instead of, “Better ingredients. Better Pizza,” may we suggest, “Better health care. Pricier pizza." Papa John's CEO John Schnatter says that Obamacare will result in a $0.11 to $0.14 price increase per pizza, or $0.15 to $0.20 cents per order, Pizza Marketplace, a trade publication, reports. (Hat tip: @dkberman via Twitter.) Under Obamacare, the company, which is the third-largest pizza takeout and delivery chain in the United States, will have to offer health care coverage to more of its 16,500 total employees or pay a penalty to the government. The National Restaurant Association pointed out following the health care law's Supreme Court approval that it may adversely affect restaurants’ ability to maintain already slim profit margins because it requires companies of more than 50 employees to provide affordable health insurance. One Papa John's franchise owner in Texas, Judy Nichols, says the law could interfere with her ability to open more restaurants. “I have two options, I can stop offering coverage and pay the $2,000 fine, or I could keep my number of staff under 50 so the mandate doesn't apply,” she told Legal Newsline. Nichols added that the law may cost her between $20,000 to $30,000 extra in taxes. “Obamacare is making me think about cutting jobs instead," she said. But with strong sales last quarter and more than 1,500 new retail locations planned in the near future, Schnatter doesn't seem all that bothered -- perhaps because he intends to pass those health care costs on to customers. “We're not supportive of Obamacare, like most businesses in our industry,” Schnatter was quoted as saying in Politico. “But our business model and unit economics are about as ideal as you can get for a food company to absorb Obamacare." McDonald’s also expects Obamacare to cost each of its 14,000 franchises between $10,000 and $30,000 annually, according to Businessweek. But, like Schnatter, the company remains optimistic it is well placed to handle the extra costs. Representatives from other restaurant chains may be less hopeful, however, including Burger King, Quiznos and Dunkin’ Donuts, all which have expressed concern the law may hurt business, according to the Wall Street Journal.</Msg><Username>tulsaturd</Username><Timestamp>1344396670872</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 23:31:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344396763681-236</Id><Topic><Title>Why Hike Taxes?
