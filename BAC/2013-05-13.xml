We are in war with terrorists. You expect to lose no one even in country as dangerous as Libya., How many special Ops guys lost their lives getting Osama. Zero Dark Thirty. OB hunted down Osama better than dumb Bush and nailed him along with scores of other Al Qaeda honchos. They are no longer the big giant threat they were. They have been decimated thanks to OB. That's the bottom line. You are sore loser #$%$ Republicans. Its war but one US ambassador gets killed and you are making a big deal in an anti- American country such as Libya. If you go to Libya you know you are putting yourself in a dangerous place, just like a soldier volunteers for duty in Afghanistan. He was no more important than one of thousands of US soldiers who died. It's called war. Meanwhile we got rid of Qaddafi. So you make a big deal about every dead soldier and blame OB. Of course not. You are total idiots and that's why your Tea party is a total loser as well. You're all on the way out. You also lost. You'll realize that if you ever wake up.</Msg><Username>rumi1one</Username><Timestamp>1368434092322</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 04:34:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368434686214-11</Id><Topic><Title>Fat , Drunk and Republican is no way to go through life , son.</Title><Username>sirifuture</Username><Timestamp>1367779353017</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-05 14:42:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>brown spot on!!</Msg><Username>zevoter22</Username><Timestamp>1368434686214</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 04:44:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368434840426-12</Id><Topic><Title>I'm a Tea Bagging, sack sucking idiot.

They are the same people who make up the conspiracy theory group that believes Bush had something to do with 9/11 and the levees during Hurricane Katrina. Bottom line....the US is considered the snake's head to many Arab countries due to our historical support of Israel. We were mercilessly targeted on 9/11. We struck back with force. War kills. Nobody really wins. Saddam terrorized his citizens and ravaged neighboring countries for years under sanctions that proved ineffective. There was a build up to that conflict that NO ONhE speaks of anymore....all they want to do is armchair quarterback the fact that WMD's were never found. As far as Afghanistan, we ALL know why we struck back there. Terrorists should have NO PLACE to hide and I'm proud of our Country for paying the price NO ONE else wants to pay. Frankly I wouldn't care if it were Obama or Bush who made the decision to decimate Al Qaeda, as long as we responded effectively (and it appears to me folks, we did). There were thousands of people that stepped up to the plate to VOLUNTARILY serve our country during that time frame. To EVEN SUGGEST that we went there for no good reason only dishonors our servicemen who sacrificed everything to serve this country in time of need. Clearly the ball was dropped with Benghazi. The embassy was ours to defend and we failed miserably both during the event and with the pathetic "downplay" political game that followed. American lives were lost and no price was paid. It was a "free" hit for the terrorists and IMHO if we continue with that mindset going forward, we will be viewed as the world views countries like North Korea. ALL TALK, AND NO ACTION.</Msg><Username>jbrin18</Username><Timestamp>1368444094991</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 07:21:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368444615634-24</Id><Title>DEAR BAC</Title><Msg>Please can you be a bit normal and 'growth up' like a normal adults.

Can’t Take Foreclosure Enforcement Action</Title><Msg>Bank of America Corp. said New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has no right to take enforcement action against the bank over claims that it violated terms of a nationwide foreclosure settlement. The settlement permits enforcement actions when a bank fails to comply with defined metrics and an opportunity to “cure” the violation has been provided, the bank said in a May 7 letter to Schneiderman. The bank says it has complied with “every applicable metric.” “Your office has no right under the express terms of the national mortgage settlement to commence an enforcement action against Bank of America, and we respectfully request that your notice of intent to do so be publicly withdrawn,” attorneys for the bank said. The letter came a day after Schneiderman announced that Bank of America and Wells Fargo &amp; Co. (WFC) violated terms of last year’s settlement with five banks that resolved claims over their foreclosure practices. The deal was negotiated with 49 states and the U.S. Schneiderman said he intended to sue the two lenders, claiming they “flagrantly violated” their obligations for processing mortgage modification applications from homeowners. Damien LaVera, a spokesman for Schneiderman, didn’t respond to a phone message or e-mail seeking comment on the letter. Lawrence Grayson, a spokesman for Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America, declined to comment.</Msg><Username>toothpaste2013</Username><Timestamp>1368449840836</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 08:57:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368450255717-47</Id><Title>Uh ohhhh.

When we look at small caps, we look for companies trading at cheap valuations that have a stable business and a solid balance sheet. We avoid small caps trading below a $1/share or below a market cap of $100 million. In our opinion, shares below this threshold tend to be too illiquid, too volatile, and generally not worth the risk. If this post reaches a wide enough audience, we may continue to cover the small-cap space in future articles.Stewart Information Services Corp (STC)STC is a real estate transaction management and real estate information services company. STC is primarily in the title insurance business with offices/agents in the United States as well as the U.K., Europe, Mexico, Canada, Central America, and Australia. Title insurance is required by lenders before a loan is made on a piece of real estate. Title insurance protects the lender and the new property owner if some unexpected lien (that is not found during the title examination process) is found after the deal has closed. Using title insurance, the lender is assured primary lien position on the property. Also, the new property owner is protected if the property is found to have title problems due to issues such as, title defects, unrecorded liens, forgeries, and mortgage fraud.STC has a market cap of $576 million with a net cash position of $172 million. STC's cash position is nearly 30% of its market capitalization. With a TTM PE ratio of 5.35 and a forward (2014) PE of 9.2, we believe that STC shares are cheap. Also, STC has a price-to-book ratio of 0.95 and is trading at about 5.5 times free cash flow.We like STC as a play on the recovering United States housing market. As the housing market improves, STC will prosper because the service it provides is critical to all real estate transactions. Shares have risen over 80% during the last year and we believe that STC has more upside potential going forward.Basset Furniture Industries (BSET)Basset is a retailer, manufacturer, and importer of home furnishings in the United States. Sales channels include 53 company owned retail stores, 33 licensee owned stores, as well as other independent furniture retailers. Basset has a market cap of $150 million and a net cash position of $44 million, which is about 29% of Basset's market capitalization. We believe that Basset shares are cheap with a TTM PE ratio of 5.39 and a price-to-book ratio of 0.98. Shares are up over 60% in the last year and we believe that Basset will experience more gains as this year progresses.Much like STC, Basset is a good way to play the recovery in the United States housing market. When people buy a new home they will often buy new home furnishings. Sometimes even someone selling a home will buy new furniture to spruce things up in hopes of attracting a buyer. In any case, more residential real estate transactions should bode well for a home furnishings retailer like Basset.Skullcandy Inc (SKUL)Skullcandy is a designer, distributor, and marketer of audio headphones and various accessories. Skullcandy has a market cap of $143 million with a net cash position of $34 million, which is almost 24% of Skullcandy's market capitalization. With a TTM PE ratio of 8.15 and a forward (2014) PE ratio of 12.9, we see Skullcandy shares as being undervalued. Skullcandy is selling for book value and has an Enterprise Value/EBITDA ratio of just 2.84.Our interest in Skullcandy is primarily focused on Skullcandy's apparent plan to buy back up to $28 million in shares. With a fairly high short interest (22% of float), we believe that if Skullcandy is aggressive with its share buy back program it may cause a short squeeze. A short squeeze would be great for Skullcandy shares, in the short term, making the shares a nice short-term trade candidate. Also, we like that Skullcandy is a small company with attractive assets selling at a compelling valuation. These situations sometimes lead to a company being acquired by a larger competitor or by a private equity firm. With the catalysts of a possible short squeeze or a possible buy out, we believe that the market has overlooked Skullcandy and has not priced in these possibilities into the stock price. In our best-case scenario, we forecast that Skullcandy shares will rise 50% or more if there is a short squeeze or buy out. In our worst-case scenario, we forecast that Skullcandy will have a stable business that will maintain a relatively stable share price. We see this as a heads we win, tails we do not lose much type of investment.</Msg><Username>dariodbest</Username><Timestamp>1368451524724</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 09:25:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368451581772-57</Id><Title>TrollTraderX</Title><Msg>Must have got permission from his Mamma to use the Colecovision for a few hours this morning.

Nobody can account for obama on the day of the Benghazi attack, so where was he, mister smarty pants? We're not saying that obungles should have stopped every attack. And only an idiot like you would think that a republican should have, but give a pass to the marxist because we've "got the gall to complain about 4 deaths". Where was obama when a response was needed? In the closet snorting coke? Nobody knows, the question hasn't been answered by anyone and the media has covered for him, but it will be obvious soon. No timeline has been provided that explains obama's absence during the 9 hours of the attack. The WH situation room wasn't used that day. And the answer is likely going to be worse than everything you've heard to date. Changing the subject is not going to help you this time. The lame duck pResidency is in full swing, as it has been for the past 4 years.</Msg><Username>anotherobamafailure</Username><Timestamp>1368453247832</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 09:54:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368453477247-70</Id><Topic><Title>TrollTraderX</Title><Username>marshallfolsh</Username><Timestamp>1368451581772</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 09:26:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>We're talking about traderx here nimrod.

The total transaction value amounted to $230,282 when the stock was bought on April 18. Yost, age 65, is the former CEO of AmerisourceBergen, a pharmaceutical services company that recently signed a 10-year agreement with Walgreen. Yost has served on Bank of America’s board as an independent director since being appointed on Aug. 23, 2012. Previous to the April 18 purchase, Yost bought 20,000 shares of BAC at a similar price in January and 10,000 shares around $9.50 per share in November. The timing of the insider buying comes following Bank of America’s first quarter results, released the previous day on April 17. Management reported in-line results of $0.20 EPS on $23.5 billion in revenue, however positive takeaways from the quarter include a $1 billion year-over-year decline in noninterest expense. Book value per share increased to $20.30, and Bank of America reiterated its plan to buyback $5 billion in stock over the next four quarters. My calculations indicate the share repurchase plan will allow management to buyback 3.7% of outstanding shares, which will be accretive to earnings growth. Bank of America and Citigroup remain my two favorite picks within the financial sector, as both stocks trade at less than book value. Analysts at Morgan Stanley also viewed Q1 results positively, upgrading BAC with a new “outperform” rating and $16 price target.</Msg><Username>marshallfolsh</Username><Timestamp>1368454341563</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 10:12:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368454358413-75</Id><Title>started this week w SHORT position in BAC</Title><Msg>started this week w SHORT position in BAC GLTA</Msg><Username>whatzephuk</Username><Timestamp>1368454358413</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 10:12:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368454491981-76</Id><Title>Bulls are running.

I applaud the President on focusing on this issue and on taking the lead to disarm Saddam Hussein. ... Others have talked about this threat that is posed by Saddam Hussein. Yes, he has chemical weapons, he has biological weapons, he is trying to get nuclear weapons." Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi (Democrat, California) Addressing the US House of Representatives October 10, 2002 Congressional Record, p. H7777 "In the four years since the inspectors left, intelligence reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock, his missile delivery capability, and his nuclear program. He has also given aid, comfort, and sanctuary to terrorists, including Al Qaeda members... It is clear, however, that if left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare, and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons. Should he succeed in that endeavor, he could alter the political and security landscape of the Middle East, which as we know all too well, effects American security. This is a very difficult vote, this is probably the hardest decision I've ever had to make. Any vote that might lead to war should be hard, but I cast it with conviction." Hillary Clinton, US Senator from NY October 10, 2002 "People can quarrel with whether we should have more troops in Afghanistan or internationalize Iraq or whatever, but it is incontestable that on the day I left office, there were unaccounted for stocks of biological and chemical weapons."

He demanded the return of the phone records and destruction of all copies. "There can be no possible justification for such an overbroad collection of the telephone communications of The Associated Press and its reporters. These records potentially reveal communications with confidential sources across all of the newsgathering activities undertaken by the AP during a two-month period, provide a road map to AP's newsgathering operations and disclose information about AP's activities and operations that the government has no conceivable right to know," Pruitt said. The government would not say why it sought the records. [end quote] Let us see now how much cover the press is willing to give Ear Leader now that he has shattered the First Amendment. We on the right always knew this was coming; it was just a matter of time. They've tried (unsuccessfully I might add) to shut us up, and now that the mainstream lapdog media is no longer useful, they are trying to nullify the press and its whistleblowers by looking to prosecute the press' sources to get the silence they need to finish their path toward destruction.
