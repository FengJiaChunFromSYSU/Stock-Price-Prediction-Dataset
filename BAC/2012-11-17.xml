It has been also supported scientifically and in the context of human/social relations. One of those Laws is recognized in human experience is the Law of "Karma"... or Cause and Effect. This Law states that "Every action generates a force of energy that returns to us in like kind... what we sow is what we reap. And when we choose actions that bring happiness and success to others, the fruit of our karma is happiness and success." You and I are infinite choice makers. My and your future is generated by the choices we are making in every moment of our lives. There is a perfect accounting system in this Universe, and everything is a constant "to and fro" exchange of energy. The more we bring our choices into the level of our conscious awareness, the more we will make those choices which are spontaneously correct- both for us and THOSE around us. Obama was the right choice given the alternative and MORE people are expected to benefit by his actions than if Romney succeeded. That is clear based on his goals of helping the middle class. But all this may be not too interesting to you. But you asked for it. Being a student of spirituality, I rose to the opportunity you presented. Sorry if it may be Vietnamese for you. My best to you and your loved ones.</Msg><Username>giovannijay</Username><Timestamp>1353132033294</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-17 01:00:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353132574800-6</Id><Topic><Title>I'll never vote Republican ever again.</Title><Username>ggggggg_gargle</Username><Timestamp>1353130147296</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-17 00:29:07 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"They all screw up sooner or later, it seems.

However, that even reinforces the view that vigilance is always most needed whoever happens to be the one "Absolute power absolutely corrupts" regardless of label of party. Here we do know that since 2000 our country was led to lose the right path in our reaction to 911 by using lies to invade two countries! The price our nation paid has indeed been too high and even though Bin Laden is dead, sadly to say he achieved all his goals!</Msg><Username>giovannijay</Username><Timestamp>1353132574800</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-17 01:09:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353134421493-7</Id><Topic><Title>★★★★★ Welcome to the Re-Election of President Obama ★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★</Title><Username>ebonics4gfy</Username><Timestamp>1352183530544</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-06 01:32:10 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And bump</Msg><Username>j.farragut</Username><Timestamp>1353134421493</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-17 01:40:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353148186400-8</Id><Title>Op deze computer is alles geblokkeerd</Title><Msg>ja waarempel.</Msg><Username>hitobamaler</Username><Timestamp>1353148186400</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-17 05:29:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353148275081-9</Id><Topic><Title>what a total farce ws=organized crime at it's finest</Title><Username>tom.foolery2</Username><Timestamp>1353088184780</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-16 12:49:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obam is the first joodse president</Msg><Username>hitobamaler</Username><Timestamp>1353148275081</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-17 05:31:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353148373179-10</Id><Title>Why is the webside of David*** Duke blokked ??????????????</Title><Msg>Because its the truth.</Msg><Username>hitobamaler</Username><Timestamp>1353148373179</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-17 05:32:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353150046845-11</Id><Title>The U.S. government puts out false and misleading info. to the public and our enemies.

The difference is Bush managed the crisis and he handled the job. Obama hasn't. BTW, the only war we are not able to win is the one the Democrats were in favor of. Afghanistan! Another dose of reality, the Clinton surplus the liberals brag about came from that improperly managed tech bubble, that was allowed to careen out control. Combined with off the books borrowing from Social Security, and the neglect and failure to make appropriate expenditures to counter the increasing incidents of terror perpetrated by Al-Qaeda around the world. In other words, it never really existed except on paper. And, how do you have a surplus while you are still running up the National Debt as Clinton was? Bush, upon entering office, immediately called for investigations into Fannie and Freddie that were held up in committee or filibustered at every turn by Democrats and a handful RINOs. Bush continued to call for and urge congress to investigate these GSE’s throughout his entire presidency. No action was taken. Those investigations had the potential to expose the whole mortgage back security scam before it became critical. Thank Barney Frank, Barack Obama and Chris Dodd for leading the opposition to those requested investigations. Bush never had a super majority in congress as Obama was privileged to have for two years, and wasted on the ideological legislation of Obamacare, rather than on fixing the economy. While Obama sat on his hands waiting for Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi to push though his health care nightmare, the economy continued to fall deeper and deeper into despair. Spending reeled out of control with government sinking it’s tentacles deep into the private sector arena with business choking regulations and bailouts for campaign donors of Obama. Had Obama put aside his ideological nonsense and focused on a private sector based recovery plan we would not still be in this dire recession. This is Obama's mess, in all this time as president he and his party still refuse to take responsibility, and he continues to blame everything under the sun but himself. Yet Democrats blame Bush for everything that transpired in his first nine months. Double standard idiocy! Obama is no leader! Obama is without one original cogent idea! Obama has damage hundreds of thousands of families beyond repair. He's just a sniveling whiner! And now he wants to sue the banks! What a feeble ideologically blinded mind this president has! The fact that the Clinton staff vandalized the White House and government computers and offices, and dumped and scrambled files, before leaving tells you the juvenile mind set of that administration.
