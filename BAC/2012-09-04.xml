Timeframe, your temperament, style of investing, etc. etc. etc. Looking at the charts, technically it does not look too good especially st. I am a swing trader and based on technical consideration alone I sold on Friday at $7.98 what I bought in July this year at about 7.0 It's a risky stock but it will depend on economic data showing the continuation of the small improvement we have been having trendwise. Europe is one unknown factor that is going to cause volatility in the stock market. It sure is a testy and risky market. But it's fun if you have experience in many areas and you can manage the challenge to your advantage.

The National Debt. Now approaching $16 trillion, the national debt and our debt to GDP ratio has never been worse despite the fact that Obama ran on a platform of debt reduction. During the 2008 campaign he roundly attacked President Bush for borrowing from China to spend money we didn’t have. Now it seems that as long as Obama is spending the money, the national debt doesn’t matter. Under his policies it is projected that the debt will be 200% of GDP by the 2030’s. Obama has already presided over a more than 25% increase in government spending in just three and a half years. Unlike the RNC convention in Tampa, there surely won’t be a National Debt Clock hanging in the arena in Charlotte. 2. The Real Unemployment Rate. Everyone knows the unemployment rate is hovering over 8% and the president has to deliver his message to a nation that hasn’t seen the employment bounce-back promised from the $1 trillion in stimulus. However, what you won’t hear at the DNC are the real numbers – 23 million people unemployed or underemployed making the real unemployment rate, including those who have stopped looking for work at a staggering 14.9%. Unemployment is also being concealed by the between 3-4 million people who have been added to the Social Security disability insurance program since Obama took office. 3. Gas Prices. Obama hit President Bush hard for rising gas prices in 2008 and promised Americans relief at the pump. When he took office, the national average for a gallon of gas stood at $1.95. Today, on Labor Day, it’s nearly double, and yet he scarcely mentions it. In How could he after appointing an Energy Secretary that believes it would somehow be good to have gas prices similar to Europe or after spending $1 billion on a failed so-called green jobs program? Obama’s stonewalling of the Keystone XL pipeline is also further evidence that the president is too focused on making the Chevy Volt viable rather than doing anything to lower gas and energy prices for Americans. 4. More than one third of Americans are on Government Assistance. Obama seems to be all for the culture of dependency, but don’t expect him to trumpet the idea that more than one third of the country is now receiving some form of means-tested government assistance. That number is up from about 24% under Bush. Of course, this welfare state isn’t a creation of the President, but between ObamaCare and his recent gutting of the work requirement for welfare recipients, Obama is well on his way to building his progressive utopia. The Romney camp should emphasize this point. Americans will find it depressing and distasteful. 5. The Federal Jobs Created. For all the talk about the unemployment rate and sluggish private sector growth, Obama has presided over the creation of nearly 150,000 new unionized government jobs during his term. This included thousands of new workers to manage ObamaCare at the IRS and the Department of Health and Human Services. This is a big slap in the face this is to the unemployed in the this country when you consider that the average salary for a federal worker is now in excess of $70,000 plus benefits. Federal workers who benefit from union protection are often doing far better than their private sector counterparts these days. And while GOP governors have been reducing the public payrolls on a state level, Obama has continued to grow the federal bureaucracy.</Msg><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1346757153621</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 07:12:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346758479502-11</Id><Title>A man's not only got to know his limitations....</Title><Msg>he's got to remember what they are LMAO: "These people who are making a big deal out of gay marriage?

One completed on Sept. 2 from the Democratically aligned Public Policy Polling has the race at 48 percent each among likely voters and the newest poll from High Point University (completed August 30) has the race at 46 percent for Romney to 43 percent for Obama among registered voters. One of the most important groups that powered Obama to victory in 2008 was young voters, who supported him overwhelmingly. Those under age 30 went to Obama by 74 to 26 percent according to exit polls. This was the difference maker – he lost among every other age group. In the new Elon poll, Obama is much softer among young voters, winning by just 58 to 34 percent. Perhaps the convention in Charlotte can excite young voters in a similar fashion, but just 36 percent in that age group say they are “very excited” about the election.</Msg><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1346760850847</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 08:14:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346761210962-16</Id><Title>FIVE RULES FOR MEN TO FOLLOW FOR A HAPPY LIFE:</Title><Msg>FIVE RULES FOR MEN TO FOLLOW FOR A HAPPY LIFE: 1.

(WFC) have contributed $20 million toward the cost of the Democratic National Convention, helping fund an event that Democrats initially said wouldn’t accept corporate money, according to two people familiar with the matter. Organizers of this year’s convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, turned to corporations after the city’s host committee struggled to reach its $36.7 million fundraising goal, according to the people, who requested anonymity. Aug. 31 (Bloomberg) -- Charlotte Mayor Anthony Foxx talks about the outlook for the Democratic convention in his city and his call that President Barack Obama will carry North Carolina in the November election. Bloomberg's Lisa Lerer and Sheelah Kolhatkar discuss Mitt Romney's performance at the Republican convention in Tampa, Florida, and fundraising behind the scenes. Bloomberg's Esme E. Deprez talks about the impact of Hurricane Isaac on New Orleans and the rest of Louisiana. Last year, the Charlotte host committee set up a separate entity called New American City Inc., to take corporate cash and to which Bank of America and Wells Fargo contributed, according to the people. The two banks were on a list of corporate donors released Sept. 1 by the host committee that also named AT&amp;T Inc. (T), US Airways Group Inc. (LCC), Duke Energy Corp. (DUK) and the law-and- lobbying firm McGuireWoods LLP. After saying in February 2011 they wouldn’t take corporate money, Democratic Party leaders and convention organizers have grappled with how to cover the estimated $52 million cost of the event, which will culminate Sept. 6 in President Barack Obama’s renomination acceptance speech. Duke Energy Chief Executive Officer Jim Rogers, co-chairman of the host committee, “has said that he secured $10 million to $11 million from local corporations from Charlotte,” said Tom Williams, a spokesman for Duke. “He has been working hard to build on those numbers to bring in money” for the convention, Williams said.

"There has been no shortage of oil in the market. Producers have been able to meet consumer needs," Abdullah al-Badri told an energy conference. "We also see this as being the case for the rest of 2012 and the foreseeable future." Oil prices surged in March to $128 a barrel, the highest level since 2008, because of concern about possible supply shortages. Prices have since fallen back and brent crude was trading around $118 on Thursday. "Today the price continues to be driven by excessive speculation," Badri said. OPEC at a meeting in December set a target to produce 30 million barrels per day, settling an argument which broke out in 2011 after Iran and other members opposed a Saudi-led plan to raise OPEC's production ceiling. Output has remained above the target all year as Libyan supply recovered after being virtually shut down during the 2011 uprising against Muammar Gaddafi's rule. The extra oil is filling gaps caused by an unusually large number of supply outages globally, which have also helped support prices. Supply breaks were running at nearly 1.3 million bpd as of early April. The additional supply has also offset a decline in exports from Iran, which is facing stiffening western sanctions over its disputed nuclear energy program. Iranian oil exports were running at between 200,000 and 300,000 barrels per day below last year's level, Maria van der Hoeven, head of the International Energy Agency, told Thursday's conference. Iranian officials have said the country exported an average of 2.2 million barrels a day last year. July supply from the 12-member Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ran at 31.75 million barrels per day (bpd), the high est since September 2008, which was shortly before it agreed to a series of supply curbs to combat recession and collapsing demand, based on Reuters surveys</Msg><Username>fairvalue23</Username><Timestamp>1346763400425</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 08:56:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346763443693-24</Id><Title>"There has been no shortage of oil in the market"</Title><Msg>"There has been no shortage of oil in the market" OPEC Says Supply Ample, Speculation Driving Price , | 28 August 2012 | 06:18 AM ET Oil supply will be more than sufficient to meet demand this year and beyond, OPEC's Secretary General said on Thursday, but added the price of fuel is being driven higher by speculation.

Naimi Says Brent Oil Should Drop to $80.00 as Supply Tops Demand By Ben Sharples - June 03, 2012 Crude prices should fall because global supply is outweighing demand, according to Saudi Arabia’s oil minister, Ali al-Naimi. “We want a lower price than where it is now,” al-Naimi said in Adelaide today. “We need to get the price to a level of around $80” a barrel for London’s Brent crude, he said. Saudi Arabia is the world’s biggest oil exporter. Brent, a benchmark price for more than half the world’s crude, has dropped 6 percent this month amid concern Europe’s debt crisis will worsen and curb fuel demand. OPEC is working to bring prices down, the group’s Secretary-General, Abdalla el- Badri, said May 3. The producer group, scheduled to meet next month, is pumping 8.3 percent more crude than it considers necessary this quarter, figures from the Vienna-based group show. Brent crude for June settlement dropped 0.8 percent in the week to May 11 to $112.26 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. West Texas Intermediate oil for June delivery slid 2.4 percent to $96.13 a barrel. At $100 a barrel for London’s Brent crude, that equates to around $80.00 a barrel for West Texas Intermediate oil. The average price for gasoline in the U.S.A would drop to $2.80 per gallon. Oil supply outweighs demand by 1.3 million to 1.5 million barrels a day, al-Naimi said today. Saudi Arabia increased output last month to the highest in more than three decades, according to data it provided to OPEC.</Msg><Username>fairvalue23</Username><Timestamp>1346763561227</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 08:59:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346763603380-28</Id><Title>Sanford Bernstein Oil Value should be $60.00 to $50.00 a barrel</Title><Msg>Sanford Bernstein Oil Value should be $60.00 to $50.00 a barrel Based on Sanford C.

That equates to averages gasoline price of $2.25 to $2.00 per gallon gasoline.</Msg><Username>fairvalue23</Username><Timestamp>1346763603380</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 09:00:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346763625934-29</Id><Title>Sanford Bernstein Oil Value should be $60.00 to $50.00 a barrel</Title><Msg>Sanford Bernstein Oil Value should be $60.00 to $50.00 a barrel</Msg><Username>fairvalue23</Username><Timestamp>1346763625934</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 09:00:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346763955869-30</Id><Title>NTWK $4.6 ..3M FLOAT REPORTS RECORD QUARTER WITH 25c/SHARE NET, RECORD YEAR, GUIDES FOR 30%+ REVENUE GORWTH AND $1/SHARE NET INCOME</Title><Msg>TARGET $10+ BY NEXT WEEK.........5 FWD P/E &amp; 40% ANTICIPATED 2013 GROWTH AND $1/SHARE NET INCOME IN 2013 NetSol Technologies Reports Record Fiscal Fourth Quarter and Year-End Results - 9/4/2012 Fourth Quarter 2012 Revenue Surges to $14.3 Million on Increased License Revenues Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Advance Significantly to $0.25 per Diluted Share Full Year Earnings Before and After Non-Controlling Interest Reported at $1.06 and $0.39 Respectively Company Expects Record Fiscal 2013 Annual Revenue Growing to $46 million to $49 million, With Earnings per Diluted Share Advancing to $0.80 to $1.00 THIS ONE WILL BE A HUGE GAINER THIS WEEK AND NEXT WEEK.......TECHNICALS WILL PUT IT IN POSITIVE GOLDEN CROSS TERRITORY TODAY WITH BLUE SKIES ABOVE</Msg><Username>joeyggrecco</Username><Timestamp>1346763955869</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 09:05:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346764378177-31</Id><Topic><Title>BAC tangible book value/share of $14.18 ---HAS CASH OF 11.38 A SHARE--**LINK**</Title><Username>valueplay_2000</Username><Timestamp>1346697184630</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 14:33:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Short term target s/b 12 ish</Msg><Username>valueplay_2000</Username><Timestamp>1346764378177</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 09:12:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346764378306-32</Id><Topic><Title>Is BAC a good buy now?</Title><Username>ongrichar</Username><Timestamp>1346731131866</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 23:58:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>patience.</Msg><Username>rocketscienc</Username><Timestamp>1346764378306</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 09:12:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346764432668-33</Id><Title>Why does 0BAMA hate dogs and cats?

One brother is poor and lives in Africa. The other is rich and lives in America. One lives in a shanty in a slum in Nairobi on dollars a month. The other lives at the most exclusive address in the world — 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Sound like a fictional Hollywood screenplay, one the Left would eat up? But it gets better. It turns out that the rich American brother made his fortune writing about his own life, and about the father from Kenya he didn’t really know. The poor African brother wrote a book about his own life, too, and about his father he didn’t know. The rich brother is a man the world knows: President Barack Obama. The poor brother is a man the world doesn’t know — George Obama. To make this story even richer, it turns out that the wealthy American brother has not bothered to help his poor African brother. Not a bit. Indeed, President Obama has not even bothered to get to know, let alone help, his struggling brother George. The two met briefly when they were younger, back when Barack Obama was searching for his identity and selling what he discovered to an American publisher. At the National Prayer Breakfast this past February, President Obama gave an eloquent speech explaining why his faith informs his desire to serve the public, and why government should play a role in helping the less fortunate among us. This is what he said in front of some of the nation’s most distinguished religious leaders: “But part of that belief comes from my faith in the idea that I am my brother’s keeper and I am my sister’s keeper; that as a country, we rise and fall together.” I guess he was talking about his metaphorical brother. He certainly wasn’t talking about his real-life half brother, George. So why do we know so little about this brother and President Obama’s refusal to help him? Why hasn’t the media covered the story more fully? Can you imagine what fun they’d be having if the poor, estranged brother was Mitt Romney’s? But much more important than the media’s silence is the question why President Obama hasn’t bothered to help his brother George. Even the president’s harshest critics give him credit for being a solid family man and a great father, husband, and role model to his two beautiful daughters. Why doesn’t he want Malia and Sasha to know their uncle? There are several possible explanations. One possible motivation is sheer shame. It is certainly true that George Obama made some bad decisions in his life, decisions that led him to the life he now leads in the slums of Nairobi. He admits to grave mistakes in his youth, to trouble with gangs and alcohol, and attributes much of it to not having a strong male authority in his life. But isn’t this precisely the kind of person President Obama would want to champion, especially if he is related by blood? There may be, however, a more profound reason we don’t know George. One that has more to do with ideology than with pathology. In his book no one has read, Homeland, George Obama has the temerity to suggest that if Barack Obama had been born and raised in Kenya rather than America, the life he has lived would be much different. Being born in the greatest, richest, freest country — one where free markets prevail — has allowed Barack to exercise his talents and achieve greatness. For his new movie, 2016: Obama’s America, Dinesh D’Souza interviewed George. It was remarkable not for what George said about his brother (he had not a single bad thing to say about him) but about the anti-colonial mindset that drove his father and that animated his brother#$%$ book, Dreams from My Father.</Msg><Username>spanktrison</Username><Timestamp>1346766176238</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 09:42:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346766466254-38</Id><Title>Baby Boomers</Title><Msg>There's 10,000 baby boomers retiring everyday.

People like me will leave you and your immoral values and your worthless dollars to rot and riot and kill each other for food, taking our wealth and our families someplace where idiots are outnumbered, where takers are shamed, where the hate speeches of amoral activists are ignored and they are told to simply shut up. And then all we need to do is wait until this Bolshevik Revolution is over, when our future generations can come back to clean up the mess.

Fifty-two percent said he did not. Republicans complain about the tone and tenor of Obama's months of character attacks on GOP nominee Mitt Romney, but the Hill poll shows us exactly what Obama's internal polling has likely been telling him for months. There is no chance of the incumbent winning if the election is about him. So it needs to be about somebody else.</Msg><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1346771861988</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 11:17:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346772187390-69</Id><Title>(Reuters) Investors are Buying up Shares on a Potential Share Buyback</Title><Msg>Liberty Media currently holds 3,156,130,633 shares of SiriusXM ( SIRI ).

If you don't believe it, just google Biden clean articulate and you'll find it. "I mean, you got the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy," Biden said. "I mean, that's a storybook, man." This is the way the typical Democrat views black people. They believe they are generally not bright, dirty, and ugly. They believe blacks need affirmative action and welfare because they aren't bright, and are too dirty and ugly to get a decent job on their own. They believe gov't is needed for them to survive. Republicans believe all men and women are created equal, and ordinary people can achieve extraordinary things without the help of government - regardless of race, color, or gender. Since Republicans don't promote discrimination via affirmative action, and don't believe you have to buy votes via food stamps and welfare we're considered the racists. It's an incredible irony, but we see this all the time. How can Bill Clinton be loved by 60% of the women when he treated his wife like trash and cheated on her several times, and also used an intern - the least powerful employee in the gov't - as his little sex toy? Incredible. Lyndon B Johnson declared war on poverty back in the 1960's and all of the "Great Society" welfare/gov't programs were passed to create utopia. The poverty rate was 15% back then, and are over 14% now despite spending around $15 trillion on these worthless programs. Incredible. You can't make this stuff up. You have to be really, really, really, stupid to vote for a Democrat. Good news for them is that the world is full of stupid people.</Msg><Username>defeatsocialism</Username><Timestamp>1346804684606</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 20:24:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346804793215-266</Id><Topic><Title>Why no debt clock at the democrap convention</Title><Username>zevoter22</Username><Timestamp>1346799146997</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 18:52:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I have a theory on that: They don't know what "debt" means.

Still not sure what they thought his challenge was, but -- clearly to those of us who actually think -- telling the truth and showing up for work are two of his biggest challenges.</Msg><Username>flippant_1</Username><Timestamp>1346804975313</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 20:29:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346806195106-268</Id><Topic><Title>Obama inherited the damage caused by Bush jr.

If he were a Republican and made this comment, the late night comedians and national news anchors would still be making fun of them - like they did when Quayle read the flash card that had potato spelled incorrectly on it. Since it was a democrat, most of the national media didn't even cover the story and probably didn't even know it happened. Imagine electing a man president that didn't even know how many states there were in Amerika. You can't make this stuff up. Soon after Obama was elected he challenged his cabinet to cut $100 million in spending. $100 million was like peeing on a bomb fire it was so immaterial, and clearly showed he had no clue what he was doing. He had to bring on lots of czars to help him because he didn't have any experience. Can you imagine what media would have said if Bush said there were 58 states in America, hired a lot of czars to help him manage the executive branch, or stated he challenged his cabinet to cut $100 million out of a $4 trillion budget?

Obama loves people who do not want to make mortgage payment - highest deliquency rate ever under his presidency. 4. Obama loves people who want tp claim disability instead of seeking work - highest rate ever. 5. Obama loves people who borrow more than their income, because they follow him by increasing our deby from $10 to $16 trillion in 3 1/2 years. 6. Obama loves people who come here illegally to fight for their right to get our free food, free health care, free education - they have more rights who are born here. 7.
