Corporate Lobbyists Manage Our Presidential Debates e-Voting Company Could Intercept and Change Ballots Without a Trace Monday, 22 October 2012 12:33 By Gerry Bello and Bob Fitrakis, The Free Press | Report The Free Press has previously reported, Scytl, a Barcelona based e-voting company will be counting votes in 26 states. They will be doing so through something called the Federal Overseas Voting Program or FVAP. FVAP is a program designed to allow military personnel and other overseas Americans to vote in their home districts seamlessly through electronically delivered absentee ballots. Intercepting and changing these ballots, as well as voting electronically on behalf of service people that have no idea such a thing is happening, is something that Scytl is uniquely positioned to do because of their cellphone spyware sister company, CarrierIQ. These stolen votes, distributed throughout jurisdictions across the country, could become a critical component of any scheme to defraud the 2012 presidential election. By means of changing a relatively small number of votes, and laundering those stolen votes in the correct places, the net effect would be a near silent theft. The Columbus Dispatch reported on Sunday, October 21 that in Ohio, "The campaign of Republican Mitt Romney plans to station Election Day Task Force members to record the name of every voter who walks through the door and feed it to a 'national command center' database in Boston as part of an unprecedented high-tech get-out-the-vote effort." Sources at Smartech, the company responsible for stealing the election in Ohio in 2004, revealed to Free Press journalist Jill Simpson that the next man in the middle attack would be launched by Scytl from its US headquarters, a location in suburban Virginia that was formerly owned by its managing director, Hugh Gallagher, and seems to serve as his private home. We believe it was Hugh who watched from the windows as our investigators photographed the home. Scytl is not the only election related business that has been run out of Mr. Gallagher's seemingly crowded residence. Since 2004, some shell company called Election Training Inc. has called some part of Mr. Gallagher's 5-bedroom home its headquarters. A phone records check on Election Training's number yielded us something called Election Systems Acquisitions and Management, also at the same address, allegedly founded in 2002 but listing Scytl as its website. Scytl entered the US elections market on January 11, 2012, when it announced its acquisition of Tampa based SOE software. SOE software is election management software that specializes in internet voting and election results reporting in 900 jurisdictions in 26 states. What exactly Elections Systems Acquisitions and Management did for the decade preceding this event is at best obscure. On September 28th, the day after the Free Press published the address and photo of Scytl headquarters, their vice president for media relations and governmental affairs, Michelle Shafer (See Why are legal scholars dismissing election fraud?: Manufactured skepticism and exit polls) of Austin Texas, filed an official change of address form with the United States Election Assistance Commission. In just 24 hours, in the middle of a presidential election, Scytl USA miraculously relocated to Baltimore, Maryland. Scytl's new address is a virtual office at 400 Pratt Street in Baltimore, purchased cheap. A quick web search determined more than a dozen other companies, including three law offices, a parking garage company and a web marketing firm are all crammed into the same suite at that location, making it perhaps a more cramped facility than Hugh Gallagher's basement. Our investigators determined this on a visit there where they found no-one willing to talk about Scytl at that location, nor willing to discuss the kind of virtual office services offered. Perhaps the staff necessary for counting the votes of America's 2.6 million servicemen and women had not had a chance to relocate from Hugh Gallagher's couch (maybe they were in his garage?) to Baltimore. Scytl is also going through with its plans to promote internet voting and has additional plans to allow voting from smartphones. Were the centerpiece of American democracy not involved, this whole episode would be farcical. Since certain federal laws are involved, both the first fake location and its subsequent movement may constitute fraud. Election law requires that companies manufacturing election products list their address with the EAC, which is why Michelle Shafer seemed to be in such a hurry to cover their tracks. In moving themselves officially from one virtual office to another, she may have covered one alleged fraud with another. Scytl, through SOE software has an office in Tampa. Why the Gallagher residence, rather than SOE's existing facility, was selected as Scytl's main United State's office is somewhat unclear to us. A visit there by our investigators found them on the 5th floor of an office building with 17 other companies. Although they appear to actually have an actual office, it is unclear to us how all their employees could work there. It is also unclear why this location was not listed as Scytl's national headquarters in the first place or why the sudden change of address they undertook after our scrutiny did not take place to their Tampa location where they actually do have an office and employees as opposed to Baltimore, where it seems they do not. Scytl is not the only phantom voting company the Free Press has investigated physically. In future articles we will detail the obscure locations, low employee head counts, improbable square footage and oppressive security designed to ward off public scrutiny we have found at every location. During this election, the people serving overseas in America's armed forces will cast virtual absentee ballots. These ballots will be processed by a company that is based in Barcelona, owned by one British and two Spanish private banks (one of which has an office in New York), has a subsidiary in Tampa, but otherwise exists alternately in a private residence in suburban Virginia or in a desk drawer in Baltimore's inner harbor. This is virtual faith based voting taken to a new level of refinement.</Msg><Username>giovannijay</Username><Timestamp>1351051550076</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 00:05:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351051660305-8</Id><Topic><Title>Hey j.farragut.

America likes tough guys. In the minds of America's so-called "low-information voters" - and the low-information-delivering media - Mitt Romney won the first presidential debate because he was the alpha male aggressor, the person who used the most dramatic hand gestures, emitted the highest number of words per minute and simply acted like he was in charge. Romney even bullied the hapless moderator, Jim Lehrer, perhaps channeling his high school days when he humiliated a handicapped teacher and bullied and assaulted gay students. Romney got away with it in high school, and he's getting away with it again - though the second debate held a different fate for him. Evidently, the actual content of what Romney said was irrelevant. It's like debate watchers were voting as they would have for American Idol. The lyrics of the song didn't matter; it was only the performance that counted. Brazen departures from reality, the truth, facts and common sense combined with constant self-contradictions and breathtaking flip-flopping are no longer a liability, but in fact, have become the very qualities that apparently make many people believe he is suddenly "presidential." If polls are to be believed, in less than 90 minutes, the press and the public forgave Romney his notorious 47 percent comments, his personification of Wall Street greed, foreign bank accounts, tax dodging, plutocratic tax plan, outsourcing American jobs to Chinese sweat shops, eagerness to suppress women's reproductive rights, brutal anti-immigration policies, comical contortions differentiating Obamacare from Romneycare, foreign policy blunders, outrageous military budget, incomprehensible federal deficit arithmetic, and his mocking of global warming. No longer did any of that matter. He looks good in a suit, and his "performance" was captivating, so the lyrics of the song were irrelevant. I and many others have written about Romney's long history of shameless dishonesty. But new information has emerged about Romney and Bain's intimate involvement in, and profiteering from, Big Tobacco, which is shocking even to me and which should remove all doubt about how empty a suit is Mitt Romney. To understand the latest and worst chapter in Romney hypocrisy, one must first appreciate how abhorrent smoking is to Mormons. As a person who grew up immersed in the Mormon culture, served a Mormon mission just like Romney did and held a significant supervisory position during my Mormon mission, I know well what Mormons think of smoking. While Mormons put a premium on "clean living" and exemplary "moral" behavior, in the eyes of Mormons, nothing distinguishes them more from non-Mormons than their unique prohibition on smoking. It is considered not just a health proscription, but also a moral imperative. Smoking would disqualify one from entering into one of the Mormon sacred temples, for example. A Mormon could be greedy, materialistic, evade his taxes, engage in unethical or inhumane business practices (like Romney does), stop going to church, become addicted to prescription drugs or even cheat on a spouse, and all of this could be either overlooked or forgiven. But nothing more thoroughly symbolizes a person's departure from the standards of the Mormon Church than cigarette smoking. The second thing one must appreciate is how much of a spiritual icon Romney is in Mormon World. Few Mormons identify with Harry Reid, though he is just as Mormon as Mitt. And not just because Reid is a relatively rare Democrat among the Mormon faithful, but because Romney is well known to have served as both a Mormon bishop and a stake president from 1981 to 1994. The latter position is comparable to a Catholic bishop. Among his many religious duties, he would have spent hundreds of hours privately interviewing other Mormons about their worthiness to perform sacred Mormon rituals. And none of them would he have deemed worthy if they had smoked. So, at the same time Mitt served as a Mormon stake president and the spiritual leader of the Boston Mormon flock of over 4,000 parishioners, he was making himself filthy rich promoting smoking and helping to ruin the health of millions of people, according to a 9,000 word October 9 article on Huffington Post by Zach Carter and Jason Cherkis drawing from the University of California at San Francisco's essential library of Legacy Tobacco Documents. In the early 1990s, Bain &amp; Co. the original parent company of Romney's Bain Capital, was floundering, teetering on the edge of bankruptcy. As revealed by Tim Dickinson writing for Rolling Stone, its leaders then asked Mitt to come back and essentially rescue the company. Romney's initial rescue attempt was a disaster - leaving Bain &amp; Company so financially strapped that it had "no value as a going concern." Then he engineered a federal bailout of the firm that cost the FDIC and, ultimately, the American taxpayers $16 million and forced Bain's creditors to accept 30 cents on the dollar. In the end, Romney had the audacity to reward his old buddies at Bain with hefty bonuses while he simultaneously demanded a company bailout from the federal government. Finally, Romney charged Bain &amp; Co. a mere $4 million to arrange for these management consulting pigs to feed at the public trough. If 47 percent of the country are living large at government expense, you can certainly count Romney and his Bain buddies among them. But the hypocrisy of Romney's rescue of his old firm goes much, much deeper. With Bain still desperate for new business, Philip Morris quickly became one of Bain's most important clients. In the United States, Bain helped develop a strategy to lure smokers into switching to Philip Morris brands and increasing their overall sales. Within a few years, Bain helped the cigarette maker fend off rising public sentiment against tobacco and increased pressure from federal regulators, as well as defend smokers' rights. But an even larger source of Bain's profits came through its unique role in helping Big Tobacco get millions of Russians hooked on cigarettes. In fact, Big Tobacco became Bain's financial savior when it was still struggling to avoid insolvency. In the aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union, Western technocrats helped facilitate the transfer of Russia's wealth into the hands of a few oligarchs. The US government also got involved. In March 1993, Bain &amp; Co. received a $3.9 million federal contract to advise Boris Yeltsin's administration on the privatization of the Russian economy, like their tobacco industry. In that role, Bain served as the facilitator for British American Tobacco (BAT) to enter the Russian market, exploiting strategies to avoid Russian taxes, laundering money and bribing customs officials. With Romney's leadership, Bain helped international tobacco corporations buy up Russian cigarette factories. Bain became heavily involved in escorting BAT to the newly emerging market in post Soviet Russia, and helping to significantly expand the smoking habit in the Russian population. Romney knew of and approved the "let's get Russia smoking" strategy and was the immediate boss of Bain's Russian collaborators. That strategy was successful in increasing the rate of smoking among Russians by 300 percent in only a few years. The smoking rate among young Russians is now among the highest in the world - a public health catastrophe. Bain management allowed some of its employees to opt out of the project if they had moral objections to it. But Mitt hardly opted out; he was the ringmaster. Many people, if not most, would have a moral objection to making a living as, essentially, a drug dealer for "killer" tobacco, which was known at the time to be more addictive than heroin. But for a widely revered and high-level Mormon official who was already fabulously wealthy to condone and profit from tobacco investments and addicting millions of people to a destructive and deadly habit prohibited by his own beloved church is the Mount Everest of hypocrisy. And the frosting on the cake is, no doubt Mitt paid his 10 percent church tithing on the filthy lucre he received from Big Tobacco. Even my active-Mormon, Mitt-worshipping friends, family and neighbors will have a hard time with this one. In fact, every Mormon should be disgusted, and every voter should realize what an EMPTY SUIT this PERFORMER who would be president truly IS.</Msg><Username>giovannijay</Username><Timestamp>1351052149429</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 00:15:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351052360973-12</Id><Title>We are forecasting Romney defeated Obama !</Title><Msg>We suggest that you will re-align your portfolio accordingly.

This is the same guy one week ago was telling crowds "Obama's Mideast policy is unraveling". Romney has gone from serial flip flopping on issues to outright lying. Then there's his statement: "There are 47 percent of the people who will vote for the president no matter what," Romney said in the video. "There are 47 percent who are with him, who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe that government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you name it." This statement morphed into his saying his remarks were "not elegantly stated". Later he changed his position to his comments were "just completely wrong". This from a guy who paid just 14% in taxes. Think of all the elderly people, single parents, and war veterans trying to get back on their feet that he just threw under the bus. "appeared Presidential" hardly, more like a man who will say anything to get elected. It is an insult to one's intellect to believe Romney's actions are presidential. His latest line of attack is saying attacking him is not an agenda. And, he states this while he simultaneously attacking Obama. How dumb does he think people are?</Msg><Username>of_course_your_right</Username><Timestamp>1351059167496</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 02:12:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351060623657-26</Id><Title>"The new economic Patriotism".

The governments of many countries are subsidizing industries within their countries to increase employment in their countries and the viability of their economies in the global marketplace. In short, it's not socialism, but an investment by governments to strengthen their economies and the standard of living of their citizens. This, in turn, results in increased tax revenues, which allows governments to provide benefits for those less fortunate in their societies to make it through tough times, or their remaining years. It undermines the idea of the U.S. being the number one superpower, if we do not take care of our elderly and disadvantaged people, if our education system remains in decline. Socialism is not what's going on....it's an investment in tomorrow. Today John Paulson gave $100 million to the Central Park Conservancy. Earlier this year Mark Zukerberg pledged $100 million for education to aid a school system - Bill Ackman has also pledged $25 million to Newark, New Jersey. These are people who have made it, and are voluntarily giving back to help others. Bill Gates and Warren Buffett have been doing likewise, and on a global scale. Your statement I referenced above is outdated. China, which will eventually become the number one economic power, subsidizes its industries through investment and protectionism. Without government help, U.S. industries, including the individual companies therein, don't stand a chance to go it alone against Chinese competitors. The U.S. government is part of the solution to keeping both employment growing in the U.S. and our industries strong. There are stages in the growth of capitalism. We are increasingly in the global stage, and the rules of play are changing rapidly.</Msg><Username>of_course_your_right</Username><Timestamp>1351064516556</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 03:41:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351068861676-29</Id><Topic><Title>Any Body Who Lies to Get to the White House</Title><Username>giovannijay</Username><Timestamp>1351053513016</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 00:38:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Just like you.</Msg><Username>mrstan4089</Username><Timestamp>1351068861676</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 04:54:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351068986636-30</Id><Topic><Title>Mormon Mitt in Bed with Big Tobacco</Title><Username>giovannijay</Username><Timestamp>1351052149429</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 00:15:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You liar</Msg><Username>mrstan4089</Username><Timestamp>1351068986636</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 04:56:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351069161146-31</Id><Topic><Title>Does the Romney Family Now Own Your e-Vote?</Title><Username>giovannijay</Username><Timestamp>1351050336920</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 23:45:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you nut job</Msg><Username>mrstan4089</Username><Timestamp>1351069161146</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 04:59:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351069341826-32</Id><Topic><Title>I have NOT been picking hemorrhoid j.farragut with a bayonet</Title><Username>mrstan4089</Username><Timestamp>1351051394987</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 00:03:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Is that all you got?

Stated Matthews: “Well, to reach back to one of our heroes from the past, from the ’60s, Saul Alinsky once said that even though both sides have flaws in their arguments and you can always find something nuanced about your own side you don’t like and it’s never perfect, you have to act in the end like there’s simple black and white clarity between your side and the other side or you don’t get anything done. “I always try to remind myself of Saul Alinsky when I get confused,” Matthews said on his “Hardball” show, speaking to guest Sen. Bernie Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, on the topic of President Obama’s health care plan. Alinsky is generally considered to be the founder of modern community organizing. He founded and trained community organizations to follow his methods, including organizations in South Chicago, where President Obama credits his political beginnings. The Washington Post reported Obama was hired shortly after graduating from college by a group of Alinsky’s disciples to be community organizer on Chicago’s South Side. Former 1960s radical and FrontPageMagazine Editor David Horowitz describes Alinsky as the “Communist/Marxist fellow-traveler who helped establish the dual political tactics of confrontation and infiltration that characterized the 1960s and have remained central to all subsequent revolutionary movements in the United States.” Horowitz writes in his 2009 pamphlet, “Barack Obama’s Rules for Revolution. The Alinsky Model”: “The strategy of working within the system until you can accumulate enough power to destroy it was what sixties radicals called ‘boring from within.’…. Like termites, they set about to eat away at the foundations of the building in expectation that one day they could cause it to collapse.” :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: Commiecrats/Progs, aka Democrats, are birds of a feather, no doubts about it, none!</Msg><Username>dons_st</Username><Timestamp>1351081584106</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 08:26:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351081620305-57</Id><Topic><Title>CONGRESS REPUBLICANS HOLDING AMERICANS HOSTAGE, VOTE THEM OUT</Title><Username>fireundersmoke</Username><Timestamp>1351081318589</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 08:21:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>We have to have educated voters in order to vote them out.

The President is powerless without Congress and our Congress number one goal is to remove the President, not help create Jobs for Americans. The Obama Budget has $1 trillion in spending for things passed under Bush and the Republicans but not one of those things have been canceled by Congress, Congress created the Debt we have and Congress can remove it. Our Congress only wants to cut things that the average American needs, not the gifts to corporations that they continue to pass and put the country deeper in Debt.

So, for starters, he will lose the national popular vote. Anyone who interprets undecideds as truly undecided and holds a torch for large numbers breaking for the president on election day is deluding themselves. Undecideds do not vote for the incumbent. This is a fact of historical significance. Undecideds always break for the challenger. Why? Any voter who cannot commit to the person who currently occupies the position is already divorced from that person. It may be amicable or it may not, but one thing is certain -- the vast majority will not come back on election day. These are the people who say "let's give someone else a chance". The reasoning and logic is clear, and it is inevitable. If the president cannot reach beyond 50% by election day, he has already lost the popular vote. But the application of this historical and logical fact is not limited to the national popular vote. It includes all 50 state votes that encompass the electoral college. As you analyze the 50 state votes and, more importantly, the "toss ups" or swing state polls, if the president does not already have 50%, he will not get 50% on election day. Which means he will invariably lose each state where he doesn't already have AT LEAST 50% locked in. Based on rolling averages and current results, Obama cannot win this election, and he already knows this. He has to put up a good show, otherwise he loses hundreds of millions in party donations, which risks greater party losses in both houses of congress, and he risks a mass defection of the moderate base that may not come back for a very long time. So showmanship is what this is all about now. The fat lady is singing. Reports indicate Obama's house in Oahu may actually be ready in time for their Hawaii Christmas vacation, which is already on the White House calendar.</Msg><Username>flippant_1</Username><Timestamp>1351088045244</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 10:14:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351088077451-109</Id><Title>ROMNEY IS IS A FULL BLOWN LIAR, A TAX CHEAT AND A BABOON</Title><Msg>this dude is complete baboon, if he was that good, how come he is not contesting Massachusetts.

People that lie on a regular basis have no remorse or regret when they don't tell the truth. Many times, they don't even think twice about it. They go on lying just as easily as telling the truth. Why is it easy for liars to tell a lie? It's become a habit for them. Just like any other bad habit, once you start doing it, you become more comfortable with it. After you become more comfortable with something, it's much harder to stop than to continue.</Msg><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1351088287310</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 10:18:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351088287563-114</Id><Title>Have you been caught holding worthless daytime shares of BAC?</Title><Msg>They lack clout.

I don't know if romney is the answer or can start to fix this mess, but he does have a plan whether it works or not only time will tell, obama not only doesn't have a plan, except socialism, he doesn't have a clue. But i can tell you this, this is about the last rodeo and obama is not going to fix anything just make it worse for the next fellow. I think this is why romney has been somewhat vague on touting his ideas on how to fix this problem, if he doesn't get a majority in the house and senate this could be problems on fixing things, but i guess he could do like obama and issue executive orders, obama has issued 923 executive orders in four years compared to 69 executive orders for george bush in eight years, this president is on the road to a dictatorship.</Msg><Username>montyprython</Username><Timestamp>1351088440569</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 10:20:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351088445749-117</Id><Topic><Title>Bank of America Corporation(BAC)</Title><Username>leafdnw29386</Username><Timestamp>1350999374629</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 09:36:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nice one, I will subscribe now.</Msg><Username>donnahpan98818</Username><Timestamp>1351088445749</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 10:20:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351088541739-118</Id><Topic><Title>It's a major breakthrough!

Some might have a different area. However until BAC can get above it and hold it convincingly it may frustrate some. However just as GE battled to get above that 19.44 and HOLD and other equities do with areas of their concern. Once that is accomplished then shareholders can expect a nice move towards the next area which is 14.58 and then wash rinse and repeat. We saw it thrust past on that 10.10 but then come back under. So it's a process. It takes TIME. However as time is passing BAC continues to become stronger and it's only a matter of WHEN they release the choke hold re increasing the divi. Should have occurred in March 2011. It's now OCT 2012. So if one wanted a rule of thumb. March of 2013 is as good a time as any to release the choke hold or June 2013. That is not that far out in the distance when one considers the upside rewards %. So if you trade it then watch that gap up to be filled and keep an eye on that 9.72. I work it with numbers of 1.62 in either direction. Take a peek to see how that matches up.</Msg><Username>mewing39</Username><Timestamp>1351092807547</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 11:33:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351092987378-145</Id><Topic><Title>Rape is God's will on Republican Platform?

Here's some facts. A majority who controlled a house voted NO on SEPT 29 2008 and as a result near seized the financial system aka CAUSE AND EFFECT. The incoming admin underestimated that egregious decision at that time. They certainly did later in 2009 as they saw the catastrophic losses that was caused by the selling that took Merill from a projected to be 2 billion to 13 BILLION. YUP cause and effect. So now we watched those with an agenda push thru their policies but not address the problem. TO DATE NO BUDGET PASSED.. Keep in mind they controlled the house and senate for the first two years. So NO EXCUSE. And enough with the blame game. If one wants to assign blame then look to whom voted NO on Sep 29 2008. Rep and Dem. Again I remind you it was a house that was MAJORITY controlled and a YES vote would have caused a RALLY and instead of WM going bye bye, Wachovia going bye bye etc. The mistake made was that a frustrated majority voted with emotion than intellect. You wouldn't hire a foot surgeon to do brain surgery. So why put in place a person who had no comprehension of just how serious the event was. And it was! The man could be the nicest guy in the world. He didn't have the qualifications then nor does he now. His record says it all. Time to bring in a a new team.

But the new printed pamphlet is to help the uninformed and the less educated to understand better. I don't need it in my case. The most important thing that really matters for this election is that President Obama can be TRUSTED. His character, intelligence and behavior is already proven and established. R-Money and Ryan are not only PRETENDING right now to be centrists WHICH THEY ARE NOT, but THEY KEEP LYING and FLIP-FLOPPING over MOST OF THE IMPORTANT ISSUES. It's a pathetic SHOW and REVEALS that they lack character, they are shifty and CAN'T BE TRUSTED. Lying to get to the White House means... also lying WHEN they are in the White House! Not only they lack GOOD CHARACTER and CORE VALUES, they also are NOT QUALIFIED and lack EXPERIENCE for the important position! They belong to the same party that gave us 911, TWO WARS, DEFICITS, and A FINANCIAL DISASTER! Their old policies ended in disaster for our country and economy! They're only counting on voters' short political memories and deception to win the election. As simple as that! Even though I was neutral on Obama, but WHAT'S the ALTERNATIVE? R-Money and Ryan CAN'T BE TRUSTED!</Msg><Username>giovannijay</Username><Timestamp>1351105900007</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 15:11:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351106242647-290</Id><Title>Fraud Street Ponzi scheme really starting to unravel!!!</Title><Msg>Fed QE3 Infinity program will not save it!</Msg><Username>rhinoinchgo</Username><Timestamp>1351106242647</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 15:17:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351106251808-291</Id><Topic><Title>Obama -- Energy Made In America ....

They take time because it's a more complex and time-taking transaction. Generally it's an 18-year cycle compared to stock markets 4.5 to 5-year cycle from bottom to top. The consumer first has to pay down the debt and save money is another reason for the longer cycle. Besides many are unemployed at this time. The damage done to economy was enormous and expecting that in 4 years it will come back is a figment of the imagination and purely being exploited by the GOP for politics. But then this is their usual politics and they count on short political memory of the electorate and the present high level of unemployment in order to succeed. Well this time many, like I, have learned and have LONGER memories. They will not get my vote no matter what they do! The GOP can't be trusted and their team already is showing it by their lying and flip-flopping.</Msg><Username>giovannijay</Username><Timestamp>1351106536669</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 15:22:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351106711501-293</Id><Topic><Title>How long will it take to disinfect the whitehouse after the obama's are evicted?</Title><Username>zevoter22</Username><Timestamp>1351106508403</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 15:21:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>bleach that place make it clean and white like my underwear</Msg><Username>treatmentbound82</Username><Timestamp>1351106711501</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 15:25:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351106902475-294</Id><Topic><Title>ANYONE WHO FALLS 4ROMNEY "I'll create 12m jobs" is a fool!!</Title><Username>monett4</Username><Timestamp>1351091883539</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 11:18:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The yearly deficit went up evey year under Reagan, Bush SR and Bush JR and has gone done under Clinton and Obama, now Romney wants to cut taxes and spend more isn't that how Bush destroyed the surplus ?</Msg><Username>sirifuture</Username><Timestamp>1351106902475</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 15:28:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351106923498-295</Id><Topic><Title>Obama Put A Written Plan For The Next 4 Years, Romney/Ryan Has No Plan</Title><Username>fireundersmoke</Username><Timestamp>1351104515546</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 14:48:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Oh Mama, Ohio is for Obama!</Msg><Username>giovannijay</Username><Timestamp>1351106923498</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 15:28:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351106968888-296</Id><Topic><Title>How long will it take to disinfect the whitehouse after the obama's are evicted?</Title><Username>zevoter22</Username><Timestamp>1351106508403</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 15:21:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In his second Term, he will turn losers like you in to productive members of society.

The first ADP release to include the new formula will be the October jobs report to be issued Nov. 1. The government’s official report will come out one day later. Economists and investors look at the monthly data compiled by Automatic Data Processing Inc. ADP -0.17% , the nation’s largest processor of company payrolls and the distribution of checks to employees, to glean clues on how many new jobs the government is likely to report. Yet the ADP report has often overshot the mark or undercounted the number of new jobs created when compared to the official U.S. report issued by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In September, for example, ADP said a net 162,000 jobs were created under its old methodology. The BLS put the number at 114,000 in its initial estimate (two revisions are to follow). But under the new ADP formula, the calculation is that 88,000 jobs were created last month. Over the past six months, ADP overestimated job growth by about 53,000 a month compared to BLS under its old approach. The new methodology results in a much smaller gap of just 1,000, according to ADP and Moody’s Analytics. As part of its overhaul, ADP switched partners to the large economic forecasting arm of Moody’s Corp. MCO +0.62% from Macroeconomic Advisers, a smaller St. Louis-based firm that helped create the original ADP report in 2006. Moody’s worked with ADP over the past year to refine the model and incorporate more data into the jobs report. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s, said in an interview they are also including more companies in their sample and surveying them more often. Each month, ADP and Moody’s will draw data from 406,000 companies that employ 23 million workers. That’s up from 344,000 companies and 21 million employees under the old method.</Msg><Username>gem_shorts</Username><Timestamp>1351111576381</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 16:46:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351111818392-340</Id><Topic><Title>criminal inside info GS shill maria bartroma and CNBC trying hard to crash financial</Title><Username>tom.foolery2</Username><Timestamp>1351110276602</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 16:24:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Long, but well worth reading!! Frank's fingerprints are all over the financial fiasco Globe Columnist / September 28, 2008 'THE PRIVATE SECTOR got us into this mess. The government has to get us out of it." That's Barney Frank's story, and he's sticking to it. As the Massachusetts Democrat has explained it in recent days, the current financial crisis is the spawn of the free market run amok, with the political class guilty only of failing to rein the capitalists in. The Wall Street meltdown was caused by "bad decisions that were made by people in the private sector," Frank said; the country is in dire straits today "thanks to a conservative philosophy that says the market knows best." And that philosophy goes "back to Ronald Reagan, when at his inauguration he said, 'Government is not the answer to our problems; government is the problem.' " In fact, that isn't what Reagan said. His actual words were: "In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem." Were he president today, he would be saying much the same thing. Because while the mortgage crisis convulsing Wall Street has its share of private-sector culprits -- many of whom have been learning lately just how pitiless the private sector’s discipline can be -- they weren't the ones who "got us into this mess." Barney Frank's talking points notwithstanding, mortgage lenders didn't wake up one fine day deciding to junk long-held standards of creditworthiness in order to make ill-advised loans to unqualified borrowers. It would be closer to the truth to say they woke up to find the government twisting their arms and demanding that they do so - or else. The roots of this crisis go back to the Carter administration. That was when government officials, egged on by left-wing activists, began accusing mortgage lenders of racism and "redlining" because urban blacks were being denied mortgages at a higher rate than suburban whites. The pressure to make more loans to minorities (read: to borrowers with weak credit histories) became relentless. Congress passed the Community Reinvestment Act, empowering regulators to punish banks that failed to "meet the credit needs" of "low-income, minority, and distressed neighborhoods." Lenders responded by loosening their underwriting standards and making increasingly shoddy loans. The two government-chartered mortgage finance firms, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, encouraged this "subprime" lending by authorizing ever more "flexible" criteria by which high-risk borrowers could be qualified for home loans, and then buying up the questionable mortgages that ensued. All this was justified as a means of increasing homeownership among minorities and the poor. Affirmative-action policies trumped sound business practices. A manual issued by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston advised mortgage lenders to disregard financial common sense. "Lack of credit history should not be seen as a negative factor," the Fed's guidelines instructed. Lenders were directed to accept welfare payments and unemployment benefits as "valid income sources" to qualify for a mortgage. Failure to comply could mean a lawsuit. As long as housing prices kept rising, the illusion that all this was good public policy could be sustained. But it didn't take a financial whiz to recognize that a day of reckoning would come. "What does it mean when Boston banks start making many more loans to minorities?" I asked in this space in 1995. "Most likely, that they are knowingly approving risky loans in order to get the feds and the activists off their backs . . . When the coming wave of foreclosures rolls through the inner city, which of today's self-congratulating bankers, politicians, and regulators plans to take the credit?" Frank doesn't. But his fingerprints are all over this fiasco. Time and time again, Frank insisted that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were in good shape. Five years ago, for example, when the Bush administration proposed much tighter regulation of the two companies, Frank was adamant that "these two entities, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are not facing any kind of financial crisis." When the White House warned of "systemic risk for our financial system" unless the mortgage giants were curbed, Frank complained that the administration was more concerned about financial safety than about housing. Now that the bubble has burst and the "systemic risk" is apparent to all, Frank blithely declares: "The private sector got us into this mess." Well, give the congressman points for gall. Wall Street and private lenders have plenty to answer for, but it was Washington and the political class that derailed this train. If Frank is looking for a culprit to blame, he can find one suspect in the nearest mirror.</Msg><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1351111818392</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 16:50:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351111931309-341</Id><Title>Obama wins another debate, AND another term.</Title><Msg>No amount of spin can change it.</Msg><Username>mr.whizzard</Username><Timestamp>1351111931309</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 16:52:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351112087167-342</Id><Topic><Title>Slobbering repug fools in denial.

According to some polls, he is about the same with Obama. I attach little value to, the Dog are nonsense figures but then are American. Campaigns make a difference and I have yet to see Romney can stand if Obama really steam. Romney himself is particularly worried about distractions, and rightly so. He only wants to talk about the economy, but he will not get away. Obama will harass him about anti-woman policies, anti-gay statements and anti-immigration rhetoric. Romney will, in other words, be held accountable. It was and is Obama's election to lose and I still believe that eventually he will easily win. That's more than an election analysis, I must admit. It is also sincere hope that America is a Republican victory spared. Not that Romney is so terrible. He is a reasonably prudent man, not very politically savvy and pretty opportunistic. He is not what I'm afraid of. It is the Republican party not in power may come. Could they win in November, then that, and I say it without drama, a disaster for America. After eight years of disastrous policy under Bush, four years of obsessive obstruction of the party and a total lack of realistic ideas about how to deal with the problems they have caused, making it difficult to imagine how deep the U.S. would sink me these guys return to power. Republicans are not anti-government or conservative, they are anti-everyone else. Only their own interests, their own way of thinking for them is acceptable. Republicans simply do not accept that Democrats govern. It is too easy for Republicans to put away like idiots, as Maarten van Rossem regularly, even if there among the electorate many weirdos. Also the only defender of the Republicans, whether or not a book to promote, would be scratching their heads over the reigns of the party. Only Theodore Roosevelt, Eisenhower and the old Bush can stand the test of criticism. For the rest it is seriously wrong with Republican presidents. The worst cases, Nixon, Reagan and Bush small (Cheny actually) are threats to democracy and the rule of law. So soon after the coup half of the Cheney party back to power threatens to come is bad news for everyone who contributes U.S. a warm heart. Given the neoconservative advisers Romney is also worrying to anyone that the U.S. a positive role in the world wants to see play. But that is not yet. Obama is a good president has been already sold his business out badly. He is also good campaign, especially now that he has realized that politics goes with it and you do not exceed the parties can hover like one of those parties never does something positive. Romney is a weak politician and that will prove. In short, there is still hope.</Msg><Username>hitobamaler</Username><Timestamp>1351113130043</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 17:12:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351113172149-348</Id><Topic><Title>BAC Premarket News</Title><Username>jaunitaapuz94729</Username><Timestamp>1351087613436</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 10:06:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Great share.

Women Review Debate 3 : First, Governor Mitt Romney Pasted the President Test, Ready to Lead USA. By USA_Jewish_Women 10 22 2012 Great Impression: Mitt Romney's Stunning Turnaround in Past 3 Debates after Huge Negative Ads. The Reasons for Change is Obama has Lost the Support and Respect with Women Voters and Others. People Notice: Most Men and Women are Turned Off Against Barack Obama most everywhere and Across All 50 States, Here is the the Review of Debate 3 on October 22, 2012 By a Jewish Women Focus Group of 7,890 Women Connecticut Across America Our Strong Plea for Change in the White House, Why? The following reasons listed bellow. Note: This review is a agreement amongst a Group of almost 8000 Women watching debates. During the Debate 3, President Barack Obama was Arrogant, Disrespectfully, Angry, Rude and Condescending to Governor Mitt Romney. Obama did not Act or Look Presidential. We Feel Governor Mitt Romney Pasted the Presidential Test and is Ready to Lead USA We Support Mitt Romney, found him to be a Smart, Respectable and Decent Gentleman. Governor Mitt Romney Looked Much More Presidential, Ready to be Commander-in-Chief. Mitt Romney said America Needs a Strong Economy in order to have a Strong Military for our National Security right now and the Future. ...... We All Agree. Women came away from this Debate with a Very Good Impression of Governor Mitt Romney, in that he would be a “ A Safe Pair of Hands.” in Foreign Policy and a Strong Economy. We Trust Him More. Obama lied about Libya on 9 11 ( a 8 hour fire fight, Obama watched did nothing) In Foreign Policy We feel Mitt Romney is Tough Enough to do what’s necessary, but laid-back enough not to do too much and get us into another war. Miit Romney Did Not attack President Obama's Policies, he Simply Pointed Out a Few Needed Improvements in a Very Respectable Way. During the debate Governor Mitt Romney Seemed More Like a Leader, Smart, Respectable, Thoughtful and Considerate. He looked and Acted more Like the New American President that our Nation and the rest of the World Needs so Disparately in These Troubling Economic Times. Governor Mitt Romney was Calm, Thoughtful, Relaxed, Steady, Looked Like A Smart Gentleman and More Presidential. Romney Looked and Acted as if he was Ready to Take the Job as Commander-in-Chief ASAP. President Barack Obama Looked more like a Very Disparate Candidate and Challenger, very Negative, Acted like a Disrespectful Attack Dog Instead of the President of the United States. Mitt Romney Expressed his Concern about Iran's Nuclear Threat that is 4 Years Closer and the USA Support of Israel, our Good Friend and Middle East Ally. The strained relationship with the Obama Administration. Tonight Romney Impressed the Ladies Very much, in that a Vote for Him is a Vote for American Security, Peace and Safety, a Strong Economy, a Strong Military, Millions of Higher Paying Jobs, Prosperity for the Middle Class and Others. and a Quiet Peaceful Life for USA and all People. The World is Much to Scary these days, Americans Aren’t Looking For a Scary Arrogant, Angry. Rude, Disrespectfully and Weak President. Barack Obama is Not the One to Lead us Any Longer Tonight we Came Away with the Feeling that President Barack Obama is extremely a more Scary Candidate then the President of USA. We are Concerned about America's Weaken Relationship with Israel, a Nuclear Iran, our Weaken Economy and the Huge 16 Trillion Dollars Debt, that in itself Threatens our National Security. Americans, Black, White, Latinos, Wake Up, USA Debt is Bigger than our Gross National Product. We Can Not Afford Four More Years of President Obama's Spending, Borrowing and lies. We Can Not Afford Another 5 or 6 Trillion Dollars in More Debt From China or Other Countries. Our Jewish Women's Focus Group of almost 8000 Democrats Therefore Proudly Endorse Governor Mitt Romney as the Next President of the United States of America.

In the Romney Family, if the baby has defects of any kind, the choice of Abortion is left to the Romney's. We know by the contract that was signed by Tagg Romney to the Surrogate of his children. The Mormon Romney family must be kept perfect and engineered against any defects, Abortion if an option. From the contract: "In the event the child is determined to be physiologically, genetically or chromosomally abnormal, the decision to abort or not to abort is to be made by the intended parents. In such a case the surrogate agrees to abort, or not to abort, in accordance with the intended parents' decision." Would Romney give the same right of Abortion because the baby has any kind of defect to All Fathers and Mothers in the U.S. ???????????????????????? The Romney's have so much money, they would be the best to ensure any baby with a defect would get the best of care. The Romney Abortion clause is bigger than that, ANY ROMNEY MUST BE PERFECT,,,Romney's are the perfect engineered family, defects would destroy the Romney Family Tree...</Msg><Username>fireundersmoke</Username><Timestamp>1351130151876</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 21:55:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351130192299-439</Id><Topic><Title>Obama -- Energy Made In America ....

The experts reading his body language in the debates depict a picture that is one agressive insecure person from the most reliable source possible- that of his body language. But we understand that because of the conditions and circumstances of his life in an affluent and politically powerful father George Romney. He never had the experience and life's hard challenges of the President faced hence he was not developed as the President was in overcoming those challenges of life... from bottom to the top! Mitt perched at the top and where can he go as far as life's challenges and experiences that shape a child? Thus he can't be blamed for who he is and who he is a liar and flip-flopper doing his 'best that he has' to become president but falling short of what's required by way of character and behavior. That is nothing but telling the truth... about Mitt and Barack... and this coming from a grandfather of 3 with living on 3 continents and several greatest cities of Earth!</Msg><Username>giovannijay</Username><Timestamp>1351132983421</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 22:43:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351133582564-456</Id><Topic><Title>Trump got fired</Title><Username>hawaiianlogic</Username><Timestamp>1351130082215</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 21:54:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Trumps ego is larger than his body.

I don't think he is impressing the majority through his lying and flip flopping. But he is hinging his hopes on the super rich 1% and their power to use their power/money to buy the media and at least influence the mentally weak and those whose memory is very short. The truth is that there are a class of folks who know nothing more than FOX news... and believe all the lies repeated day after day. But I think they are the minority in our modern times of easy access to information and the facts and speedy communication. But the GOP has an uphill battle going against the tide of progress and growing awakening. They will realize that sooner than they think by defeats and rejection. Critical mass is at hand as to the awakening of the youth the majority of which are better informed than the best strategists of the GOP like Karl Rove and his mates.</Msg><Username>giovannijay</Username><Timestamp>1351134274238</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 23:04:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351134277196-460</Id><Topic><Title>TWO SEALS FOUGHT FOR THEIR LIVES FOR 7 HOURS IN BENGHAZI AND NEVER RECEVED BACKUP</Title><Username>whitest_white</Username><Timestamp>1351114823121</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 17:40:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>YES HE IS</Msg><Username>gem_shorts</Username><Timestamp>1351134277196</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 23:04:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351135050972-461</Id><Topic><Title>The ONLY state that Obama might win....</Title><Username>kingofvietnam</Username><Timestamp>1351114480042</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 17:34:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Oh, I forgot the state of Conceit</Msg><Username>mrstan4089</Username><Timestamp>1351135050972</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 23:17:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351135209462-462</Id><Title>Obama a Commander-in-Chief, Romney as a Banal Bully</Title><Msg>"I thought the third and last presidential debate was a clear win for the President. He displayed the authority of the nation’s Commander-in-Chief – calm, dignified, and confident. He was assertive without being shrill, clear without being condescending. He explained to a clueless Mitt Romney the way the world actually works. Romney seemed out of his depth. His arguments were more a series of bromides than positions – “we have to make sure arms don’t get into the wrong hands,” “we want a peaceful planet,” “we need to stand by our principles,” “we need strong allies,” “we need a comprehensive strategy to move the world away from terrorism,” and other banalities. This has been Romney’s problem all along, of course, but in the first debate he managed to disguise his vacuousness with a surprisingly combative, well-rehearsed performance. By the second debate, the disguise was wearing thin. Most news sources are funded by corporations and investors. Their goal is to drive people to advertisers while pushing the corporate agenda. NationofChange is a 501(c)3 organization funded almost 100% from its readers–you! Our only accountability is to the public. Click here to make a generous donation. In tonight’s debate, Romney seemed to wither — and wander. He often had difficulty distinguishing his approach from the President’s, except to say, repeatedly, “America needs strong leadership.” On the few occasions when Romney managed to criticize the President, he called for a more assertive foreign policy – but he never specified exactly what that assertiveness would entail. He wanted “tougher economic sanctions on Iran,” for example, or “stronger support for Israel” – the details of which were never revealed. Obama’s most targeted criticism of Romney, on the other hand, went to Romney’s core weakness – that Romney’s positions have been inconsistent, superficial, and often wrong: “Every time you’ve offered an opinion,” said Obama, “you’ve been wrong.” Nonetheless, I kept wishing Obama would take more credit for one of the most successful foreign policies of any administration in decades: not only finding and killing Osama bin Laden but also ridding the world of Libya’s Gaddafi without getting drawn into a war, imposing extraordinary economic hardship on Iran, isolating Syria, and navigating the treacherous waters of Arab Spring. Obama pointed to these achievements, but I thought he could have knitted them together into an overall approach to world affairs that has been in sharp contrast to the swaggering, bombastic foreign policies of his predecessor. Like George W. Bush, Mitt Romney has a pronounced tendency to rush to judgment – to assert America’s military power too quickly, and to assume that we’ll be viewed as weak if we use diplomacy and seek the cooperation of other nations (including Russia and China) before making our moves. President Obama won tonight’s debate not only because he knows more about foreign policy than does Mitt Romney, but because Obama understands how to wield the soft as well as the hard power of America. He came off as more subtle and convincing than Romney – more authoritative – because, in reality, he is. Although tonight’s topic was foreign policy, I hope Americans understand it was also about every other major challenge we face. Mitt Romney is not only a cold warrior; he’s also a class warrior. And the two are closely related. Romney tries to disguise both within an amenable demeanor. But in both capacities, he’s a bully." There was no doubt who knew the business of LEADING and who was the bully who was mostly repeating the President's lines and trying to rise by approving the President's actions and policies to gain some respectability in the process. Mitt exhibited some tiny awareness that he could not act aggressively in an area of proven leadership in a new era of the world where SHARING and COOPERATION is the ONLY way to go and BULLYING DAYS ARE OVER! But tell that to the GOP that is still living in the 50's having ousted the few statesmen they had like Senator Lugar. The ugly and short sighted bully Sen. Mitch McConnell is the GOP leader now taking the party to its SECOND DEFEAT!</Msg><Username>giovannijay</Username><Timestamp>1351135209462</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 23:20:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351135227439-463</Id><Topic><Title>Democrats claim strength in Nevada .....</Title><Username>dumpobamie</Username><Timestamp>1351128190081</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 21:23:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You are such a liar!!!</Msg><Username>mrstan4089</Username><Timestamp>1351135227439</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 23:20:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351135443835-464</Id><Topic><Title>Obama a Commander-in-Chief, Romney as a Banal Bully</Title><Username>giovannijay</Username><Timestamp>1351135209462</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 23:20:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You'll be fired if your boss catches you posting when you're supposed to be making pizzas</Msg><Username>mrstan4089</Username><Timestamp>1351135443835</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 23:24:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351135880660-465</Id><Topic><Title>13 more days Fartie..ILMFAO...13 more days Fartie...ILMFAO...13 more days Fartie..ILMFAO</Title><Username>milesed18</Username><Timestamp>1351126283863</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 20:51:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's stuck really bad.</Msg><Username>mrstan4089</Username><Timestamp>1351135880660</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 23:31:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351136230553-466</Id><Topic><Title>Ann Coulter</Title><Username>hawaiianlogic</Username><Timestamp>1351129502469</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 21:45:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>She is a transvestite for your info.
