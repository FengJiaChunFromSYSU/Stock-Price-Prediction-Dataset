William Wilson, a Bank of America underwriter and manager in Charlotte, North Carolina, from 2010 to 2012, described what he said was called a “blitz.” About twice a month, he said, Bank of America would order case managers and underwriters to clean out the backlog of HAMP applications by rejecting any file in which the documents were more than 60 days old. Employees were instructed to “enter a reason that would justify declining the modification to the Treasury Department,” Wilson said.</Msg><Username>jam9011</Username><Timestamp>1372802200349</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 17:56:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372802312627-74</Id><Title>Bank of America Consumer Complaints-HEART BREAKING STORY! SO MANY ON WEB!</Title><Msg>In 2011 I went on disability. In January 2013 we found we were no longer able to make our mortgage payments. I called BOA and they said someone would contact me in about 6-8 weeks. In February I started working with my assigned rep Sheri and she sent me a letter with some forms to complete and return, which I immediately did. Some weeks later, Sheri called and asked for some additional information and the same forms that I had already sent. I explained she had all that was requested. I have been asked now at least 4 times for the same documents. I get a letter saying I've been denied (only got one letter), so I called to find out why. Turns out they need more paperwork. No one called and requested it. They just sent the same documents to me again. They then said they needed some additional information: a letter explaining the hardship, why we took money out of our 401k. These were faxed the day after being requested. Sheri called and said I've been denied because I hadn't provided proper paperwork and the SAME packet was sent to me. I explained I had sent them everything already. She said she would send it back to underwriting. A week ago I received a letter saying they were sending someone TO MY HOME to collect the paperwork (that they already had). I refused to deal with their representative. I just refused his calls. Today they (another rep named Virginia) called to tell me again that I've been denied. They asked if I could make a payment and I told them (truthfully) no. She asked a couple more questions and I told her that I already submitted all the requested paperwork. She said she would consult with my regular rep, Sheri, and have my file sent back to underwriting.I am certain they are just playing silly games, and expensive ones as well. All the letters and paperwork they keep sending me to complete are always sent FedEx. Who's paying for that? All the papers and letters they send are via a third party and BOA has no control over them, so I am bombarded with the same letter, same request and threat of denial. I am sure they have no intentions whatsoever of helping me retain my house. I am fed up with their ridiculous game of paper chase and contacted an attorney today to see what I can do. Right now, I am considering walking away from the house altogether just to be free of their constant harassment.</Msg><Username>jam9011</Username><Timestamp>1372802312627</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 17:58:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372802771124-75</Id><Topic><Title>so is russia leading the new space race?

This is why unions can be a great idea but they have all the same problems as other groups of humans including businesses.
