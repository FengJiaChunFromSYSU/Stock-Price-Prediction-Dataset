The president's margin over Romney in the daily rolling poll was unchanged from Saturday's numbers, turning up the heat on Republican strategists who were hoping for a more muted post-convention "bounce" for Obama in the wake of Friday's release of weak employment numbers. "It means (Democrats) are on good footing going into the rest of the election," Ipsos pollster Julia Clark said. Obama's lead already was more sustained than a smaller and shorter-lived boost that Romney enjoyed after the Republican convention finished in Tampa, Florida on August 30, Clark said. The Democratic convention ran through Thursday night in Charlotte, North Carolina. "The task is now to stay on the message as we're still quite a ways away from the election," Clark said, reiterating her prediction that the gap in poll numbers between Obama and Romney is likely to narrow and stay close up to November 6. Senior advisers to Romney rejected the idea that they would panic after several polls showed the former Massachusetts governor losing in key swing states, saying such results reflected the recent Democratic convention and not the ongoing tight race. "An incumbent president who is below 50 percent in the polls is in a very bad place," one senior Romney adviser said. Another adviser said, "if we're at 47-45 (with Obama leading) going into the Thursday before the election, I'd be very comfortable we'd win." DIRECTION OF JOBS, ECONOMY What Romney advisers are banking on is Americans' feelings about Obama's handling of the U.S. economy. "Mitt has improved his standing in battleground states and is positioned perfectly on the issue of the economy with swing voters, who are so down on President Obama's performance in office," the first senior adviser to Romney said. Sunday's Reuters/Ipsos poll showed Romney leading in popularity among registered independent voters, with 35 percent of them saying they would vote for him. Obama had 31 percent. But asked which of the two "will protect American jobs," 32 percent of independent registered voters picked Obama, while 27 percent sided with Romney, according to Sunday's results. Among all the 1,660 registered voters surveyed, Obama scored 42 percent compared to Romney's 35 percent. Obama's ranking in that category has climbed steadily over the past two weeks of the daily poll, starting with 34 percent on August 28, reaching 40 percent on September 7 and peaking Sunday. "The public view of the economy is much more about personal perception than reality," Clark said, explaining that few people pay close attention to numbers or statistics. "The fact that the dialogue is in the public sphere and Obama has been defending his record, it's possible a little bit of that is sticking." At the same time, 72 percent of registered voters surveyed said the national economy and national deficit were on the wrong track, while 66 percent said the same about jobs and unemployment and 57 percent about the direction of things in the country in general, according to Sunday's poll numbers. Asked how they felt about Obama, 54 percent of registered voters were favorable. Romney's favorability trailed at 49 percent. Sunday's findings wrap up a series of daily rolling polls aimed at gauging sentiment during the two weeks of party conventions. For the survey, a sample of registered voters was interviewed online from September 5-9. The precision of Reuters/Ipsos online polls is measured using a credibility interval. In this case, the poll has a credibility interval of plus or minus 2.7 percentage points for all respondents.</Msg><Username>dawgeeeeedawg</Username><Timestamp>1347260930353</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-10 03:08:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347269040038-39</Id><Title>Stock Price</Title><Msg>Will BAC hit $20 this year?</Msg><Username>star26</Username><Timestamp>1347269040038</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-10 05:24:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347270163843-40</Id><Title>BAC BOOKVALUE $20.16 &amp; $636.18B in Cash</Title><Msg>Bank of America has $636.18B In Cash Trading WELL BELOW BOOKVALUE OF $20.16 ; U Could Double / Triple Ur Money in 1 - 2 Yrs</Msg><Username>sutton7michaels</Username><Timestamp>1347270163843</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-10 05:42:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347271182947-41</Id><Topic><Title>Chicago Teachers Union on Strike-MONDAY -Charter Schools will be open comprising around 12% of the students community.</Title><Username>urichey</Username><Timestamp>1347247746779</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 23:29:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This is a big problem for Mayor RAHM .350,000 students need teachers , not babysitters, they can't be on the streets.

Watch the movie 2016 and you will also respect Obama for the enemy he is to the US. Statistics indicate that 95%+ of all black people and at least 80% of Hispanics voted for Obama. Most all of the people are young people, where statistics show the majority of them supporting for Obama. During his 2008 run for President, Obama said he wanted to form a civilian army that was just as powerful as the US military. Obama's civilian army that he will form during his 2nd term will be composed on primarily black and Hispanic young people who support his goals of turning the US into his Marxist utopian dream. Hate is too vague and simplistic of a word. Knowledge and respect of your enemy is what serves one best.

White House Officials: Strangely, a Post story written this year in which Obama officials discuss the importance of the intelligence meeting and extol how brilliantly the president runs it. “Obama reads the PDB ahead of time and comes to the morning meeting with questions. Intelligence briefers are there to answer those questions, expand on a point or raise a new issue,” The Post reported. “One regular participant in the roughly 500 Oval Office sessions during Obama’s presidency said the meetings show a president consistently participating in an exploration of foreign policy and intelligence issues.”</Msg><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1347298866913</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-10 13:41:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347299057692-135</Id><Title>THOUSANDS OF BUSINESS CUSTOMERS LEAVE BANK OF AMERCIA AND OPT</Title><Msg>For accounts at credit unions!!!!!!! let us see bank of america deny it!</Msg><Username>oh_my_2012</Username><Timestamp>1347299057692</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-10 13:44:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347299063894-136</Id><Title>$PCFG Pacific Gold is on FIRE!! $.003 +0.0005 (+20.00%) bac</Title><Msg>$PCFG Pacific Gold is on FIRE!! $.003 +0.0005 (+20.00%)</Msg><Username>hogolddigger</Username><Timestamp>1347299063894</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-10 13:44:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347299091751-137</Id><Title>UH OH</Title><Msg>Timmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmberrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr</Msg><Username>sargntshort</Username><Timestamp>1347299091751</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-10 13:44:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347299250995-138</Id><Title>BAC DIVERSIFIES ITS NON-GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES IN FORECLOSURES</Title><Msg>For each foreclosure, it loses 3-4 customers immediately. it is the trickle down affect through family, friends, and business associates!</Msg><Username>oh_my_2012</Username><Timestamp>1347299250995</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-10 13:47:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347299409519-139</Id><Title>Take your interest to ...Westinghouse Solar, Inc.

The beautiful white candlesticks on the chart over the past 2 trading days before looked like march 2012 was repeating with possibly a bust through 10 this time but you had to open your mouth and give the hedge funds a breath to short us down and break the momentum. You are very well aware that there is no more protective multicent uptick rule for your stock or others in the united states now. You should spend your spare time campaigning to bring that all important rule back for financials. You are getting out of prop trading as a company so what have you got to lose? looks like you would stand to gain big time in stability and maintenance of bac's stock price. The momentum did not need you to stop the run by stating the usual blah blah blah blah blah of slogging through, slowly making progress....same old song and dance since the beginning of the meltdown in credit of 2008. Slogging though is not a necessary statement right in the middle of regaining the all important legitimacy of the 10 dollar stock price!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1 man, grow some knowledge as to how to take the shorting hedge funds by their vulnerabilities. You are smart enough to know that the shorts must pay the dividend on the shares they have shorted and your are smart enough to know the shorting day traders that raid the stock and cover intraday can only be nipped best in the bud by bringing back the multicent uptick rule. i suggest you make a second career out of campaigning to bring back the multicent uptick rule so bac can get back up above 10 dollars like it was so near to getting before you had to go and blab in the middle of the run up that stopped on a dime on your presentation. Thank you for your efforts to bring back the multicent uptick rule these past 4 years!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! wait, it is almost 5 years now.....oh the pain it has caused those who have 401k's, ira's, pension plans, municipalities with long stock mutual funds, etc, etc. did you see how they attacked bac almost in synchrony upon your presentation today? You cannot be blind to the timing and the 5 minute chart's proof today!!!! have a nice night and i know you are simply a victim of a stock market with no multicent uptick rule anymore. good luck in bringing it back to help our country's stocks stay more stable from day to day rather than crashing on a second's notice the way it is now and has been for nearly 5 years.

He had the perfect opportunity to take us over the 10 dollar top with a subsequent one dollar over night gap up while he had the spotlight shining on him!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! They took an $8.92, AN $8.92 for Bank of America AND TURNED IT INTO $8.51 starting with his presentation today. It isn't fair to him or us.

I am too die hard of a long to fool around with shorting very much. I will spend a huge amount of time and funds to stay long far beyond when I should be since the powers to be favor shorting via the continued lack of installation of a multicent uptick rule. This example taken from "everything2inspire" One day, a scorpion looked around at the mountain where he lived and decided that he wanted a change. So he set out on a journey through the forests and hills. He climbed over rocks and under vines and kept going until he reached a river. The river was wide and swift, and the scorpion stopped to reconsider the situation. He couldn't see any way across. So he ran upriver and then checked downriver, all the while thinking that he might have to turn back. Suddenly, he saw a frog sitting in the rushes by the bank of the stream on the other side of the river. He decided to ask the frog for help getting across the stream. "Hellooo Mr. Frog!" called the scorpion across the water, "Would you be so kind as to give me a ride on your back across the river?" "Well now, Mr. Scorpion! How do I know that if I try to help you, you wont try to kill me?" asked the frog hesitantly. "Because," the scorpion replied, "If I try to kill you, then I would die too, for you see I cannot swim!" Now this seemed to make sense to the frog. But he asked. "What about when I get close to the bank? You could still try to kill me and get back to the shore!" "This is true," agreed the scorpion, "But then I wouldn't be able to get to the other side of the river!" "Alright then...how do I know you wont just wait till we get to the other side and THEN kill me?" said the frog. "Ahh...," crooned the scorpion, "Because you see, once you've taken me to the other side of this river, I will be so grateful for your help, that it would hardly be fair to reward you with death, now would it?!" So the frog agreed to take the scorpion across the river. He swam over to the bank and settled himself near the mud to pick up his passenger. The scorpion crawled onto the frog's back, his sharp claws prickling into the frog's soft hide, and the frog slid into the river. The muddy water swirled around them, but the frog stayed near the surface so the scorpion would not drown. He kicked strongly through the first half of the stream, his flippers paddling wildly against the current. Halfway across the river, the frog suddenly felt a sharp sting in his back and, out of the corner of his eye, saw the scorpion remove his stinger from the frog's back. A deadening numbness began to creep into his limbs. "You fool!" croaked the frog, "Now we shall both die! Why on earth did you do that?" The scorpion shrugged, and did a little jig on the drownings frog's back. "I could not help myself. It is in my nature." Then they both sank into the muddy waters of the swiftly flowing river. Self destruction - "Its in my Nature", said the Scorpion... Good luck laid back trader. You seem to be quite laid back and patient.

But the enemy is their 1). rigid ideology that gradually has become outdated and unacceptable by the faster growing diversity of the people who naturally are progressive, flexible, more tolerant and accepting living in a multicultural society and increasing multi-racial marriages and friendships. 2). The demographic change is making whites a minority by 2039 anyway. 3.) the modern age and the easy access of information and knowledge and fast communications and connectivity that makes the facts known soon enough to show what was the GOP forte of taking advantage of 'the lag'... through lying, smearing and trickery to exploit the uninformed and the credulous. That advantage is now vanishing and their Machiavellian tactics are becoming useless. 4). pretending to be a party of 'high moral principles' and being 'fiscally responsible', and, touting 'family values', being 'against abortions', while invading other countries and killing hundreds of thousands of innocent people based on made up lies... etc. are no more positions to cover their extremism and not acceptable by decent people... whether in the U.S. or the rest of the world. The world is much more connected and better informed than what the GOP ideology takes as to be 'right' and 'good'. The GOP has no future... unless it radically changes. They are actually going against the times and the rising tide progressives open-minded and tolerant people. Contrary to the rising time... the GOP is becoming more rigid and inflexible by letting their insane religious zealots and right wing radicals to shape their politics. They have turned into OBSTRUCTIONISM as ttheir politics and exercise of 'democracy'. Should they succeed they could put the U.S. on a path of decline yet being a big threat to the rest of the world. An analogy of the situation would be partly comparable to the Ayatollas grab of power and dictatorial rule in Iran.</Msg><Username>giovannijay</Username><Timestamp>1347334512173</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-10 23:35:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347335663486-242</Id><Title>I DO NOT PAY $8.95 IF A TELLERS PROCESSES A DEPOSIT AT MY CREDIT UNION!</Title><Msg>BAC is simply a fee mongrel hungry bank. Pursant to the terms, the minute an e-banking customer has a teller process a deposit, he is charged a monthly $8.95 fee for the month. This applies to e-banking checking accounts at BAC in Nevada.</Msg><Username>nameno203</Username><Timestamp>1347335663486</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-10 23:54:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
