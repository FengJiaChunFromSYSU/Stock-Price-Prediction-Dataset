Things seem like they are finally heading in the right direction. I have held BAC for 4 years and doubled down at many points along the way. I think this uptrend is very real IF the 8.5B settlement clears. I am optimistic but it is still hard for me to see BAC win ANY court case-even if it should be a slam dunk like this one. If the court case clears i see BAC hitting 15 very quickly. I also believe earnings will surprise to the upside...probably around .30 per share or more.</Msg><Username>waldair</Username><Timestamp>1373085214499</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-06 00:33:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373087205912-2</Id><Title>wow. open high price fraud today by the thieving banksters who rob americans by</Title><Msg>falsifying prices of homes for poison loans to steal them who falsify the price of stocks to print money by falsifying the price and giving it to the fed who will then print money for them and give it to them so they can hand it to their certain special clients who then use the money to buy up american cities and homes to deprive americans of their land. sounds very familiar.</Msg><Username>hayzeuschrist</Username><Timestamp>1373087205912</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-06 01:06:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373087316227-3</Id><Title>how are the home thieves doing today?</Title><Msg>perhaps if they would include in their report just how many more homes they have falsified docs for to steal them we could get a better idea how much more thieving profit these pirates would - (not earn) STEAL.</Msg><Username>hayzeuschrist</Username><Timestamp>1373087316227</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-06 01:08:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373087512229-4</Id><Topic><Title>President Obama was just voted "Best President of the 21st Century"</Title><Username>doctrricardo</Username><Timestamp>1370973888627</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-11 14:04:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He ain't no president!

The government is now referring to our Social Security checks as a “Federal Benefit Payment”. This isn't a benefit it. It is earned income! Not only did we all contribute to Social Security but our employers did too. It totaled 15% of our income before taxes. If you averaged $30K per year over your working life, that's close to $180,000 Invested in Social Security. If you calculate the future value of your monthly investment in social security ($375/month, including both you and your employers contributions) at a meager 1% Interest rate compounded monthly, after 40 years of working you'd have more than $1.3+ million dollars saved! This is your personal investment. Upon retirement, if you took out only 3% per year, you'd receive $39,318 per year, or $3,277 per month. That's almost three times more than today's average Social Security benefit of $1,230 per month,according to the Social Security Administration. (Google it - its a fact). And your retirement fund would last more than 33 years (until you're 98 if you retire at age 65)! I can only imagine how much better most average-income people could live in retirement if our government had just invested our money in low-risk interest-earning accounts. Instead, the folks in Washington pulled off a bigger Ponzi scheme than Bernie Madoff ever did. They took our money and used it elsewhere. They forgot (Knew) that it was OUR money they were taking. They didn't have a referendum to ask us if we wanted to lend the money to them . And they didn't pay interest on the debt they assumed. And recently, they've told us that the money won't support us for very m</Msg><Username>zevoter01</Username><Timestamp>1373116650638</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-06 09:17:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373116876076-21</Id><Topic><Title>Gee j kerry got off his boat swiftly when he was caught.

You can have papers drawn to order his assets all be frozen at the same time you file harassment papers. He is the one stealing IDs, posting nasty stuff under new ID's,harassing people off the board by posting viciously against them under different ID's and he is the only one doing the antisemitic postings under constant new ID's. He has been posting on the board since 2007. He is 53 years old lives with his mother and does not work. He spends all waking hours posting vicious things. People complain to Yahoo, they take his account away and then he just gets a new ID. Apparently they can do nothing more.

WH or the 1%??</Title><Msg>The Census Bureau has reported that 15% of Americans live in poverty. A shocking figure. But it’s actually much worse. Inequality is spreading like a shadowy disease through our country, infecting more and more households, and leaving a shrinking number of financially secure families to maintain the charade of prosperity. 1. Almost half of Americans had NO assets in 2009 Analysis of Economic Policy Institute data shows that Mitt Romney’s famous 47 percent, the alleged ‘takers,’ have taken nothing. Their debt exceeded their assets in 2009. 2. It’s Even Worse 3 Years Later Since the recession, the disparities have continued to grow. An OECD report states that “inequality has increased by more over the past three years to the end of 2010 than in the previous twelve,” with the U.S. experiencing one of the widest gaps among OECD countries. The 30-year decline in wages has worsened since the recession, as low-wage jobs have replaced formerly secure middle-income positions. 3. Based on wage figures, half of Americans are in or near poverty. The IRS reports that the highest wage in the bottom half of earners is about $34,000. To be eligible for food assistance, a family can earn up to 130% of the federal poverty line, or about $30,000 for a family of four. Even the Census Bureau recognizes that its own figures under-represent the number of people in poverty. Its Supplemental Poverty Measure increases, by 50%, the number of Americans who earn between one-half and two times the poverty threshold. 4. Based on household expense totals, poverty is creeping into the top half of America. A family in the top half, making $60,000 per year, will have their income reduced by a total tax bill of about $15,000 ($3,000 for federal income tax and $12,000 for payroll, state, and local taxes.
