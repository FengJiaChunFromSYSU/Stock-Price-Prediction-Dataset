According to the Philadelphia Inquirer, 16-year-old Samantha Pawlucy said she was told Carroll High is a “Democratic school,” and that wearing a pro-Romney-Ryan shirt is analogous to the teacher, who is black, wearing a KKK shirt. "The teacher told me to get out of the classroom, I said 'no,'" Pawlucy told NBC Philadelphia. "She told me to take off my shirt and said that she has another one if I need one. And then the teacher asked me … 'are your parents Republican?' I said, 'I don't know.'” The teacher later apologized and insisted she was joking, but allegedly commented to the class next day that she could no longer crack jokes in class because a student had gotten her in trouble. Samantha told the Inquirer that the teacher's remarks upset her to the point where she had to leave the room.</Msg><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1349438032277</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 07:53:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349438416672-30</Id><Title>BAC is Melting UP !!

If not for all the people who have simply dropped out of the labor force, the real unemployment rate would be closer to 11 percent. The results of President Obama’s failed policies are staggering – 23 million Americans struggling for work, nearly one in six living in poverty and 47 million people dependent on food stamps to feed themselves and their families. The choice in this election is clear. Under President Obama, we’ll get another four years like the last four years.

Next month starts the Christmas rush, 600 thousand will be hired. Record enrollment for Social Security and registration in Medicare ends in November. The country will lose millions of people from the job force. President Obama is pushing education because so many of the people retiring were well educated and this country is getting dumber every day. I posted a true story 2 years ago, The company I work for opened a new plant in Texas and had to close it one month later because we could not find a work force educated enough to fill those jobs. The U.S. was number one in the world in Science and Math 30 years ago, now the U.S. is 17th in the world in Science and Math. Stay in School or go back to School, the U.S. needs you. The unemployment rate for people with a college education is under 5%, those without a High School education, unemployment rate is above 15%. Those with a college education will earn more than one million dollars more in their lifetime while people without a High School GED will never see one million dollars over their lifetime. Republicans pushing Home Schooling, your kids will never compete in the jobs market. People Schooled at home lack the Social skills children only get when they interact in a class room.</Msg><Username>fireundersmoke</Username><Timestamp>1349446825623</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 10:20:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349446897139-124</Id><Topic><Title>Humiliating</Title><Username>doctor_casanova</Username><Timestamp>1349386147925</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 17:29:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It is truly pathetic and humiliating.</Msg><Username>surreal.deal</Username><Timestamp>1349446897139</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 10:21:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349446897428-125</Id><Topic><Title>Ask Obama to show you these 800,000 newly self employed home workers????</Title><Username>watch_learn72</Username><Timestamp>1349446500689</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 10:15:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>right tell me what numbers they called where all these people are suddenly self employed working from their homes?

Traders are starting to get particularly bullish over gasoline prices – and that is bad news for the average driver, who may also be looking to vent his spleen at the voting booth. Reports of gas shortages along the high-demand west and east coasts may be fleeting – although deeply concerning – but they highlight a problem that's expected to persist in the U.S.: our refineries are getting old. Given that a new refinery has not been built since 1976, commodities desks on Wall Street are bracing for more refinery outages and fires just as the nation needs to gear up for the busy winter heating season.</Msg><Username>gem_shorts</Username><Timestamp>1349447720198</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 10:35:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349447731525-135</Id><Title>Demand Transparency.

We are concerned that BAC will soon need to increase its liability (reserve) for mortgage buybacks. This could cost several billion dollars, in our view. BAC's representation and warranty reserve, at 6/30, was $15.94B, as compared to unresolved mortgage buyback requests of $22.71B, a difference of $6.77B.

Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras hailed the trip as a very positive development at a time when his country is locked in negotiations with euro zone and IMF creditors who are holding back some 31.5 billion euros ($41 billion) in urgently needed loans. "The key is liquidity. That is why the next credit tranche is so important for us," Samaras told the German business daily Handelsblatt. Asked how long Greece could manage without it, he said: "Until the end of November. Then the coffers are empty." A German government spokesman said Merkel would travel to Athens on Tuesday for her first visit since the crisis began in late 2009, when a previous government revealed that Greece had hugely understated its public deficit. "It is a trip that of course happens to the backdrop of this very difficult situation that Greece is going through right now, the massive adjustment and reform measures that have shaped Greece for the past two years," Merkel's spokesman Steffen Seibert told a news conference. "We see that the reform efforts have increased under the Samaras government and we want to support that." The visit appears to signal that Europe's most powerful leader has decided it is essential to keep Greece in the single currency area despite is repeated failure to meet fiscal targets and economic reform commitments under two bailout programs. "This is symbolically very important. It points clearly to the fact that Merkel is not going to drop Greece, even though things are not going well there," said Carsten Brzeski, senior European economist at ING bank. Merkel has been vilified in some Greek media as dictating devastating austerity to Greece. One newspaper dressed her in a Nazi uniform on its cover. Germany's popular press meanwhile has systematically depicted the Greeks as work-shy tax cheats. Greek government spokesman Simos Kedikoglou said in a statement: "It's the first time in five years that the German Chancellor visits Greece. This visit ... will certainly be a further, important step toward future European decisions." But Greek labor unions called a work stoppage and a protest rally outside parliament during her visit, and a far-right anti-bailout party, the Independent Greeks, will demonstrate at the German embassy "to express in front of Chancellor Angela Merkel our opposition to Greece becoming a German protectorate". BIGGEST RISK TO MERKEL? Greece's crisis poses potentially the most serious risk to Merkel's re-election prospects next year, unless a way can be found to keep Athens afloat and avoid another debt restructuring before the German general election next September. In Brussels, a senior euro zone official said no decisions would be taken on Greece at the next European Union summit on October 18-19 because preparatory work on Greek reforms and the country's macroeconomic situation will not be ready by then. A Greek official told reporters negotiations with the so-called troika of the European Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund were intensifying ahead of a euro zone finance ministers' meeting in Luxembourg next Monday. "The government and the troika are working around the clock so that the progress is noted at Monday's Eurogroup and the Greek issue gets on the EU summit's agenda," the official said. Talks have been hampered by serious differences among the creditors over the long-term sustainability of Greece's debt, with the IMF arguing that bondholders will have to take further writedowns, sources on both sides said. European governments and the European Central Bank are now the biggest creditors. That would mean Germany, the biggest contributor to euro zone rescue funds, potentially having to write off billions of euros lent to Athens during the crisis. Merkel faces strong resistance in her own centre-right coalition against giving any further aid to Greece, depicted by rebel lawmakers as a bottomless pit. A senior official close to Merkel told Reuters last week it made no political sense to bring individual requests for aid to Spain, Greece and Cyprus piecemeal to parliament, and it would be better to bundle them together in one package. Spain, the euro zone's fourth biggest economy, has not yet requested a euro zone assistance package but is discussing the conditions with European authorities and the ECB. SPAIN IN FOCUS The leaders of Spain, France and Italy were due to discuss ways of supporting Spanish public finances at a meeting in Malta later on Friday on the sidelines of a Mediterranean summit. Euro zone sources say Spain is ready to apply for a partial bailout that would keep it in the capital markets and trigger ECB buying of its short-term bonds, but Germany has so far urged Madrid to hold off. Spanish borrowing costs have fallen from peaks above 7 percent since ECB President Mario Draghi announced that the central bank was ready to make unlimited purchases of bonds of euro zone states that signed up to strict terms and supervision. Madrid has to refinance some 28.5 billion euros in maturing debt later this month in a major funding hump. Draghi made clear on Thursday the ECB was ready to act but it was now up to euro zone governments to make the next move. Senior central bank sources told Reuters the ECB envisions buying large volumes of sovereign bonds for a period of one to two months once the program is launched, but would then suspend purchases for an #$%$ment period. During that time, inspectors from the EU or the troika would #$%$ whether a country is meeting the conditions of its aid program, to ensure continued compliance.</Msg><Username>mrj.premier</Username><Timestamp>1349453327574</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 12:08:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349453612532-205</Id><Topic><Title>Selling my FAS and buying FAZ</Title><Username>shortburner2012</Username><Timestamp>1349452593345</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 11:56:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>get a job, you degenerate gambler..you must be employed by fast money @ cnbc, they all a bunch of degeerate gamblers too.</Msg><Username>tom.foolery2</Username><Timestamp>1349453612532</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 12:13:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349453826964-206</Id><Topic><Title>9.71 finish today</Title><Username>kds5862</Username><Timestamp>1349449313412</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 11:01:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>soar back or BAC soar?</Msg><Username>kkobe36</Username><Timestamp>1349453826964</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 12:17:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349454127806-207</Id><Title>Ok.

Saefong, MarketWatch And while there are many factors that will influence oil in the months ahead, most of them point to the likelihood of prices falling to levels closer to $60 to $50 a barrel — or at least not making any sort of lasting impression at $100 in the fourth quarter. “Given the backdrop of slowing global demand and rising non-OPEC production, the odds are that Brent heads to below $100 as we get towards the end of the year, which will also pressure WTI to stay closer to $60 to $50,” said Kirk McDonald, senior research analyst at St. Louis-based Argent Capital Management. Overall, the selloff in West Texas crude oil has been “due to the converging bearish themes of lethargic economic data, lackluster oil demand and the continuing trend of rising domestic oil production,” said Smith. “Meanwhile, signs of slowing in China and a euro-debt crisis that rumbles on and on provide little reason to be bullish right now.” U.S. field production of oil has climbed to its highest level since 1996, according to Energy Information Administration data. Production is currently at more than 6.5 million barrels per day. See the EIA’s latest production data. “The renaissance in domestic production is real and can be attributed to improved exploration and production techniques as well as higher prices,” which enables the economic recovery of previously known reserves, said Michael Peterson, managing director of energy research at MLV &amp; Co. At the same time, “industry capital has rotated back to the U.S. en masse because there is no fear premium to operating,” with the U.S. and Canada the safest places to make large capital investments in projects, said Neal Ryan, managing partner at Ryan Oil &amp; Gas Partners LLC. The largest area of output growth among oil producers who are not part of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is North America, according to the EIA, which expects production there to increase by 1 million barrels per day in 2012. See the EIA’s Short-Term Energy Outlook Report from September. Oil should be “at the $60 to $50 level in the fourth quarter as long as Israel doesn’t employ a preemptive attack on Iran,” said Zahir. And, barring any specific supply-shock scenarios, Peterson said the likelihood of significantly higher WTI oil prices in 2012 is “limited” to less than 25%. When asked if $100 or $60 oil prices are more likely, Peterson replied: “$60 is more likely near-term,</Msg><Username>fairvalue23</Username><Timestamp>1349457271206</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 13:14:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349457283965-242</Id><Topic><Title>What a "surprise" -- Chicago cooks the jobless books.</Title><Username>southshoretrader</Username><Timestamp>1349455007892</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 12:36:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Is CNBC actually reporting the truth about these fictitious jobless numers?

If you don't believe it, think about when Obama took office, if the numbers were 8% when he took office, the real numbers revised only 2 months later were really over 10% when he took office. All employment reports have an error of plus or minus 100,000, I would concede that President Obama may have been given high number. The obsolete way we vote is even worse, the error rate is far more than 100,000, they are still counting votes weeks after an election, that is why we only wait until one concedes before the winner is posted. I am still not sure Romney was the real winner for the Republcians, Rick Santorum was given a raw deal, at the start of the primaries they gave a state to Romney that Santorum later won. Santorum would of had a load of money coming in but Romney got the money. In another state Romney got more votes than voters in that district and the next day the results were the same.

No surprise (to me) that machine forces would be so intent. It's how the bread-n-butter is made for their masters. A constant unending rain of small prints against the bid or between the spread. Looks like they're trying to set-up breaking the .30 line....and in expectation that they will do just that I've a low-ball bid at the ~.25 line just to add a bit more to my longer term basket (plus a tranche to trade). If .30 fails, and it looks like that's the set-up, then a quick visit to the ~.20 area is to be expected today...And just because it's Friday and forces love to overshoot such days if .20 should come up within the final hour I'll bet it'll try to take it back to close the .10 to .20 gap that opened yesterday morning. And if so that'll give me another area to add more. Machines at play, eh?

The only people who thought Obama won were the replacement refs. They’re saying close to 60 million people may have watched the debate. In fact, the only person who didn’t tune in was President Obama. President Obama talked last night about finding other sources of energy for the future. Other sources? He couldn't muster up enough energy for the 90-minute debate! To make matters worse, last night was President Obama's wedding anniversary. Let me tell you something. The only way his anniversary could've been worse is if he'd forgotten it. Conan At one point last night, President Obama said the one thing about being president is learning to say no. Especially when someone asks, "Do you feel ready for this debate?" Mitt Romney went after PBS last night. It's about time someone went after those guys. It's about time someone took some starch out of their collars. During last night's debate, Mitt Romney said he would cut funds to PBS even though he loves Big Bird. And he said he's definitely against whatever Bert and Ernie are up to. There was a coin toss to see which candidate would speak first. There was an awkward moment just before the coin toss when Romney asked, "What's that shiny little disk you're holding?" Jimmy Kimmel Live! Most analysts think Mitt Romney won the debate last night. Which means President Obama lost two fights on his anniversary last night. The president seemed a little bit out of it last night. He had all the enthusiasm of a husband talking to his wife's friends at a dinner party. The only thing that could have salvaged the president's performance would have been if the body of bin Laden fell from the ceiling onto the stage. Moderator for the debate last night was Jim Lehrer of PBS, and Jim was as in control of this evening as a replacement referee. Late Night with Jimmy Fallon During last night's debate Mitt Romney said that he loves Big Bird. What made it even more awkward was that the question was, "Can you explain your tax plan?" Last night was the first presidential debate at the University of Denver. Of course, a lot of big names didn't show up for the event — Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi, President Obama. It was not a good night for the president. In fact, the president seemed to give long-winded, disjointed answers during last night's debate. Even Gary Busey was like, "Dude, you've got to focus." Jim Lehrer had trouble making sure the candidates stuck to the rules last night. Even NFL replacement refs were like, "This guy's a disaster!"</Msg><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1349466318783</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 15:45:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349466412336-325</Id><Topic><Title>Romney now leads in Florida, Virginia and one poll has him up in Ohio!!</Title><Username>obama_sucksass</Username><Timestamp>1349465150259</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 15:25:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>We need real change not a teleprompter president who works for the chicago mafia</Msg><Username>green_now16</Username><Timestamp>1349466412336</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 15:46:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349466493450-326</Id><Title>QE induced Ponzi Market FALLING FAST!</Title><Msg>This MAY BE THE BIG ONE Elizabeth!!!(Fred Sanford)</Msg><Username>mrj.premier</Username><Timestamp>1349466493450</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 15:48:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349466530379-327</Id><Topic><Title>YOU'D HAVE TO BE STUPID TO BELIEVE THOSE JOBS NUMBERS</Title><Username>bury_obama</Username><Timestamp>1349465903941</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 15:38:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>People don't believe anything they see/hear in the mainstream media anymore, by a 60/40 split.
