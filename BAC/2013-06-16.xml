The bigger problem is things like in CA where from the news reports it seems, and I haven't bothered to check but it sounds reasonable for now, they are price controlling milk- not subisidies to producers but restricutions on what they can charge. As grain prices went up, farmers were left wondering why feed the cow if the milk is restricted? I'm not sure the trumps can be bothered with stuff like this when they know how to succeed in business without even trying and they have much influence. ROFLMFO. The good news is that climate change may be moving the corn belt north faster than the pests can migrate but it does make crop decisions more uncertain. It wasn't too long ago they were paying farmers not to produce to keep prices up. Now they apparently at least in CA have to keep prices to the EBT program under control. The problem for farmers is that the cow food is being exported to people who produce things.</Msg><Username>spocklovesyou</Username><Timestamp>1371399712371</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-16 12:21:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371401053316-32</Id><Topic><Title>The world is paying off your debt with their savings and pensions .</Title><Username>dollar_printer</Username><Timestamp>1371375186731</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-16 05:33:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The feds are trying an insurance and regulation program no idea how this impacts CA, for example from the watertowndailytimes see quote below, but there seem to be real issues with there being too much or two little supply. No shortages of milk yet AFAICT but they can only do so much if the cows are going away ROFLMFO, Senate OKs farm bill granting USDA authority to regulate milk supply The federal government soon could have the authority to regulate the amount of milk produced by dairy farmers, according to a dairy program included in the farm bill that passed the Senate on Monday night. If data suggest there’s an oversupply, the government would shave a percentage of the payment farmers take home for milk in an effort to adjust national milk production and raise profit margins. That’s the gist of the Dairy Market Stabilization Program included in the federal farm bill that passed the Senate, 66-27. Enrolling in that program would be mandatory for farmers who sign up for a new margin insurance program that would replace the current Milk Income Loss Contract program.

Eventually the wealth and trust will run out, and then the appeased only have spite to fall back on. Did you ever know of a case where the CIA actiually gave stidents a drug intended to actually cure a disease rather than to disable the subject? The handicapper general will be the only means of appeasement left. It is unfortunate when criticla thought encounters a sociophile, the sociophile gets angry when balanced arguments are presented in an attempt to have both sides win by identifying problems and solving them rather than just trying to decide who takes from whom. Tampon praising death spiral is now in effect. ROFLMFO. The US was different, with no gulags and no way to enforce tampon praise. Socialism ultimately can become tampon praise when egos rather than gods are the center. This worked fine in Scandinavia at least with state churches, no one seems to like secular socilism for too long. ROFLMFO. It may still work but let's see how charitable the trumps are if the food supply is questionable.</Msg><Username>spocklovesyou</Username><Timestamp>1371432917188</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-16 21:35:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371436762838-104</Id><Topic><Title>Don Cassel the unemployed motorcycle grease monkey</Title><Username>dalsaucearneis</Username><Timestamp>1371429891093</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-16 20:44:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>i met don 5+ yrs. ago. he is a hard working guy who posts in his real name and stands behind what he posts. you may not agree with him but he is a honest man.-jmho-bucko</Msg><Username>muench.john</Username><Timestamp>1371436762838</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-16 22:39:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371437055450-105</Id><Title>The Best method for Trading</Title><Msg>Anybody here ever try oil trading?
