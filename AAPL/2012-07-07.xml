Yes Apple will go down because they are simply an electronics manufacturing company that has some interesting work conditions and now they are telling the American people that they can't buy any competitor's products with that Samsung ruling. It's like an airplane, it may fly missing three bolts and it may fly missing four bolts but that fifth bolt can be the catalyst to fail the whole system. Apple could be losing a bolt with their shameless exploitation of the consumer thinking they will discard their electronic product every year to buy the new one, I believe they will get tired of it. Another bolt is their shameless exploitation of their employees by paying them little when it comes to the grand scheme of how much they earn. Another bolt can be the arrogance of making a whole line of products that can't be recycled. Another bolt can be that even companies that don't have an electronics product history are now getting into the game i.e. Amazon. Another bolt could have been the loss of Jobs. There will be a point where the fifth bolt falls out and then look out below. No positions at the moment.</Msg><Username>jimp_22000</Username><Timestamp>1341661562468</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-07-07 07:46:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1341663339424-13</Id><Title>277000 Window PCs will loss internet on Monday due to Malware</Title><Msg>Zero Mac will be affected.

Long-term, I am also very bullish on Apple. However, next week I think Apple won't be above $600. Technically, the market in general is looking very bearish. I realize Apple sometimes trades without any consideration as to what the general market is doing, but next week will be very scary. After next week, there will be a grand opportunity to catch AAPL with calls.</Msg><Username>flixseal</Username><Timestamp>1341671438600</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-07-07 10:30:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1341671657604-39</Id><Title>Wang , RCA.

Even with their legendary grip on the supply chain I don’t see them extracting enough value unless the unit is priced at a minimum of $299, which puts it rather close to the base iPad 2 unit.Once more, it’s time to discuss Apple, so once more I’ll invoke Taniyama-Shimura and look at the world of the seven inch tablet and the iPad. When it was Steve Jobs running Apple it was easy. Jobs would say that something was silly, impossible, and a bad decision, until the moment that Apple announced a product that would revolutionise that area of technology. After some investigation, it will turn out that Apple has been working on said technology for a few years, internally iterating like crazy to get the perfect product. With all the talk of a 7 inch tablet I keep coming back to Steve Jobs dissing the 7 inch form factor when talking about the iPad. Given Apple’s previous form, that leads me to think that seven inches is bad… until seven inches is what consumers need. Strictly speaking, all the talk is now over a 7.85 inch tablet thanks to some nifty arithmetical calculations around display panels and pixel density (here’s Andy Faust’s explanation). This ‘mythical’ iPad Mini is an interesting test for CEO Tim Cook. Thanks to Google’s Nexus 7 the smaller form factor is gathering a huge amount of media love, although it remains to be seen if it is something that will translate into significant sales in the marketplace. Amazon’s Kindle Fire is probably the leading 7 inch tablet, with Samsung’s smaller Tab devices flying the flag outside of the American market. The issue that Cook will need to address is simple – does he start the production of the iPad Mini this year? To have any significant volume for the holiday season the decision needs to be made now. Can they let Amazon continue to build a presence and brand name in the 7 inch space, presumably with a Kindle Fire mk 2 on the way? Should they let Google demonstrate to their partners how to go about making smaller Android tablets with the Nexus 7? Apple are a conservative company, and if you assume an iPhone 5 is on the way it makes more sense to concentrate on the smartphone now, and keep an iPad Mini for the traditional ‘iPad announcement’ date in March. I’ve no doubt that Apple have a 7.85 inch tablet inside Cupertino. I suspect they have iOS devices with a variety of screen sizes, all being constantly tested and evaluated. Will any of them make it to the public before the end of the year? On balance I don’t think an iPad Mini is on the way to the public in the near future. ==================</Msg><Username>bretbecken</Username><Timestamp>1341674587865</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-07-07 11:23:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1341674624916-51</Id><Title>DoX StoxPix is calling for 619 on AAPL</Title><Msg>Trader Alert: DoxStoxPix is calling for AAPL to hit 619 Possibly by Monday, latest Tuesday early AM.

Apple will obviously tweak that to suit its needs. Moving to 4 cores would be a first for Apple, as the new iPad stuck to a dual-core design and beefed up the on-board GPU. A quad-core chip in the iPhone 5 would also likely share a similar GPU upgrade, meaning the handset promises to be an incredibly fast device. Of course, Apple can ensure iOS takes full advantage of all four cores, but app developers will likely have to update their apps to use the extra performance on offer. It does bode very well for games though, and would yet again show how quickly smartphones are catching up to dedicated gaming handhelds like the 3DS and PS Vita. A phone that’s 7.9mm thick, has a 4-inch 16:9 display, and is powered by a quad-core processor and upgraded GPU sounds like a very desirable handset. And that’s before you stick the iPhone name on it. not 100% the same quad-core ARM if so like you say why aapl manufacturing on their own IC manufacture they just bought not long ago ?</Msg><Username>aea_2gt</Username><Timestamp>1341688294974</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-07-07 15:11:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1341688314939-76</Id><Title>Same ignorant white trash that will never be able to afford 10 shares of Apple</Title><Msg>Blabbing on here as usual.

Kindle Fire is no match for the iPad, but the leading online retailer managed to sell nearly 5 million of its portable gadgets over the holidays. Google's Nexus 7 -- matching the Kindle Fire on both price and 7-inch screen size -- will begin shipping as early as next week. The proliferation of 7-inch Android-fueled tablets is hard for Apple to dismiss. After all, this is the one niche where Apple actually commands the lion's share of a growing market. Yes, the iPhone is a bigger contributor to Apple's business at the moment, but roughly two Android smartphones sell for every iPhone that's picked up. Apple's desktops and laptops are still the devices that many consumers associate with the company that until recently was known as Apple Computer, but Apple isn't even one of the world's five largest PC makers by unit volume. That leaves us with the iPod. Apple has had this market cornered for years, but sales of the portable-media player have been falling over the past two years.

Also, the iPad Mini, being smaller, makes it even more portable. For example, it will fit into a Doctor's Lab Coat pocket easily. It will be a huge hit in the Enterprise/Corporate sector. To classify APPLE INC. in a Ferrari category is "extreme". APPLE provides TOP QUALITY at a fair price, albeit the higher end range. I simply refer you to the APPLE REVENUES and UNIT SALES - which prove that APPLE's products are still affordable - BECAUSE the APPLE REVENUE and UNIT SALES speak for themselves. Furthermore, many carrier plans are beginning to offer incentives to add a tablet. I believe the iPad Mini will be a Holiday Top Seller. Why? Again, it will be TOP QUALITY at a VERY affordable price - and will likely LOCK-IN the tablet market for APPLE. Let us revisit this thread when APPLE reports the Calender Q4!
