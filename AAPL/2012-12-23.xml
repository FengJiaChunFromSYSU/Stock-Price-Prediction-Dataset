Rumor in the sense that nobody from Alibaba, not even anonymous sources, have mentioned it as a possibility. Rumor in the sense that only Yahoo longs have mentioned it as a possibility. Today Jack Ma controls Alibaba Group. After an IPO that might not be the case since he will not hold a controlling interest and the new Alibaba Group public company board of directors might chose some other CEO. Jack Ma has nothing to gain by Alibaba Group going public, but much to lose. He would not be the first founder to be kicked out of his company after going public. And I am also sure he has no burning desire to become the Jerry Yang and David Filo of Alibaba Group.</Msg><Username>dr.gloom</Username><Timestamp>1356280665806</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 11:37:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356283136038-15</Id><Topic><Title>Alibaba Group IPO in 2013</Title><Username>neo1278alpha</Username><Timestamp>1356275030008</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 10:03:50 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think what YHOO and Alibaba agreed upon as stated in the letter of agreement is that likely IPO is mid next year but Alibaba has the right to be the first buyer of YHOO stakes if YHOO decided to sell it.

Facebook users i'm sure are already posting things from yahoo sites.</Title><Username>stoxtxholdem</Username><Timestamp>1356295244896</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 15:40:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I won't get into your discussion with Dickey_Betts but Yahoo DOESN'T have more viewership than Facebook...Yahoo's has been pegged optimistically at 700M for quite sometime whereas FB has over 1B, 900M if you include fake profiles but I assume the same would hold true for Yahoo, knocking it to the 630M range. I just seen a special on FB, and they're growing a 100M users per quarter. As for time spent between the two properties its not even close, last I checked. It wasn't too long ago Yahoo users went from 3hrs to 2:15hrs in a single quarter. Facebook has something like 600M users login in EVERY DAY and of those they average 22hrs per month. Can't remember specifics but it was released in the past few weeks. Just found this: Statistics One billion monthly active users as of October 2012. Approximately 81% of our monthly active users are outside the U.S. and Canada. 584 million daily active users on average in September 2012. 604 million monthly active users who used Facebook mobile products as of September 30, 2012. ***While I could research more its the holidays after all, specifically the Hitwise or Comscore or SearchEnglineland answer to time spent online my question pertains to how $40 is a good deal for an acquirer. I posted my numbers, a few days ago, and giving AG an IPO valuation of $70B and later stake of $150B valuation I for the life of mean can't make a case for over $30 per share. If they cash out all their stuff, the core isn't worth multiples of its revenue, just isn't. As for "growth", I suggest you click on slide 4 from the latest earnings cause I see the words "flat YOY", 1% growth and 2% growth. Remember the online advertising market is growing far faster than that AND Yahoo had double digit declines from 09' on. They need 50% growth just to get to 08' levels essentially. Slide 12 goes like this $9.4B for cash(7.4B once Uncle Sam gets a $2B check), 954M Accts Rec., 309 deferred revenue, $7.7B on Yahoo Japan, and 8.1B for AG stake. $24.463B/1.2=$20.39 per share. I feel like Santa, haven't counted for taxes, but let's say that last AG stake is worth TRIPLE($24.3B) but that is an additional $16.2B in value/1.2B shares= $13.5+20.39= $33.89. I don't think the core is worth that $7 per share. If I apply a 35% tax rate to that 7.7B+24.3B=$32B(AG+Yahoo Japan) it falls to $20.8B, a loss of $10B or $8 per share to taxes. So now instead of $7 to reach your $40 it is now $15 for the core...are you telling me the core is worth $15 per share while also TRIPLING the value of the last AG stake???</Msg><Username>hotmodeltestid122</Username><Timestamp>1356317624120</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 21:53:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356321737784-35</Id><Topic><Title>Yahoo Updates Message Board Format</Title><Username>neo1278alpha</Username><Timestamp>1356103675212</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-21 10:27:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Only the mentally challenged haven't figured out how to use the new board.</Msg><Username>trotlightly34</Username><Timestamp>1356321737784</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 23:02:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356321799790-36</Id><Topic><Title>What is 35% of Yahoo!

Management with a vision and clear winning strategy does amazing things to perception of the company and pps. We will see in a couple of quarters if Marissa's strategy increases what the core is worth. I am betting it does and we will see multiple expansion. The next couple of quarters will give us hints of what to come.</Msg><Username>stoxtxholdem</Username><Timestamp>1356322113850</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 23:08:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356322326458-38</Id><Topic><Title>Facebook to Buy Yahoo!; Why not?
