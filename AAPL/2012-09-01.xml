The rectangular shape with rounded edges? Even though apple didn't originate that shape? The "bounceback" feature or other trivial features? Most people are under teh impression that apple has a patent on the "touch screen interface smartphone". They don't. Their patents are relatively trivial. Samsung spent billions developing LTE and they have key patents. Apple's next product will use LTE even though Apple spent zero developing it...but that's OK. And LTE isn't a tiny feature of the product, it IS the product.</Msg><Username>kenberthiaume123</Username><Timestamp>1346473023329</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-01 00:17:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346473144832-8</Id><Topic><Title>Obamanure's class and reputation is going down the drain</Title><Username>obadidos1</Username><Timestamp>1346472642305</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-01 00:10:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He never had any class to begin with.

Mark Zuckerberg knew all about how impatient public-market shareholders are. And he set up the whole company so he would never have to pay attention to their whining. •In the 9 months following the IPO, insiders would be free to sell more than 2 billion shares of Facebook that they had been holding for years •Facebook was going public at an astoundingly high price for a company with these characteristics--about 60-times the following year's projected earnings, in a market in which other hot tech companies like Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOG) were trading at less than 15-times. Even more importantly, if anyone had read the IPO prospectus, they also would have learned the following, all of which was expressed in a letter written directly to prospective shareholders by CEO Mark Zuckerberg: •Facebook's social mission is more important to Mark Zuckerberg than Facebook's business •Facebook's business exists to support Facebook's product development, not the other way around •Facebook's CEO is an extremely patient man who does not flinch under criticism •Facebook will never care as much about clients and shareholders as it does about its service and users •Facebook cares about the long term, not the short term (read: decades, not months). Facebook shareholders may be annoyed by those facts, especially now that the value of their stakes are getting demolished. But they can't say that they weren't warned. And they also can't say that the stock has been unduly punished: At $18, using the correct share count (2.7 billion), Facebook is still valued at almost $50 billion. And it's still trading at ~28-times next year's projected earnings of $0.65, an estimate that looks just as likely to be too high as it is to be too low.</Msg><Username>northofheaven2000005</Username><Timestamp>1346473730519</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-01 00:28:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346473847361-11</Id><Topic><Title>Empty Chair President!!!!!</Title><Username>obadidos1</Username><Timestamp>1346471828819</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 23:57:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Bump the empty!!!!!</Msg><Username>obadidos1</Username><Timestamp>1346473847361</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-01 00:30:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346473951088-12</Id><Title>Any Obamahos here?</Title><Msg>??????</Msg><Username>obadidos1</Username><Timestamp>1346473951088</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-01 00:32:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346474513213-13</Id><Topic><Title>Copy cat products should get banned immediately</Title><Username>endicotttsteel</Username><Timestamp>1346472587441</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-01 00:09:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A US Jury decided that Samsung was at fault.

I couldn't find anything from Google search. What should I search in Google to see a link? 2) Assuming you're right: "...and copying still continue."" No, copying is not continuing. They settled for 100MM, that means they bought-out the "copy-right". If Apple has stoled so many ideas that have been registered/patented from others, then how come no one has sued and won a case against them in US where these laws are enforced not like anywhere else in the world? Just because you have a good idea and share it with others but don't patent it, that doesn't mean someone else can use it and make money from it. You would do the same thing, us devils (humans) are motivated by nothing more than the old mighty $ no matter how high you're sitting on your high moral horse, so come down and face reality, idiots!</Msg><Username>plzplzplayfaster</Username><Timestamp>1346481986786</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-01 02:46:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346482899533-18</Id><Topic><Title>apple is what is wrong with america</Title><Username>seekanddestroyerss</Username><Timestamp>1346480624325</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-01 02:23:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"apple is what is wrong with america" NO, it's JACK #$%$ ES like you who posts constant BULL $%^ every MINUTE!</Msg><Username>plzplzplayfaster</Username><Timestamp>1346482899533</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-01 03:01:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346485240758-19</Id><Topic><Title>apple is what is wrong with america</Title><Username>seekanddestroyerss</Username><Timestamp>1346480624325</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-01 02:23:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obamanurist!</Msg><Username>obadidos1</Username><Timestamp>1346485240758</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-01 03:40:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346485279646-20</Id><Topic><Title>apple is what is wrong with america</Title><Username>seekanddestroyerss</Username><Timestamp>1346480624325</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-01 02:23:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Another Obamanurist!</Msg><Username>obadidos1</Username><Timestamp>1346485279646</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-01 03:41:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346485368002-21</Id><Topic><Title>apple is what is wrong with america</Title><Username>seekanddestroyerss</Username><Timestamp>1346480624325</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-01 02:23:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Just an Obamanurist!</Msg><Username>obadidos1</Username><Timestamp>1346485368002</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-01 03:42:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346485431820-22</Id><Topic><Title>CONGRATULATION</Title><Username>carlwilliams_2001</Username><Timestamp>1346471292052</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 23:48:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>PURE OBAMANURE!!!</Msg><Username>obadidos1</Username><Timestamp>1346485431820</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-01 03:43:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346485847120-23</Id><Title>Romney loses cool with reporter that catches him in a lie</Title><Msg>Check it out on Youtube!

CIA balked at chance to kill bin Laden in '99, Polish ex-spy says By ROY GUTMAN McClatchy Newspapers Published: August 29, 2012 Alexander Makowski, a former Polish intelligence agent, alerted the CIA to a chance to kill Osama bin Laden in 1999. Pictured in Warsaw, Makowski is the author of “Ferreting out bin Laden,” which offers details of how the United States missed warning signs of the deadliest foreign attack ever on U.S. soil. ROY GUTMAN/MCT WARSAW, Poland - In late 1999, two years before the 9/11 terrorist attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people, a group of Afghan agents loyal to an anti-Taliban guerrilla leader proposed assassinating Osama bin Laden. All they wanted was the $5 million reward the Clinton administration had offered for bin Laden's capture, says a former Polish spy who was the Afghans' go-between on the plot. The CIA rejected the plan, however, saying, "We do not have a license to kill." The story - the centerpiece of "Ferreting out bin Laden," a book by former spy Alexander Makowski that was published in Poland in June but isn't yet available in English - offers previously unknown details about how the United States missed warning signs of the deadliest foreign attack ever on U.S. soil. It's told from the perspective of an allied intelligence service whose specialty is human intelligence - recruiting and running agents - not the technological monitoring that's considered the United States' strength. "They gave us the exact location of the houses where bin Laden would be staying in Kandahar, the route he would be taking between his living quarters, his meeting place, and what kind of transportation he would be using," Makowski told McClatchy Newspapers in a recent interview, referring to the city in southern Afghanistan that was the Taliban's seat of power. The Afghans planned to use car bombs to kill the Saudi-born leader of al-Qaida. But on Oct. 14, 1999, a CIA officer whom Makowski identified as "Jim" flew to Warsaw with a response. "I would like everyone here to be absolutely clear on one thing: We do not have a license to kill," "Jim" told top officials at the headquarters of Polish intelligence. Makowski, at the time a businessman, said he was at the meeting. "We have to capture bin Laden safe and sound so that he can stand trial and be sentenced legally," Makowski quotes the officer as saying. "Any other solution is out of the question. CIA operates within the American legal order." According to Makowski, the intelligence proved accurate: bin Laden arrived in Kandahar as planned and stayed in the house as had been predicted. Could the Afghans have killed him? "I have no doubt," he said. Bin Laden's death in 1999 could have changed the American role in the world today, particularly if his death had demoralized al-Qaida enough that it abandoned its 9/11 plans. Both the war in Afghanistan, which continues to this day, and the war in Iraq, which claimed nearly 4,500 American troops, were outgrowths of the 9/11 attacks, as was the increase in anti-Americanism in much of the Muslim world. ADVERTISEMENT But Makowski's book isn't about the world that might have been. Instead, he uses the aborted bin Laden assassination plot as the basis for a much broader criticism: that the U.S. government, including the CIA, faced with a choice between a fundamentalist Taliban regime that had taken power in 1996 and the Taliban's main rival, guerrilla leader Ahmed Shah Massoud, sided with the Taliban. The bin Laden mission was not the only missed opportunity that Makowski highlights. He also blames the CIA for the attack on the USS Cole in Yemen in October 2000, which claimed the lives of 17 American sailors. "Beginning in 1999, for almost a year, we started giving information that bin Laden had made a decision to prepare an operation to attack U.S. warships in the Gulf," Makowski told McClatchy. "We started supplying details. There was a 27-person team, the command was divided and it was based in Dubai. We told them who its leader was, his passport number, his Dubai identity card and that they were preparing to attack a U.S. warship," he said. At first the CIA asked for more information. But after seven or eight months of reporting, the agency wrote back that the information is interesting "but they think such an attack is impossible," Makowski said. Three months later, the Cole was attacked as it was in port in Yemen. "To me, the most appalling thing is that after we supplied all this information about an attack on a warship in the Gulf, the Cole wasn't protected in any way," Makowski said. The CIA had no comment on the book or on Makowski's assertions. A former senior U.S. intelligence official said he'd never heard of Makowski, but he declined to speak on the record. Michael Scheuer, who from 1996 to 1999 headed the CIA's special "Alec station," which monitored bin Laden, said he was unaware of Polish intelligence on the terrorist leader. Makowski's former colleague, Gromoslaw Czempinski, who's a legend at the CIA for having led the rescue of six U.S. intelligence officers from Iraq in 1990, vouches for his story, however. "The Americans didn't believe us. They said, 'We have better sources than you do,' " Czempinski told McClatchy. "We offered them bin Laden, but they refused." Makowski's credentials are many. The son of a spy, he speaks fluent English, attended primary school in Great Britain and high school in the United States, and received a postgraduate law degree from Harvard. He graduated from the Polish military intelligence academy at Stare Kiejkuty, also the location of one of the so-called "black sites" where the CIA interrogated - and some say tortured - suspected terrorists, including the alleged mastermind of the Cole attack, Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, who now faces trial before a military commission at Guantanamo. Makowski spent 20 years in the Polish espionage service under the communist regime, rising to the rank of colonel, in charge of spying on the democratic opposition and tracking its finances. When the communist government collapsed, he was mustered out in 1990 and went into private business, though he never left the world of espionage behind. He gave McClatchy this account of his conversations with Massoud: Massoud was desperate for arms, financial support and a relationship with the United States when he reached out to Makowski in 1997. At the time, Makowski was selling arms manufactured by the Polish state arms industry. Arriving at Massoud's Panjshir valley redoubt in northern Afghanistan, Makowski introduced himself as a former spy. Massoud wanted to purchase three things: $150 million in Polish arms, equipment to mine emeralds and an arrangement to print Afghan currency in Poland. A high Polish intelligence official checked first with the CIA. "The CIA isn't interested in Massoud. He's not on their agenda. They don't want us to sell him any arms," the Polish official reported after a visit to Langley, Va., where the CIA's headquarters are. The CIA did say it had no objection to selling the mining equipment or printing money in Poland. Massoud and Makowski's relationship deepened, and eventually Massoud offered Makowski access to the extensive intelligence network he'd built while fighting Soviet occupation in the 1980s and carried on after the Taliban ousted the regime of Burhanuddin Rabbani, in which Massoud was the defense minister. Soon Makowski was focused on bin Laden. "There was a period of 12 months when we were tracking bin Laden basically day to day," he told McClatchy. He said he'd supplied the Polish intelligence services with "everything Massoud's service had on al-Qaida, on bin Laden and on the Taliban structures." The Polish service passed the information to the CIA, which sent "tons" of follow-up questions, Makowski said. Makowski thinks that was why Massoud granted him the access to his network in the first place. But the CIA didn't warm to Massoud, Makowski said, and it's unclear whether the information reached all the CIA analysts who were monitoring bin Laden. Scheuer, for one, said he couldn't recall "hearing of any information from a Polish government source on al-Qaida." He added, "I know that period pretty well." Makowski now thinks that Massoud held back intelligence about bin Laden and the 9/11 plot because of the CIA's lack of interest. "I am aware of the fact that the development of modern Afghanistan doesn't matter to the Americans," Makowski recalls Massoud telling him in August 1999. He knew, however, that the United States was interested in bin Laden, and he feared that if bin Laden were killed, the U.S. would reach an accommodation with the Taliban. He decided to play it coy, Makowski says. "I will stall for time until I make sure they had stopped supporting the Taliban and are ready to support me instead," Makowski said Massoud had concluded. In mid-June 2000, Massoud practically ordered his commanders not to cooperate with the CIA in hunting down bin Laden. Makowski thinks Massoud also avoided telling the Americans of bin Laden's plan for the 9/11 strikes. "I think there is a very good case that he allowed this to happen," Makowski told McClatchy, speaking of 9/11. Unfortunately, Massoud missed a key part of bin Laden's 9/11 planning: Massoud's own assassination, which took place on the eve of the Sept. 11 attack. "If it were not for his death days before, all the pieces would have fallen into place, and Massoud would have been returned to power," Makowski says, referring to the U.S.-led post-9/11 campaign that swept the Taliban from power. How did Massoud, the master of intelligence in Afghanistan, fail to spot the assassination plot against him? "Intelligence failure," Makowski said. "You have those things even in the best intelligence service." (Jonathan S.

A noted polymath, Franklin was a leading author, printer, political theorist, politician, postmaster, scientist, musician, inventor, satirist, civic activist, statesman, and diplomat. As a scientist, he was a major figure in the American Enlightenment and the history of physics for his discoveries and theories regarding electricity. He invented the lightning rod, bifocals, the Franklin stove, a carriage odometer, and the glass 'armonica'.[2] He facilitated many civic organizations, including a fire department and a university. Franklin earned the title of "The First American" for his early and indefatigable campaigning for colonial unity; as an author and spokesman in London for several colonies, then as the first United States Ambassador to France, he exemplified the emerging American nation.[3] Franklin was foundational in defining the American ethos as a marriage of the practical values of thrift, hard work, education, community spirit, self-governing institutions, and opposition to authoritarianism both political and religious, with the scientific and tolerant values of the Enlightenment. In the words of historian Henry Steele Commager, "In a Franklin could be merged the virtues of Puritanism without its defects, the illumination of the Enlightenment without its heat."[4] To Walter Isaacson, this makes Franklin "the most accomplished American of his age and the most influential in inventing the type of society America would become."[5] Franklin, always proud of his working class roots, became a successful newspaper editor and printer in Philadelphia, the leading city in the colonies.[6] He was also partners with William Goddard and Joseph Galloway the three of whom published the Pennsylvania Chronicle, a newspaper that was known for its revolutionary sentiments and criticisms of the British monarchy in the American colonies.[7] He became wealthy publishing Poor Richard's Almanack and The Pennsylvania Gazette. Franklin gained international renown as a scientist for his famous experiments in electricity and for his many inventions, especially the lightning rod. He played a major role in establishing the University of Pennsylvania and was elected the first president of the American Philosophical Society. Franklin became a national hero in America when he spearheaded the effort to have Parliament repeal the unpopular Stamp Act. An accomplished diplomat, he was widely admired among the French as American minister to Paris and was a major figure in the development of positive Franco-American relations. For many years he was the British postmaster for the colonies, which enabled him to set up the first national communications network. He was active in community affairs, colonial and state politics, as well as national and international affairs. From 1785 to 1788, he served as governor of Pennsylvania. Toward the end of his life, he freed his slaves and became one of the most prominent abolitionists. His colorful life and legacy of scientific and political achievement, and status as one of America's most influential Founding Fathers, have seen Franklin honored on coinage and money; warships; the names of many towns, counties, educational institutions, namesakes, and companies; and more than two centuries after his death, countless cultural references.</Msg><Username>white_knight_in_texas</Username><Timestamp>1346511671046</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-01 11:01:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346511705462-61</Id><Topic><Title>Apple going after 4 more Samsung products including the Galaxy S lll</Title><Username>robpic5</Username><Timestamp>1346499536772</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-01 07:38:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Your entitled to your opinion.

WAKE THE HECK UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Digest some FACTS... See below. Building Businesses, Creating Jobs Governor Romney's time at Bain Capital was spent fixing struggling businesses and giving new businesses a shot at success. From 1984, when Romney co-founded the firm, to February 1999 when he left to lead the Olympics, Romney helped save thousands of jobs at companies that were in trouble. And the businesses Romney helped start while at Bain Capital employ more than 100,000 people today. Since Bain Capital's founding, the company has had a remarkable record of success, especially considering that it largely invests with struggling or startup enterprises. Eighty percent of Bain Capital's portfolio companies have increased revenues, and only five percent of the companies under its control have filed for bankruptcy. Romney's work not only helped to save and create jobs, it also provided returns to investors, the majority of which were pension funds for retirees, university endowments helping with financial aid, and charities serving their local communities. This experience helped Romney fix a scandal-plagued and debt-ridden Olympics in 2002 and to fix a budget shortfall in Massachusetts. He knows how to provide strong leadership in challenging times, and he will bring that experience with him to the White House to fix America's broken economy and to create jobs for the millions of Americans who are out of work. The Obama campaign's attacks on business and free enterprise aren't just false; they explain why we aren't creating jobs. They reveal what this President really thinks about free enterprise. This is the most anti-business President in memory, and the results are clear: 23 million Americans are struggling for work, and unemployment has been above eight percent for 42 straight months. It's time to make a change to someone who understands the private sector and can get America working again.</Msg><Username>white_knight_in_texas</Username><Timestamp>1346515459017</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-01 12:04:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346515868057-73</Id><Topic><Title>WHO HERE THINKS STOCKS ARE HEADED FOR A VOLATILE SEPTEMBER?

(NASDAQ:AAPL), Tim Cook, and Larry Page, Google Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s CEO, engaged in a “phone conversation last week, and are expected to talk again in the coming weeks”, according to Reuters. These discussions are related to mobile patents and intellectual property disputes between the two rivals. The reports also indicated that lower level executives from both of the rival companies have also been engaged in talks regarding the issues. These reports come just days after Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) won a major lawsuit against one of Google Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)”s biggest distributors of their Android based mobile products, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (KRX:005930). So far, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has not called Google Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)’ to the carpet in the courtroom, but has chosen instead to take on Google’s distributors, such as Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (KRX:005930), HTC, and Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc (NYSE:MMI). The late co-founder of Apple, Steve Jobs, called Google’s mobile platform, Android OS, a “stolen product”, and up until his recent death, his main purpose in life seemed to be the destruction of Google’s flagship mobile product. It’s also interesting to note that Jobs felt betrayed by Google’s former CEO, Eric Schmidt, who pushed the company to build Android as direct competition to Apple, while he held a position on Apple’s board. When Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) debuted the iPhone, it strongly supported Google programs, such as Search, Maps, and YouTube videos. However, in recent years and in line with the ongoing dispute, Apple has taken major steps to move away from Google and develop its own applications apart from those offered to Android users. Could these talks be the signal that an end is coming to the long dispute, and that perhaps a cross licensing agreement could be reached between the two tech giants? Such an agreement was reached between Apple and Microsoft, and if Google could be persuaded to work with Apple to come to a peaceable agreement regarding the technology, The two could be an unstoppable force in the mobile market. Only time will tell what will happen between the two companies.</Msg><Username>lord_chatterly</Username><Timestamp>1346521915955</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-01 13:51:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346522048715-95</Id><Topic><Title>Apple and Google in Secret Patent Talks</Title><Username>lord_chatterly</Username><Timestamp>1346521915955</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-01 13:51:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Anyone have some constructive ideas as to a possible outcome of this story that broke this week ?</Msg><Username>lord_chatterly</Username><Timestamp>1346522048715</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-01 13:54:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346522583660-96</Id><Topic><Title>Clint Eastwood was to help Mitt Romney ! oops! he helped Obama instead ! hahahahaha</Title><Username>grouponnewbie</Username><Timestamp>1346462955944</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 21:29:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>...and doesn't want gov't in their personal lives etc." 1) Except when it comes to what you can or cannot do in your bedroom. 2) Except when you are raped Google search: "RNC 2012 - The Road to Jeb Bush 2016 - The Republican Platform" Then watch and learn!</Msg><Username>didihala_1</Username><Timestamp>1346522583660</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-01 14:03:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346523113779-97</Id><Topic><Title>Feeling lonely without AAPL</Title><Username>jai_hakim</Username><Timestamp>1346518385376</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-01 12:53:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Lol!</Msg><Username>escapegrl1</Username><Timestamp>1346523113779</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-01 14:11:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346523715197-98</Id><Topic><Title>Feeling lonely without AAPL</Title><Username>jai_hakim</Username><Timestamp>1346518385376</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-01 12:53:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well I don't give a sheit what you think, that is for sure.</Msg><Username>jai_hakim</Username><Timestamp>1346523715197</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-01 14:21:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346523857610-99</Id><Topic><Title>Romney's Cult is anti Beer,Wine,Spirits,Coffee ,Caffee and Coke</Title><Username>grouponnewbie</Username><Timestamp>1346512670646</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-01 11:17:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Romney is the candidate that no one (in conservative Republicans party) wanted (or he wasn't their 1st choice) but had no choice to endorse anyway.

Shortly after I got out it took a large $9 drop and the next day Sharp announces problems in delivering materials (glass window) for the new product(S) this will reduce sales finalized this quarter, already a disappointment. Then with the market up $120 aapl could only generate $1.37 up and struggled with that early on. The come back from $6 down was impressive but still not good. I am still happy to be on sidelines, I have been in since 80 and sold 4 times now and gotten back in lower, sold before last quarters earnings and got back in $30 less and expect more this time. Market is also vacillating. Due for a correction, hard to time when, but thinking soon real soon like sept 12th unless something totally new and not reworked comes out. Lets say iPhone 5 doesn't have LTE then this goes down $50. If you listen there are at least several products expected by the crowd, they had better be good or it will be sell the news.

It is like an "Entitlement Society" where people think they deserve this or that. The only thing the lazy liberal loudmouths deserve is a swift kick in the tail. The common theme with Owe-Bama is increasing the size of the Federal Government --- with High Taxes, Government Spending and Government Over-Regulation. He has governed like a Dictator or Monarch of the Middle Ages -- always interfering with the Private Sector. What is the result ??? High Taxes = Less Money in Your Pocket; Less Entrepreneurs to invest, innovate and create jobs. Government Spending = Direct INTERFERENCE in the Private Sector; Gov't spending should be limited to infrastructure, defense, etc. Government Over-Regulation = Again - Direct INTERFERENCE -and- CONTROL of the Private Sector; e.g. - Over-regulation of the Energy Sector has caused higher oil/gasoline prices. THE RESULT = LESS FREEDOM IN AMERICA -- This is the gift of the Owe-Bama Admin. for nearly 4 years now. And, with LESS FREEDOM, we see a less innovative society. The advancement of a civilization slows or falters. With LESS FREEDOM, America becomes less of an Innovative Society. Now, this brings us "full circle)....back to the top of this thread (copied below).... APPLE = THE ORIGINAL INNOVATOR What causes an Innovative Society? Easy Answer: History has already given us the answer - and that answer is FREEDOM. For 5,000 years, this world we live in...was in the Horse &amp; Buggy Era, like the old Middle Ages. Some countries haven't changed in the Middle East...even now. People in many countries have (or had) despot dictators on their backs, or monarchs stealing from them, or communal-type living that left people stagnate with little motivation but the status quo. THEN, the founders of the United States wrote a constitution that UNLEASHED FREEDOM, IMAGINATION, INVENTIVENESS -- and, in ONLY 236 years, the world was pulled out of the Horse &amp; Buggy Era, which had trapped the human race for 5,000 years. There are so many very important US inventions: Telephone, Electricity, the Light Bulb, the Combine for Harvesting, Computers, etc...that came from American inventors. If a society has a despot dictator, monarch or central government that does not RESPECT and ADHERE to the RULE OF LAW, then --- what motivation is there to INVENT and PATENT anything? Your hard work would be simply stolen. I wish to recommend a book called The 5,000 Year Leap. Ronald Reagan recommended that it be taught in all public High Schools. FREEDOM is not a Left, Right or Centrist Idea... FREEDOM is desired by every human being in the world. And, given the FREEDOM to CREATE and INVENT...along with an environment in which there are laws that will PROTECT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, a society will flourish -- just as it has done in the USA. Amazing inventions by American inventors have changed the world. Is FREEDOM increasing or decreasing in the USA? During the past 4 years, much government regulation has interfered with the Private Sector's ability to conduct FREE enterprise. Some regulation is needed, but... too much will stifle the FREE environment that has enabled the USA to thrive. In the book referenced above, it is recommended that the Burden of Debt be AVOIDED. Over-spending by the US Government is the wrong direction. A small, limited government made the USA an economic superpower; BUT....a large, bloated government saddled with debt could drag us down the path of Greece. Whether we like it not, economics and politics DO INTERSECT.

Did Owe-Bama even take ECONOMICS 101 in college to learn the "Law of Supply and Demand" ??? .....Owe-Bama has been inept, incompetent and way over his head from DAY #1. IN DIRECT CONTRAST, Mitt Romney is OVER-QUALIFIED to be President of the USA. This man has directly-created OVER 100,000 jobs still in existence TODAY. Get it ??? CHECK-OUT Romney's PRIOR TRACK RECORD --- and you will feel ULTRA-EMBARRASSED that you even doubted him for ONE SECOND. See below.......... This information is directly from Mitt Romney's website: Governor Romney's work at Bain Capital was about fixing companies that were broken and giving new companies a shot at success. Building Businesses, Creating Jobs Governor Romney's time at Bain Capital was spent fixing struggling businesses and giving new businesses a shot at success. From 1984, when Romney co-founded the firm, to February 1999 when he left to lead the Olympics, Romney helped save thousands of jobs at companies that were in trouble. And the businesses Romney helped start while at Bain Capital employ more than 100,000 people today. Since Bain Capital's founding, the company has had a remarkable record of success, especially considering that it largely invests with struggling or startup enterprises. Eighty percent of Bain Capital's portfolio companies have increased revenues, and only five percent of the companies under its control have filed for bankruptcy. Romney's work not only helped to save and create jobs, it also provided returns to investors, the majority of which were pension funds for retirees, university endowments helping with financial aid, and charities serving their local communities. This experience helped Romney fix a scandal-plagued and debt-ridden Olympics in 2002 and to fix a budget shortfall in Massachusetts. He knows how to provide strong leadership in challenging times, and he will bring that experience with him to the White House to fix America's broken economy and to create jobs for the millions of Americans who are out of work. The Obama campaign's attacks on business and free enterprise aren't just false; they explain why we aren't creating jobs. They reveal what this President really thinks about free enterprise. This is the most anti-business President in memory, and the results are clear: 23 million Americans are struggling for work, and unemployment has been above eight percent for 42 straight months. It's time to make a change to someone who understands the private sector and can get America working again.</Msg><Username>white_knight_in_texas</Username><Timestamp>1346528688949</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-01 15:44:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346528784028-136</Id><Topic><Title>Will there be heat or atenna issues this time?

If it's an iPhone app, you can make it available on the iPad, iPad mini, and iPod touch with very little extra effort. Remember, the iPhone is the best selling smartphone in the world, there is no android smartphone that has sold as many as the iPhone,,, you have to aggregate many different smartphones together to get sales numbers that approach the iPhone. Even with the iPhone 5 larger screen, Apple is going out of its way to protect the app developers investments by using a bigger screen in dimensions that will allow most apps to work unchanged. Many of the android users are low end, like the prepaids, and probably won't spend a dime on apps. And then you have to deal with all the different incompatible versions and form factors ... you can't just write one app and have it work on every android device.</Msg><Username>cofunloving</Username><Timestamp>1346529444833</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-01 15:57:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346529659781-139</Id><Topic><Title>Will there be heat or atenna issues this time?

More iPhone 5 supply rumours: Sharp display production delayed HOME MORE IPHONE 5 SUPPLY RUMOUR... Mobile News Apple iPhone 5 iOS +Lewis Curdie Yesterday More articles by Lewis Curdie As I was saying last week, it’s now tradition for any new iDevice launch to be preceded by rumours of supply shortages. DigiTimes got the ball rolling, and now none other than The Wall Street Journal is chiming in, with a finger pointed firmly at Japanese manufacturer Sharp. In particular, the DigiMen cited “low yield rates in the production of in-cell touch panels,” and issues with the “connector at the bottom of the phone”. Ultimately, its sources suggested Q3 shipments would be 15 million, not the 20 million initially forecast. The Wall Street Journalists, meanwhile, reckon Sharp “hasn't started mass producing screens for Apple Inc.'s next iPhone”. That’s according to “a person with knowledge of the situation”. Sharp is one of three manufacturers pumping out iPhone 5 displays (the other two being Japan Display Inc and LG), however it’s not clear how big a share Sharp is responsible for. Nor is it clear what the problem is. WSJ reports only that the delay is “due in part to manufacturing difficulties.” Earlier in the month, we heard that Sharp was in a spot of financial difficulty. Rumours that it didn’t pay its electricity bill for ye olde display factory are entirely made up.

Also if you write it in a structured way, it's not that difficult to port from one language to the other, so once you've done it for iOS, you can port to the various versions of android.</Msg><Username>cofunloving</Username><Timestamp>1346530243325</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-01 16:10:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346530421464-144</Id><Topic><Title>Romney's Cult is anti Beer,Wine,Spirits,Coffee ,Caffee and Coke</Title><Username>grouponnewbie</Username><Timestamp>1346512670646</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-01 11:17:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>i like a good wine, a glass here and there. i love champagne, a glass here and there. i drin coffee everyday. don't touch soft drinks, prefer water or sparkling water. but so what? it is good to believe in something. for some it is god, for some humanity, for others god in the context of a religion. i personally don't care for religion; but millions do. it is our right as american to choose what we believe in so long as we don't trespass others' right to believe. please grow up adn try to learn to think and talk/write like an adult, a mature adult, not a rambling buffoon. now when it comes to some social issues, republican need to be more progressive. it is mind boggling that we still are debating abortion, the rights of human beings to love and marry others adults of whatever sex and some other social issues. however, only an idiot will choose the president of the united states based on his religion, abortion,gay rights etc when our nation faces economic, fiscal, job, housing and many more crises...including an infrastructure that is falling apart, a nation that is divided and at odds with each other...bring to mind the old adage..divided we fall. we need a healing president that will inspire everyone to come together and find solutions of a better america for the future progeny. what is more precious than our children? look at them and ask what kind of country and future you are leaving them? is it better than what your parents left you? then do what is right regardless of political ideology..put the country before the party and the whole before the parts.</Msg><Username>faribachicagomed</Username><Timestamp>1346530421464</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-01 16:13:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346531176727-145</Id><Topic><Title>Sharp's financial struggles may try to put pressure on Foxconn investment by delayed the screen display for Apple's new iPhone</Title><Username>aea_35</Username><Timestamp>1346504721537</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-01 09:05:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>your statement is not a solid one because aapl has more than one suppliers for the i phone screen. secondly Sharp needs cash to pay debt you said Sharp will delay the aapl iphone screen production so that Sharp can force foxcoon to close the deal.</Msg><Username>tiger1004cy</Username><Timestamp>1346531176727</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-01 16:26:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346532207551-146</Id><Topic><Title>To fight Apple-flight, Microsoft must hang tough on Surface</Title><Username>lord_chatterly</Username><Timestamp>1344719189490</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 17:06:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Surface is going in the wrong direction, Microsoft doesn't understand the tablet market. Microsoft is trying to build a pc replacement ... complete with keyboard, kickstand, mouse, physical printer and USB ports (and maybe even a floppy disk option, lol), etc.. So the Surface will compete with HP, Asus, Lenovo, etc. but not with the iPad. I guess MS Office on a tablet is an ok idea, but lets face it, if you are doing intense spreadsheet or document creation, you will use a pc with a real keyboard, not a tablet with some sort of thin flexible keyboard. Microsoft doesn't even see the importance of a retina display. Think about what the iPad is doing ... retina, no physical keyboard, everything connects through the cloud (i.e. no usb ports), the push for Apple tv, the investment in siri,,,, apple is not trying to build a pc replacement with the iPad, and to me its as plain as the nose on my face where Apple is going with all this, but Microsoft is locked into the old way of doing things. Microsoft will not be fighting Apple with the Surface, they will be fighting the pc makers.</Msg><Username>cofunloving</Username><Timestamp>1346532207551</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-01 16:43:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346532605805-147</Id><Topic><Title>I learn so much from this board.Everyone is so pleasent</Title><Username>northofhell200333333</Username><Timestamp>1346285665657</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 20:14:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So people have been calling me trailer park trash!

I have pull out everything due to Sept. being a bad month and next year being more difficult to make money . I have been playing the stock market for over 30 years. I have had Apple stock for several years and it has made me very wealthy. My advice is be very careful this next month it will be tight and the market will bounce crazy. I do not expect for apple to climb a lot. The market is controlled by the analyst, they are often call mms. They will drop the whole market to make adjustment in the economy. Europe will make an influence in the market due to the debit including the USA. We are up for a new presidential election and it will make a difference, but the stocks are going to suffer and mutual funds will carry the market, this is the impression I got from the FEDS in this week meeting. Apple has some new changes in the whole technology due to it competitors, I will minimize my investment until I see the new direction of this economy. By the way I have made money as well lost some. example I had green mountain coffee and lost 135,000 dollars over a couple of days and finally had to take a loss and reinvest in something else. Good luck to everyone, I do own apple products. but all good things do come to an end.</Msg><Username>mr.megawatt</Username><Timestamp>1346545347651</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-01 20:22:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346545391031-202</Id><Topic><Title>AAPL WILL HIT $714 BY DEC 2012</Title><Username>aapltrillionaire</Username><Timestamp>1327447830000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-01-24 18:30:30 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>5\=-6]\</Msg><Username>lehmancalltrader</Username><Timestamp>1346545391031</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-01 20:23:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346545422364-203</Id><Topic><Title>AAPL WILL HIT $1,111.00 BY DEC 2013</Title><Username>aapltrillionaire</Username><Timestamp>1346078568072</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-27 10:42:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>g7fdty</Msg><Username>lehmancalltrader</Username><Timestamp>1346545422364</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-01 20:23:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346545433451-204</Id><Topic><Title>Does Samsung own LTE?</Title><Username>solve1enigma</Username><Timestamp>1346445045847</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 16:30:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What a bunch of #$%$ Samsung and Qualcomm are the leaders in the LTE patent space.

But is he a marathoner? On Hugh Hewitt's radio show Friday it sure sounded like he was, at least in his youth. Hewitt asked the vice presidential candidate whether he is "still running." Ryan answered that he "hurt a disc" in his back," so he doesn't "run marathons anymore." Instead, he said. he just runs 10 miles or less. The conservative radio host then asked him what his personal best time is. For a marathoner this is a badge of honor, but Ryan couldn't recall exactly. "Under three, high twos. I had a two hour and fifty-something," Ryan said. Hewitt was surprised, saying, "Holy smokes." Ryan replied: "I was fast when I was younger, yeah." But it turns out, he's only run one and it wasn't under three hours or even under four hours. The Ryan campaign told Runner's World magazine that the House Budget Chairman ran one marathon in 1990 when he was 20 years old. That was the Grandma's Marathon in Duluth, Minnesota. The running magazine reports he finished in 4 hours, 1 minute, and 25 seconds. Ryan spokesman Brendan Buck provided ABC News with this statement from the Republican vice presidential candidate: "The race was more than 20 years ago, but my brother Tobin - who ran Boston last year - reminds me that he is the owner of the fastest marathon in the family and has never himself ran a sub-three. If I were to do any rounding, it would certainly be to four hours, not three. He gave me a good ribbing over this at dinner tonight." ABC News asked Buck why the Wisconsin congressman made it sound as if he had run more than one marathon, but Buck only responded to confirm it was just a single race.</Msg><Username>plzplzplayfaster</Username><Timestamp>1346551922009</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-01 22:12:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346551971176-227</Id><Topic><Title>What would you do if you had a million in cash?

GWB's lies, ONLY about Iraq war Lie No. 1: “My fellow citizens, events in Iraq have now reached the final days of decision.” The decision for war with Iraq was made long ago, the intervening time having been spent in an attempt to create the political climate in which US troops could be deployed for an attack. According to press reports, most recently March 16 in the Baltimore Sun, at one of the first National Security Council meetings of his presidency, months before the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon, Bush expressed his determination to overthrow Saddam Hussein and his willingness to commit US ground troops to an attack on Iraq for that purpose. All that was required was the appropriate pretext—supplied by September 11, 2001. Lie No. 2: “For more than a decade, the United States and other nations have pursued patient and honorable efforts to disarm the Iraqi regime without war.” The US-led United Nations regime of sanctions against Iraq, combined with “no-fly” zones and provocative weapons inspections, is one of brutal oppression. The deliberate withholding of food, medical supplies and other vital necessities is responsible for the death of more than a million Iraqis, half of them children. Two UN officials who headed the oil-for-food program resigned in protest over the conditions created in Iraq by the sanctions. The CIA used the inspectors as a front, infiltrating agents into UNSCOM, the original inspections program. The CIA’s aim was to spy on Iraq’s top officials and target Saddam Hussein for assassination. Lie No. 3: “The Iraqi regime has used diplomacy as a ploy to gain time and advantage. It has uniformly defied Security Council resolutions demanding full disarmament...” Iraq has never “defied” a Security Council resolution since the end of the Persian Gulf War in 1991. It has generally cooperated with the dictates of the UN body, although frequently under protest or with reservations, because many of the resolutions involve gross violations of Iraqi sovereignty. From 1991 to 1998, UN inspectors supervised the destruction of the vast bulk of the chemical and biological weapons, as well as delivery systems, which Iraq accumulated (with the assistance of the US) during the Iran-Iraq war, and they also destroyed all of Iraq’s facilities for making new weapons. Lie No. 4: “Peaceful efforts to disarm the Iraqi regime have failed again and again because we are not dealing with peaceful men.” According to the Washington Post of March 16, referring to the 1991-1998 inspection period: “[U]nder UN supervision, Iraq destroyed 817 of 819 proscribed medium-range missiles, 14 launchers, 9 trailers and 56 fixed missile-launch sites. It also destroyed 73 of 75 chemical or biological warheads and 163 warheads for conventional explosives. UN inspectors also supervised destruction of 88,000 filled and unfilled chemical munitions, more than 600 tons of weaponized and bulk chemical weapons agents, 4,000 tons of precursor chemicals and 980 pieces of equipment considered key to production of such weapons.” Lie No. 5: “The Iraq regime continues to possess and conceal some of the most lethal weapons ever devised.” The Washington Post article cited above noted that CIA officials were concerned “about whether administration officials have exaggerated intelligence in a desire to convince the American public and foreign governments that Iraq is violating United Nations prohibitions against chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons and long-range missile systems.” The article quoted “a senior intelligence analyst” who said the inspectors could not locate weapons caches “because there may not be much of a stockpile.” Former British Foreign Minister Robin Cook, who resigned from the Blair government Monday in protest over the decision to go to war without UN authorization, declared, “Iraq probably has no weapons of mass destruction in the commonly understood sense of the term.” Even if Iraq is concealing some remnants of its 1980s arsenal, these would hardly deserve Bush’s lurid description, since they are primitive and relatively ineffective. “Some of the most lethal weapons ever devised” are those being unleashed by the United States on Iraq: cruise missiles, smart bombs, fuel-air explosives, the 10,000-pound “daisy-cutter” bomb, the 20,000-pound MOAB just tested in Florida. In addition, the US has explicitly refused to rule out the use of nuclear weapons. Lie No. 6: “[Iraq] has aided, trained and harbored terrorists, including operatives of Al Qaeda.” No one, not even US government, seriously believes there is a significant connection between the Islamic fundamentalists and the secular nationalist Ba’athist regime in Iraq, which have been mortal enemies for decades. The continued assertion of an Al Qaeda-Iraq alliance is a desperate attempt to link Saddam Hussein to the September 11 attacks. It also serves to cover up the responsibility of American imperialism for sponsoring Islamic fundamentalist terrorism. The forces that now comprise Al Qaeda were largely recruited, trained, armed and set in motion by the CIA itself, as part of a long-term policy of using Islamic fundamentalists as a weapon against left-wing movements in the Muslim countries. This policy was pursued from the 1950s and was escalated prior to and during the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan, which ended in 1989. Osama bin Laden himself was part of the CIA-backed mujaheddin forces in Afghanistan before he turned against Washington in the 1990s. Lie No. 7: “America tried to work with the United Nations to address this threat because we wanted to resolve the issue peacefully.” The Bush administration went to the United Nations because it wanted UN sanction for military action and it wanted UN member states to cough up funds for postwar operations, along the lines of its financial shakedown operation for the 1991 Persian Gulf War. Bush’s most hawkish advisors, such as Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and Vice President Cheney, initially opposed going to the UN because they did not want diplomacy to slow down the drive to war. They only agreed after Secretary of State Colin Powell argued that the pace of the US military buildup in the Persian Gulf gave enough time to get the UN to rubber-stamp the war. Lie No. 8: “These governments [the Security Council majority] share our assessment of the danger, but not our resolve to meet it.” This is belied by virtually every statement on Iraq issued by the governments of France, Russia, China, Germany and other countries opposed to military action, which have repeatedly declared that they see no imminent threat from Iraq. Bush brands his opponents on the Security Council as cowards, as though they were afraid to take action against Saddam Hussein. These countries were, in fact, increasingly alarmed—by the United States, not Iraq. Insofar as they summoned up resolve, to the shock of the Bush administration, it was to deny UN support for the war that Washington had already decided to wage. Lie No. 9: “Many nations, however, do have the resolve and fortitude to act against this threat to peace, and a broad coalition is now gathering to enforce the just demands of the world.” Only three nations are contributing military forces to the war: 250,000 from the US, 40,000 from Britain, and 2,000 from Australia. The other members of the “broad coalition” are those which have been bribed or browbeaten to allow the US to fly over their countries to bomb Iraq, to station troops, ships or warplanes on their territory, or provide technical assistance or other material aid to the war. None will do any fighting. All are acting against the expressed desire of their own population. Lie No. 10: “The United Nations Security Council has not lived up to its responsibilities, so we will rise to ours.” Bush defines the UN body’s responsibility as serving as a rubber stamp for whatever action the United States government demands. In relation to the UN, however, the United States does have definite responsibilities, including refraining from waging war without Security Council authorization, except in the case of immediate self-defense. Under Article 42 of the UN Charter, it is for the Security Council, not the US or Britain, to decide how Security Council resolutions such as 1441 are to be enforced. The US decision to “enforce” its interpretation of 1441 regardless of the will of the Security Council is a violation of international law. Lie No. 11: “If we must begin a military campaign, it will be directed against the lawless men who rule your country and not against you.” The widely reported US military strategy is to conduct an aerial bombardment of Iraq so devastating that it will “shock and awe” the Iraqi people and compel the Iraqi armed forces to surrender en masse. According to one press preview, US and British forces “plan to launch the deadliest first night of air strikes on a single country in the history of air power. Hundreds of targets in every region of Iraq will be hit simultaneously.” Estimates of likely Iraqi civilian casualties from the immediate impact of bombs and missiles range from thousands to hundreds of thousands, and even higher when the long-term effects are included. Lie No. 12: “As our coalition takes their power, we will deliver the food and medicine you need.” This is particularly cynical, since the immediate consequence of Bush’s 48-hour ultimatum was the withdrawal of all UN humanitarian aid workers and the shutdown of the oil-for-food program, which underwrites the feeding of 60 percent of Iraq’s population. As for medicine, the US has systematically deprived the Iraqi people of needed medicine for the past 12 years, insisting that even the most basic medical supplies, like antibiotics and syringes, be banned as “dual-use” items that could be used in a program of biological warfare. Lie No. 13: “We will tear down the apparatus of terror and we will help you to build a new Iraq that is prosperous and free.” The goal of the Bush administration is to install a US puppet regime in Baghdad, initially taking the form of an American military dictatorship. It is no exaggeration to say that the US government has been the leading promoter of dictatorships around the world, from Pinochet of Chile to Suharto of Indonesia to Saddam Hussein himself, who, according to one recent report, got his political start as an anti-communist hit-man working in a CIA-backed plot to assassinate Iraq’s left-nationalist President Qasem in 1959. A classified State Department report described by the Los Angeles Times of March 14 not only concluded that a democratic Iraq was unlikely to arise from the devastation of war, it suggested that this was not even desirable from the standpoint of American interests, because “anti-American sentiment is so pervasive that elections in the short term could lead to the rise of Islamic-controlled governments hostile to the United States.” Lie No. 14: “Should Saddam Hussein choose confrontation, the American people can know that every measure has been taken to avoid war and every measure will be taken to win it.” This combines a lie and a brutal truth. The Bush administration has taken every possible measure to insure that war takes place, viewing the resumption of UN weapons inspections with barely disguised hostility and directing its venom against those countries that have suggested a diplomatic settlement with Iraq is achievable. In prosecuting the war, the Bush administration is indeed prepared to use “every measure,” up to an including nuclear weapons, in order to win it. Lie No. 15: “War has no certainty except the certainty of sacrifice.” There will be colossal sacrifices for the Iraqi people, and sacrifices in blood and economic well-being for the American people as well. But for Bush’s real constituency, the wealthiest layer at the top of American society, there will be no sacrifices at all. Instead, the administration is seeking a tax cut package of over $700 billion, including the abolition of taxation on corporate dividends. Major US corporations are in line to reap hundreds of millions of dollars in profits from the rebuilding of Iraqi infrastructure shattered by the coming US assault. These include the oil construction firm Halliburton, which Vice President Cheney headed prior to joining the Bush administration, and which continues to include Cheney on its payroll. Lie No. 16: “[T]he only way to reduce the harm and duration of war is to apply the full force and might of our military, and we are prepared to do so.” Every aggressor claims to deplore the suffering of war and seeks to blame the victim for resisting, and thus prolonging the agony. Bush is no different. His hypocritical statements of “concern” for the Iraqi people cannot disguise the fact that, as many administration apologists freely admit, this is “a war of choice”—deliberately sought by the US government to pursue its strategic agenda in the Middle East. Lie No. 17: “The terrorist threat to America and the world will be diminished the moment that Saddam Hussein is disarmed.” No one, even in the American military-intelligence complex, seriously believes this. US counter-terrorism officials have repeatedly said that a US conquest and occupation of Iraq, by killing untold thousands of Arabs and Muslims and inflaming public opinion in the Arab world and beyond, will spark more terrorism, not less. Lie No. 18: “We are now acting because the risks of inaction would be far greater. In one year, or five years, the power of Iraq to inflict harm on all free nations would be multiplied many times over.” This is belied by the record of the past twelve years, which has seen a steady decline in Iraqi military power. Saddam Hussein has never been a threat to any “free nation,” if that term has any meaning, only to the reactionary oil sheikdoms of the Persian Gulf and to neighboring Iran, all ruled by regimes that are as repressive as his. Lie No. 19: “As we enforce the just demands of the world, we will also honor the deepest commitments of our country.” The demands of the world were expressed by the millions who marched in cities throughout the world on February 15 and March 15 to oppose a unilateral US attack on Iraq. Bush seeks to have it both ways—claiming to enforce previous Security Council resolutions against Iraq (“the just demands of the world”), while flagrantly defying the will of the majority of the Security Council, the majority of the world’s governments, and the vast majority of the world’s people. Lie No. 20: “Unlike Saddam Hussein, we believe the Iraqi people are deserving and capable of human liberty... The United States with other countries will work to advance liberty and peace in that region.” For “the Iraqi people,” substitute “the Egyptian people,” “the people of the Arabian peninsula,” “the Pakistani people” or those of other US-backed dictatorships, not to mention the Palestinians who live under a brutal Israeli occupation that is supported by Washington. Does the US government believe that any of them are “deserving and capable of human liberty?” When the parliament of Turkey, under the pressure of popular opposition, voted to bar the US from using Turkish territory to invade Iraq, the Bush administration appealed to the Turkish military to pressure the government into overturning this democratic decision.</Msg><Username>plzplzplayfaster</Username><Timestamp>1346553027985</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-01 22:30:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346553156329-231</Id><Topic><Title>September the Month !</Title><Username>radardeldinero</Username><Timestamp>1346537854097</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-01 18:17:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>total opposite actually im loaing my shorts lol the news has been out an dleaked about the iphone 5 and mini pad plus the marets had made a lower high its all down hill till after the election the fed dont want to fast of a run up youll see when u get crushed</Msg><Username>gcaravousanos</Username><Timestamp>1346553156329</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-01 22:32:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346553311756-232</Id><Topic><Title>Should a white people be better of chose a white men to die for ?</Title><Username>gren_mitchell</Username><Timestamp>1346552708238</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-01 22:25:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Even though your racist remark is understandable, I detect a heavy accent.
