I think that Verizon will report tepid sales of iPhone, just like last quarter (why would it get better?). But I think that's also expected, to a large extent. However, I think that iPhone sales worldwide will still surprise to the upside, as even though this quarter has a tough compare with last quarter (when China launched iPhone4S during their holiday season) many of the countries that sold iPhones were supply constrained. Apple, with their superior logistics, will simply flex their supply to meet the demand where it exists. So, the long and the short of it is that next week may see some disappointment for AAPL shares due to sympathy with Verizon, etc, and due to overall earnings weakness and problems (JP Morgan reports too!). But the following week will show a surprise, and AAPL will recover and then some. Just my hunch. I'm holding through it all, because that's why I do.

In China they are taking pre orders - very strange See Reuters</Title><Msg>By Melanie Lee SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Apple Inc's (AAPL) next-generation iPhone has not even been released yet, but opportunistic sellers on China's largest e-commerce platform, Taobao, are already accepting pre-orders, complete with mock-up pictures and purported technical specifications. The hotly anticipated iPhone 5 is widely expected to be released sometime between August and October this year, although Apple itself has been tight-lipped about it. Sources have said the iPhone 5 would have a bigger screen than previous models, while Taiwanese media reported the phone's voice recognition software, Siri, would have more powerful functions. Sellers on Taobao, a unit of Alibaba Group, are accepting orders for the iPhone 5, in some cases asking for a deposit of 1,000 yuan ($160) for the new phone. One seller, "Dahai99888", who started accepting pre-orders this week, is asking for full payment upfront, at a cool 6,999 yuan ($1,100). Taobao sellers that Reuters spoke with said they planned to buy the iPhone 5 in Hong Kong or the United States and then bring it to mainland China. Apple products are often available in Hong Kong before they are released on the mainland. The sellers could not promise a specific delivery time. The pre-order activity comes despite the mystery around the iPhone 5 and highlights the intense demand for new Apple products in China. Apple has not confirmed the specifications, details or price of the latest iPhone but the Internet rumor mill has been in overdrive, churning out photo renderings and pictures of purported iPhone 5 engineering samples, and speculating endlessly on its technical specifications and functions. Apple did not respond to requests for comment. "Demand is high, yesterday someone just bought two phones. Altogether we have about two dozen orders," said one seller on Taobao who went by the nickname Xiaoyu. Demand for Apple products in China is so high that many consumers buy smuggled goods in order get them before the official China release. Earlier this year scalpers queued overnight outside a Beijing store for the latest version of the iPhone 4, only to pelt it with eggs after Apple decided against selling the phone at the store because of security concerns. "It's not so easy to bring the phones from overseas, there's a limit to how many you can carry in ... If we could bring in a few thousand that will be great!," said Xiaoyu. One enterprising seller posted a list of 17 possible new iPhone 5 features and gave a percentage probability that they would be included in the new device. For example, bio-metric capability has a 20 percent chance of being a feature on the iPhone 5, according to this seller.

That’s the ladder of success,” he said in an interview with The Atlas Society. “Sometimes you fall off of that ladder, but we believe that there is a safety net that is there, and that safety net is to catch you and get you to bounce back up and continue to climb on the ladder. That’s what conservatives believe.” But liberals see it differently, West says. “[They] tend to believe that the safety net is a hammock, so you can stay there the rest of your life.” It’s a matter of economic freedom versus dependency, West says. “The ladder and safety net are part of economic freedom. The hammock is part of economic dependency. That is the collective versus the individual.”</Msg><Username>texexec60</Username><Timestamp>1342094228941</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-12 07:57:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1342094239778-56</Id><Title>Buying into the close $606 easy... $599 now....LMFAO...</Title><Msg>God!

According to reports out of Reuters, China's largest e-commerce platform, Taobao, a unit of Alibaba, is already accepting pre-orders despite sketchy details on the phone's new features. Buyers don't seem overly concerned, and orders are already coming in. Taobao is asking consumers in China for a $160 deposit, and another retailer, Dahai99888, is asking for $1100 upfront for the iPhone 5. The release date for the iPhone 5 is believed to be between August and October of this year. Apple will begin selling the new iPad in China on July 20th. Other companies with exposure to China's economy have been reducing guidance due to a slowing economy in Asia, but if evidence from recent reports is correct, Apply may once again prove be an exception to rules governing 'normal' companies.</Msg><Username>texexec60</Username><Timestamp>1342098970543</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-12 09:16:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1342098973781-103</Id><Title>CNBC needs to jettison Jim Cramer....</Title><Msg>I can't watch CNBC anymore.

The hotly anticipated iPhone 5 is widely expected to be released sometime between August and October this year, although Apple itself has been tight-lipped about it. Sources have said the iPhone 5 would have a bigger screen than previous models, while Taiwanese media reported the phone's voice recognition software, Siri, would have more powerful functions. Sellers on Taobao, a unit of Alibaba Group, are accepting orders for the iPhone 5, in some cases asking for a deposit of 1,000 yuan ($160) for the new phone. One seller, "Dahai99888", who started accepting pre-orders this week, is asking for full payment upfront, at a cool 6,999 yuan ($1,100). Taobao sellers that Reuters spoke with said they planned to buy the iPhone 5 in Hong Kong or the United States and then bring it to mainland China. Apple products are often available in Hong Kong before they are released on the mainland.</Msg><Username>texexec60</Username><Timestamp>1342100411433</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-12 09:40:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1342100421357-124</Id><Title>Buying and Volume Up, Shorts Will Cover Soon and the Squeeze Begins....</Title><Msg>....eom.</Msg><Username>chaolopez</Username><Timestamp>1342100421357</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-12 09:40:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1342100602811-125</Id><Title>TARGETS RAISED BECAUSE THE STREET KNOWS THAT CHINA SALES ARE STILL VERY, VERY STRONG.</Title><Msg>$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$</Msg><Username>mytwocnts</Username><Timestamp>1342100602811</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-12 09:43:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1342100627361-126</Id><Title>700's after earnings is a sure bet</Title><Msg>ipad sales expected to pass iphone sales soon</Msg><Username>texexec60</Username><Timestamp>1342100627361</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-12 09:43:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1342100633815-127</Id><Topic><Title>Here we goooooooooooo</Title><Username>aea_75</Username><Timestamp>1342100132012</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-12 09:35:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Your posts are a waste of bandwidth.</Msg><Username>chaolopez</Username><Timestamp>1342100633815</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-12 09:43:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1342100737128-128</Id><Title>all my grandkids say their favorite part of daycare</Title><Msg>is ipad class time</Msg><Username>texexec60</Username><Timestamp>1342100737128</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-12 09:45:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1342100767482-129</Id><Title>Anyone see the citigroup news on AAPL?</Title><Msg>Citigroup removes AAPL from champions list</Msg><Username>mjjk1</Username><Timestamp>1342100767482</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-12 09:46:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1342100809251-130</Id><Title>ATTENTION: DO NOT SELL!!!

The first he described as a “European-like” economic situation “where we have a managed decline” and “a stagnant, lost decade” of growing debt burden that the nation’s lawmakers refuse to address. The second, he said, is “a crisis of more and more people seeing the government as a provider of their livelihood instead of themselves.” “We want an upwardly mobile society,” Ryan continued. “We want to have a safety net, not a hammock of . . . dependency and complacency. “We are worried that the president’s taking us down the wrong path.” Ryan stressed if the nation’s leaders continue to ignore the growing debt crisis, even those who have become more dependent on entitlement programs — such as seniors and the poor — will soon be faced with a wake up call. “We will have a debt crisis and we’ll have to respond rapidly to appease the debt markets, the bond markets, so we can avoid a catastrophe,” Ryan said. “That means cutting benefits to current seniors, raising taxes that slows down the economy, which is exactly what Europe is doing. “Economic growth and spending control, and entitlement reforms, are the key recipe of what we are trying to do to prevent this debt crisis from happening,” Ryan added. “And we think the next president and the next Congress will basically decide how this all goes.” Ryan said he believes one of the main reasons Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has refused to pass a budget in three years is to avoid putting vulnerable Democratic incumbents on the spot.</Msg><Username>texexec60</Username><Timestamp>1342101812956</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-12 10:03:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1342101817978-147</Id><Title>Earnings predictions!

Trying to make voters think Mitt Romney cares more about the offshore bank accounts of the wealthy than the pocketbooks of the middle class. Proving for the umpteenth time that you know nothing about economics, how wealth and jobs are created or why businesses and rich people are moving themselves or their money overseas to escape the taxes you think aren't high enough. "There you go again, Mr. Obama." That's what my father would have said to the president's latest dumb idea to punish rich and successful Americans by raising their taxes. President Obama challenged Mitt Romney this week to join him in asking Congress to extend the Bush tax cuts only for households earning less than $250,000. Everyone above that figure — about 2 percent of Americans — would lose the Bush tax cuts, which covered all taxpayers and expire at the end of the year. President Obama, I feel your pain. You were in way over your head when you essentially became the CEO of the largest economy in the world. You had less business experience than a seven-year-old girl running a front-yard lemonade stand. But by now I thought you would have learned that it is high corporate tax rates, over-regulation, and finance laws like the Dodd-Frank Act that are chasing industry and jobs and capital out of the country. Apparently not. You and your fellow taxoholics in Washington still don't understand how much damage you're doing. It's gotten so bad that one of your party's biggest campaign contributors, socialite and ex-songwriter Denise Rich, renounced her citizenship last year in part because Austria's tax policies will let her keep more of her wealth. Rich, in case you've forgotten, Mr. President, is the ex-wife of Marc Rich, the zillionaire Wall Street trader and tax evader who received a controversial pardon from Bill Clinton. She's been living large in a $65 million Manhattan penthouse, but she's what you'd call "a good rich person," Mr. President. Like George Clooney, Bill Maher, George Soros, the Kennedys and others, she's a Democrat. Unfortunately, Mr. President, Denise Rich is not alone. According to your friends at the IRS, nearly 1,800 American citizens and green card holders officially severed ties with the United States in 2011. That includes Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin, who decided that when he became a Facebook billionaire he'd rather be a resident of Singapore. The weather down there is a little sticky, and the laws against the import and sale of chewing gum are a little severe, but Singapore just happens to have no capital gains tax. My father only had an economics degree from little Eureka College, but he knew government doesn't create wealth or prosperity by raising taxes, over-regulating the economy, or punishing success. Mitt Romney already knows those principles. He got very rich — in the private sector — because he's really smart about financial matters, which, with all due respect, Mr. President, is something you have spent more than three years proving you are really dumb about. Yes, Mr. President, Mitt Romney is a very successful businessman. You can beat him up for that. But I'm hoping and praying that this fall the American people will give him a chance to clean up the mess you've made.</Msg><Username>texexec60</Username><Timestamp>1342107448617</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-12 11:37:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1342107525526-288</Id><Topic><Title>crazy... chinese already selling pre orders to unreleased iPhone 5 due expected unprecedented demand</Title><Username>davidch14</Username><Timestamp>1342093552748</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-12 07:45:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Man what is this worth about a 100 pts?</Msg><Username>robpic5</Username><Timestamp>1342107525526</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-12 11:38:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1342107666151-289</Id><Topic><Title>I must be driving obama's chicago internet police</Title><Username>texexec60</Username><Timestamp>1342106384961</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-12 11:19:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I guess you forgot about the Homeland security department the previous administration put in place, wire taping Americans and all that, are you mad about that ?</Msg><Username>hailthecheif</Username><Timestamp>1342107666151</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-12 11:41:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1342107691034-290</Id><Topic><Title>crazy... chinese already selling pre orders to unreleased iPhone 5 due expected unprecedented demand</Title><Username>davidch14</Username><Timestamp>1342093552748</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-12 07:45:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I hope so lol</Msg><Username>bellagloom</Username><Timestamp>1342107691034</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-12 11:41:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1342107754270-291</Id><Topic><Title>Obama's Class Warfare Continues</Title><Username>texexec60</Username><Timestamp>1342107448617</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-12 11:37:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The mess. That was the previous administration starting very expensive wars, cutting taxes, and changing or economy from one that was completely solvent to the present economic disaster. Mr. Obama doesn't want to raise taxes, sir, he wants the tax rate to reflect the one in which we were doing extremely well as a nation during the Clinton years. He does wish to keep the tax rate for the middle class lower because of the mess we got into thanks to the previous administration. Stop fooling yourself.

Romney labeled Health Care Reform Act "Obamacare" which is a favorite pejorative of the right. In fact it could be called Romneycare and it contain much of what Gingrich and company proposed in '93 including individual mandates. Romney purposefully orchestrated a negative, vocal response. It carries legs because he did it in front of racial organization thus structuring it in a racial setting. Romney is not a nice person. But we knew that. Interstingly, Romney is shaping up as a John Kerry like candidate.</Msg><Username>illbewsuncle</Username><Timestamp>1342108822488</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-12 12:00:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1342108876937-323</Id><Topic><Title>crazy... chinese already selling pre orders to unreleased iPhone 5 due expected unprecedented demand</Title><Username>davidch14</Username><Timestamp>1342093552748</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-12 07:45:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Most investors really underestimate just how much the Chinese groupthink when it comes to luxury brand names.

Speaking to Fox News’ Sean Hannity, the Wisconsin Republican said he sees two “tipping points” that could lead to disaster without a course correction. The first he described as a “European-like” economic situation “where we have a managed decline” and “a stagnant, lost decade” of growing debt burden that the nation’s lawmakers refuse to address. The second, he said, is “a crisis of more and more people seeing the government as a provider of their livelihood instead of themselves.” “We want an upwardly mobile society,” Ryan continued. “We want to have a safety net, not a hammock of . . . dependency and complacency. “We are worried that the president’s taking us down the wrong path.” Ryan stressed if the nation’s leaders continue to ignore the growing debt crisis, even those who have become more dependent on entitlement programs — such as seniors and the poor — will soon be faced with a wake up call. “We will have a debt crisis and we’ll have to respond rapidly to appease the debt markets, the bond markets, so we can avoid a catastrophe,” Ryan said. “That means cutting benefits to current seniors, raising taxes that slows down the economy, which is exactly what Europe is doing. “Economic growth and spending control, and entitlement reforms, are the key recipe of what we are trying to do to prevent this debt crisis from happening,” Ryan added. “And we think the next president and the next Congress will basically decide how this all goes.” Ryan said he believes one of the main reasons Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has refused to pass a budget in three years is to avoid putting vulnerable Democratic incumbents on the spot. “I think they basically made the calculation, it’s better that we just do nothing and take the heat for that than show the country all the tax increases that are required to fulfill the spending vision that we have,” Ryan said. The congressman also blasted Reid for refusing to hold a vote on whether to repeal the healthcare reform law. The House voted again on Wednesday in favor of killing Obamacare. But Ryan said the Democratic-controlled Senate is not likely to revisit the issue for the same reasons Reid has refused to produce a budget — because a debate on it would reveal its “broke promises.”</Msg><Username>texexec60</Username><Timestamp>1342110536946</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-12 12:28:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1342110674490-348</Id><Title>1pm push coming</Title><Msg>right through 600</Msg><Username>robbierobnj</Username><Timestamp>1342110674490</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-12 12:31:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1342110802501-349</Id><Title>Dow up on July 3 2012 only for the month of July</Title><Msg>Will probably be up 1 or 2 more days this month so that is a good thing.

Orbite Aluminae T.ORT has developed and proven it has innovative economical and environmentally friendly extraction processes for a variety of much desired rare and not so rare elements. But as before so many times the markets brushes it off as a too good to be true story and actually comes out and says as much. This attitude is pervaicous and has been ingrained into the human psyche for centuries by the millions of snake oil salesmen that have scammed and are scamming even today. Change means pain for some, look at all the pain caused buy the internet and cell phones many jobs were lost as a result of these innovations and yes at first they too were scoffed at as too expensive and probably won't work as claimed and who needs that. Yet those who embraced the changes and stuck with it were well rewarded and many jobs were created too. The coming evolution in the refining of rare earths and the productions of Alumina will not be stopped by disbelief or the laughter of the old guard as the money to be saved and the profits to be made are too great to be ignored.

King’s Perspective: The Supreme Court voted against the American people. The Affordable Care Act tramples on our religious liberties and our rights. It affects every American. When will we wake up and realize that we are being forced to swallow a “bitter bill?” The system of checks and unbalance is doling out deathcare in the name of affordable care. Many of the goods and services included in the ACA are linked to breast cancer, strokes, heart attacks, and baby killing. Many Americans don’t even realize that we are in danger. The “innocent bystanders” are either uninformed or misinformed. All the while, many of those elected to protect our rights are making deadly deals behind closed doors. American brothers and sisters, this isn’t about political parties, ethnic debates and which side are you on. Across the aisle and among the three branches, a terrible hand has been dealt. Right now, in the face of this terrible decision by the Supreme Court Justices, some are being duped into thinking that the upcoming elections are only about the next occupant of the White House. Nothing can be further from the truth. The presidential election should not require all of our focus, as we must also work as hard as we can to salvage as many good people/causes down ballot as possible. Our economy is suffering because a moral morass is eating away at our infrastructure. Homes, jobs, health, quality of life — all are being impeded and swallowed up by negative forces that are causing people to turn on each other rather than lifting a helping hand. Not only are babies in the wombs and marriages and families suffering; our pocketbooks, schools, neighborhoods and everything that matters are in danger. Wake up America, the thief is at the door! But even though the Supreme Court voted against us, we are not without recourse. Americans get the final vote on November 6.” Dr. Alveda C. King grew up in the civil rights movement led by her uncle, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.</Msg><Username>texexec60</Username><Timestamp>1342117505232</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-12 14:25:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1342117565061-494</Id><Title>Data from China tonight will move Apple up or down big tomorrow</Title><Msg>Good luck to all!</Msg><Username>pinnacle01</Username><Timestamp>1342117565061</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-12 14:26:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1342117597824-495</Id><Title>gotta get in our diggs cuz martini is going to a meeting soon...</Title><Msg>the crying meeting begins as soon as martini begins the he third rip off the middle class careers</Msg><Username>funniebucket</Username><Timestamp>1342117597824</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-12 14:26:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1342117612088-496</Id><Topic><Title>Data from China tonight will move Apple up or down big tomorrow</Title><Username>pinnacle01</Username><Timestamp>1342117565061</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-12 14:26:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Place your bet</Msg><Username>pinnacle01</Username><Timestamp>1342117612088</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-12 14:26:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1342117722786-497</Id><Title>it is need hit 603 befer mash highter......</Title><Msg>announce of iphone5, mini-Oad, buyback, and divident soon.

King’s Perspective:</Title><Msg>Four years ago, during the long hot summer before Mr. Barack Hussein Obama was elected as the “first black president of the United States of America,” I remember being distraught because prophets and pundits were predicting his election. Friends, I was angry with God, and that was a dangerous position for me to be in. God had revealed to me that due to His hand of judgment on America, Mr. Obama would be the next president. I just couldn’t stand the thought of that. It took the God ordained wisdom of a fellow prophetic voice in the person of my good friend and fellow warrior Pastor Clennard Childress to calm me down. I remember him saying: “Alveda, only God can use one vessel, one man to shine light on the most demonic forces we battle today in the 21st century. Abortion will come to the forefront with this presidency because Barack Obama will be the most abortion-minded president America has ever known. As it turns out, Pastor Childress is right. President Obama’s abortion agenda is unprecedented. Then too, there is the flip side of the anti-Christ/anti-procreation agenda which President Obama also promotes. Abortion along with his homosexual marriage agenda are the two most effective forces against natural marriage and procreation. Face it friends, two men or two women engaged in sexual liaisons, and mothers who abort or surgically and chemically prevent conception are much less likely to birth babies. Friends, it’s time to come together regardless of ethnicity, church denomination, economic status, political party affiliation and other distinctions that divide us rather than unite us. The blood of the innocents is crying from the ground. The earth is groaning under the injustices. Natural procreation is under attack. We must pray and ask God to help us.</Msg><Username>texexec60</Username><Timestamp>1342117933629</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-12 14:32:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1342117952096-505</Id><Topic><Title>silverjackal..ive studied fractals</Title><Username>martikkkins</Username><Timestamp>1342117388290</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-12 14:23:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think the market is completely machine driven, and whilst humans program the machines, and key in express dates as "targets" for market making, investors and traders are simply caught in the cross-fire.

But as far as that goes, modern-day leftists are akin to the 17th-century philosophers who, professing certitude that mountains and valleys could not possibly exist on the moon, famously refused to condescend, even for a moment, to look through Galileo’s newly developed telescope. Indeed, contemporary leftists are likewise wedded to a faith they cannot bear to see challenged in any way, lest the carefully crafted towers of their understanding suddenly be washed away like sandcastles on the shore. Thus they turn a blind eye to the legacy of chaos and suffering that big government has brought to mankind generally, and to African Americans in particular. Consider, for instance, what the Left did to the black community by way of government-mandated policies regulating the mortgage-lending industry. In 1977, progressive Democrats in Congress engineered the passage of the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), which required banks to make special efforts to lend to minority borrowers—particularly mortgagors—of meager to modest means. In the 1990s, the Clinton administration effectively placed the CRA on steroids, transforming it from an outreach program into a strict quota system that imposed oppressive penalties on banks which fell short of their quotas. With no recourse other than to drastically lower their standards and to issue multitudes of subprime loans to borrowers with weak credit credentials, banks embarked on a path of ill-conceived practices that would ultimately lead to the housing-market collapse of 2008. Because of their comparatively poor credit ratings as a demographic group, blacks were disproportionately represented among those who fell into the financial trap of subprime loans. Thus the subsequent foreclosure rates among black homeowners dwarfed those of their white counterparts. Because of this, the median net worth of black households declined by 53% between 2005 and 2009—the single greatest economic blow ever delivered to the black community. Then, from 2009-2012, African Americans collectively lost another $193 billion. When the bottom fell out of the housing market, it inevitably fell out of the jobs market as well. Between January 2007 and August 2011, the black unemployment rate spiked from 8% to 16.7% (and 19.1% for black males). Hoover Institution Fellow Thomas Sowell observes that although “many blacks got loans that they could not have gotten otherwise,” in the final analysis they “lost out, big time, from this ‘favor’ done for them by politicians.” The ceaseless proliferation of big-government welfare programs and expenditures during the past half-century has likewise inflicted incalculable harm on poor blacks in the U.S. When President Lyndon Johnson in 1964 launched the so-called War on Poverty, he gave form to what Thomas Sowell has described as “the crowning triumph of the liberal vision of society—and of government programs as the solution to social problems.” With the expansion of the welfare state, Americans’ dependency (which previously had been declining for many years) on the federal government suddenly rose to unprecedented heights. By 1974, government-provided benefits were an astounding 20 times higher than they had been in 1965. From 1965 to the present day, more than $16 trillion of taxpayer money (in constant 2012 dollars) has been spent on welfare programs for the poor, yet the poverty rate is essentially unchanged. The most devastating by-product of the mushrooming welfare state has been its corrosive effect on American family life, particularly in the black community. Rising illegitimacy rates are the key indicators of this development. The out-of-wedlock birth rate among blacks spiked from 24.5% in the mid-Sixties, to 50.3% in 1976, to 73% today. To be sure, there were cultural influences that helped to ignite the dissolution of American families generally, and of black families especially. But the ramifications of those influences have been amplified exponentially by provisions in welfare laws that offer substantial economic incentives for shunning marriage and avoiding the formation of two-parent families. For decades, means-tested welfare programs such as food stamps, public housing, Medicaid, day care, and Temporary Assistance to Needy Families have penalized marriage. George Mason University professor Walter E. Williams puts it succinctly: “The welfare state has done to black Americans what slavery couldn’t do, what Jim Crow couldn’t do, what the harshest racism couldn’t do. And that is to destroy the black family.” The devastating societal consequences of family dissolution cannot be overstated. Father-absent households—black and white alike—are 700% more likely to experience poverty than two-parent families. A Heritage Foundation analysis notes that youngsters raised by single parents, as compared to those who grow up in intact married homes, are far more likely to be physically abused; to smoke, drink, and abuse drugs; to behave aggressively and violently; to engage in criminal activity; to perform poorly in school or drop out; to be treated for emotional and behavioral disorders; to serve jail time before age 30; and to experience poverty as adults. With regard to girls in particular, those raised by single mothers are more than twice as likely to give birth out-of-wedlock, thereby perpetuating the cycle of poverty. Yet another area where big government has sown seeds of enormous destruction is in the public education system, which for decades has yielded a meager return on a very large, ever-escalating financial investment. Over the past half-century, the annual per-pupil costs of educating children in public elementary and secondary schools have risen (in constant present-day dollars) from $2,808 in 1962, to nearly $11,000 today. Yet the performance of America’s public-school students has not improved in the least. Between 1973 and 2008, the math and reading scores of 17-year-old high-schoolers taking the National Assessment of Educational Progress were unchanged. SAT reading scores for the high-school class of 2011 were the lowest on record. According to the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA), an evaluation of high-school students in 34 countries which belong to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the U.S. today ranks 25th in math literacy, 17th in scientific literacy, and 14th in reading proficiency. African-Americans have been particularly shortchanged by the public-education system’s inadequacies. If black students in the U.S. were counted as a self-contained “national” group, their average PISA reading scores would rank them 31st among the 34 OECD nations. Black high-school graduates nationwide perform, on average, at a level that is four academic years below that of their white counterparts. Moreover, large numbers of African American public-school students fail to obtain a high-school diploma—very significant, in light of the fact that dropouts go on to earn substantially less money during their working lives than students who graduate. Dropout rates are especially high in urban areas with large black populations, including such academic basket cases as Washington, DC (57%), Trenton (59%), Camden (61.4%), Baltimore (65.4%), Cleveland (65.9%), and Detroit (75.1%). The failure of public schools to properly educate American students—blacks in particular—can be attributed largely to the priorities of the teachers unions. Far more devoted to promoting left-wing political agendas than to improving the quality of public education, these unions rank among the most powerful political forces in the United States. The National Education Association (NEA), for instance, employs more political organizers than the Republican and Democratic National Committees combined. Of the $59 million in combined political donations which the NEA and the American Federation of Teachers have made during the past 20 years, more than $56 million has gone to Democratic candidates. Meanwhile, the teachers unions have endeavored to prevent even the most ineffective instructors from losing their jobs, lest their mandatory union dues—which in turn are funneled into political activism—be lost. For instance, during a recent ten-year period in Newark, New Jersey—where the high-school graduation rate was just 30.6%—only one out of every 3,000 public-school teachers in the city was terminated in any given year. In summation, big government has shown itself, time and again, to be the problem for black Americans rather than the solution</Msg><Username>texexec60</Username><Timestamp>1342118409351</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-12 14:40:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1342118438151-517</Id><Title>texmess now that you posted you talk to god</Title><Msg>please ask him who is going to win the 7th race at hollywood park on saturday......thanks</Msg><Username>martikkkins</Username><Timestamp>1342118438151</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-12 14:40:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1342118440683-518</Id><Topic><Title>wow... even greenpeace upgrade aapl</Title><Username>davidch14</Username><Timestamp>1342118282520</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-12 14:38:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>LOL gggggggggggggggggggggggggggg</Msg><Username>river_cooter</Username><Timestamp>1342118440683</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-12 14:40:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1342118508323-519</Id><Topic><Title>here we goooooooooooooo</Title><Username>aea_75</Username><Timestamp>1342115979925</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-12 13:59:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>G gg ggg gggg ggggg gggggg ggggggg ggggggggg gggggggggggg</Msg><Username>matthyatt511</Username><Timestamp>1342118508323</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-12 14:41:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1342118515918-520</Id><Title>Re:Great positive close today and tomorrow</Title><Msg>All three of us agree we will have a great positive close today.

In a recent Gallup Poll, 78 percent of Americans professed some form of Christianity. Other polls would have us believe that the Christian standards of upholding life in the womb and every human’s right to be born, as well as upholding the principles of natural marriage, of one man to one woman, are also in the minority. Actually, according to Gallup, “America is sharply divided” on the subject of homosexual relations. However, the real questions and answers rest not with what the pollsters report, but rather the solutions remain with “we the people.” What do Christian people, men and women of faith really believe about the controversial issues that are threatening to rend our communities apart? There are historical accounts of a youth who changed his community with five smooth stones. There is also the big war that was won with a little army. Whether or not we are in the minority on the subjects of the right to life and natural procreative marriage, we as Christians still pack a lot of "punch." When we punch, or scan, or key in our ballots in November, we should be voting for life. David and Gideon are good examples of how to overcome naysayers and popular or politically correct opinions. In our new book, “Life at All Costs,” we members of the National Black Prolife Coalition write about why abortion is harmful, and why homosexual marriage is a problem. We are part of another "minority" who is often misrepresented as having no "voice of moral authority." We beg to differ! From one Christian to another, I want to state for the record that I stand with my pastor on the issues of natural, procreative marriage and the right for human babies to be conceived and to be born. People often ask me "where do you go to church?" Friends, I am member of the music ministry and teaching staff at Believers' Bible Christian Church in Atlanta, GA. Our senior pastor, Allen McNair has been my mentor and pastor for nearly a quarter of a century. He is a pastor and a prophet of God. During Sunday morning service this week Pastor McNair said that we can't vote to approve sin. Pastor included the sin of abortion in the message as well. Pastor also said that President George W. Bush "had enough sense to know not to approve same sex marriage." Pastor McNair warned African Americans not to approve of the sin in any form, including the sins of homosexual marriage and abortion. I was really listening, and was inspired and encouraged to stay on the battlefield. I hope his message is food for thought for you as well.</Msg><Username>texexec60</Username><Timestamp>1342120156039</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-12 15:09:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1342120218834-549</Id><Topic><Title>Cue the drop...</Title><Username>silverjackal_trader</Username><Timestamp>1342120075713</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-12 15:07:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Whatever a&amp;&amp;whole.</Msg><Username>rwc232</Username><Timestamp>1342120218834</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-12 15:10:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1342120445340-550</Id><Title>McCain: Obama Wasted Too Much Time on Healthcare</Title><Msg>Thursday, 12 Jul 2012 Sen. John McCain says President Barack Obama wasted the first two years of his presidency pushing his healthcare reform law when he should have been concentrating most of his effort on the nation’s economic crisis. “I think he devoted most of his intention to health care reform when probably it would have served him and the country better if they had worked on other issues, because the economy was failing while we were focusing all our attention on the Obamacare,” the Arizona Republican said Wednesday. “And also I think that the president thought that, and still believes that, if you expand government, hire more government workers, you will have an economic recovery,” McCain added. Now, the senator suggested, the president is trying to hide from the problem by initiating “a class-warfare game” again over taxes by insisting that Republicans go along with his proposal to allow the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts to expire for upper-income earners making $250,000 or more, but preserve them for middle-class Americans. “We are in this whole class-warfare game,” McCain said. “I guess that the president is — in my view — trying to do everything to divert Americans’ attention from a very bad economy and bad, recently bad economic news.” McCain, the 2008 Republican presidential nominee, said he remains opposed to any changes in the current rates because “it would be a huge blow to small businesses in America.” That’s the same objection, he reminded Van Susteren, that Obama gave in 2009 to raising taxes during an economic downturn.</Msg><Username>texexec60</Username><Timestamp>1342120445340</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-12 15:14:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1342120505779-551</Id><Topic><Title>Christians Still Pack a Lot of ‘Punch’</Title><Username>texexec60</Username><Timestamp>1342120156039</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-12 15:09:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>this woman is a certifiable lunitic religious fanatic..take her off your list of idiots who opine for you</Msg><Username>martikkkins</Username><Timestamp>1342120505779</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-12 15:15:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1342120626916-552</Id><Title>predictions for today's close/friday open...</Title><Msg>I say close today between 601.50 and 602.

He is the best-known victim of "Fast and Furious," the Obama administration's de facto conventional-weapons proliferation program. Between November 2009 and January 2011, Team Obama arranged for licensed firearms dealers to sell guns to straw buyers, who transferred them to known violent criminals in Mexico. Among these firearms, two AK-47s were found near Rio Rico, Ariz., where suspected smugglers fatally shot Terry, a 40-year-old former Marine, on Dec. 15, 2010. While Terry epitomizes those whom Fast and Furious has harmed, he is not its sole casualty. In another Obama administration "gun-walking" escapade, in February 2011 in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, members of Los Zetas drug gang ambushed two U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. Jaime Zapata, 32, was fatally shot and Victor Avila was wounded. Largely overlooked is this plan's calamitous impact on Mexico, its people and U.S.-Mexican relations. "Our federal government knowingly, willfully, purposefully gave the drug cartels nearly 2,000 weapons — mainly AK-47s — and allowed them to walk," Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, told NBC News recently. These arms were supposed to lead federal agents in Phoenix to the Mexican thugs who acquired them. Instead, Fast and Furious guns melted into Mexico. Approximately 300 Mexicans have been killed or wounded by Fast and Furious guns, estimates former Mexican attorney general Victor Humberto Benitez Trevino. Relevant details are scarce. However, at least one case generated enormous headlines — in Mexico. On Oct. 21, 2010, Sinaloa drug cartel members kidnapped Mario Gonzalez, brother of Chihuahua state's attorney general at the time, Patricia Gonzalez. That Nov. 5, his tortured body was discovered in a shallow grave. Mexican police soon nabbed eight of his suspected kidnappers in a shootout. They seized 16 weapons, including two Fast and Furious guns, serial numbers confirm. These guns were tied to two kidnappings. That case is detailed in a congressional report prepared for two top Republicans — Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa and Rep. Darrell Issa of California — and released last July 26. Fast and Furious guns have befouled at least 200 crime scenes, including murders and abductions. Among them: Members of La Familia drug gang fired at a Mexican federal police helicopter on May 24, 2011, wounding three officers and forcing an emergency landing in Michoacan, western Mexico. Five days later, four more helicopters attacked La Familia. Gang members returned fire, striking all four choppers and injuring two more government agents. Police prevailed, killing 11 cartel members and arresting 36 — including those suspected of targeting the first chopper. Mexican authorities say La Familia possessed heavy-duty body armor and 70 rifles, including several Fast and Furious weapons. Two weapons purchased by Fast and Furious targets were recovered in Sonora July 2010, and to what the Justice Department classifies as a "homicide/willful kill — gun." Two Fast and Furious guns were linked to a February 2010 assassination conspiracy against Julian Leyzaola, then police chief in Baja California. Four Fast and Furious guns found in January 2010 were connected to a "kidnap/ransom." Eleven Fast and Furious firearms were discovered in Atoyac de Alvarez, a city on Mexico's Pacific Coast, after Mexican soldiers saved a kidnap victim in November 2009. Team Obama's defenders correctly argue that George W. Bush administration investigators distributed some 450 guns in Mexico through Operation Wide Receiver, the precursor to Fast and Furious. But there are several key differences between the two initiatives: No known deaths pertain to Operation Wide Receiver. Many of its weapons featured radio-tracking devices, unlike most Fast and Furious guns. Also, Mexico's government knew about and supported Wide Receiver. In contrast, Issa and Grassley's report observed, "ATF and DOJ leadership kept their own personnel in Mexico and Mexican government officials totally in the dark about all aspects of Fast and Furious."</Msg><Username>texexec60</Username><Timestamp>1342121310570</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-12 15:28:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1342121314450-566</Id><Topic><Title>McCain: Obama Wasted Too Much Time on Healthcare</Title><Username>texexec60</Username><Timestamp>1342120445340</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-12 15:14:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>he "spent" 692 billion of which 342 billion were tax cuts.and 4million jobs were added.oh those god damn facts..annoying little demons</Msg><Username>martikkkins</Username><Timestamp>1342121314450</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-12 15:28:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1342121339676-567</Id><Topic><Title>BUY MORE CHINESE GOODS (IPHONES, IPADS, TV'S, CLOTHES) AND SUPPORT JOBS THERE.</Title><Username>diwanrk</Username><Timestamp>1342121015959</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-12 15:23:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well, The Chinese company makes about $6 building an iPhone while Apple makes a few hundreds selling it.

At least seven Democratic governors are concerned about the issue, The Washington Post reported. In Montana the law would add about 84,000 people to the state’s Medicaid program and by 2019 costs could reach $71 million. “Unlike the federal government, Montana can’t just print money,” Gov. Brian Schweitzer, D-Mont., said according to the Post. “We have a budget surplus, and we’re going to keep it that way.” The Supreme Court ruling upholding Obamacare said that states could not be penalized for refusing to go along with the Medicaid expansion in 2014, leaving a number of unanswered questions for states. Dan Crippen, executive director of the National Governors Association, was asked to describe state reactions to the court’s ruling and replied with the word “confusion.” Among the areas of confusion are whether the court’s ruling changes the rules governing Medicaid expansion, can states opt in at a later date or cut back, and can states set their own income cutoffs for admission to Medicaid. The governors association, along with other groups including the Republican Governors Association, wrote to Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius seeking answers about the law’s provisions, the Post reported. “The answers to these questions are key,” Matt Salo, director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors, told the Post. “States need to be making these decisions now, and it’s hard to make them if you don’t have clarity.”</Msg><Username>texexec60</Username><Timestamp>1342121639844</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-12 15:33:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1342121667783-574</Id><Topic><Title>McCain: Obama Wasted Too Much Time on Healthcare</Title><Username>texexec60</Username><Timestamp>1342120445340</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-12 15:14:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Spending $692B to create 4M jobs amounts to paying $173,000 for each job.

Cliff Stearns, R-Fla Stearns, chairman of the House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, along with Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton, R-Mich., has introduced the No More Solyndras Act. Solyndra declared bankruptcy in August 2011. The company manufactured solar panels but couldn’t compete with cheaper products from China and filed for bankruptcy in August 2011. Subsequent investigations have revealed that the Obama administration continued to provide government-backed loans even though they were aware the company was in trouble. E-mails show that the loan-process was tainted by political considerations and a Washington Post investigation found that nearly $4 billion in federal grants and financing went to a host of companies with connections to five administration staffers and advisers on energy policy.</Msg><Username>texexec60</Username><Timestamp>1342121974890</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-12 15:39:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1342122028195-581</Id><Title>Advisors tell me to sell tomorrow........up/down is a bad earnings signal</Title><Msg>say pre-earnings sag could get worse????? anyone???</Msg><Username>thebigpitcher17</Username><Timestamp>1342122028195</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-12 15:40:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1342122048286-582</Id><Topic><Title>Mexico's Forgotten Victims of 'Fast and Furious'</Title><Username>texexec60</Username><Timestamp>1342121310570</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-12 15:28:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yes, marticini, and the holocaust never happened either what an idiot you are.</Msg><Username>rlbeard6734</Username><Timestamp>1342122048286</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-12 15:40:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1342122055855-583</Id><Topic><Title>shorts think market will fall with jpm earnings</Title><Username>getinrhythme</Username><Timestamp>1342121515086</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-12 15:31:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>JPM priced in wont be as bad as they think we rally 300 points on the dow aapl 612 close</Msg><Username>robbierobnj</Username><Timestamp>1342122055855</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-12 15:40:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1342122082542-584</Id><Topic><Title>McCain: Obama Wasted Too Much Time on Healthcare</Title><Username>texexec60</Username><Timestamp>1342120445340</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-12 15:14:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If hiring more government workers is the solution for economic recovery than a communist country must have the best and fastest growing economy because it employs everyone in the country.</Msg><Username>pureinvestor</Username><Timestamp>1342122082542</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-12 15:41:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1342122102441-585</Id><Topic><Title>McCain: Obama Wasted Too Much Time on Healthcare</Title><Username>texexec60</Username><Timestamp>1342120445340</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-12 15:14:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So I gather you are pleased with a stubborn 8% unenemployment and a tax cut on social security taxes that will drain badly needed funds from that system AND be darn near impossible to get back to were it was even though it was supposed to be temporary.

McKee's Perspective:</Title><Msg>Clarence V. McKee's Perspective: Give Mitt Romney credit for going into the NAACP Lions’ Den. He stood his ground, told the truth, weathered a chorus of boos and didn’t back down. It was a bold — and smart — move. He told it like it is, saying that the 14.4 percent black unemployment rate was an example of how the “duration of unemployment, average income, and median family wealth are all worse for the black community.” He told the Obama worshiping crowd “. . . if I did not believe that my policies and . . . leadership would help families of color . . . more than the policies and leadership of President Obama, I would not be running for president.” Plunging a dagger into the hearts of the NAACP’s bosom buddies in the teachers’ unions, he said “I will give the parents of every low-income and special needs student the chance to choose where their child goes to school.” Good for him! One would think that such sincerity would and will be appreciated. Don’t bet on it! One thing is for sure: since the non-partisan eras of NAACP leaders Roy Wilkins and my friend and former boss Benjamin L. Hooks, whom Romney quoted, the organization has become nothing more than a partisan appendage of the liberal Democratic Party establishment. Its leaders, the Congressional Black Caucus, and others have come together as “overseers” of the liberal “plantation” which Congressman Allen West, R-Fla., has so aptly described. On almost every issue, the NAACP leadership sides with its liberal friends against the interests of much of its own constituency. And what are those issues? As Chicago area writer Dennis Byrne wrote over a year ago regarding the situation in too many black communities: “. . . culture is described by the growth of a matriarchy, as displayed by the many grandmothers raising their daughters' children. By the absence of men in child rearing. By men who prey on young women who have never learned what to expect from decent, caring and responsible men. By the collapse of the family and the destruction of men's and women's traditional, balanced roles in making children strong enough to resist the challenges of today's broader culture of irresponsibility, casual sex, substance abuse and other plagues.” So what side does the NAACP come down on: YES, to same-sex marriage; NO, to legislation banning race and sex-based abortions; NO, to vouchers and choice for poor parents whose children are trapped in the “schoolhouse to jailhouse pipeline” schools; and, YES, to race baiting for Democrats’ political gain at every opportunity. Those were the shark-infested political waters Romney waded into. He did well, but, he was a bit too polite. He could have really “told it like it is” in Obama’s black America. He could have talked about the dirty little, not so secrets that Obama, the Democrats, the Congressional Black Caucus, Eric Holder and the NAACP don’t want to talk about. A few will suffice: The urban terrorism gang and drug-related violence is slaughtering so many innocent men, women, and children in our cities. In Obama’s Chicago, where his former chief of staff is mayor, more people have been killed this year than the number of U.S. troops killed thus far in Afghanistan over the same period. A day later, Vice President Joe Biden speaks to them about the environment — but not that environment. According to the Children’s Defense Fund, black males born in 2001 are more than five times as likely as white males to be incarcerated some time in their lifetime. One in nine (11.7 percent) black males between ages 25 and 29 is in prison or jail. Sixty-six percent of the women newly infected with HIV each year are black, according to a May study. The infection rate for black women in the major urban areas studied is comparable to the Congo; and, Obama’s Center for Disease Control states that nearly one in 30 black women will become infected with HIV in her lifetime.</Msg><Username>texexec60</Username><Timestamp>1342140327901</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-12 20:45:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1342140357246-667</Id><Topic><Title>aapl fall is over, gap up tomorrow, back to 620</Title><Username>getinrhythme</Username><Timestamp>1342122273574</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-12 15:44:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Man I really hope so........</Msg><Username>A Yahoo!

The news came as the Romney campaign confirmed for the first time that a choice would be made before the Republican National Convention. "We're getting ready to share some exciting news. Sometime between now and the Republican convention, Mitt will be announcing his choice for VP," Romney campaign manager Matt Rhoades said in an email to supporters. The report from Drudge — which says the decision will be made in the "coming weeks" — carries particular weight because of the widely reported personal connection between Rhoades and Matt Drudge, whose eponymous website is a dominant force in online journalism.</Msg><Username>texexec60</Username><Timestamp>1342140485345</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-12 20:48:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1342140508546-669</Id><Title>Do Kangaroo Tails mean anything?</Title><Msg>Two days in a row now we've had a big sell off and a comeback by the bulls.

If strike price is not met and market closes, the option expires as worthless (on the weeklies). No action is required. If you want to roll-over to another option, say for the next week, then you would have to Buy to Close the dwindling option. Then you could Sell to Open for the other option. Letting the option expire does not incur a commission fee. Sometimes I may Buy to Close if I see a good premium for the following week, in the event of the Roll-over...or just wait till the next week. Just be aware that when you Buy to Close, you will be surrendering a portion of the proceeds against your original Sell to Open. With covered calls, one Sells to Open....then Buy to Close (for roll-over). Hope that helps. Have your brokerage firm go over all this with you. The risk is extreme. Good luck, and be careful. LoL, I should talk...
