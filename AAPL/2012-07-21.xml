Lets say your sl order is at 585..If the stock is halted and eventually opens at say 560, your 585 stop loss will be triggered and your order becomes a market order...which means you're out at around 560. The best way to play this is to not play it...either buy and hold or go flat...imho. Options are a pure gamble at this point. If you think (as I do) that the Iphone 5 release will be a hit then just own it and accept whatever happens on the downside. Know that any dip will be bought and any spike will likely be sold. All trading rules are somewhat useless when earnings are released..again imho. For what it's worth, I'm holding 500 shares bought at 580 and I plan on making another 15k from current price.</Msg><Username>soupnazi100</Username><Timestamp>1342844703105</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-07-21 00:25:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1342844937395-6</Id><Title>I hope they beat....</Title><Msg>"Apple can drive the whole (tech) group," said Daniel Morgan, who helps manage about $3.5 billion at Synovus Trust Company in Atlanta.</Msg><Username>northofheaven2000005</Username><Timestamp>1342844937395</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-07-21 00:28:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1342845529120-7</Id><Topic><Title>No mean to scare you, AT&amp;T earning Tuesday moning, Be very worry my friend</Title><Username>aea_30</Username><Timestamp>1342820289749</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-20 17:38:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This gang will do any thing and every thing to play their little dirty games of misinformation whole day long- absolutely shamelessly.

With vow selling MORE and more countries coming on over the last quarter....do the math. 3. PC sales declining and intel missed. Where are those buyers going? A lot of you naysayers will says "duh we are in a depression". May be true but doesn't stop every swinging dck with a credit card from buying an iPad or Mac. iPad and new Mac numbers are going to be filthy insane for Q2. 4. If one through 3 are all friggin wrong it doesn't matter is you intend to hold through the end of the year. The iPhone 5 ALONE will bring this to 750 conservatively. Toss in iPad mini or iTouch XL and Appl TV and this is a friggin no brainier for 800+ by next march REGARDLESS of a miss ( that's not going to happen) next tuesday.

The lowest trailing PE in the last 4 years including 2008 is 12.65. If Apple"misses" it will be a slight miss and still be a little over 10 bucks. This will give you about 44.5 in 12 month earnings. A 12.65 PE would then be 550. 550 IS THEN THE WORST CASE SENARIO. If you average all the earnings forecasts,both Institutional and Independent ,you get 11.25. I like that number. That would mean the downside limit would be 575. The updside is an 18 PE and an 800 handle.

He said no...the IPHONE is still the best selling phone that they have and still sells more than Galaxy. Some here have been spreading rumors about sales slow down in ATT. I doubt it, but ATT is a rip off and people keep migrating from ATT to Verizon and Sprint. In any case ATT is just ONE of hundreds of Telcos round the world selling Iphone.

By Philip Elmer-DeWittJuly 21, 2012: 7:10 AM ET Bernstein's Toni Sacconaghi and Bullish Cross' Andy Zaky offer sharply contrasting views FORTUNE -- "We see a reasonable probability that Apple will miss consensus revenue expectations due to macroeconomic weakness in China and Europe, a product cycle lull in the iPhone, a later than expected introduction of the new iPad into China, and the late quarter introduction of new Mac notebooks." So begins the note to clients issued Friday by Bernstein's Toni Sacconaghi in which he lowered most of his estimates, from iPhone unit sales to his top to bottom lines, for Apple's (AAPL) third fiscal quarter -- one of the factors that helped drive the company's shares down $10.02 (1.63%) for the day. "We are a bit torn on Apple's stock," Bernstein concluded, "but on balance believe that it risks treading water or underperforming coming out of earnings." Contrast that with the e-mail I received from Bullish Cross' Andy Zaky after he met with Piper Jaffray's Gene Munster and Asymco's Horace Dediu at Fortune's Brainstorm Tech conference last week: "After speaking with them, I think this could potentially be a blowout quarter. The most recent blowout quarters we've seen in Apple took place in fiscal Q1 2012, fiscal Q3 2011 and fiscal Q2 2010. So they don't happen THAT often. I think this quarter makes for a good set-up. "In fact, I don't think I have felt more confident in how Apple is going to respond to earnings almost regardless of what it reports this quarter. Apple is almost certainly going to gap-up on earnings. I know the trading action is weak right now, but that is a major red herring. "I couldn't be anymore confident in how the stock will react on earnings. That's because Apple has gapped-up in 20 out of the last 26 earnings reports. Three of the failures happened in Q1 2006, 2007, and 2008 when Apple had a consistent trend of selling off on Q1 earnings. The other three failures had some major extenuating circumstances. First we have two back to back sell-offs in Q4 2010 and Q4 2011. One was the result of Apple being extremely overbought (Q2 2010) and the other was the result of Apple missing. The 6th sell-off happened in Q3 2008 which was the result of Apple reporting in a very poor market environment. So even if you don't discount or explain those six times Apple has sold-off on earnings (three of which happened ages ago) the fact of the matter is, Apple gaps-up 80% of the time. "So I think market participants really need to be thinking twice about selling into earnings right now. As investor will soon find out, that will be a major mistake this quarter. If you sell ahead of the results, you will likely miss a major gap-up on earnings." Apple will report its Q3 2012 earnings after the markets close on Tuesday, July 24.

If you trade conservatively like I do, you can even combine the two into a diagonal spread to actually take advantage of the high premium of the near-the-money options. For example, you can buy a sept $550 for about $63.40 ($9 time value) and sell a July $620 weekly for about $9.50. The total cost of the trade will be about $54. Its net delta is about 0.44. Max gain is $16 or 29%. 29% may not seem much but since the IV of the 620 weekly will crash after earning, you can get a lot more if you manage the trade accordingly. The basic idea is to use the Sept long call as cover and sell short term ATM calls repeatedly to get the premiums. Here is how to manage it: If stock pops after earning, as soon as it crosses $620, if next weekly is available, you roll the $620 short call up to a higher strike next weekly. If next weekly isn't available, you roll it to Aug call. If stock moves sideway or drops after earning, You roll the $620 call out to next weekly on Thursday or wait for it to expire and sell the next ATM weekly again. You do it again and again until Sept expiration at which time you can close out the whole trade. Important: When you roll the short calls, make sure you always roll them for credit, never roll for debit.</Msg><Username>pureinvestor</Username><Timestamp>1342891008309</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-07-21 13:16:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1342891620100-66</Id><Title>if they do....</Title><Msg>announce a better than expected and IBM already announced great earnings, then WE MAY not get what everybody wants.......

And - well said Docpro! - the Independents have been "schooling" the so-called "Wall Street Pros" (aka - Shills for the most part). The Independent Apple Analysts will be far closer to the "actual". I still think the "actual" will hit somewhere between $11.28 to $12.15 EPS....with an increased probability of it falling in the higher end of this range...about $11.75ish. Independent APPLE Analyst, Mr. Horace Dediu, who has been very accurate...but a little bit light/conservative in the past, has predicted $11.54. At this time, the Wall Street Consensus EPS number is only $10.35; therefore, APPLE is poised to deliver another strong "beat" to the upside! LOAD UP before the APPLE Earnings Release on Tuesday - July 24th. INVEST in AAPL for the LONG-TERM GLOBAL GROWTH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! P.S. - iPad "Mini" will be huge this holiday season and during the Chinese New Year in January 2013.

But the product cycle refresh dropoff has me concerned enough to limit my exposure going into the earnings report on the 24th. I'm planning to sell 33% of my position on Monday just in case they do miss, which is much more possible this time than for a good while... If they had been able to sell iPads in China before just a few days ago, then I would be far less concerned. I'm sure iPhones have been selling well in China, but this purported China slowdown may actually be germaine innthis instance. I damn sure hope they do beat..l As far as sellng into the pop if they do crush... That is a definite. The overall sentiment of chickenshit wall street is very negative, and they're taking any profits there can be, which does make sense, given what is absolutely shaping up to be a lousy second half of the year. Buying back in cheaper is going to be pretty easy... Looks like Apple is due for around 45 more days of extreme volatility... Until the iPhine 5 hits... and then... it goes parabolic again straght into January $800. As far as an earnings beat pop... If they crush then of course it will... but last Thursday and Friday's price action definitely indicates a lighter potential for a heavy short squeeze. On a lighter note, noe since Apple will be releasing the dividend schedule, it will then enable Dividend Investment Funds to buy in, putting a much more stable support level underneath the pps. What I'm going to do is sell 33% on Monday, hopefully into strength, be it a dead cat bounce which is possible, and or a pre-earnings run, which is unlikely with slanted CNBC coverage, with Melissa Lee who I know is fairly soon to be replaced, leading the charge as usual for Anthony Scaramucci. From there, I'm going to set at least 2 After Market Limit Sells to hopefully catch a pop. If it is a crush report, then good chance the stock will be halted, where then both orders will fill near the AH High... more likely it won't be halted, so my sell orders will be around $15-$20 apart to catch as much upside as possible. If there is a miss, then I'm just going to hold my 66% into the dividend, and use the 33% of dry powder to buy what will be a massive selloff. Overall I am setting odds of a beat to around 60-40 on the side of a beat, since it rarely pays to bet against Apple. To me it just seems to be wisest to cast a wide of a net as possible to account for as many possibilities as can be, which at least this time around is indicated. Moving forward, next 3 quarters are going to be truly INCREDIBLE with only Mountains of Money just out there for the easy gathering&#127808; This quarter is definitely the LAST wildcard for a solid year.

I certainly hope they crush, but it really seems like the street is pretty convinced there's a miss coming... I definitely don't think they'll miss their own guidance of 8.68 or even close... However the delay in iPads in China is a sore spot. New MacBooks are going to be ok, iPhone 4S is has been pretty hot, but pretty difficult to guage. China has definitely become a serious factor with the iPhones... Is there a slowdown there like the US in anticipation of iPhone 5? The iPhone has proven certainly significant enough for Apple to want to be able to release it to China when the newest iteration is released in the US, as it would now seem... These kind of questions remain unknowable until the iPhone 5 comes to be, and easily from there cycles and expectations will be entirely predictable... but there unfortunately is a substantial amount of uncertainty this time around. This all is why I'm only heading into earnings @ 66% overall exposure in case of a miss. 33% of my dry powder would definitely buy a selloff under $600, and I'd be very happy with that. Reason why I'm holding 66% steady is for the dividend., and of course in case they do indeed crush. What I am entirely certain of is this is the very last quarter for a long time where holding Apple into earnings will be an iffy situation, and come September, Apple is going to go absolutely parabolic... with: iPhone 5 China Mobile with a Billion clients finally coming into play... if even 10% = 100,000,000 new/additional iPhones being sold! iPad 3 numbers finally rollng in from China starting just a couple days ago iPad mini, going to truly decimate competition iTunes expanding massively in unprecedented proprtion both in content, studios, and 40-50 additional countries and still so much more... Truly astounding. No uncertainty about any of those things&#127808; Just about 45 days until it is all handed to us on a Gold Platter I'm not worried about the future even remotely.

There are those that next Q will be tougher than this one due to even more buyers IPHONE 4s buyers waiting to buy Iphone 5 in Oct. Your thoughts on that? I also thought that Tim Cook postponing earnings to July 24 and then starting IPAD3 in China on the 20th was a way for him to get a handle on demand so he could better predict 4th Q earnings. IPAD is going to play a big part in next Q's numbers. I totally agree with you on Q1 2013(ending in DEC 2012). IT WILL BE HUGE. MAYBE 20 BUCKS. NO BULL. 4TH Q CHINA MOBILE DEAL WILL BE THE KEY.GLTA</Msg><Username>docproc1_2000</Username><Timestamp>1342916656283</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-07-21 20:24:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1342916980971-134</Id><Topic><Title>Earnings Tuesday - bring on the iSplit</Title><Username>splitdastock</Username><Timestamp>1342903588347</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-07-21 16:46:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Be careful how long you wait.

Usually AAPL makes a decent up move before earnings, but not this time. If AAPL doesn't exceed on revenues a little, exceeds on EPS healthy, and margins gain a little, stock could retreat. On a positive side, they might announce ex-dividend date and possibl;y stock split on Tuesday at 5 pm that might propel the stock up. Future catalysts: 1. Very conservative valuation at FE of 10. Market is consistently wrong on anticipating slower growth, so FPE of 10 is too low. 2. IPhone 5 before Holiday shopping kicks in. 3. iPad finally on sale in China. 4. They need to announce a major deal on iPhone with China Mobile, the largest wireless company. 5. A dividend increase, stock split, and possible increased buyback will give confidence boost. 6. iPad 4 early next year will be good especially in enterprise segment and education and military markets. 7. A new smaller iPad to compete with Google, Amazon, Microsoft in low-price tablet segment.

That would be about 12.65 times trailing twelve months of earnings anticipating AAPL beating by 28% which is the lowest beat of EPS over the past 18 months. The charts also indicate strong resistance at $560 going back to Q2 earnings. If AAPL misses consensus estimates and reports $10/share, the lowest point of the range should be $547 unless the historical TTM PE multiple is broken on the downside below 12.65. That TTM multiple has not been broken in a few years and would be highly unusual.</Msg><Username>psusteelers1</Username><Timestamp>1342927865504</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-07-21 23:31:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1342927892908-153</Id><Topic><Title>AAPL pre-earning move has been weak</Title><Username>sm081969</Username><Timestamp>1342922564121</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-07-21 22:02:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>most likely, friday's price drop had more to do w/ options manipulation than anything else. mon &amp; tues price action will be a better indicator.
