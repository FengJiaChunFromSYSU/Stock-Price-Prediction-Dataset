Here is my strong belief on what would happen based on market facts and experiences: Facts are: 1- YHOO will lose its cash and will not have to buy back the shares and will not have money for possible acuquistions. 2- Market usually seels big cash dividend as company having no plan for growth and its cash 3- After the dividend is paid, the stock price drops at least to the amount of the dividend paid and 95% it drops much more than the dividend so you as an investor lose . Here are what happens to the investor who receives the dividend: 1- He should pay the dividend tax which is 15% in 2012 and is expected to go up to an unknown amount in 2013. 2- You cannot combine your dividend received with your loss in the market so from IRA eyes your account shows a profit which you did not. Say you have lost $5000 YTD in your trades and you get dividend, you still have to pay the dividend tax and cannot claim it towards your loss. 2- Dividend is like your bank buys you a gift with your own money and deduct the gift amount from your account. That is why many big investors short the shares just before the stock going ex-dividend because they know the shares will drop more after ex-dividend date. 3-Even paying a regular small amount of dividend, does not help the stocks and pushes them from growth sector to value sector so you don't usually see big price change in them. AAPL may not be a good example but check out and see dividend did not help AAPL from falling. So as a stock holder you should pray not to get a big one time dividend.</Msg><Username>phd44m</Username><Timestamp>1353247768755</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-18 09:09:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353247929136-5</Id><Title>MarketGrader data from Barron's online</Title><Msg>Yahoo!, Inc.

Sources have told The Sunday Telegraph that Marissa Mayer, chief executive of Yahoo!, has held discussions with Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer, about how the two companies can work more closely together. The two internet giants have already collaborated together on a number of small projects, for example to share Yahoo! news on Facebook, and recently agreed to settle a number of long-standing lawsuits over patents. However, board members expect the talks to lead to much more substantial collaboration based around web-based search. Facebook has already said it plans to boost its web search facility, with founder Mark Zuckerberg noting that the social network is “pretty uniquely positioned to answer the questions people have”. Forging an alliance with Yahoo! would allow the social network to take a major leap forward in search, ensuring it remains central to its users’ lives and helping to target advertising more efficiently. Meanwhile, Yahoo!, which started life as one the first major search engines but is now dwarfed by rival Google, would benefit from Facebook’s vast army of more than 1bn users.</Msg><Username>xetra72</Username><Timestamp>1353260723316</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-18 12:45:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353260854274-13</Id><Topic><Title>Alibaba IPO announcement will get YHOO to $20+</Title><Username>goingbravo</Username><Timestamp>1353260029337</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-18 12:33:49 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yahoo will be $20 much before Alibaba announces an IPO.</Msg><Username>randywms55</Username><Timestamp>1353260854274</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-18 12:47:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353261138352-14</Id><Topic><Title>Facebook and Yahoo! are in talks....</Title><Username>xetra72</Username><Timestamp>1353260723316</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-18 12:45:23 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Remember Yahoo dropped its Facebook pre-IPO lawsuit days before the issue went public.
