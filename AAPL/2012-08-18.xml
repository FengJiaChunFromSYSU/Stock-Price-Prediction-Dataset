This personality type is addicted to warning people about future outcomes and saying "I told you so" whenever they have guessed correctly. They're self-righteous and suffer from a superiority complex. They tend to walk with their hands clasped behind their back. They use the term "grasshopper"...they pronounce it "glasshopper", however...when referring to those they view as their students (which is virtually everyone). They tutor, instruct, advise, caution, warn, and correct others in an obsessive compulsive and uninvited way. Those people around them hate this aspect of their personality, and wish they would just shut up.

(GOOG)’s Motorola Mobility unit said it filed a new patent-infringement case against Apple Inc. (AAPL) claiming that features on some Apple devices, including the Siri voice-recognition program, infringe its patents. The complaint at the U.S. International Trade Commission claims infringement of seven Motorola Mobility patents on features including location reminders, e-mail notification and phone/video players, Motorola Mobility said yesterday. The case seeks a ban on U.S. imports of devices including the iPhone, iPad and Mac computers. Apple’s products are made in Asia. “We would like to settle these patent matters, but Apple’s unwillingness to work out a license leaves us little choice but to defend ourselves and our engineers’ innovations,” Motorola Mobility said in an e-mailed statement. Motorola Mobility and Apple have been fighting since at least 2010 after licensing talks failed. Apple has said Motorola Mobility is making unreasonable demands, and argues that phones made by Motorola Mobility and other handset manufacturers that run on Google’s Android operating system are copying key patented features of the iPhone. The complaint is the second that Libertyville, Illinois- based Motorola Mobility has filed at the agency against Apple. A copy of the new complaint wasn’t immediately available. The commission is scheduled to announce a final decision Aug. 24 in the earlier case, and could impose an import ban on the iPhone. Kristin Huguet, a spokeswoman for Cupertino, California- based Apple, had no immediate comment. Broader Battle The dispute is part of a broader battle for share in a smartphone market that Bloomberg Industries said rose 62 percent to $219 billion last year. Apple, which made one-third of the smartphones sold in the U.S. last quarter, is in the midst of a patent-infringement trial in federal court in California with its biggest rival, Samsung Electronics Co. Android, which is distributed by Mountain View, California- based Google, is the most popular platform for smartphones. Google bought Motorola Mobility in May. A trade judge in April said Apple infringed one of four Motorola Mobility patents in the first case. The patent covers a way computers transmit signals through Wi-Fi. The full commission is reviewing those findings and is scheduled to release its final decision on Aug. 24. A key issue in that case is whether the agency, which is designed to protect U.S. markets from unfair trade practices, should issue import bans on products found to infringe patents on technology used in industry standards. Industry Standards Companies that help develop standards to let electronics work together pledge to license patents covering those standards on fair and reasonable terms. Apple contends that issues over what is fair should be resolved in a federal district court, since the ITC doesn’t have the power to award damages. Motorola Mobility said Apple has refused to negotiate a license and that Apple’s argument is merely a way to avoid punishment for infringing another company’s patents. Apple filed its own patent-infringement case against Motorola Mobility at the Washington agency. The commission in March upheld a judge’s determination that the handset manufacturer wasn’t infringing one Apple patent and that two other patents were invalid. Apple is appealing that decision.</Msg><Username>frank_capra_04</Username><Timestamp>1345295164356</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 09:06:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345295324777-51</Id><Title>AT&amp;T wants to kill off FaceTime over cellular network</Title><Msg>AT&amp;T Inc. will require subscribers to sign up for its soon-to-be-available data-sharing plans if they want to use Apple Inc.’s FaceTime video-calling feature over its cellular network. The application has been available for use over Wi-Fi connections, something that will continue for all AT&amp;T subscribers, but the latest version of Apple’s operating system will allow for use over cellular networks. There has been speculation that AT&amp;T would place a roadblock to the data-intensive application after software developers using a prerelease version of iOS 6 restricted its use. The software will be released in the fall, Apple has said. “AT&amp;T will offer FaceTime over cellular as an added benefit of our new Mobile Share data plans,” spokesman Mark Siegel said in a statement. Last month, AT&amp;T unveiled the long-awaited details of its new wireless data plans that will launch Thursday. The plans allow customers to share data among multiple users and devices, and continues the trend of shifting the focus away from voice minutes and texts, once the basis for most wireless bills. Rival Verizon Wireless, a joint venture of Verizon Communications Inc. and Vodafone Group PLC, has launched similar plans. AT&amp;T has highlighted that its plans offer more choices to consumers, including no requirements for new customers to adopt a shared-data plan. AT&amp;T, once the exclusive carrier of the iPhone, has restricted access to services on the iPhone in the past. It previously blocked users from tethering other devices to the iPhone because of fears about the amount of data that would be consumed. The feature was available on the phone in 2009, but AT&amp;T only made it available for an extra fee in 2010 when it stopped offering unlimited data to new customers. FaceTime uses a camera on the iPhone to connect with others on their phones, iPads or Mac computers. The data consumption from FaceTime on a cellular network could be significant for regular users as the next-generation iPhone is expected to operate on 4G networks using LTE, or Long Term Evolution, technology.</Msg><Username>frank_capra_04</Username><Timestamp>1345295324777</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 09:08:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345295551935-52</Id><Title>Without Steve Jobs Apple keeps making disastrous mistakes</Title><Msg>Daring Fireball's John Gruber likened it to the most vicious dressing down of a sales staff in American film history -- Alec Baldwin's tirade in Glengarry Glen Ross. The Loop's Jim Dalrymple called it "one of the worst decisions" Apple (AAPL) had made in a decade. "This has the stench," Dalrymple wrote, "of a man looking to make a name for himself." When two bloggers who between them have cultivated better sources within Apple than anyone covering the company -- in print or online -- turn on a senior vice president who reports directly to CEO Tim Cook, you know the guy's in trouble. The SVP in question is John Browett, the Wharton MBA who was brought in from Dixons -- a giant British electronics chain -- to fill the gaping hole created in Apple's executive team when Ron Johnson departed to run J.C. Penney (JCP). Johnson was the man who, with Steve Jobs, created the Apple Stores -- those clean well-lighted places whose reputation for service and profitability are the envy of the retail world. Browett's troubles began Monday when reports began to surface -- first in the U.K., then in the U.S. and Canada -- that Apple was laying off recently hired staffers at its stores around the world. Then on Wednesday ifoAppleStore's Gary Allen, who covers Apple's retail operations like the Sporting News covers baseball, ran a long piece entitled Store Personnel Cuts Linked to Profit Goal that traced the rumors to their source. Browett, Allen reported, felt the stores were "too bloated" with employees, and had launched a series of policy changes to make them run "leaner" -- despite "strongly-worded advice from Retail segment veterans that reducing personnel ahead of the annual Back-to-School promotion and the September introduction of the iPhone 5 could create a customer service catastrophe." Enter Gruber, Dalrymple and the rest of the Apple bloggers. Within 24 hours of Allen's piece, Apple PR had reached out to the Wall Street Journal, which reported that Browett had reversed course and instructed his lieutenants to tell the retail staff "We messed up." Apple official statement was blunt and more critical of a member of Apple leadership team than any I'd ever seen: "Making these changes was a mistake and the changes are being reversed. Our employees are our most important asset and the ones who provide the world-class service our customers deserve." I'm reminded of what Jonathan Margolis, who advises wealthy readers what technology to buy in the FT's How to Spend It magazine, tweeted when Browett was brought in to replace Ron Johnson: "#Apple has hired bloke from Dixons to run retail. Tim Cook very excited about this as he's Mr Customer Service. Has he been to a Dixons?"</Msg><Username>frank_capra_04</Username><Timestamp>1345295551935</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 09:12:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345295634416-53</Id><Topic><Title>Samsung insiders: Apple will lose lawsuit!</Title><Username>g_dulaney</Username><Timestamp>1345295155821</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 09:05:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>when is the verdict?</Msg><Username>derek_k_man</Username><Timestamp>1345295634416</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 09:13:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345295753286-54</Id><Title>My Feeling is...</Title><Msg>that aapl will open up under 640 on Monday and I believe europe will be the catalyst.</Msg><Username>short_reaper_will_get_ya</Username><Timestamp>1345295753286</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 09:15:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345295780476-55</Id><Title>Unsustainable!

The loud roar of the oven exhaust fan competes with the TV sounds of CNBC in the background, where some guest is presenting his arguments on why the market is overpriced while another guest tries to infuse a contrasting dose of optimism. Concentrating on the task at hand - trying to flip the omlette without breaking it into a million pieces and spattering the contents all over the oven, all I hear is "...Dad....iPhone....". Assuming that she's made a request for another overpriced I-Whatever, my response is direct and immediate - "No sweetheart, we can't afford it right now", thinking follows a second later where the cost of paying for two college tuitions casts a blanket of worry on my sinking heart. She replies "Its for you and I'm paying for it. It's the new IPhone 5 out next month". She had just just gotten her first paycheck of her life working as a intern in the local university's genetics lab. I was speechless and overwhelmed. She could have gotten anything for herself but she chose to give me something she felt was special - an iPhone 5. It was then that I knew that my investment in Apple stock would yield fruit.</Msg><Username>stkpkr44</Username><Timestamp>1345298290087</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 09:58:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>16</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345298479370-80</Id><Topic><Title>Wow!!

Google will end up getting nothing except the bill for their lawyers. Apple realizes that stupid lawsuits like this comes from being the best in the business, and they have plenty of cash on hand for these frivolous suits. I hope that if it drags out long enough to stop shipments of iPhone5 and iPad Mini that Apple will turn around and sue for damages for the delay of releasing their new products. Now that would hurt Google and maybe they would stop all the whining.</Msg><Username>irongf</Username><Timestamp>1345302949860</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 11:15:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345303226367-103</Id><Topic><Title>What happens to the stock when all iOS devices get banned in the US?</Title><Username>musichead2005</Username><Timestamp>1345296708165</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 09:31:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Will NEVER happen.</Msg><Username>irongf</Username><Timestamp>1345303226367</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 11:20:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345303371003-104</Id><Topic><Title>What happens to the stock when all iOS devices get banned in the US?</Title><Username>musichead2005</Username><Timestamp>1345296708165</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 09:31:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What happens when you grow a brain?</Msg><Username>champton90</Username><Timestamp>1345303371003</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 11:22:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345303389190-105</Id><Topic><Title>What happen to stock if apple got ban on U.S. imports of iPhone, iPad and Mac computers.?</Title><Username>lorhatterly</Username><Timestamp>1345300986357</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 10:43:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Not much at all.

Once established in the 400s, it let up quite a bit. This repeated in the 490s/520s and went crazy with the 4s and new iPad. There were hundreds of posts about the 4s being a failure, Siri not working, bogus lawsuits, Nokia and Samsung taking over and the new iPad overheating and being returned. AEA (under a variety of his foolish message board names) is being joined by a growing group of trolls repeating this process yet again. It is clear that the trolls are restless because APPL is headed to 700s and they fear that. It's just too bad we can't but them on Iggy to clean up the MB. I can't wait to see the 700s.

Also interesting: the focus on features (screen, camera, etc.) rather than the functionality of the entire eco-system. The *innovation* apparent in the Apple concept seems so much bigger than the form-factor of the phone, number of pixels, etc., encompassing the supply of components, the production, distribution of the devices, plus their integration with companion products and services... If what they are doing in this regard is not *innovation*, what is? Sure, todays winner can quickly become tomorrows loser, whether by change of fashion, or failure to innovate. That IS important! But the obsession with features and fashion is misplaced. Most impressive - beyond the features and fashion - are the financial results the company consistently puts up, its astounding growth and profitability... and the impact of those real results on the stock price. Those results are where we find the facts, the stock an expression of those facts. Its the facts, the results and the stock that matter ; everything else is preference, opinion and talking your book. What matters is the forest, and not the trees; the facts and not your opinion.</Msg><Username>musketeernumberone</Username><Timestamp>1345310838000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 13:27:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345310885715-138</Id><Topic><Title>Stock wen up, stock go down, you're gain then you're lose, Only the truth gain is what you able to learn each time</Title><Username>aea_dm2</Username><Timestamp>1345307954736</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 12:39:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>translation: we got our #$%$ kicked again on this move up and are stuck with major short losses. it will stop at $670.......a tip for your boss........</Msg><Username>genesis_gekko</Username><Timestamp>1345310885715</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 13:28:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345310915534-139</Id><Topic><Title>AAPL BREAKOUT TO NEW HIGHS -- NO RESISTANCE UP THE CHART -- P&amp;F CHART TARGET = $800.00</Title><Username>white_knight_in_texas</Username><Timestamp>1345305879591</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 12:04:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I really hope Apple wins the case against Samsung......Samsung needs to learn NOT to copy.

The government rescued Freddie and larger sibling Fannie Mae in September 2008 after massive losses on risky mortgages threatened to topple them. Taxpayers have spent about $170 billion to rescue Fannie and Freddie, the costliest bailout of the 2008 financial crisis. It could cost about $200 billion more to support the companies through 2014 after subtracting dividend payments, according to the government. This is the fifth quarter in which Freddie hasn't requested new federal aid since it was taken over in September 2008. Freddie Mac requested $19 million in federal aid in the first quarter. The company received $7.6 billion for all of 2011 and $13 billion for all of 2010. McLean, Va.-based Freddie Mac said Tuesday that its net income attributable to common shareholders amounted to 37 cents per share in the April-June period. That compares with a loss of $3.76 billion, or $1.16 per share, in the same period a year ago. It was Freddie's first profitable quarter since the first quarter of 2011. Freddie's latest results take into account $1.8 billion in dividend payments that Freddie made to the government, its primary shareholder. The company said the gain reflected a decrease in the amounts that it had to set aside to cover potential losses on mortgages as the housing market has improved. Fannie and Freddie are required to pay 10 percent dividends on the government money they receive. Freddie has paid more to the government in dividends than it has taken in aid in the last six quarters, the company says. Twenty-eight percent of the company's holdings are home loans issued between 2005 and 2008, which accounted for 88 percent of its losses in the first six months of the year. Freddie said those loans are becoming a smaller proportion of its portfolio, and that over time that should have a positive impact on its finances. Freddie and Washington-based Fannie own or guarantee about half of all U.S. mortgages, or nearly 31 million home loans, which are worth more than $5 trillion. Along with other federal agencies, they backed nearly 90 percent of new mortgages over the past year. The housing market has slowly begun to improve, but has a long way to go before it's healthy. Many homeowners are still defaulting on their mortgages. Unemployment remains high at 8.3 percent. Fannie and Freddie buy home loans from banks and other lenders, package them into bonds with a guarantee against default, and then sell them to investors around the world. When property values drop, more homeowners default, either because they are unable to afford the payments or because they owe more than the property is worth. Because of the guarantees, Fannie and Freddie must cover the losses. Pressure continues on the government to eliminate Fannie and Freddie and reduce taxpayers' exposure to risk. The Treasury Department put forward a plan last year to slowly dissolve the companies, though that process could take years. Abolishing Fannie and Freddie would transform how homes are bought and redefine who can afford them.</Msg><Username>preperforfmcc</Username><Timestamp>1345311887263</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 13:44:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345312297454-150</Id><Topic><Title>660 to 670 this week</Title><Username>jockne40</Username><Timestamp>1345305387425</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 11:56:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes, Ten...it is Really Good.

Now that the iphone release in imminent and due to hit in Calendar Q3 vs Q4 we are off to the races.

Also interesting: the focus on features rather than the functionality of the entire eco-system. The *innovation* apparent in the Apple concept is so much bigger than the form-factor of the phone, number of pixels, etc., encompassing: the supply of components; production &amp; distribution; and integration of the various devices with companion products and services... That is *innovation*, not how big is the screen, and more pixels the camera, etc. I agree that todays winner can quickly become tomorrows loser, whether by change of fashion, or failure to innovate. That IS important! But the focus on features and fashion here, as opposed to finances, is absurd. Its the astounding growth and profitability reflected in the stock price. The stock is an expression of the facts. everything else is preference and opinion. Maybe some will disagree, but I think what is important here is the forest, and not the trees.</Msg><Username>musketeernumberone</Username><Timestamp>1345317998607</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 15:26:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345318004495-186</Id><Title>I just finished my garage sale successfully. :)</Title><Msg>Couple of iPhone covers sold at $ 1.00 each. :) Those buyers asked me if it might make their iPhone more noisy.

If AAPL is a small cap stock, you can give the stock value with forward PE, (based on net earning growth this year over a year ago.) Assuming 1T market cap company, AAPL has to make net earning of 100B every years. You'd hope that the sales prices and costs of phones to remain favorable. (No price pressure from competitions..) A laptop used to be 4000 dollars 10 years ago. Now 400-600 (and much more powerful) Intel used to make 100-120 profits on the CPUs. Now INTC sells more CPUs than ever.. But it makes much less profit per CPU. INTC is a stock in value stock index!!! LMAO. it is growing in CPU units... The chance of BAC, AA, or C to double is much much higher than AAPL. The chance of AAPL to fall drastically is actually quite possible. If iPhones/iPads are out of favors, or pricing pressure heats up, this thing can sink faster than it rises. We have seen the rise and fall of RIMM and NOK. It is consumer electronics, stupid. (Have you seen anyone using iPods lately?) It is a fashion. It is not a necessity.

Over the coming years, Apple wants to be able to say "Steve designed this" or "Steve thought we should do that." Why? Because people believe Steve had magic and if you touch something that has Steve's name on it, maybe you'll get magic too. But the jury (in California!) could do immeasurable harm to Steve's legacy if they find that Steve didn't invent the iPad but rather the design belongs to Roger Fidler (from Knight Ridder), especially given that Fidler testified that Apple engineers knew all about his work. If that were to happen -- and the risk the jury could do this is very real -- what is lost to Apple? Is it just that Samsung gets to keep selling Galaxy Tabs in the U.S. (which aren't selling all that well versus the iPad) or is it something much deeper? I think it's the latter. If a jury says the iPad design isn't Steve's (and implying that maybe Steve took it from Fidler) the lost of credibility is great. The headlines will be harsh...can you just imagine "Jury Says Jobs Stole iPad Design." Some amount of Steve Magic spills out of the bottle and is forever lost in the sand. Apple needs that magic in the future...they need people to keep believing in that Steve mojo. The best way for them to do that is to license "Steve's" work to Samsung before the verdict. Let the Apple faithful keep believing in the magic, and don't let some jury rule the emperor had no clothes, regardless of whether it's true or not.</Msg><Username>pastapalegic</Username><Timestamp>1345342076296</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 22:07:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345343008812-285</Id><Topic><Title>starting EOD until EOW this pig will sell off as Samsung goes on attack</Title><Username>musichead2005</Username><Timestamp>1344968781124</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 14:26:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Spammers use the words PIG, BAGHOLDER etc. musichead is just a spammer or a short.
