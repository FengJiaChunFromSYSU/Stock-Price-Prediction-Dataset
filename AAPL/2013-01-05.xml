YHOO and Samsung are basically going to integrate a search results page into TV's, featuring relevant paid and organic links. Samsung's new screens will allow these search results to be shown fairly unobtrusively, at the very edge of the screen where on most TVs there is currentlyframing. YHOO's Soundprint technology (Into Now) will recognize the program you are watching. YHOO will serve links to relevant content in the sidebar as you are watching TV...pioneering a a new ad platform to reach TV viewers that bypasses the networks. YHOO will include personalized paid links tied to the program and the viewer's TV watching and app-using history. If this takes off this is huge....as revolutionary as Adwords or Facebook.

(AAPL) is Brookside Capital’s Top Pick</Title><Msg>Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is Brookside Capital's top stock pick. The tech stock makes up over 7.8% of the fund's 13F portfolio, according to its last quarterly filing with the SEC. Brookside - Bain Capital’s public equity fund - focuses on long/short positions and uses fundamental analysis to invest across all economic sectors (see Brookside Capital's favorite stock picks here). After eclipsing the $700-mark in September 2012, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) tumbled to around $530 by the end of last year, but still managed to close the calendar up almost 30%. It's been said on literally every channel out there, and repeatedly at that, but we'll say it again: the stock is an excellent value opportunity. Apple trades at 12x earnings, where other major tech peer Google is at 23x and Microsoft is at 15x. From a growth standpoint, Apple's 5-year long-term EPS growth rate also outshines that of Google (13%) and Microsoft (9%), and what's the cherry on top? Investors are severely discounting Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s future growth prospects, as shares of the tech giant trade at a paltry PEG ratio of 0.6; typically any figure below 1.0 signals an undervaluation. With close to $120 billion invested in its secret hedge fund, it's quite possible that income-seeking investors could see a boost in payout over the next year or so. For those keeping score, Apple's projected dividend yield (1.96%) still remains above that of the 10-Year Treasury (1.93%). Think about that for a second, and then think about this: Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has a bevy of growth drivers that can boost its shares to a fairer valuation, and they're almost all product-related. Some analysts estimate that an Apple TV would add at least 5-10% of upside to this year's EPS estimates if Cupertino does release the device, and obviously, a low-cost iPhone would do wonders for the company's exposure in emerging markets. Most of the recent hype has been about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s presence in the smart watch arena, but keep your eye on both of these potential developments. Billionaire David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital is one of the key investors owning Apple at the moment (check out David Einhorn's top picks), and AAPL was also the No. 1 pick among the 400+ hedge funds we track last quarter.</Msg><Username>arao25</Username><Timestamp>1357410046045</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 13:20:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357410132726-19</Id><Topic><Title>TA runs this stock, not fundamentals</Title><Username>ibuythered</Username><Timestamp>1357396223514</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 09:30:23 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hint #2 Check for Money inflows on Friday.</Msg><Username>atrayu19</Username><Timestamp>1357410132726</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 13:22:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357410901444-20</Id><Title>HEADLINE REPORT SAY SAMSUNG EXPECTED TO WIDEN SMARTPHONE LEAD OVER APPLE THIS YEAR IN 2013 .THE END IS NEAR FOR APPLE.

Benzinga reports that Trip Chowdhry, a managing director at Global Equities Research, has put out a research note estimating that Apple sold between 3 million and 4 million iPhones to businesses over the past quarter, some of whom have switched over from BlackBerry. “This figure emerges from a combination of new purchase of iPhones and users switching to iPhones from Blackberry,” Chowdhry writes. “After the two-year contract expiration on Apple iPhone[s], [the] majority of the enterprises have replaced their employees’ current phones with the new iPhone 5.” As for reasons why more companies are switching to the iPhone, Chowdhry says that salespeople for key enterprise apps such as Salesforce, Workday and VMware are increasingly “demonstrating their enterprise offering on iPhones, which is also acting as a trigger for enterprises to purchase iPhones for their employees.” Chowdhry also thinks that the advent of mobile device management software has boosted the iPhone’s security capabilities and has made it less risky for companies to adopt.</Msg><Username>waterboard_me</Username><Timestamp>1357411020744</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 13:37:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357411086943-24</Id><Topic><Title>Question</Title><Username>brattle_smattle</Username><Timestamp>1357400853711</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 10:47:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Oh my!!!...lol...i really hit a nerve with the suicide suggestions didn't i??....lol...i knew you've thought about it and probably tried but failed, didn't u??........u see, i know how miserable u are.....and your 24 postings here prove it!!...seriously, i can help you kill yourself....silently nd painlessly...think how much netter to be without all the anger and pain you feel.........i can talk you thu it.......think about it....we can talk off the mb if u want...let me know...</Msg><Username>sheepskinner6</Username><Timestamp>1357411086943</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 13:38:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357411190332-25</Id><Title>Sequester not Debt ceiling is what Repubs should use to pressure Obama</Title><Msg>Call Obama's bluff and give him 1 trillion dollar increase in Debt Ceiling now.

How'd AAPL do from there? === Apple has hit product after hit product. While this will sound very bullish to the Apple addicts, investors are concerned about sales of the new iPhones during the third quarter. More importantly, everything is pointing to some pressure on Apple’s gross margins in the coming quarters. There is an analyst call with some concern, and other data pointing to more solid figures which will add to some of the concerns about the sustainability of Apple’s mega-growth path. The research outfit at Kaufman has trimmed the unit sales expected from the new iPhone to 7.5 million units from an original projection of about 9.0 million (and versus what they call a street consensus of about 8.5 million units) The issue is not so much one of the demand side. Supply constraints in channel checks have brought up part of this concern. The big issue is that Kaufman noted that the supply constraints could impact the number of units shipped for the next two quarters. We have our own take on this supply issue. The implications of a two quarter tight supply would not be the end of a trend for Apple. The issue at stake is that this means much of the Christmas season will be in short supply of iPhones. There is of course also the possibility that Steve Jobs can bully suppliers for the rest of 2010.</Msg><Username>im_long_aapl</Username><Timestamp>1357411447066</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 13:44:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357411489712-27</Id><Topic><Title>Only JEWspammers post Apple stores are "Packed"</Title><Username>techs_long_horn</Username><Timestamp>1357409239094</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 13:07:19 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Bringing someone's religion into the discussion just shows how ignorant and prejudice a person you are.

Apple will sell $7 billion worth of Macs and $11 billion in iPads to the corporate market this year, the report added. In 2014, Apple will sell $8 billion in Macs and $13 billion in iPads. Forrester analyst Andrew Bartels told TechCrunch that Apple’s success in the corporate market was due to the fact that it made products that employees want to use and feel proud of. Apple’s “best-in-class” iPad is usually the first device a firm turns to when looking for tablets, he said. In addition, Apple’s corporate sales unit has been “responsive to business demand and delivers competitive prices.” Our 20-page proprietary analysis of Apple’s stock is ready. Click here to get your Cheat Sheet report now. The iPhone maker has also forced “fundamental change in the way people work and live,” Bartels said. While Google’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) Android is also seeing a high enterprise growth rate, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is beginning to be challenged by the mobile shift. Global corporate spending on Wintel PCs and tablets was down by 4 percent in 2012 and will be flat in 2013, Forrester said. While that was due to firms replacing old Windows desktop PCs with laptops, tablets, etc., by next year, increased PC demand and improved Windows 8 devices will lead to an 8 percent growth. However, that will still fall short of the double-digit growth for Linux, Android, and Apple products. “The growth rate in Linux and Android devices is primarily due to Android tablets — mostly from Samsung (SSNLF.PK) — which are starting to make inroads in the corporate market, but off of a very low base, hence the high growth rate,” Bartels said. Meanwhile, Apple continues to shine, and has even taken steps to develop a workflow that works for enterprise, including reports that its iWork suite will soon be integrated with VMware (NYSE:VMW) Horizon.</Msg><Username>waterboard_me</Username><Timestamp>1357412806149</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 14:06:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357412909730-39</Id><Topic><Title>HEADLINE REPORT SAY SAMSUNG EXPECTED TO WIDEN SMARTPHONE LEAD OVER APPLE THIS YEAR IN 2013 .THE END IS NEAR FOR APPLE.

And what does a few suppliers making parts for which model really mean, vs. its well known Apple is working on newer models to replace existing models. Last year they surprised the market coming out with an improved IPAD4 mid-year. They may well be doing such again with an Improved IPHONE5S or an earlier intro. of an IPHONE6. If so, of course they'd cut back some component purchases for the existing models. Doutche Bank took one piece of data and extrapolated alot more than it meant, to likely help its trading desk which likely took out big positions before options expiration Friday.

Reality Check</Title><Msg>Let's start a realistic discussion: While none of the subsequent items are known realities, they are already priced in to the current valuation of the company: What is priced in? Answer: All the chatter, which includes... 1. Slowing growth 2. Samsung is fractionally increasing it's market share. (I might add here that Samsung doesn't enjoy the profit margins that Apple does and that Apple may not care about the lower end of the market. Read the history of Apple and Steve Jobs' biography. It's about the Zen of doing a few things great and with elegance, than doing too many things half measure. 3. The possibility of a miss or soft numbers on the iPhone 5. 5. Product refreash causing lower margins. 6. Rival products narrowing the gap with Apple's line. What is NOT priced in? 1. Apple may surprise to the upside this quarter. 2. They may increase their dividend. 3. They may hint at what is in their pipeline, i.e. wearable iThings, TV, etc. 4. They may agressively buy back stock. They might hold these shares in foreign currency, reducing the tax implications of these funds being held overseas. 5. A deal with China Mobile. 6. iPad Mini sales beyond the wildest expectations and getting stronger. 7. An iPhone Mini with respectable margins to grab develping market share. I remember when the share price of Apple dropped from 200 plus to 79. Steve Jobs was sick and getting sicker. The sky was falling. People were counting on the end of Apple. iHate Apple was in vogue. Naysayers were proven wrong. Add to this all the skepticism when Steve Jobs announced the iPad. People are emotional about this company, and the stock trades with more emotion than most, perphaps fear being the strongest emotion. The reality is that fears have always proven to be overblown and unfounded. We are caught in an season of negativity towards Apple. Your decision and mine to stick with Apple is a gamble. That's what investing is all about. Fear presents one of the greatest opportunities for those who are equipped to process it realistically and rationally. Apple is more attractively valued right now on any valuation metric than it has been in the last five years. It has an ecosystem that people will not leave behind. I have hundreds of dollars of Apps, music, books, etc. that have been purchased through iTunes. There's no way that I'm going to leave that for a new product line. In fact, I'll probably buy my first Mac after decades of PC use. I believe this is a moment to consider risk/reward and lengthen the horizon of your confidence in this company. The Apple culture is alive. Tim Cook is doing a great job. He's not given the credit for the role he played keeping Apple together when Jobs was dying. Good luck!

Apple has enough people with good ideas to bring to the table. They have Tim Cook, the brilliant proccess guy who will lead the company into the future. Apple's profits and share price have all increased under Tim Cook.

And yet selling continues. What does that tell you. Funds drive the price. Funds already own oversized positions. Funds see that growth may be slower for 2-3 quarters and don't want to sit through a period of underperformance. Risks of more cometitive pressures are real and are just enough to cause fund managers to incrementally reduce their position sizes. stock is cheap relative to current growth rate. no question. But if that rate of growth is set to slow, then its not as cheap. What people may not see, is that th erun from 425 to 700 should not have taken place. it was hysteria over the idea that iphone 5 would have some new gamechanging feature set. Reality is the Galaxy III has more impressive feature list than iphone 5. Market was disappointed that the iphone 5 didn't once again reinvent the cell phone. Stock will bottom once every nervous fund manager has finally sold. That may take another 2 quarters in reality.</Msg><Username>calbucks09</Username><Timestamp>1357415941840</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 14:59:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357416125003-80</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft options almost 4 times cheaper than Apple options....why???</Title><Username>lightdoesnotage</Username><Timestamp>1357413807823</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 14:23:27 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Buy a copy of Sheldon Natenburg's book on options and buy a black scholes calculator. you can download a app for that on your iphone!</Msg><Username>calbucks09</Username><Timestamp>1357416125003</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 15:02:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357416149710-81</Id><Topic><Title>No reason not to go long apple big time tommorw</Title><Username>cwtripps</Username><Timestamp>1352270986251</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 01:49:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wow Tendulrocks...coolrobb was right, and you, as usual, 100% wrong.

Lost credibility: They have missed analyst EPS estimates 2 quarters in a row now. And, Cook gave much lower guidance for q1 2013 than expected (especially on gross margin) causing analysts to lower projections for this period. 2. Financial Uncertainty: Along with #1, there is a lot of uncertainty about just how much revenue and margins will slow. Cook has gross margin falling off a cliff in the eyes of investors (down from 44.7% q1 2012 to 44.0% q4 2013 to guide of 36% q1 2013). Great reasons for it (manufacturing costs of new products, offering iPhone 4 and 4S at discounts, new product launch costs, etc.) but no one likes margins on the decline and if you draw a line through the trend it looks really scary. 3. Innovation Uncertainty: Without Jobs, the question is can they come up with a next thing to regain revenue and margin growth momentum? Since they don't disclose what they are working on, they will not get any value for a future product until they deliver one at this point. It would seem their best opportunities to regain investor confidence would be to 1) soundly beat q1 2013 analyst estimates of $54.5B revenue and $13.33 EPS and 2) deliver solid q2 2013 guidance and especially guide gross margins back above 40% by moving down the cost curve on new products. Later in 2013, they will need to 1) launch a new innovation by Christmas 2013 that captures the market's imagination and 2) launch iPhone with China Mobile for the 2014 Chinese New Year (if not much earlier).</Msg><Username>bbandassoc</Username><Timestamp>1357418161446</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 15:36:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357418175247-119</Id><Topic><Title>question: When do I sell my profitable call options?</Title><Username>avshama</Username><Timestamp>1357417686201</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 15:28:06 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>we will see one more move towards or thru 555.40 which is key resistance that has failed to break above but if it clears that specific number it is off to the races</Msg><Username>opt_trdr</Username><Timestamp>1357418175247</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 15:36:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357418186948-120</Id><Topic><Title>interesting point of view from another investor</Title><Username>robertel65</Username><Timestamp>1357409078427</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 13:04:38 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Your #$%$ gets old, BFLGT....get off the Yahoo message boards.</Msg><Username>papal_papa2</Username><Timestamp>1357418186948</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 15:36:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357418225108-121</Id><Topic><Title>What is Priced In?

Even CNBC trashed Apple when it was 79 per share. Time will once again prove that the horizon is not bleak.

Half an hour later a long burn line appeared in the touchscreen. Phone was 3 mos. old, he has it because he went cheap, so carrier offered no replacement while the thing was being fixed. In short, it's cheap knockoff. And it is not surprising that Samsung is selling a lot of cheap knockoffs. But here's the rub: AAPL is not going to introduce a low end phone to compete with this garbage. They will just introduce more and more high-end items--which of course will no longer be phones in any sense of the word--and eliminate the market for "smartphones." In short, you Samsung boys worry about the horse-market and new horse-car hybrids.

They only sold 15.5 million iPads at the same time last year, so they would just need to sell about 10 million large iPads to match last years revenues for iPads (They sold 15.5 million last quarter. ) I can POSSIBLY see a miss here, but they have grown every quarter year over year since inception. I have only heard of one analyst say that they MIGHT be light on iPhone sales, but beating 37 million is a VERY low number. With 50+ % revenues coming from iPhones at nearly 70% margin, this number is the key to their quarter. In any event, thanks for the response.</Msg><Username>docnaka12</Username><Timestamp>1357418846836</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 15:47:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357418882347-132</Id><Topic><Title>Remember if Apple clears 555.40 it is a straight shot gap to 594.00</Title><Username>opt_trdr</Username><Timestamp>1357418272987</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 15:37:52 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>All Blue Skies ahead eh ?

I think (but I lay no great weight on this), that they didn't really have much in stock in the days before Christmas that wasn't scheduled for pickup (excepting iPods and such), and that there was no reason to go there while wrapping up Ch. shopping unless you had already reserved. But, as I say, that's just a guess. The only AAPL product I bought personally this Christmas was stock--lots of it.

They will raise it.</Msg><Username>binnybeoris</Username><Timestamp>1357423526714</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 17:05:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357423566777-205</Id><Title>Bullish scenario to Earnings</Title><Msg>ok, here is the bullish scenario. here is exactly what needs to occur. Gross Margin Guidance: Cook needs to give guidance substantially increasing gross margin expected for remainder of 2013, similar to 2010. If he guides back above 40% after the initial launch of the new products, analysts will reprice stock. Unit sales of Iphones, preferably sales abroad, MUST subtantially come in north of wall street analyst models (note, NOT apple's guidance). you get those 2 things from Tim Cook, and longs will see 700 by mid year. the critical one is gross margins. You need to dispell the new wall street fears of gross margin compression.</Msg><Username>calbucks09</Username><Timestamp>1357423566777</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 17:06:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357423585226-206</Id><Topic><Title>Right or Wrong You much Trust Apple this earning or You can call It, “It's” AEA 1998-2013:</Title><Username>thinkdifferent_98</Username><Timestamp>1357421051725</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 16:24:11 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Funny ...

IHS iSuppli, which regularly tears apart electronic devices to estimate a "bill of materials," or BOM, pegged the lowest-priced iPad Mini's component costs at $188, with an additional $10 to account for manufacturing. The total of $198 does not include other costs, such as research and development, marketing or capital expenses. With the 16GB iPad Mini's retail price of $329, the $131 represented a margin of nearly 40%, slightly higher than the 37% margin iSuppli estimated Apple earned on each third-generation iPad when that model debuted last March. The more expansive configurations -- 32GB and 64GB -- add even more to Apple's bottom line, said Andrew Rassweiler, iSuppli's senior principal analyst for teardowns, in an interview today. Calling Apple's incremental cost for the additional memory "almost insignificant," he and his team put the extra income at $90 for the 32GB, $162 for the 64GB device, both above and beyond the $131 for the 16GB model.</Msg><Username>dave72picks</Username><Timestamp>1357423638516</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 17:07:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357423655079-208</Id><Topic><Title>Apple is not going to test 550 the bottom is in you heard it first from one the greatest apple traders</Title><Username>opt_trdr</Username><Timestamp>1351952166204</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 10:16:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Another jerk off living with his hore momma.</Msg><Username>apex_trex</Username><Timestamp>1357423655079</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 17:07:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357423703276-209</Id><Topic><Title>is market share really that important?</Title><Username>tbc1962</Username><Timestamp>1357421419166</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 16:30:19 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>not at all.

Apple is undervalued. But its about perception and ownership. Apple is overowned and every analyst is bullish. That means the risk is to the downside on any evidence that the bullish thesis is incorrect. this is the largest market cap in the world. Therefore it is the most likely to fall on any execution hiccup. When a ceo guides their gross margin down to 36% from 41% that is going to create mayhem.

Personally I think its a good move, but I agree with analysts that it is cannabalizing to some degree. The more worrisome potential scenario is continued lower margins across the board due to price competition or due to shorter product cycle times where there is less time to achieve economies of scale between models.</Msg><Username>calbucks09</Username><Timestamp>1357425897583</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 17:44:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357425949469-238</Id><Topic><Title>Great quote from Marc Faber</Title><Username>calbucks09</Username><Timestamp>1357425684227</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 17:41:24 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Kodak?

Now, Tim Cook and the heads at Apple are thinking about iRadio. Internet Radio is the future but iRadio is the wrong way to go about it. First and foremost, Apple makes great products, but has no experience in broadcasting, which is a completely different market altogether. (Remember the Google maps fiasco?) Pandora currently owns a 75% market-share of the web radio space and it also has deals with over a dozen automakers, including BMW, Ford, Honda, and Toyota, to provide in-dash functionality. Also, an Apple iRadio would not work on Androids and other smart phones. At a current valuation of $1.6b, a Pandora buyout makes more sense than anything else in the web radio business. Unless Apple makes an immediate move to acquire Pandora, then Google or Facebook will beat them to it. You can bet that the music industry will work with an Apple/Pandora Radio to negotiate a fair deal. Wake up Tim Cook! I love Apple and I love Pandora.

Apple is still without viable competitors in this field. Compare away to MSFT, but you look a little foolish.

Why would networks allow that to happen? You don't really think they'll let a 3rd party piggyback on all their billions spent creating content do you? If you're watching sports on ESPN for example I GUARANTEE any advertising dollars coming from links is going to their bottomline not Yahoo's. Are you suggesting Yahoo gets a cut? I don't think it'd be much at all and more of a technology licensing type deal. 2. That being said, we're on serious information overload. Take ESPN for example, they used to tell you a hitters batting average, strikeouts, on-base percentage but now it includes balls hit in play, runners in scoring position, their hot/cold sectors of their strike zone. Football used to be just yardage, ints, and TD's of the QB but now its gone from QB rating to a new metric in QBR taking to consideration how a QB does in the red zone. They've exponentially included the number of useless stats like that guy is the 1st Caucasian American from south central Minneapolis to hit a homerun at Target Field while overhead is less than 5 clouds. Who gives a s***!lol 3. There is nothing worse than annoying product placement and I certainly don't want to watch a continuous catalog on TV where my TV show was supposed to be. Nothing worse than an ad shoved in my face as Yahoo LOVES to do on its home page with its pop up ads. The ONLY way this comes to fruition is if Dish's fast-forward technology stands in Cali and NY where skipping ads completely is possible. Only then will networks have to go into the show itself. Downside is MOST people have more than the basic 5 networks so therefore pay for each channel. Quite a few people have simply got rid of TV altogether going the route of Netflix or Amazon. ***Are we forgetting this is the SAME TECHNOLOGY and Widgets that Bartz announced 3yrs ago and hasn't taken off???*** Glad you're still in Yahoo as you bring good discussions and I've only scratched the surface here as I got a Vikings playoff party to attend but your batting avg. hasn't been too good lately. Newco? MSFT paying tons of money for the 361' patent? That being said this is BY FAR the most interesting possibility I've read.</Msg><Username>hotmodeltestid122</Username><Timestamp>1357429434042</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 18:43:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357429519375-295</Id><Topic><Title>AAPL is a great value at a P.E. of less then 9.</Title><Username>cadmium_nitrate</Username><Timestamp>1357428294901</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 18:24:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And the company that sells paper towels has a PE of 19 plus........and a company with cents for EPS in Amazon has a PE of 3000......and a company that's stock price hit $711 in october of 2007 and now the stock price in Jan 2013 is $738.....has a PE of 23...and for all its Android growth is only up $27 bucks over its high of 2007.....

Overlay the 2000 CSCO chart with the current AAPL daily chart and it appears to be the exact same pattern after CSCO's blowoff top. declining 50 dma is resistence. CSCO dropped from 70 to 13 in about 1 year. That would be like aapl plunging from $700 to $130. I'm thinking $210 may be an interesting entry point as that would be a typical 70% correction of an Institutional favorite/ IBD 50 highflyer that eventually t tops out while everyone says buy the dip with both hands. that's so the big institutions can slowly unwind their positions without complete carnage. a/d rating at IBD is D- on AAPL and B+ on Q's after NDQ Comp staged largest up week in 13 months....yet AAPL only up 3.33% far underperforming the NDQ and Q's on the record breaking week.</Msg><Username>ibdman15</Username><Timestamp>1357430350076</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 18:59:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357430454035-313</Id><Title>Put 20K in Apple right here at $530 and in 20 years you will have $10M.

The networks don't have any choice. Yahoo and Samsung are basically "framing" the TV network's content...and placing their own relevant ads within their frame. It's the equivalent of a web toolbar. A web toolbar can display its own ads as a user navigates from website to website. The websites don't get a cut of the toolbar ad revenue. And neither will the networks get a cut of the YHOO / Samsung ads that accompany or overlay the network content.IMO. "There is nothing worse than annoying product placement..." I agree. If this platform is to work, it must add real value to consumers, and the inclusion of paid links together with customer-desired organic links must be done very carefully and be skillfully personalized. But this is the challenge of every ad platform...whether broadcast TV, or the Google search results page, or the Facebook newsfeed, or Tweets....carefully managing the frequency and responsiveness of paid ads, interspersed with customer-chosen content, so consumers don't get turned off. I don't know if YHOO will be able to make this work. The point is, integrating in effect a search results page with TV content, that is personalized in real-time for the individual viewer and for the content that is being shown, is a MASSIVE business opportunity if done well...which could easily generate hundreds of billions in market cap. And YHOO looks to be a true leader in this space...we'll see how much so at CES this week.</Msg><Username>argent_a_bend_gules</Username><Timestamp>1357431068326</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 19:11:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357431089345-323</Id><Topic><Title>Deceleration in Earnings and Sales</Title><Username>ibdman15</Username><Timestamp>1357430350076</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 18:59:10 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Earnings is obviously the BIG question mark.

If we just look at macro data, IDC says the smartphone market will grow 40% this past quarter. If true and AAPL maintained its market share, then, they should have sold 51.8M iPhones. However, both Kaptran and comScore suggest AAPL made significant market share gains since last year, especially in the U.S. market. Kaptran has U.S. market share up from 35.8% to 53.3% in the Sept. - Nov. 25 period. comScore has U.S. market share up from from 28.7% last November to 35% this November (a full month for both 4S last year and 5 this year). Market share in Europe was also up modestly and the iPhone 5 was launched in 101 countries this year, including China, whereas the iPhone 4s was only launched in 70 and not in Asia, except Japan. Perhaps IDC is wrong about market growth and/or Kaptran and comScore are wrong about AAPL gaining market share, but if we just take the publicly available data at face value, it would suggest iPhone sales should be 51.8M plus whatever market share gains are assigned to it. Other factors to consider are 1) the initial iPhone 5 launch was the end of last quarter, so the early bolus of sales were recognized last period whereas the 4S was launched late October 2011, yet the 5 has been available an entire quarter and the 4 probably sold little in the first 3 weeks of October last year awaiting the 4s launch, 2) China sold 2M iPhone 5s in their initial weekend and had 2 additional weeks of sales as well as whatever was realized in the additional 30 countries that the iPhone 4S didn't reach last year, and 3) WMT and Best Buy discounted iPhone 5's (at their own cost to drive foot traffic) while everyone was discounting 4 and 4S (presumably at AAPL's cost based on Cook call comments) to drive additional demand this holiday season. All combined, it's just very difficult to see how they miss the 47M to 49M unit forecast of analysts this period.</Msg><Username>bbandassoc</Username><Timestamp>1357434090425</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 20:01:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>23</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357434228959-361</Id><Topic><Title>News alert!!!

December 17th low 501.23. December 27th low 504.66. Next low will be higher, there is a trend change happening right now. I believe that on Tuesday we will see a higher low and the stock will begin to move up again. On this next leg up, we may break out of the descending channel and thus the reversal will be complete. It may take one additional down cycle before this happens but I agree with Cody Willard who is calling for AAPL to go to 1,000 on the next big move up, from the bottom that we are forming right now.</Msg><Username>jrdelane</Username><Timestamp>1357437284127</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 20:54:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357437344900-395</Id><Topic><Title>Ready for a +$100 week?

They almost sold out in China and Hongkong and pretty much everywhere else as the other analyst said. Who wants a samsung when you can get a iPhone or iPad for pretty much the same price.

Yes phone sales matter; so will the pad sales and so will the gross margin -- we expect all of those to surprise to the upside. There are many things that have tortured these shares, but beyond ongoing superb management execution, the one thing Cook must fix is to ensure the street understands the roll forward guidance sandbagging of the past either is or is not going to persist... it is a truism that they have F up the last two Q by failing to smash not only guidance but also the consensus estimates -- because that has been the pattern for several years prior to the last two q... All of that is most unfortunate, bur a huge part of the fault lay at the sellsiders' feet, too. Guys like Gene Munster and Shaw Wu, excellent, super bright analysts who actually do work along the lines of yours above, need to teach Cook what AAPL's lame investor relations and even CFO have not about why it is critical to ensure the street understands what mgmt is actually thinking re the guide vs consensus and vs smahing both (or NOT). Cook needs to get this right from now on to avoid having the entire street and the buyside and all the #$%$ shorting the story be able/required/forced to begin their first paragraphs of updates by writing, "Well the Q was okay, but they badly missed the consensus." Such fail makes all the sellsiders and BUYSIDERS afraid of management's lack of control over the IR process... a non-workable credibility issue for the valuation. Given the carnage of late, we can hope Tim and many PM in addition to us have shared this perspective with mgmt. Longs can also hope AAPL has ambitiously repurchased shares and will re-up the authorization with force near term... and while they are smelling some coffee on capital planning and despite missing the huge opportunity to crank a special div in December, they really ought to come with that tied tightly to the earnings call. A $30 special dividend is comfortable for them given free cash flow and domestic liquidity, and it would send a message/warning shot straight between the eyes of the tools like Grundlach and kass mgmt is letting punish the stock with impunity -- at least until the heavy institutional money decides it is safe enough to pull the hedge shorts and resume the run higher here. As ambitious buyers on this latest redip to below $530, we are amazed to see the negative sentiment directed at the shares... but perhaps on the guidance vs consensus piece alone and the missed consensus two Q in a row, the BOD and Cook have earned it for their shareholders. It seems in the distant past when sentiment was frighteningly bullish (everyone loved the story at $705 going to $1111), but that was only 3 weeks ago! The intensely negative sentiment bias seen since then is very encouraging for us -- we think the sustained reversal will be VIOLENT AND RAPID... and start any day now. Figure it out already Tim!</Msg><Username>squeezetracker</Username><Timestamp>1357443019199</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 22:30:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357443042736-457</Id><Topic><Title>mac sold out in maryland</Title><Username>kidil999</Username><Timestamp>1357441113005</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 21:58:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well apple selling didn't start overnight.

In last years FQ1 report, US sales were about 37% of the 37 Million iPhones sold (ATT sold 7.6M, VZ sold about 4.3M, and Sprint about 2M) for a total of about 13.9M iPhones sold domestically. It is very important to remember two things for comparison purposes: 1) The iPhone 4S was released two weeks AFTER the quarter started and 2) The iPhone 4S rollout was much slower (China didn’t even start selling it until the next quarter). The first point means domestic sales might have been more brisk for the 4S because opening weekend/week was included, but also less sales because of the 2 less weeks. Another huge point of consideration is that Apple share of US smartphone sales last year in the same quarter was 35% vs this year 53% (and likely higher than this) according to a recent report. So we know for sure that domestic sales of the iPhone will surely come in higher than last year, if not much higher. If we assume flat total smartphone sales year over year (just to be extra conservative), we take 13.9M iPhones and divide by 0.35 for a total of 39.7M total smartphone sales in the US last year in the 4th quarter. Now, iOS has a 53% share of smartphone sales in the US so we multiply 39.7 x 53% to get 21 Million iPhones sold for the 4th quarter in the US. Ignoring the fact that the iPhone 5 rolled out much quicker than the 4S internationally, we can use the same US/international ratio of iPhone sales as last year (~37%) to get a good estimate of total iPhone sales for the quarter. 21 Million / 0.37 = 56.75 Million iPhones sold for the quarter. So we can be fairly comfortable with this number, given the conservative approach I’ve taken to calculate this figure. Couple this with a number like 27 Million total iPads sold, and we can be comfortable with an EPS coming in at least $15 (with plenty of upside possible).</Msg><Username>madskillz9891</Username><Timestamp>1357444666414</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 22:57:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357444876310-473</Id><Title>Chew on this</Title><Msg>Apple will have (technically already has) more cash in the drawer then amazon is "worth".

I was working on two models. And, the one that ignores the 14 v. 13 weeks is the 51.8M base without market share gains nor any other factors. Here is the logic for ignoring it, however. The q1 sales in both cases involve the launch of a new iPhone model as well as Christmas. The majority of sales likely occur during the early phase of the launch and leading into Christmas, as people hold off purchases awaiting the launches. And, in 2011, there were likely few sales the 3 weeks leading up to the October 21 launch of the 4S. As such, the 14th week probably meant little to revenue in q111 and somewhere between 48.2 and 51.8 is a fair baseline.</Msg><Username>bbandassoc</Username><Timestamp>1357445200278</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 23:06:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357445279326-476</Id><Topic><Title>Macro look at iPhone Units</Title><Username>bbandassoc</Username><Timestamp>1357434090425</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 20:01:30 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I did the same calculation but what troubles me is the US market share last year and this year.

So with that, I'm gonna assume their EPS guidance is probably the closest to the truth. At $11.75 per share, to me that's a $560 stock (12x). I'm not long or short but on the sidelines because the risk IMHO is too high of a negative surprise (actual iPhone numbers in the mid 40's, iPad mini taking too many below the line dollars from the iPad total). If their EPS drops below $11.75, it could be a mid 400 stock. disclosure: I own iphones, ipads, macbooks, imacs....love their stuff</Msg><Username>rknipe</Username><Timestamp>1357446338376</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 23:25:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357446350524-485</Id><Topic><Title>Huge news--- year long congressional tax study of tech companies are over -- apple smells like roses</Title><Username>cwtripps</Username><Timestamp>1357437967380</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 21:06:07 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Been going on a year and apple has helped them understand DID U SEE THE FISCAL CLIFF BILL IT included tech company subsidizes..

They "missed' lofty analyst expectations, but still produced the BEST QUARTER EVER FOR THE THIRD QUARTER IN A CALENDAR YEAR. Is this really a miss? 2) Cook had gross margin guidance which was 5% lower than actual margins. This is called "lowballing". I do believe that margins will be lower, but nowhere near the 36% guidance. Most likey, margins will come in around 40% to 41.5 %. All things considered, these are pretty incredible numbers. The fact is.....the guidance given by Cook is the highest ever. You can bet your pants that they will BEAT guidance. 3) It is a FACT that Jony Ivie is the innovator at Apple. He is credited with MacBook Pro, iMac, MacBook Air, iPod, iPod Touch, iPhone, iPad and iPad Mini. Jobs had MANY failures along with his successes. As long as Apple has Ivie, they retain the most innovative person on the planet. Rest assured, this will be the BEST quarter EVER by any company!</Msg><Username>docnaka12</Username><Timestamp>1357446698661</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 23:31:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357446729519-492</Id><Topic><Title>Chew on this</Title><Username>mccormickred</Username><Timestamp>1357444876310</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 23:01:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Youre an idiot if you don't think there was substantial tax sell off prior to the end of the year.
