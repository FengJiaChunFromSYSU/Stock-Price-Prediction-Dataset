Here's a list of market-moving catalysts: $2.65/sh. QUARTERLY DIVIDEND - Ex-Date = 8/9/2012 (Next Thursday); Payable = 8/16/2012. iPhone"5" - Major hardware refresh will make this iPhone the largest launch of any product ever in the world - according to Piper Jaffray Analyst Gene Munster. Own AAPL ahead of the launch date - rumored to be on Sept. 12th, 2012. $10 BILLION (3-YR.) SHARE BUYBACK PROGRAM - Begins in Calendar Q4 (Oct). iPad Mini - Rumored to have a Fall launch...just in time for the Holiday Gift-Giving Season in the USA and China. I predict the iPad Mini will be bigtime seller, and it will also crush inferior tablet manufacturers who sell at a "loss" at this time. Soon, their tablet business will be a loss leader...and eventually discontinue. Watch for the future headlines. Split - This simple management of the share price...is long overdue. With a cult-like following of young, retail APPLE consumers/investors, it is only rational and logical to keep your share price low to appeal to a broad base of new, possibly young investors, e.g. - teenager working at a part-time job, to begin investing for their future. There is also a basic psychological-effect of lowering the share price...in a market in which the main objective is the "buy low". It is a no-brainer for APPLE to split the shares in my view. EXXON MOBIL has split their shares all the way up the chart...and XOM is believed by many to have the best, conservative management in the fully-integrated oil &amp; gas industry - successful in all commodity price cycles. Side note: XOM is about to break out to the upside from a long-term ascending triangle. iTV - This device will bring the whole APPLE ECOSYSTEM TOGETHER within the comfort of your living room or office. I predict that iTV will a MAJOR CATALYST for PE Expansion...as it will create a LOT of VALUE and ancillary "halo effect" to purchase ALL of the APPLE devices. The next 6 months are going to shock the skeptics ($hills)...and bring a big smile to the long-term APPLE shareholders. INVEST and HOLD AAPL for the LONG-TERM GROWTH and INCOME. P.S. - P&amp;F CHART PRICE TARGET = $710.</Msg><Username>white_knight_in_texas</Username><Timestamp>1344052953666</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 00:02:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344053269660-2</Id><Topic><Title>Technicals for apple look bearish</Title><Username>musichead2005</Username><Timestamp>1344043884834</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-03 21:31:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thankfully technical analysis is about as predictive as Astrology, with which it shares its basis in reality.</Msg><Username>radar_the_kat</Username><Timestamp>1344053269660</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 00:07:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344053517390-3</Id><Title>APPL Stock Split ??</Title><Msg>A Chinese Company named BIDU recently split its $700 stock on the Nasdaq at a 10 : 1 basis and is currently selling around $125 per new Share = $1,250 for the old share price ????</Msg><Username>croatkid1</Username><Timestamp>1344053517390</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 00:11:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344053627682-4</Id><Title>aaplboost</Title><Msg>I think if we don't break 617 next week convincingly then we may go down....aaplboost, whats ur take on this?</Msg><Username>tendulrocks</Username><Timestamp>1344053627682</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 00:13:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344053648329-5</Id><Topic><Title>How big a drop after dividend date?</Title><Username>fender_boy21</Username><Timestamp>1344044212771</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-03 21:36:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Apple's share price will rebound from any dividend related dip faster than most, as it's cash is valued near $0; it's totally discounted in the share price (as though Apple has no cash at all).

That would free up production capacity for the 163 pixels per inch displays used in that phone. So why not continue production of displays at that pixel density (the R&amp;D has already been amortized) and start producing them at 7.85" for a new iPad mini rather than the 3.5" currently being produced for the iPhone 3GS? A 7.85" display with a 4:3 aspect ratio at 163 pixels per inch would yield 1024x768, the same pixel count as the iPad 2. No need to rewrite iPad apps; they'll run unmodified on this new device. Buttons and other touch elements will shrink to 68% of the size of their counterparts on the 9.7" display (the mini's 7.85" display will have 68% of the screen area of the existing iPad's 9.7" display) which will make touch elements almost exactly the size you find on the iPhone. Presumably our fingers, used to touching things on the iPhone display, will not need to be filed down as per Steve Jobs' hyperbole. No need for a lot of new engineering to come up with a display technology for the new device; the 163 pixels per inch display technology already exists and is proven. This will help Apple keep costs down and maintain their margins on the iPad mini. While 163 pixels per inch would not be considered Retina quality, it's still 52% higher pixel density than the iPad 2 display, which is 132 pixels per inch; (163x163) / (132x132) = 1.52. This will undoubtedly be a selling point, with Apple's marketing rounding the number to "more than 50% higher resolution than iPad 2." By utilizing existing display technology, Apple will likely be able to price this new device competitively in the 7 - 8" tablet space while retaining the high margins it garners on the more expensive 9.7" Retina iPad. Apple realizes that it's in a game to slow adoption of competing tablets in order to suppress any build out of the competition's app store inventory. The more iPads exist, especially ones that present developers with zero additional hurdles to developing apps, the fewer developers will work on apps for Android or Windows 8 apps. My guess on pricing? $279 for 16GB, $329 for 32GB. Apple will save money in the manufacture of the iPad mini by utilizing the 163 pixels per inch display tech used in the iPhone 3GS. It will save additional money via the economies of scale its likely to achieve from the fact it will sell millions per quarter. Add to that a higher price point that Apple will be able to command due to its superior catalog of available apps and its excellent ecosystem (and smooth integration with all other Apple products) and you'll see Apple likely garner margins similar to its existing product lines.</Msg><Username>radar_the_kat</Username><Timestamp>1344053986195</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 00:19:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344054363398-7</Id><Topic><Title>Why didn't aapl rise more than 8 pts on such a killer day</Title><Username>northofheaven2000005</Username><Timestamp>1344037648929</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-03 19:47:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Look at the last five trading days.

If you`ll indulge some long-winded rambling my take is something like this: (Also, I would take all my charting like reading a newspaper Astrology page—for entertainment purposes only) If you want to avoid the ramble skip down to the bottom. Going all the way back to the two-day rocket pop that peaked Wed. April 18 at 620.25 (close 610.35) and a similar one right after Q2 earnings that peaked Wed. April 25 at 618.22 (close 610.72), this range (618-620) has remained a daunting zone of resistance, where post-earnings trapped longs have/had been waiting to break even and eager shorts were/are ready to pounce—11 weeks elapsed before it was tested again ( Tues. July 10 at 619.87) via a 54 point 7-day parabolic bull spike that ended in a 3-day pullback of almost 30 points from tail to tail. This spike breakout—begun June 29 (probably the pre-earnings run), ended a month long (May 24--June 28) sideways trading range consolidation period that riveted a heavy bridge of support between 565-585 (esp. 568-578). It also created the most recent swing high through which a long bear tread line can be drawn (starting from April 10 high 644 or high close April 9 at 635.52 whichever you want). Until yesterday, that is, when this line would have to be raised just slightly to accommodate the close (615.70). (BTW, this resistance zone, especially when going by exact previous day`s highs has worked like Swiss clocks and magic chocolate over the past weeks for short scalps and semi-day swing short and covers). If you look at the last month from Thurs. June 5 to yesterday Aug. 3, you can see that AAPL has been trading in a tight sideways trading range between approx. 600 and 617—well, okay, you have to take out the earnings drop and the ensuing 4 days when WS said you missed bad and then thought about it and said, wait a minute, those are actually great earnings, then with iP5 rumors and whatnot. The point being is that this seems to be the new trading comfort zone until further notice—600--617. When you watch the daily price action you see returning buying pressure over and over just when you think it will sell off. I think the continued buzz and seemingly reliable speculation over iP5 launch date and the dividend are preventing the normal pullback one might otherwise expect down to the low 590s or so (not to mention the macro climate has been shine-the-green the past few days, warranted or not). Just technically, if you look at a one year daily chart, you see that a bull flag, pennant, falling wedge, whatever you want to call it has been forming over the last 4 months. If this went text book on us, then AAPL would trade slightly bearish sideways (in a 620—588 range) and break out end of Aug. early Sept. moving to new highs sometime in Sept. If you look at the last 10 wks. or so AAPL has been trading in an uptrend channel. If this channel continues over the next month, AAPL will trade between 588 and 655. If you look at the past 6 trading days, AAPL has paused slightly in the course of a normally unsustainable bull spike, hovering just under key resistance and buoyed by a tenuous but persistent buying pressure. The near term (as in next two, three, four, five days) scenarios would look like this: Bullish: AAPL spikes up even further, breaking through the long awaited 620 only to reach even higher, climactically stretching and piercing the upper boundary of the 5SD envelope that parallels the 22day EMA—that is to say, between 629-631 before reversing sharply back down to trade again in the 595-615 range. Neutral: AAPL continues to trade in a tight trading range between 607 and 618, repeatedly banging its head against the seemingly impenetrable ceiling, maybe having a peek at 620 before becoming exhausted and meandering back down to 600 and lazily lilting around there—give or take 5 points—for a few days. Bearish: Institutions continue to whack the bid for a few days, but shorts, like monkeys with sticks on the roof, will give AAPL no high exit. Bulls become exhausted (of patience and money) and like broke drunken sailors looking for a cheaper lay, decide to withdraw until a better entry becomes available. AAPL tumbles hard down to 582 over the next weeks in the subsequent wound-licking respite. That`s my take on it for what it`s worth.</Msg><Username>aaplboost</Username><Timestamp>1344084030033</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 08:40:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344084173154-21</Id><Topic><Title>aaplboost</Title><Username>tendulrocks</Username><Timestamp>1344053627682</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 00:13:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Raand ki aulaad...</Msg><Username>achtung_mick</Username><Timestamp>1344084173154</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 08:42:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344084222376-22</Id><Topic><Title>INVEST and HOLD AAPL for the LONG-TERM GROWTH and INCOME</Title><Username>white_knight_in_texas</Username><Timestamp>1344052953666</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 00:02:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Insightful post Sir.

I've been seeing a lot of comments on these articles that show a lack of comprehension regarding patent law and how it applies. I thought I'd provide a bit of insight here for those who might not be conversant in the topic. Apple's assertion in this lawsuit is that Samsung has copied element of the iPhone and iPad for which Apple holds several patents. These particular patents are known as design patents. It seems a lot of folks don't take these patents seriously and go as far as to suggest that they should not exist. But there is a good reason why they do exist, but to explain this we have to begin with a bit of background, and that requires that we speak about trademark law. Bear with me on this and hopefully Ill be able to clarify the purpose of design patents. Most people are familiar with the idea of a trademark. By way of example, Kellogg, the cereal maker, has a trademark on Tony the Tiger and fought a battle with Exxon over Kellogs' clam that the use of an unnamed tiger in Exxon's advertising violates cereal-maker Kellogg Co.'s trademark for Tony the Tiger. Why? Because for most of those 30 years, Exxon used its tiger character exclusively to promote its gasoline blend, but then, in the 1990's began using it to sell food. Kellogg said consumers are confused by the similarity between the cartoon tigers and may conclude that Kellogg is somehow behind soda, coffee and other items for sale at Exxon's TigerMart stores. The case went back and forth for several years, with Exxon initially winning the case, but ultimately losing on appeal. This case would not seem extraordinary to most people as most folks understand the concept of protecting a unique trademark like Kellogg's Tony the Tiger character. Now let's look at another case, one that comes closer to the Apple vs Samsung case, but still an application of trademark law. This case is Ferrari vs Robert's Replicas. Back in the 1980's Robert's Replica's was in the business of manufacturing fiberglass kits that replicated the exterior features of Ferrari's Daytona Spyder and Testarossa automobiles. Roberts' copies were called the Miami Spyder and the Miami Coupe, respectively. Ferrari brought suit against Roberts in March 1988 alleging trademark infringement. Here's what this case was about: After a Ferrari design has been on the road for a number of years, that design acquires what's called "secondary meaning" under trademark law. Secondary meaning refers to an association of a design, like the design of a Ferrari vehicle, with the quality and craftsmanship or other positive attributes one might associate with the Ferrari brand. After a design has acquired secondary meaning, trademark law can be applied to protect the company from those who would copy it's designs and use them to promote their own products. Robert's copying of Ferrari's iconic designs could confuse the public and dilute the strength of Ferrari's brand. Just the presence of large numbers of replicas would dilute Ferrari's image of exclusivity, causing financial harm to Ferrari. Trademark law, under the concept of secondary meaning, protected Ferrari. The courts rules in favor of Ferrari in this case and enjoined Roberts from producing the Miami Spyder and the Miami Coupe. But how does this relate to design patent law? The problem with using trademark law to protect a company's designs (under trademark law a product design or package design is referred to as "trade dress") is that the company's product has to be on the market for a long time before its design acquires secondary meaning (i.e. before the design becomes iconic and is seen by consumers as representative of the company behind the product). When competitors come in immediately after a new product design is introduced and copy it, as is the assertion in the Apple vs Samsung case, the originator of the design doesn't have the luxury of time needed for it's product design to acquire secondary meaning in the eye of consumers. Consumers immediately see the same design from multiple companies and so don't grow to associate the design with the company that originated that design. This is where design patents come in. Where trademark protection of an iconic product design has no expiration, it takes time for a new product to acquire that protection (as stated above). A design patent offers protection of a new and novel design for a period of 14 years, giving a company protection of its original designs until they acquire secondary meaning and therefore protection under trademark law. So the design patent serves a valuable function for companies like Ferrari, and Apple.</Msg><Username>radar_the_kat</Username><Timestamp>1344090234559</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 10:23:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344091515121-40</Id><Topic><Title>Re:SHALOM SHALOM PLEASE THANK ME FOR ENCOURAGEMENT</Title><Username>levinstein3</Username><Timestamp>1344086139363</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 09:15:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>thank you ive never made a move without you</Msg><Username>martikkkins</Username><Timestamp>1344091515121</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 10:45:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344092402382-41</Id><Topic><Title>AAPL in "breakout" mode above 620 early Monday August 6th</Title><Username>rndyjensen</Username><Timestamp>1344067693727</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 04:08:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>very well defined cup with handle formation has been setting up on this security for the last 6 weeks or so, most likely result will be a "breakout Monday and a challenge of the old high around 640, also helping from a fundamental standpoint most buyers will want to purchase shares before close on August 9th to collect that $2.65 per share dividend.</Msg><Username>rndyjensen</Username><Timestamp>1344092402382</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 11:00:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344093043520-42</Id><Topic><Title>INVEST and HOLD AAPL for the LONG-TERM GROWTH and INCOME</Title><Username>white_knight_in_texas</Username><Timestamp>1344052953666</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 00:02:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>silentmark - Very good point sir! The Apps create a very sticky, loyal consumer. APPLE now has 650,000+ Apps in the App Store! As for the media, just consider the source... the main business network (unnamed here due to the cen$or$hip) fears APPLE...and will always try to downplay the very bullish and positive trends surrounding APPLE. Another very important and often overlooked area of expansion for APPLE is the Business Market or Corporate Sector. Per the recent Conference Call, APPLE's Management confirmed that iPhone use has "doubled" and iPad use has "tripled" in Fortune 500 Companies. This is a very strong trend. Furthermore, APPLE Management confirmed on the Conference Call gains in the Education Market. One order spoke of...was the purchase by the Mansfield School District in Texas of 11,000 iPads - enough were purchased for EVERY STUDENT. Incredible! The iPad will be the future of Education. The teacher's curriculum is provided - and the students can study and learn at their own pace. At home, at work, at school or even within government agencies and the military, APPLE's products are in increasingly strong demand. The "Top" Brand in the World (trusted for "quality") will make strong gains worldwide in Emerging Markets as well.

I quoted the yahoo numbers. I wasn`t trying to use these numbers to refute what you were saying. Yes, I do get very specific sometimes, because for scalping sometimes it gets that specific and it has become a habit of mine to read the moving bid and ask and the time as I watch the 5 minutes develop. I forget sometimes that most people don`t care whether you say 611, 611.50 or 612, and for my running long position it makes absolutely no difference. I am well aware of all higher lows and higher highs When I quoted those numbers I was thinking, wow, we`re getting close and it could be soon maybe you are used to being disagreed with, but I wasn`t at all quite the contrary it makes me think you haven`t understood anything I`ve said I`m not shorting AAPL (though I have made short day trades of swing highs and faded gap openings) I`m long AAPL for the long I hope you are right about next week It`s one of the scenarios I strongly consider, but I`m not sure In the long run, with a long position, it doesn`t matter whether it goes up next week or not it will go up over time for sure for day trading it is something to think about, but even that not really if you are reading price action on the 5 minute my charting assessments are for entertainment purposes only I guess you we`re amused</Msg><Username>aaplboost</Username><Timestamp>1344112049169</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 16:27:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344112933238-83</Id><Topic><Title>What is in it for Apple to Split the Stock, AND do Buybacks ?</Title><Username>lord_chatterly</Username><Timestamp>1344107183010</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 15:06:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Very good answer.

If you sell it on Thursday, Aug 9, it won't settle til Tuesday Aug 14, so even though you sold it on Thursday, you will still be the shareholder of record on Monday and thus entitled to the dividend.

Thanks Larry Key excerpts from the APPLEINSIDER news link: According to Business Insider sources, Apple is in talks to acquire social commerce site The Fancy in a move meant to kickstart the tech giant's nascent general e-commerce business. Apple has long been a leader in e-commerce since the Apple online store opened in 1997, followed by iTunes and the company's iOS and Mac App Stores, but it has yet to enter the general e-commerce category. The rumored acquisition would allow Apple to leverage its formidable number of existing active iTunes accounts with credit cards on file, now numbered at over 400 million, in the arena. The iPhone maker's new PassBook app, which will be included in the upcoming iOS 6, is a step toward bridging the gap between iTunes and general e-commerce, but the software won't allow users to make credit card purchases. This could change if the rumored Fancy acquisition goes through as users would have the ability to make purchases directly and easily from their iDevices. It should be noted, however, that the system as well as the acquisition remains firmly planted in the realm of speculation. Apple CEO Tim Cook is also rumored to have joined the growing network and supposedly met with The Fancy's CEO Jim Einhorn at this year's Allen &amp; Co. Sun Valley retreat which attracts heavyweights from the entertainment, tech and media industries. Cook reportedly lined up a number of meetings during the event, hinting at possible digital media partnerships for Apple TV content and other secret projects. While The Fancy may not boast as large a following as rival Pinterest, the 20-person startup is "much farther along" in leading users to transactions and currently takes a ten percent cut of each purchase. The site managed to snag a $10 million investment round at a reported $100 million valuation last year which added to the $6 million it raised in 2010. Apple is no stranger to making strategic acquisitions of smaller tech companies on their way up, evidenced by its recent purchase of app search engine Chomp and Israel-based flash memory maker Anobit. The Siri virtual assistant, widely-advertised as the standout feature of the iPhone 4S was a direct result of a 2011 Apple acquisition.
