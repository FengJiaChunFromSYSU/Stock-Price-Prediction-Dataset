The report expects orders to remain strong throughout the first quarter of 2013, as orders for new products typically peak within the first four months after their launch. The report runs counter to recent trends, which have seen delivery times for the 21.5-inch iMac slipping to two to three weeks in some areas, suggesting that production problems could still be an issue as late as this week. More recently than that, Apple CEO Tim Cook noted during the company's quarterly conference call that, while Apple was confident it could significantly increase supply, "demand here is very strong and we are not certain that we will achieve a supply-demand balance during the quarter." Cook cited iMac supply constraints as a major reason for a significant drop in Mac sales for the past quarter. Cook noted during the conference call that figures for other Mac devices were largely in line with analyst projections and that the iMac, along with the shorter quarter and other inventory constraints, largely made up for the shortfall in Mac sales compared to previous quarters. Analyst Ming-chi Kuo of KGI Securities revealed in August, months before the new iMacs were unveiled, that production issues were likely. It was said that the screen lamination process in building the new desktops is difficult, particularly with the larger 27-inch model.</Msg><Username>longonfargo</Username><Timestamp>1359263260612</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 00:07:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359263323556-12</Id><Topic><Title>Did a crazy option trade late in the day and oddly enough it might payoff on Monday (or not!)</Title><Username>croesus_intervention</Username><Timestamp>1359164079477</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 20:34:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You better praise.

BlackRock, the world's largest asset management company, has taken an $80 million stake in Twitter Inc, a person with knowledge of the deal said Friday. The six-year old social media company will not raise new capital as part of the private deal that values the firm at more than $9 billion. BlackRock will buy shares directly from early Twitter employees seeking to liquidate their stock holdings and options. Twitter's new valuation represents a slight rise from late 2011, when the company facilitated a similar tender offer with Prince Alwaleed bin Talal of Saudi Arabia that valued the company at a reported $8.4 billion. Twitter sought investors for another tender offer last summer in the wake of Facebook Inc's botched initial public offering in May, but did not complete the deal until recently, according to people with knowledge of the situation.</Msg><Username>bhttsl</Username><Timestamp>1359263455300</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 00:10:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359263523758-14</Id><Title>Shorts grow some balls, don't cover till $325</Title><Msg>Any short that covers before $325 is a little pussie.

AAPL is slowly losing the cost benefit of doing business overseas due to labor costs. Can the infrastructure and political stability of China be replaced in another 'cheap labor' country? The slow death of Labor Unions in the U.S. also makes this plausible. 3) Taxes.

Keep ur powder dry. .dp</Msg><Username>davionprince</Username><Timestamp>1359265137200</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 00:38:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359265233784-40</Id><Topic><Title>APPLE PRODUCTS HAVE MERELY BECOME COMMODITIES-NOTHING SPECIAL</Title><Username>juanvaldezvaldez</Username><Timestamp>1359264258648</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 00:24:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Right on.

Well, let me tell you a secret, the Government doesn't care about the price. Shh, don't tell anyone.

That is basically what it comes down to. At this price you should be buying Apple and Nokia and selling RIMM. RIMM is going to crash because bb10 is just not going to cut it even if it does very well. Apple was actually a sell probably at 600 and certainly 700 but now the valuations makes it a screaming buy. Nokia is also a screaming buy they have turned around dramatically as well. Guess what he media is trying to tell you right now day after day? Buy RIMM Sell Apple Sell Nokia Do the opposite of the above and you will do very well. Just an example Goldman, JP Morgan etc have all been dramatically increasing their shares in Nokia while keeping low price targets. They are round to make money not give it away so do what they do not what they say to do. Good luck. Buying Apple or Nokia here you really can't go wrong. If you buy RIMM you might as well give your money away to charity.</Msg><Username>A Yahoo!

Then when the fired manufacturer was replaced, orders would be cut at the manufacturers that took the overflow, returning the loads per manufacturer back to 'normal'.

If they level off at $40 billion in EPS, which would be a 10% decline from current levels, and trade at a 10 multiple it would still be worth $425 a share. For earnings to go down that much AAPL would need to have a little over $9 in EPS for the next three quarters. That is a pretty low estimate, just based on projected iphone sales alone. I stated above that 40 million over Q2 and Q3, add in Q4 and you’re talking about 55 million in the US alone. That said the dividend will be raised, but they are still trying to figure out how much should be spent on buybacks. But at $12 a quarter that would mean they would pay around 48 billion in dividends, around 10%. Junk status and not very likely. Once they stop buying back shares, they will turn around and double the dividend to around 5%. Or at least that’s what I think. This stock is very entertaining.</Msg><Username>wait4itorsell</Username><Timestamp>1359274074901</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 03:07:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359274510442-117</Id><Title>The parabolic move seems to have started about a month after the death of Jobs (serious discussion only please)</Title><Msg>I was looking at the chart and noticed that from November 2011 the stock really started to move up a lot faster than it had the previous four years. I was thinking if you take this move out of the chart and continue the trend line at the rate it had been rising you would arrive at around Friday's closing price. Since markets usually overshoot there is probably some more downside but I don't think we break $400 and if we do not for very long. Thoughts? Could that trend still be intact?

The Apple "money machine" is ridiculously overdone to the downside. Don't be surprised if we see a face melting rally in shares of AAPL in the next few days. We are now approx 40% off of the recent highs, and for a company that was a wall street darling just a short time ago, institutions and individual investors could pile back into the name just as fast as they bailed. Furthermore, even an infinitesimal smidgen of a hint from Apple regarding positive use of their cash hoard (Twitter?) or a deal over in China, a stock split, accelerated buyback program, etc, and it's the end game for shorts in the stock. I, personally, am a buyer right here and right now. Remember, for many individual and institutional investors out there, Apple is not a day trading vehicle, so picking an exact bottom is not necessarily the primary objective. Bottom line: This is a great time to get in on a world class stock/company; one that does not give people this type of opportunity very often.

One thing no one brings up is that when MSFT went down from its peak it went from trading at a 30 multiple to around a 15. If AAPL trades up at a 15 it would be around $650 dollars.

And, Apple is not simply a hardware company - it's hybrid hardware and software. iTunes generated $3.5B revenue last quarter, so its no slouch. And money spent in iTunes is going to help Apple retain customers who will time and time again buy their products at a premium. However, their products are becoming commoditized so new users might seek other brands that are going to offer similar products at lower prices. It's getting harder for Apple to generate spectacular earnings despite good sales numbers; it's growth is on the decline - that's why the (panic) selling, justified or not.</Msg><Username>qqmore12</Username><Timestamp>1359280867522</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 05:01:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359281581619-147</Id><Topic><Title>why aapl is trading like a value stock</Title><Username>arawfrejunk</Username><Timestamp>1359182450797</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 01:40:50 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How is PC a dead industry?

That has never happened before and will likely never happen again due to a very lucky product cycle/mix that came together. The revenue is modeled to go up around 10% YOY over a very good quarter last year. My personal opinion is that they are low-balling that revenue estimate too but we shall see. I am interpreting the more "realistic guidance" comment from the CC as just meaning is it unrealistic to give a single number instead of a range. So for all those interested, just remember, that last year's EPS crush was due to an out-of-whack high margin number and that Apple's sales are just fine YOY. My personal "fair-value" price for AAPL today is $616 based on $44EPS - ttm and a PE ratio of 14 to be just under the S&amp;P historical average. This is ignoring the cash (which, unlike the #$%$ that all-of-a-sudden hate cash, I find GREAT value in) and is not giving AAPL credit for ANY earnings growth. My perspective on 2013 EPS is that AAPL comes in at $46 for this year without any new product or CM pushing an EOY target for me to $644. For 2014, I expect and EPS rise of 15% to just under $53 conservatively and an EOY 2014 price of $741. Needless to say, IMHO, AAPL is absurdly undervalued here. They are not spending day-after-day and billions of R&amp;D dollars doing nothing. They come up with another disruptive product and everything I just wrote above will be extremely conservative. Just my $.02 this early Sunday Morning.</Msg><Username>monkey449</Username><Timestamp>1359287257608</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 06:47:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359287363518-188</Id><Topic><Title>longs ask yourselves</Title><Username>ny_nyyankee</Username><Timestamp>1359248782565</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 20:06:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This stock is a longterm play.

As margins gets smaller, so does EPS. Like you, I own several Apple product (2 Ipads and 2 Iphones). I like their products. I took a hit on APPL on got out. The people long AAPL are hoping for AAPL to go back and make up their losses. This can only happen if AAPL introduces a new disruptive product (not a refreshed IPad or Iphone). Until this happens, AAPL will trade sideways. People will be scalping every point move. AAPL is great for day traders. Long term investors will be hanging in there hoping for a rebound. I had INTC at 80 back in 2000. I though it would go higher and didn't sell out. Now it's trading in the low 20's. So I've been there and done that with INTC back in 2000. AAPL maybe the next INTC, CSCO and MSFT. Or APPL can rebound be the tech darling again. Only time will tell. Best way AAPL can increase share price is to do a split to allow more retail investors to buy the stock. This also opens up more option trading opportunities. Don't know if this is going to happen.</Msg><Username>chowskee</Username><Timestamp>1359287894972</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 06:58:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359288302485-195</Id><Topic><Title>Another Horrible Weekend ahead, if you are like me and long.... .

That was once a $40 stock...seems like decisive action is necessary to stem the slide. If you look at Cooke's stock price performance during 2012, that was essentially George Siefert winning with Bill Walsh's team or Barry Switzer winning with Jimmy Johnson's team...but now when you look at things after the slide, he has underperformed the S&amp;P by a large margin since Job's death. Apple is in desperate need of a blood transfusion to inject new ideas and need someone so brash that he will not hold Jobs in such reverance that he is afraid to make smart acquisitions or return cash to shareholders in a meaningful way. Need to start doing smart acquisitions also- as opposed to letting your cash earn 0.1%. It is mind boggling that Apple refuses to use its cash- but this likely comes from the near death experience they had. There again- another reason that the blood transfusion is necessary.</Msg><Username>budfox20001</Username><Timestamp>1359289197449</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 07:19:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359289200267-206</Id><Topic><Title>Goldman Sachs steals Tarp bailout money, horde's it, and uses it to short Apple with.</Title><Username>sheepskinner6</Username><Timestamp>1359288324956</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 07:05:24 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So this is what the Jeuwsacs of sheit do with tax payer dollars.</Msg><Username>sheepskinner6</Username><Timestamp>1359289200267</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 07:20:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359289302496-207</Id><Title>What additional news will push AAPL down further next week??????</Title><Msg>I don't get it why people feel AAPL is going lots lower?????

What about $1.99? $2.99? Are you really going to tell your kids sorry that that app is too expensive! I highly doubt it? Now ask yourself where AAPL stock will be with revenue increases of 20-100%. Again, who the hell cares about GM's dropping a few percentage points? Not Me! For every phone sold, there is another chance for AAPL to lock in another costumer locked into a proprietary eco system. Take this past weekend I was able to "FACE TIME" with my grandson who lives 2000 miles away. Becuase of AAPL eco system my daughter was able to use her phone and switch to ipad without dropping call. It's all about eco system folks not the next innotavite product or GM's.

Nokia has lost its entire cell phone franchise to smartphones, and now that 100% of its "smartphones" are on the new msft os8 they will see their share go down to only legacy IT shops married to msft upgrade cycle. Their aggregate smartphone sales are down more than 90% yoy -- offset by what 6m Lumias in the Dec Q? GFL owning Nokia. Adjusting for the launch weekend or, alternatively, an extra week in the Dec q 11 vs 12, aapl's iPhone sales of 48m+ this year vs 2011 looks about like this 52Mm (net adj) iphones this year vs ~34m last year...or something around 50% adjusted iPhone sales growth. Think about it -- it is a riot to read all the press and clueless analysts and agenda players like Cramer and abusive comments from Grundlach (I'm assuming he is not so lame as Cramer's lazy comments) syggest aapl is now done growing. It really is stupid. Back to msft, rimm and Nokia. These players are dead in smartphones. Have you held/used the new Lumia? It is heavy, lunky, bulky... kind of like going horse riding and finding out the only thing left if an old mule... RIMM is dead - you have that right. From an os standpoint, it is down to iOS and android, and good is trying to work through its own network (focused LTE is speculated)... but don;t you think some of the carriers are doing that in collab with others maybe incl AAPL? LOL AAPL is also working on more than unobstructed open source web oriented android... icloud users up from 150m to 250m in less than 12 months is stunning, too. Connect the dots on AAPL's new financial disclosures -- they are spotlighting that they really do have the ecosystem no one else does, and the idea of attaching unique software and best in class developer apps to their devices is clearly differentiating aapl products from all the trailing copycats as seen in the ongoing abandonment of anddroid os based in smartphones in favor of the iPhone line up. See T and VZ q releases for those details.</Msg><Username>squeezetracker</Username><Timestamp>1359294356462</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 08:45:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359294420019-282</Id><Topic><Title>Let Apple be like Microsoft, then Apple today would be @ $675 !</Title><Username>davidba1960</Username><Timestamp>1359293169795</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 08:26:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ha- good point and valid.

Watch now how the losers will reply to this message with hate and tell me about the thousands of imaginary shares they trade. All it takes for AAPL is to make once major announcement, and the same analysts who cut targets will be jumping head over heels to raise them. It is true, this is a testing time for Apple management. Till now, they have been riding the halo effect of guru Steve Jobs, but its been a few years since they released a major product and, believe me, they will. Like any other industry, the media has to sell its product; and its product is news. If they can't find anything worth reporting out there, they make their own news. And, nothing sells better than bad news. You can only build wealth in this market if you can see the forest for the trees. If buffet can do it, so can you.

A simple pro forma adjustment to reflect the 2011 launch in mid October of the i4s or to simply add another week of average 4Q 2012 sales shows that aapl would have done closer to 52-53m iPhones in the Q, for adjusted comp sales growth of 50%. Does anyone anywhere recall the last time dell or msft or csco or any other largely yesteryear and passed by companies had such growth? These babbling heads now suggesting AAPL is similarly hosed are gumps or rolling on an agenda. Do the same thing with the Ipad actual numbers and you get 24m vs 17m or 40% plus growth yoy. Pr forma is more like 52%... Record sales, superb growth -- and the key new products were not close to up the yield curve, down the cost curve, or even able to meet demand in virtually all markets, especially the many new and faster growing markets for AAPL. AAPL just guided to new ranges on revs and margins... notice that they are on top of last year for revenues and last Q for margins? And now there are several credible/ reputations matter cources for the reality that at least two new phones are coming before June is out and perhaps a third (big screen) phone is coming this year too. As an adjunct, has anyone noticed that TMobile and Sprint and T are all advertising the i5 aggressively all of the sudden? Why, ask yourself. Answer: i5 is by far their most profitable data plan phone and all the ipHones are making bacon for the carriers. Also, it seems no one notices in the press or analysts community as they all hide in the closet for another day (or not), but last week -- that's right, last week -- the number of carriers on the iPhone roster having LTE networks jumped by 36 from 24 to 60 advanced networks. The ridiculous selldown is almost over here -- but stay off margin and get ready to participate in the violent reversal coming.</Msg><Username>squeezetracker</Username><Timestamp>1359295593309</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 09:06:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359295593825-299</Id><Topic><Title>Big News From China Check it out</Title><Username>marketguru111</Username><Timestamp>1359209343217</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 09:09:03 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>S&amp;P REITERATES STRONG BUY OPINION ON SHARES OF APPLE INC.

Apple can just keep making the same stuff. Cook set during the conference call his phone size is right and he said prior that they wont make a cheap phone. So that means no changes just incremental updates. The recipe for failure. We will have a correction soon ... buy PCLN, AMZN, GOOGLE and BIDU. Also YOKU is great. Apple will drop to 363 by February. You could have a dead cat bounce. Then it will continue its slide until the next product launch . This time the product launches will be less then thrilling against the backdrop of the Galaxy 4 and Hunwai phone selling like hot cakes in China. China Mobile deal will never materialize and we will see Appl at the low 300s and with a big selloff in the market we will see Apple at 270. As Apple will never rise due to there is no more Growth Funds willing to buy, a drop down in stock price will always be permanent. That is why I put my year end price of Apple at $ 175.00. Apple will maintain a 5 p/e before ex-cash. Cash will grow to close to 200 billion in cash and that will keep growing. Apple will get close to 300 billoni in cash by 2016. With the company trading below 300 Apple could make a serious increase in share price with a 200 billion dollar buyback. But they won't. The dividend could eve get cut if earnings start dropping as they did not give an EPS for the March Qtr knowing it will be real bad. I see earnings of $ 7.50 for that quarter. I see earnings for 2013 at below $ 36.00 Apple's share of the markets will continue to drop. Their lead in the US will dwindle with the Xphone and the Galaxy 4 which will just kill. Lighter, thinner and better in every way. Look at how fast Samsung went from 0 to 60. They will leave APple in the dust with a better OPsys. Android also will leave IOS in the dust. Tim Cook could be the worst CEO picked to run Apple. He was good up until now in what he did. He cannot even dream to fill Job's shoes.</Msg><Username>sheepskinner</Username><Timestamp>1359295979134</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 09:12:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359296054382-308</Id><Topic><Title>Record rev, profit, ipad sales, iphone sales causes CRASH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</Title><Username>davidba1960</Username><Timestamp>1359295505944</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 09:05:05 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Cook &amp; Oppenheimer must be in shock at the CRASH record rev &amp; earnings caused.

It has begun to happen in complex investments known as "equity-linked structured products" tied to the price of Apple shares. Investors who had fat yields on seemingly safe short-term debt soon will find out they have been handed huge losses, while the firms that sold them have profited. The products, issued by investment banks, are essentially bonds that can turn into stocks of other companies. They pay high interest, typically monthly, for one year or less. If the stock the products are tied to rises or stays close to its price at the time the bonds were issued, investors get all their money back when the bonds come due. But if the stock falls more than 20% or so, the bonds can morph into shares of the fallen stock. The buyers, usually individual investors, must hold the bonds until maturity. In 2012, Apple's shares soared—and firms such as J.P. Morgan Chase, JPM +1.70%Morgan Stanley, MS +0.44%UBSUBSN.VX -0.98% and BarclaysBARC.LN +0.23% sold more than $722 million of these instruments, according to an analysis of Securities and Exchange Commission filings for The Wall Street Journal by Securities Litigation and Consulting Group, a financial-research firm in Fairfax, Va. Bloomberg Apple employees and customers gather at the opening of the new Grand Central Station location in New York in 2011. . Last year, at least 450 new structured products were linked to Apple, according to SLCG. Three-quarters of them were issued when the stock was at least $550. The shares closed Friday at $439.88, down $60 for the week. As a result, the value of Apple-linked products suffered a one-week drop of more than 15%, estimates Craig McCann, founder of SLCG. "The vast majority of them are now underwater," he says. Many investors will get far less than they expected. Losses exceed 25% on more than 100 of last year's Apple-related products, SLCG estimates.</Msg><Username>palisadesestateplanninglawyer</Username><Timestamp>1359296372629</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 09:19:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359296414623-320</Id><Topic><Title>Stock of 013!</Title><Username>vooodooodoc</Username><Timestamp>1359249729999</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 20:22:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The numbers don't lie. $3.50/share cash on hand. it's at least worth that.

The group's warnings were discounted.[65] Einstein and Szilárd, along with other refugees such as Edward Teller and Eugene Wigner, "regarded it as their responsibility to alert Americans to the possibility that German scientists might win the race to build an atomic bomb, and to warn that Hitler would be more than willing to resort to such a weapon."[54]:630[66] In the summer of 1939, a few months before the beginning of World War II in Europe, Einstein was persuaded to lend his prestige by writing a letter with Szilárd to President Franklin D. Roosevelt to alert him of the possibility. The letter also recommended that the U.S. government pay attention to and become directly involved in uranium research and associated chain reaction research. The letter is believed to be "arguably the key stimulus for the U.S. adoption of serious investigations into nuclear weapons on the eve of the U.S. entry into World War II".[67] President Roosevelt could not take the risk of allowing Hitler to possess atomic bombs first. As a result of Einstein's letter and his meetings with Roosevelt, the U.S. entered the "race" to develop the bomb, drawing on its "immense material, financial, and scientific resources" to initiate the Manhattan Project. It became the only country to successfully develop an atomic bomb during World War II. For Einstein, "war was a disease . . . [and] he called for resistance to war." But in 1933, after Hitler assumed full power in Germany, "he renounced pacifism altogether . . .

Lance - i don't take drugs - no it does not make sense. apple worth less than $700 - say $450? no - makes no sense : throw in the current p/e of 10, a forward p/e of 8 or so - even likely that without the cash counted. there is a "why" you need to figure out. i am a lawyer - one of my major brokerage clients tried to sell me an "apple bond" when he heard i loved apple so much mid 2011. i believe in apple long only. read the wall street journal - this major brokerage guy was trying to sell me this stupid bond - whereby his lawyer would be scr'd if apple stock did a temporary tank at maturity time ..... Imagine, sticking it to your lawyer??? I am a nice guy - estate planning - no pi. this not so nice client was out to take out his lawyer who has 2 nice twins that take a lot of personal time to educate and cost as we chatted during our meeting. bottom line - under his major brokerage these instruments paid out in inflated $700 priced apple if stock tanked - not pay out of bond face in then apple priced stock. Result- these people are out 25% - read the wall street journal - google apple bond - this is why the stock tanked on the last trade of the day - an evil broker/brokerage dumped stock last second - so that the brokerages would pay out at that much lower of a price posters were confused why the stock tanked around $8 in the last second of trading - i bet you that is it -! bonds are gone - stock is coiled and ready to explode since the incentive rip off is gone for the brokerages - they took the apple bond money and its over - they can focus on apple rea</Msg><Username>palisadesestateplanninglawyer</Username><Timestamp>1359297035591</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 09:30:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359297076310-336</Id><Title>Galaxy S3 is cool..Not iphones.

Money never sleeps, right? My two cents: this is a great buying opportunity, if this company has any future to make more products. Not just AAPL TV---how can you shorts be so sure there aren't even better products in the hopper that won't rock the world? I think the better play now is to buy more.

I only can hope that you don't have any children or if you do, they can overcome their parent being a complete waste - clown.</Msg><Username>monkey449</Username><Timestamp>1359299331233</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 10:08:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359299367786-391</Id><Title>Should you buy or sell AAPL.</Title><Msg>When you look at a stock, you have to look at two things: The company itself, and the fundamentals of the stock. These are two completely separate things, but joined at the hip. They are like Siamese twins. They might have completely different personalities but if one is having sex, the other has to tag along for the ride and watch. It makes you wonder but stay focused for a second more. Apple the company is having problems but this is not new. People forget there was a long time between the release of the ipod and the iphone (about five years). People forget that Apple, under Steve Jobs, had extreme volatility in the stock. Even going down 50% in one year. People forget and forget and then yell the same comments year after year. And then anonymous Internet trolls who pretend to be billionaires come out of the woods and say , "See! We were right all along". Ok, that's fine. Enjoy the parade. You can't look at a stock day by day. This is where "the company" comes in. When you buy a stock, you're an owner of a company. If you buy a stock as a quick trade then you might as well use your money as hand out hundred dollar bills to all the hungry people on Wall Street because they will make better use of your money than you will. As an aside, I did an experiment a few months ago and videotaped it (coming shortly). I went to every person in a suit and said I had gone broke trading and could they lend me five dollars. Not a single person gave me money except...I went to one homeless guy. He gave me the five dollars. And a guy selling hot dogs gave me a hot dog for free. So generosity and goodwill still exist on Wall Street. What's going on with Apple the company? The bad news is this: For the first time, every other company has caught up with it on hardware. Feature for feature - the latest Amazon (AMZN) Kindle Fire is better than the latest ipad. It's got better wireless (two antennas), better speakers, better screens, better lighting (less glare), better content display,</Msg><Username>smithdon827</Username><Timestamp>1359299367786</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 10:09:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359299411101-392</Id><Topic><Title>why i hate ny people</Title><Username>sheepskinner</Username><Timestamp>1359299276965</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 10:07:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That's why i live in Jersey....they'd never let me in the city.

Bloomberg reported they had hired 2 investment banking firms. Alibaba said they had hired no none. They didn't say "no comment". They said they had hired no one. If they in fact had hired someone this would be a false and mis-leading statement. It would have been better if they had responded with "no comment". So other than that....where is this "IPO plan" you refer to. Seems like rumor and speculation to me...which I guess is fine...but to jump to the conclusion based on a Bloomberg rumor (that was denied, not ignored, by Alibaba,) seems a bit like jumping the gun. And I fail to see why Jack Ma stepping aside is somehow proof of an impending IPO. If Mark Zuckerberg had done the same thing people would have been nervous. Show me another startup where the founder steps aside and then it is followed by an IPO announcement. I think some on this board are so long they are spinniing any news into being bullish. Go watch the Bloomberg interview with Marissa Mayer. In particular, start at the 16:00 minute mark when she is asked about competing companies that have mobile, mobile OS, browsers and social. And at 16:49 the question and reference of the "Four Horsemen" clearly makes her nervous as she starts rotating her foot. Once they move on to another question the foot stops. Something about that topic clearly made her uncomfortable.

No disagreement with the facts you point out, but the purpose of this post was to promote as conservative a strategy as possible ( which is achieved in this strategy by collecting as much time value as possible without compromising principal ... i. e. selling calls at or near the money ). In my particular case, I already have a significant portion of my portfolio with exposure to AAPL with higher entry costs. I don't want to miss out on this price correction, but am nervous about how much more exposure I take on ...

That’s a violation… But you do it anyway because the SEC doesn’t understand it,” said Cramer speaking of his strategy of falsely presenting a stock as ‘down.’ Cramer spoke of making use of the media and news establishment to ‘report’ information about companies and encourage the development of stories which may not have hit significant coverage to build favorable reputations for his companies or stocks. Much of Cramer’s technique seems to involve using his exposure and influence in media circles — particularly his operation of the ‘adviser’ show, Mad Money — to create opinions which are complex enough the SEC cannot enforce them as strict fomenting. One of the basic strategies of Cramer’s fomenting, he said, was, that in the situation a hedge fund (such as his own) was holding a short position in a company which reported excellent quarterly news, the fund would call up brokerage houses and either feed them bad news / blatant lies, or order a huge set of short sales — suggesting that investor confidence in the company was falling. The slew of bad news would create a temporary fall long enough for the manager to resolve his short position and conclude a tidy profit. Cramer refused to talk about some of his techniques, saying he was “not going to say it on TV.” Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne, said the CNBC reporters used this technique to spread lies and rumors about his company, combined with a slew of bad / false financial reports and analysis around the Internet and otherwise. Many analysts are suggesting that much of the CNBC enterprise and Jim Cramer’s specifically success came from a strong understanding of how to control the system — control the news, you control the stock. “We had it down to a science in 1992: my wife would pick stocks that technically looked ready to go up, or she would keep track of merchandise to see what was down to tag ends.

The Apple wave is in full force just go to any store and you will witness it live. Many new products in the pipeline including 3 phones they say. Anyone that really knows the inside of how tech companies work know that Steve Jobs alone did not event all the Apple products. Steve was great of course but he worked with and trained many of the folks that are working at Apple today and they are for sure carrying the torch. Apple stock is obviously worth much more than what it is trading for by any stock market metric. The stock is going down in the trading action because of fear that is being built up by folks in the investment news and the internet sites and message boards. If Netfix is worth $160, Apple is worth $3200. Just look at the number and this is easy to see. As the market makers and the herd follows drive the APPL stock down, I will by more as the current trend will reverse soon enough.</Msg><Username>cannistraro.vincent</Username><Timestamp>1359301429515</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 10:43:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359301434099-468</Id><Topic><Title>Went to restaurant last night.

Clearly one can never underestimate the irrationality of the stock market. So many of the talking heads speak untruths about Apple and ignore their product improvements. People just take too much for granted and become accustomed to it all too quickly. It's hard to believe iPad hasn't been around that long, it seems like an eternity. But, unless the next iPad coverts to a hoverboard, people won't care that much about a better screen or a thinner profile. The one thing that would get peoples' attention is a super long battery life on devices. That would be a holy grail of sorts. But even a super long battery life would soon be take for granted and the talking heads would say they just don't innovate anymore. If I were Apple, I wouldn't give any guidance.

CNBC, even BloombergTV. Think the info (misinfo) fed and spread was b/c of record iphone/ipad sales? Sentiment is as important if not more important than fundamentals on WS, which of those two do you think can be controlled by the nefarious? It was manipulated info spread by paid entities. Wonder why you see the same vitrolic postings from members with choice headlines and trigger words? (Slashed, Declined, Dead, Cuts, Losses). Clear as day gang. Rumors/Misinformation was spread at a rate I have not seen in the past 15 years of following apple. Clear fundamentals are as strong as ever, and with Apple now valued below HPQ and inline with Dell it's clear that sentiment is the answer to why the stock price crashed and that sentiment was intentional and evil. Apple management standing by and not stepping in, is as bad and possibly worse. Doing the right think does not mean watching somebody get robbed. TC's main motivation is doing the right thing, but he may not have figured out whats in front of him yet.</Msg><Username>atrayu19</Username><Timestamp>1359301631516</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 10:47:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359301688870-478</Id><Title>WENT TO A MOVIE LAST NIGHT............</Title><Msg>WHILE WAITING IN LINE I ASKED SOME KIDS IF THEY HAD AAPL PRODUCTS!!!

I don't think it would be wise for them to do so. In the past they have sandbagged estimates. The street knew the estimates were #$%$ and came up with what they felt were realistic targets. The single number was given because accuracy didn't matter, so why give a range. This was fine when they were growing at an astronomical rate. They could outperform the streets wildly high estimates. As growth slows to 10%/yr this is not fine. That is why they made such a big stink about estimating a range and having earnings fall within that range. If they blow out their own estimates the 1st quarter with this new system they lose credibility and the street goes back to assuming estimates are low-balled.</Msg><Username>im_long_aapl</Username><Timestamp>1359301689465</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 10:48:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359301712641-480</Id><Topic><Title>Apple to open up down 10 points on Monday.

Apple value is about fundamental value driven by tangible cash inflows. WS could not change fundamentals, so they relentlessly attacked perception. Why? Many theories; one being that Apple got too powerful in terms of overall stock market weighting and call options were going to bankrupt the option writers - WS could not let that happen. Another is that the content owners were afraid Apple would dictate to them the way it dictated terms to the recording industry. So they used their media to tarnish fundamentals by manipulating perception, in addition, of course, to WS using every stock-manipulation trick in the book. Where does that leave us IMHO? Fundamentals are fundamentals and they are sound. Apple is not spending R&amp;D billion$ on making better hamburgers. The apple fear-factor has reached it's zenith and fundamentals will dive pps going fwd. Of course Apple will need to continue delivering, but nothing they have done to date indicates to me that they will not.</Msg><Username>kokohead1</Username><Timestamp>1359302338914</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 10:58:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359302395710-505</Id><Topic><Title>CNBC and Jim Cramer were bashing Apple to profit billions in their shorts position.</Title><Username>one_dogydog</Username><Timestamp>1359301400628</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 10:43:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>They turned a totally successful earning results to a nightmare.

If you're a long term investor, you're going to get a better price to buy in at, don't try to guess the bottom, it's too early.. Despite what one idiot keeps saying here about 5 day margin calls, with a large dump like this, calls will go out same day or next day with any number of brokers. I've been there, believe me, when i first started trading, and you're sitting there, sweating, can't sleep at night, hoping the price will snap back and get you out of your call, but it doesn't come.. I guarantee you that there are/were massive amounts of investors that were heavily leveraged because Apple was the never fail stock... That's why parabolic burst patterns like apple always return to where they started, because buyers on the way up think it's never going to end and the eventual fall destroys all their equity and then some... Even long term, i'd wait for something under 420... Keep THIS in mind, especially those who think this is going to rocket back up to 500+.

If the stock were to spike, to $750 for example, you would have to buy at $750 and sell at $450 to fulfill the obligation on the call you sold. The reason for choosing a deep in the money call is to minimize the time premium you pay. You could buy the equity itself and pay no time premium ... But if you want the leverage of options, then higher the strike you choose the more time premium you pay. Time remember is a wasting asset so as a rule of thumb, the less you pay for time the better. With this strategy, your profit is capped at $450 ... Above that, any profit on the call you are long is offset by the call you are short.</Msg><Username>asiabynight</Username><Timestamp>1359302732856</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 11:05:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359302745448-523</Id><Topic><Title>iTV feature</Title><Username>shoponnet</Username><Timestamp>1359301079272</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 10:37:59 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A glasses free 3D retina display screen.</Msg><Username>shoponnet</Username><Timestamp>1359302745448</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 11:05:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359302847506-524</Id><Title>The real issue - guidance and what it means</Title><Msg>Margins down 20% from 47% to 38%, YoY growth down to 7%, nothing to indicate that will not become the new normal. You can talk about new products, cheaper phones, iTV, buybacks, dividends, cash on hand, whatever you want, but the reality is Apple just forecasted, absent change, it is no longer a growth company and some contraction in the EPS is coming. 38% margins are still great compared to the industry which unfortunately means they have room to fall further. To put this in perspective to make the same net profit when going from 47% margins to 38% margins revenue needs to increase from 40 billion to 50 billion. If the margins drop to 30% that expands to 62 billion. Margins certainly arent going to drop further tomorrow, but it's something to consider because if the revenue growth stays as low as 7% it will take YEARS to make up for the drop in EPS. For example, using next quarter it would take 3.3 years to get EPS back to 12.3 from where it will drop if margins stay at 38% and revenue increases 7% yoy. This isn't my opinion, it's just math. Should the margins drop further during that time then the time frame to get back to where they were expand with it. Now it does seem odd that revenue would grow 18% last quarter and drop to 7% next quarter, but then again the iPhone5 was already offered to every country they are going to offer it in and by the end of the quarter they had excess phones in the pipeline indicating demand dropped quickly. I cant make it any simpler or clearer than what I just did. Make no mistake this is not a temporary issue. A cheaper phone could help with revenue while putting further pressure on margins. A new product would certainly help to the extent it didnt hurt sales of other products. I think there is a tendency to think "Hey, it' Apple, they will figure it out" and they might, but NOTHING makes up for declining margins other than increased sales/revenue and right now they are saying that increase isn't going to be there.</Msg><Username>tkell31</Username><Timestamp>1359302847506</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 11:07:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359302856789-525</Id><Title>Your deemed a loser here in NY if you don't have an iphone.</Title><Msg>or a SIRI Sat subscription.

If you didn't sell on a parabolic rise like that or even worse if you bought in that eriod, then you are to blame for entering the game too late. AAPL was portrayed the same way that the 90s dotcom stocks were. Everything was portrayed based on the 7 Billion population of earth and if the Chinese all buy AAPL products and upgrade every year when a new product was introduced. The signs of irrationality was obvioue not only from the "Rocky Movie type" constant upgrades of products but the Ipda mini. You either use a phone or a tablet what is the use for a mini? AAPL became too retail and started canibalizing itself. Tim Cook doesn't think pro shareholder and will not be able to turn this company around as it is like a huge tanker ship. Until they don't do something with the cash and if they don't have perhaos some dividends and some strategic buyouts, the stock will lag. No one ever considered competition as a threat either.

I am long AAPL too and have traded stocks a long time. Its just that when I started, people were not such babies as they are now when they loose. I was just commenting that a lot of people on this board ( probably full grown men ) are crying like babies because AAPL is down 12% this week. My wife is glad I don't cry over stuff such as this. We bought more AAPL at about 451.50 and our average cost is down and we will more than likely sell our position at a profit somewhere down the line. In the meantime we will get a dividend of 2.65 a share next week or so, also if I want to I can sell some really expensive call options on my positions and almost guarantee they get called away at a profit and if so, I can buy AAPL all over again and make more money. So you guys worrying what a cable tv channel spews out are like the kids I used to trade marbles or matchbox cars or hotwheels with. When they found out they made a bad trade, they actually cried instead of made the next trade better to come out ahead in the long run. Just man up guys, please, it much easier to read your posts when there is no whining. Have a nice Sunday, relax with your family, do not obsess over a silly stock position. It is a small part of your life hopefully.</Msg><Username>evanstoo</Username><Timestamp>1359303399573</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 11:16:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359303461232-546</Id><Topic><Title>Did a crazy option trade late in the day and oddly enough it might payoff on Monday (or not!)</Title><Username>croesus_intervention</Username><Timestamp>1359164079477</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 20:34:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Doing a collar is an excellent idea.

Speaking at a financial conference in Tokyo on Thursday, Geithner said the Obama administration would strive to resolve by the end of the year the impasse with the Congress that threatens to impose a so-called "fiscal cliff" of tax increases and deep spending cuts if the two sides do not reach agreement. The U.S. has been relatively successful in managing to clean up the mess left by the 2008 financial crisis while not starving the economy of credit, Geithner said. Growth has dragged, though, due to the European crisis and severe drought across the U.S. "We've been relatively successful in doing these reforms in a way that didn't starve the economy of credit," he said.</Msg><Username>tomsaga25</Username><Timestamp>1359303525910</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 11:18:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359303535445-549</Id><Topic><Title>What would the LBO price of AAPL be $600,$700,$800 or $1000?</Title><Username>ujrodz4</Username><Timestamp>1359303239273</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 11:13:59 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>AAPL's patent library is worth $300/share alone.

I'm long Apple, but the numbers they gave as guidance are really concerning for the future. In the short term I believe we're looking EPS drops for the next 3 quarters to give an EPS of $39-40 for the year. Why? 3rd qter margins last year were 48% 4th qtr 41%. EPS for both quarters are going to suffer if margins stay at 38%. So if growth is down to 7% what PE would you assign a company like that? Conservatively I'm going with 10 and EPS for 2013 of 39-40 so I'm looking at a price of $390-$400. The issue is should you believe the guidance they provided? If they are lowballing Apple is a bargain here. Of course new products would change the math as well and if margins compressed further.

But who has the means and guts to do that.It has to be offered higher than today's price, something like $600 per share. That will require about $500 Billion. Of course as soon as they accomplish it, they can use the cash hoard to pay down the debt if hey take any, and split the company into different product category. With the cash flow generated by Apple they can pay a nice dividend or pay off the loan eventually. Of course you can get very low interest rate loan to buy apple now. May be Mitt Romney and Bain Capital can pull it off. What is the chance of that happening. May be 10%.</Msg><Username>michaeljoseph4040</Username><Timestamp>1359304481151</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 11:34:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359304491262-578</Id><Title>No reason for low capital investors to trade on 400-500 stock with slow grown stock, You better off trade on 30-60 stock</Title><Msg>gggggggggggggggggggg</Msg><Username>aea_momentum1</Username><Timestamp>1359304491262</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 11:34:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359304493008-579</Id><Topic><Title>This is the year to split the stock: 10 for 1 - discuss here!</Title><Username>surprisetotheupside</Username><Timestamp>1359304251241</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 11:30:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think it would be a good move to split the stock.

Your point is correct when WS crooks were telling people to buy apple at 700 because it was too cheap to compare to other techs and their PE ratio. Cramer was "ponding his freaking table literally" saying APPL was way to cheap at 700. That by itself was stemmed from a different kind of agenda. To get naive investor to buy APPL shares at the highest possible so they can short it later. But the retail investor doesn't have the tools or opportunity to sell when the big boys are slowly dumping their share and they are the one who usually get hurt the most.

Apple’s stock is perceived to be expensive because it has a price tag, per share, of many hundreds of dollars. The stock is high-priced but not over valued. It is cheap and undervalued at less than 6x forward earnings. Many of Apple consumers can’t afford the stock because it is more expensive than upgrading (with contract) to an iPhone 5. Apple should reward its consumers and split the stock, and let the very people that have propelled it to its success participate in its future success. Many suggest that stocks like to maintain its high dollar price tags in order to keep retail investors, considered fickle, out of a stock. However, in the case of Apple, retail investors, I contend, are more loyal to the stock while institutional investors, including hedge funds, are whipping the stock around. I have written several articles on the merits of an Apple stock split, including broader distribution, less volatile holders, and giving back to the consumers who made the company great. See these articles on Apple stock split: Five Reasons Apple Should Split Its Stock And Four Reasons It Shouldn’t Apple Must Split Its Stock A stock split would unleash value, and allow the stock to trade to a normal level, which at the low end would be at the growth rate, and at the high end, would be two times the projected growth rate. That would offer investors upside of almost two to four times where the stock is trading today." the above is from the article Forbes, Jan 24 "Three Things Apple Must Do to Regain Its Momentum"</Msg><Username>surprisetotheupside</Username><Timestamp>1359304688122</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 11:38:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359304705903-593</Id><Topic><Title>Also what was MM waiting for in buying back shares??

When you see too much sentiment to one side, take the other, institutions need to stay with the trend as they have to report to others. Being contrarian doesn't work. Treat your invested dollars like institutions do, use it as chips to play not as your net worth Be nimble No large cap company or world economy like US can turn on a dime or run up like a rocket. Changes aren't that easy to implement and economies don't turn on a dime If a liquid macro cap company like you gave you the musical chairs game chance like last year, play it but know that it's gonna end at one point.

Oh sure, there's still lots who bought way back under $100, but they are going to be outnumbered by the recent underwatwer margined buyers. It's kind of crazy to see the market reward a stock like AMZN while it trashes AAPL. You know now that it was always just about growth, not P/E. AAPL's growth is slowing and this means a painful transition to value stock. As long as AMZN grows sales(not P/E), the $ will flow into it. Quite an amazing lesson in stock market mentality.</Msg><Username>algaebb</Username><Timestamp>1359305514253</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 11:51:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359305563505-639</Id><Topic><Title>if better buy RIMM make easy 20% then come back to buy back APPLE at 392</Title><Username>aea_momentum1</Username><Timestamp>1359305328765</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 11:48:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>thx...</Msg><Username>davidch14</Username><Timestamp>1359305563505</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 11:52:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359305590719-640</Id><Topic><Title>The real issue - guidance and what it means</Title><Username>tkell31</Username><Timestamp>1359302847506</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 11:07:27 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sigh.

How else could 800,000 shares worth nearly $300 million be sold in 17-second intervals? If retail investors are moving back into mutual funds, per Sunday's New York Times, could it be in part because the algos have squeezed them out of what used to be their favorite stock?

Longer term, I think APPL has the resources to increase gross margin dollars to offset the decline in margin percentage. New products, expanded lower end product lines on existing products and pursuing relatively untapped markets for these products is where the additional margin dollars come from. If they also buy back shares of stock, that would help also.</Msg><Username>bobdicks123</Username><Timestamp>1359307147106</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 12:19:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359307157663-694</Id><Title>Peace of Mind for LONG - - Go to Gorufocus to see which HFs are currently holding and at what price</Title><Msg>If your entry points under $600, you have nothing to worry about!</Msg><Username>tvn601</Username><Timestamp>1359307157663</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 12:19:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359307193552-695</Id><Topic><Title>An Apple flash dump</Title><Username>marine_1290</Username><Timestamp>1359304721908</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 11:38:41 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I wonder what options they were holding????</Msg><Username>marine_1290</Username><Timestamp>1359307193552</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 12:19:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359307201109-696</Id><Topic><Title>Wow, apple had the 4th largest qtr in business history</Title><Username>nitram6481</Username><Timestamp>1359306823520</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 12:13:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yep that is why was the most valuable company in the world.</Msg><Username>adamoussebus</Username><Timestamp>1359307201109</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 12:20:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359307212882-697</Id><Title>MY MOM HATES ME BECAUSE IM GAY............WHATS IT MATTER??</Title><Msg>She's afraid ill steal her boyfriend!!! i think he likes me!!...not many people do...til i suk their cawks!!!!</Msg><Username>bruno.malli</Username><Timestamp>1359307212882</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 12:20:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359307277375-698</Id><Topic><Title>Wow, apple had the 4th largest qtr in business history</Title><Username>nitram6481</Username><Timestamp>1359306823520</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 12:13:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>SO, DO YOU WNAT A #$%$????...............I LOVE TO GIVE A BLOWWWWWJOBBBB!!!</Msg><Username>bruno.malli</Username><Timestamp>1359307277375</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 12:21:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359307340108-699</Id><Title>Simple logic for all: would you sell IBM JNJ PG MSFT GOOG etc at 2-3 times cash hoard?????

MFST dropped after topping 1999, in 12 months from $60 to $21, a 66% loss; the stayed for 12 years between 38%-63% range (Fibo!) of the top price; so, after AAPL will rebound and fill the GAP just created by this panic, in 1 week to 510-$520, it should drop in 6 months to $260, and then oscillate for 12 years, between $260-$440. This $440 will remain a very strong Resistance, after AAPL falls thru below it. But first: Sell next week at $510.

They say that they forecast $14.32 for the quarter just ended. But that forecast, we believe, did not take into account the shorter quarter (by one week) this year. We believe that analysts were estimating the quarter relative to the results of the year ago quarter, the 14 week quarter. When you add the $1.11 you get by adjusting the quarter just ended to 14 weeks, you see that even S&amp;P IQ's earnings estimate was exceeded in the quarter just ended. Of course, you are free to believe that Apple would not have achieved a billion dollars of profit in the last week of that extended quarter. You see, the analysts so quick to find failure arre themselves guilty of failure in their own estimates. Now, if they made their estimates in absolute terms then they wouldn't have made the mistake.

I'm long or short, depending on market/equity conditions.. The problem with long term investors, who are always long only, is that they only want to hear the bull case, they don't want to even consider the bearish reasons for this to drop because they don't understand that markets don't necessarily move on fundamentals... do you think the S&amp;P is at levels they are from 665 in March 2009 on fundamentals..?? It's all thanks to liquidity provided by the Fed, and the current 1504 top si being driven entirely by additional liquidity that will be pumped into markets by Japan due their directive to weaken the Yen. Absolutely nothing fundamental about any of this.. And when markets sell or run, everything goes with it, for the most part... There are long term support and resistance levels that are in play here now that Apple is back to these levels. 420 is a SURE thing. Any drop below that is an intentional act by WS to suppress the price so they can be THE bottom feeders and own Aapl lower than anyone else. That's why PB's drop to where they do.. In the same manner that central banks are suppressing the price of Gold, so they can be the exclusive owners. They don't want the public in it driving the price up. CB's want them OUT..</Msg><Username>golfrattt2000</Username><Timestamp>1359309296309</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 12:54:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359309298848-741</Id><Topic><Title>Who are the APPL shorts?.</Title><Username>sameas55</Username><Timestamp>1359308559346</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 12:42:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Anybody with a brain knows that Jobs was the brains behind everything at Apple.

Knowing what those tops are and calling them to take short positions is the hardest part, can potentially bankrupt you if you're not risk conscious.. And that's the problem with Apple bagholders.

P/E is Price/Earning. It isn't (Price+Cash)/Earning or (Price+Cash-Debt)/Earning. If you want to analyze (Price+Cash)/Earning, it is perfectly fine, but you should call it something else and you can't compare it to P/E because P/E doesn't have the cash component in it. Look at it from another viewpoint, if for some reasons, Apple decided to use all its cash to buy an island somewhere. Its P/E will still be the same but the P+C/E will be very different. Changing the meaning of P/E isn't fundamental analysis. It is just spinning the data to rationalize someone's bias.</Msg><Username>pureinvestor</Username><Timestamp>1359309966205</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 13:06:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359309975464-759</Id><Title>Yes, MM has only bought back a paltry $212 mil worth or 13 mil shares out of 1.2 bil. shares and with $5 bil to spend according to.....</Title><Msg>....that filing.

How do you cut the losses? 1. Get out before you lose more 2. Don't get emotional after losses 3. Re-think your Long strategy 4. Go Short (but this is very hard to do) 5. Find another place to invest (if you still have money left) The problem with doubling down is that you don't know where the bottom is! And you just end up losing more and more of your hard earned money. In the past, I have used that strategy, and lost even more. You can't change the momentum for a particular stock. It's governed by larger institutional holders and hedge funds. You can only be part of that momentum, can't change it. And when the momentum is downward, you can only hope that it turns around in your favor. In the absence of any new news, that is almost impossible. As I said earlier, I still Love Apple, but just don't like the Apple stock at this levels.</Msg><Username>traderapple</Username><Timestamp>1359312008498</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 13:40:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359312174851-797</Id><Topic><Title>AAPL GROWTH: Cramer's and others "Reset" Nonsense</Title><Username>squeezetracker</Username><Timestamp>1359295593309</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 09:06:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Notice no one is talking about math like that?

If the above parallel holds: -AAPL should fall by sept.2013 into the $440-264 range, bottoming at $264, and stay there for the next 12 years. -on the way down, currently AAPL is at 5 months decline, this is best time for the first rebound, from current bottom at $440, -the rebound should last the next 2 months, upward 50% of the total drop of (700-440)*50%= 130, topping at 430+130=$560. -From that point on, we might expect AAPL price continue to fall for 5 more months, bottoming sept.2013 at $264. If it follows the MSFT pattern. IF. The psycology is pretty much the same. And psycology is much more important factor than cash, PE, Bookvalue, etc; simply because almost ALL Apple investors are underwater. Just like MSFT investors, in year 2000.

Six weeks later coy manipulator K#$%$ called aapl a "generational buy" at $525 and Grundlach suggested the stock could easily bounce back hard for a while. As favorable results poured in, a week later the stock was almost 20% higher, hitting $595 before fading as the entire cadre of cnbc and U.S. press twits piled onto the aapl bashing parade. K#$%$ showed his fat red face onFM telling Wopner that AAPL is somehow now a great short, re-energizing the cnbc parade to bash aapl again. Three days later the stock was down to $520 again and it continues to thrash about on mostly bs commentary from professionals set up to benefit from it -- using cnbc as the likely very unwitting numb effer tools in the bucket. K#$%$, for those who think he is a genius more than underhanded #$%$ taking advantage of cnbc's willingness to be the judas goat, said he had covered in at $530 on the same call he revealed what an #$%$ he was buy saying generational buy while his clear plan within days was to short the snot out of the stock. But see my post about the real revenue and earnings story for last Q, and realize that guidance gaffs aside, aapl is performing beautifully and likely will continue to dazzle. Looking forward to more confirmation about the 2 perhaps 3 new phones coming this year... bring it Steve -- along with some kind of news about using m#$%$ive excess capital to buy shares aggressively down here. Read up on the LTE expansion last week as well... the number of worldwide carriers with new LTE networks now selling i5 increased from 24 to 60 last week. No bs -- just what is happening.

Say what you want about Intel, Cisco and MSFT, but they have established floors under their stock price by virtue of their dividend yields. Apple still cannot say this. I also think that while Apple is almost universally loved by consumers- they have a lot of enemies out there- especially on Wall Street. Apple does almost no M&amp;A and has no debt so they throw Wall Street no love in the form of fees. Even an aggressive stock buy back program would show Wall Street some love in the form of commissions. Sure there may be some still high price targets, and some fund managers have been overly bullish- but this stock has ruined their careers- so there is tons of hate out there. This has flat out turned into a hated stock- and it is difficult to convince people to buy a hated stock. They are also essentially one of the largest bond owners out there with a $100B fixed income portfolio so they are essentially contributing to the issue of bonds being over-owned. You watch if Apple decides to issue debt or start doing M&amp;A- the sentiment will change in a hurry as the greedy bankers steam roll their analyst into doing an upgrade a raise in the price target in order to curry favor.</Msg><Username>budfox20001</Username><Timestamp>1359314373802</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 14:19:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359314386615-867</Id><Topic><Title>BOYCOTT CNBC!</Title><Username>sameas55</Username><Timestamp>1359222162530</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 12:42:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>if you know the game then play it.

Employees must be at all time lows since 2003 on the stock malaise and S press everywhere, so as I wrote last week, Tim and the BOD need to smell the F coffee and get going on some shareholder distributions NOW before more damage is done to the jelly of the month clud and customer/shareholder sentiment toward AAPL. Many folks who have been hurt are loyal aapl customers and would be out buying new iPads coming and the i5S and i6 and for their wife later this year, giving the i5 they just bought to their kids if they feel they can afford it, and given aapl has plenty to say and do to remedy the bs takedown, they REALLY ought to do more than say "the stock will take care of itself." THAT attitude is what has created the opprtunity for people to bash and dis and short at will until the last trade on Friday. Expect more news on the new phones, more carriers, CM, dividends, aggressive buyback etc over the coming weeks. Now to your question. Despite the carnage of the above, we still expect aapl to mash last year's numbers this year. We also expect the stock to rip back above $550 rapidly, and to claw its way back toward $700 ($800 if CM is done by say October) by the end of the year. If we were publishing public estimates, we'd be out at $600 by EOY as written earlier -- giving us cushion to raise it in April or on other brightening news as the stock begins a roaring reversal higher any moment now.</Msg><Username>squeezetracker</Username><Timestamp>1359315015196</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 14:30:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359315016111-883</Id><Title>Slumdog millionaires need to dive into shiat holes to get out of house.</Title><Msg>Forrest Gump sold.</Msg><Username>osulinn</Username><Timestamp>1359315016111</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 14:30:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359315036815-884</Id><Topic><Title>What companies should Apple buy?</Title><Username>redzombie85</Username><Timestamp>1359312362262</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 13:46:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Berkshire, GE, Honeywell</Msg><Username>sun_cruise</Username><Timestamp>1359315036815</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 14:30:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359315077016-885</Id><Topic><Title>Told my Mom to get ready to BUY BUY BUY APPLE</Title><Username>alvin555</Username><Timestamp>1359314985343</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 14:29:45 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why would you want to destroy your mother and your inheritance?</Msg><Username>wag_quagmire</Username><Timestamp>1359315077016</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 14:31:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359315130387-886</Id><Topic><Title>DOUG KASS: SHEAD EXTRAORDINAIRE</Title><Username>squeezetracker</Username><Timestamp>1359313646620</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 14:07:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>have fun with reading this fact based recap.</Msg><Username>squeezetracker</Username><Timestamp>1359315130387</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 14:32:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359315167357-887</Id><Title>360 and im in.

In exchange for an up-front payment of $1.95 billion, the financial institution committed to deliver a number of shares during the ASR’s purchase period, which ends later in 2013. The total number of shares ultimately delivered, and therefore the average price paid per share, will be determined at the end of the purchase period based on the volume weighted average price of the Company’s stock during that period. In the first quarter of 2013, 2,582,782 shares were initially delivered to the Company. This does not represent the final number of shares to be delivered under the ASR. These shares were retired and accounted for as a reduction to shareholders’ equity in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company accounted for the ASR as a repurchase of common stock for purposes of calculating earnings per share and as a forward contract indexed to its own common stock which met all of the applicable criteria for equity classification, and, therefore, was not accounted for as a derivative instrument.</Msg><Username>seabow9981</Username><Timestamp>1359316197691</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 14:49:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359316203239-913</Id><Topic><Title>What companies should Apple buy?</Title><Username>redzombie85</Username><Timestamp>1359312362262</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 13:46:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Disney just made that deal with Netflix.

They didnt mention that Samsung was not taking as much in the smartphone devision but moistly low cost which by the way they are going to get into zoo. They didnt mention that even with next q conservative earnings APPL should be trading around 600.

Its mall has both Microsoft and Apple stores. Both are always crowded but the Apple store has always been more so. However, Apple just built a new, even larger store there. It is so impressive that middle aged men stop in front of it with their months wide open and it's even more crowded. That's one of the reasons that I bought some stock on Friday. People want Apple products. Buying the stock was a no brainer with a trailing PE of 7 after backing off the cash and investments and with a 2.4% dividend that wiil rise since they earn a billion dollars a week. The dividend alone is larger than most without even considering the huge cash flow that keeps going up.</Msg><Username>patient2invest</Username><Timestamp>1359317433391</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 15:10:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359317451859-963</Id><Topic><Title>I wouldn't be buying Aapl behind an 800k share dump at Friday's close...</Title><Username>golfrattt2000</Username><Timestamp>1359302472437</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 11:01:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>'As for Amzn, when it goes, it's going to go BIG, down that is..' gee no kidding.

A stock split will open the doors for more people to buy the stock. Retail investors like to buy rounds lots of 100. It's hard to buy a round lot of 100 for AAPL. Sets you back 44K right now.

I'm not sure what "I think APPL has the resources to increase gross margin dollars to offset the decline in margin percentage." would mean otherwise. Expanding revenue would be one way to tackle it, but with revenue projected to grow 7% next quarter that would take some time which is my immediate concern with the stock. The big question then is will revenue growth accelerate in future quarters. I'm hopeful they will release new products to capture the lower end market while maintaining market share in the upper end, but that is going to be a juggling act. As some have pointed out it does appear the Mini iPad ate into the full size iPad sales in addition to reaching additional consumers. Expecting a completely new product to save the day seems extremely unrealistic. Yes, share buybacks would help, but realistically I dont see them spending much more than already allocated unless the price significantly drops from here. Even doubling the allocation wouldnt be enough to buy back much more than 1% of the stock. Personally I would rather see a larger dividend hike to get 3%. Initially I thought this would have a bounce, now I'm not so sure now. The numbers for second quarter really dont warrant much enthusiasm. I think this is a 390-400 stock at this point since the market never seems to care about cash on hand like shareholders think it should.</Msg><Username>tkell31</Username><Timestamp>1359320387437</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 15:59:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359320488161-1057</Id><Topic><Title>was at the club last night everyone had a Samsung phone...</Title><Username>bat1_70605</Username><Timestamp>1359318201310</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 15:23:21 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Android phones are good if you like hackers having access to your bank account.</Msg><Username>not_bearish</Username><Timestamp>1359320488161</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 16:01:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359320547982-1058</Id><Topic><Title>AAPL Up Big This Week.

Given next quarters projections would you next quarters free cash flow (tbh not sure how that is measured) will beat or fall short of second quarter 2012? Other than the tremendous amount of revenue and cash they already generate I guess I'm trying to figure out where optimism would come from given the number Apple has put out there. I was under the impression PE told you how long it would take for the company to earn it's market cap so in this case it would be more like 10 years. Am I wrong in assuming some of the free cash flow pays for dividends and buybacks? Thanks again, have me something else to look into.

Why was margin temporarily compressed and now about to get materially better? AApl is now past their most massive product refresh ever, just began in many entirely new markets, rush shipping/fedex vs freighters, huge overtime spiffs for Foxconn on i5 and iPad Mini and continuing still through the chinese new year holiday just starting up, still unmet demand for i5 in most markets/ipad Mini in all markets/ and iMacs inall markets while on the verge of huge enterprise surge, massive software/cloud/accessories surge visible now and accelerating, no production yield curve benefit in the q, no cost curve benefit yet on the i5 or the mini despite pulling away from Samsung for cheaper/better alternates, and no operating leverage on any of the foregoing until later in the March Q. AAPL is going to kick butt this quarter. Bank it. And still we wonder, Why did Gore go early? Is there something special coming by March 19th? Or did he and his advisores think the Q and guidance and handling of both was going to be plenty to launch the stock.

By all means if there is public information that indicates revenue in the third quarter and beyond will increase faster please do so. So there you have it back up what you claim you mental midget and I will never be seen or heard again.</Msg><Username>tkell31</Username><Timestamp>1359324532188</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 17:08:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359324564799-1135</Id><Topic><Title>AAPL going to 0</Title><Username>doesthishurtyou</Username><Timestamp>1359324269072</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 17:04:29 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>so long as it doesn't go below zero i am good.</Msg><Username>rainbow_trout23</Username><Timestamp>1359324564799</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 17:09:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359324574527-1136</Id><Topic><Title>AAPL going to 0</Title><Username>doesthishurtyou</Username><Timestamp>1359324269072</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 17:04:29 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>this may be the biggest #$%$ on this board</Msg><Username>elbar56</Username><Timestamp>1359324574527</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 17:09:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359324615181-1137</Id><Topic><Title>was at the club last night everyone had a Samsung phone...</Title><Username>bat1_70605</Username><Timestamp>1359318201310</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 15:23:21 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Lol, look at this idiots posting history!

So you dont think 3rd and 4th quarter are going to drop? I mean even if they stay the same we're looking at $42 not 44. Margins last year in the 3rd quarter were 48%...if this year they are going to be 38% (like for the past quarter and current) you dont think that is going to have a negative impact on EPS? Um, it's at a 10 PE now is it not? so how is it a ridiculous? I've already explained how $42 is optimistic, 39-40 hardly seems "lowball" when you consider the margin compression from this quarter and next.

Could you expand on the revenue model you reference? Revenue growth in second quarter 2011 was around 83% so 55% doesnt seem that unusual. I dont think there is anyway to spin 4-8% as anything but negative (much like the reaction at the time it was announced). My question is why do you see EPS in the 3rd and 4th quarters, historically the worst performing quarters, not being impacted by the declining margins and slowing revenue growth? $46 eps for 2013 seems ridiculously optimistic UNLESS Apple is in fact lowballing the second quarter, but given what was said that would seem odd. In fact if the third and fourth quarter have similar margins to the first and second quarter I would project EPS closer to $40. Admittedly I'm taking second quarter numbers, and applying them to the 3rd and 4th quarter (ie 4-8% growth and 38% margins). Given they are normally weaker quarters I dont see why I would use better projections, but if you have any reasons for being more optimistic I would like to read them.

You can make your extended AM trades starting at 8 am. IDO NOT try and offload all 1k shares at once, the algos will run away from you. Try to do it in four trades or more. Try and split the spread but closer to the buy side to make execution more likely. On the other hand, I happen to think tomorrow willl be a nice apple day. but thats based on nothing but gut. In any event, I hope this becomes a profitable lesson for you on what not to do with expiring options. Of course we all want to know how it goes.

Many other phones are better now than iphone5. So why paying such a premium for iphone. The pricing for ipads are competetive and i can see they will be in demand. The gross margin for ipad is about 20%. The outdated Iphone 5 for $700 is simply a joke. I can not find any reasonable person who would pay this. The carries subsidy will only keep iphone alive. If you picture Apple as a luxury brand on smartphone market this would mean significant market share drop. You can not have luxury premium margins with mass production at this scale as Apple has been having. The competition has caught up and there is a new reality now.</Msg><Username>adamoussebus</Username><Timestamp>1359329264571</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 18:27:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359329301349-1324</Id><Title>SPY still has room to go up..</Title><Msg>if Red delicious is not your type of fruit.</Msg><Username>osulinn</Username><Timestamp>1359329301349</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 18:28:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359329309262-1325</Id><Topic><Title>AAPL now ridiculously OVERSOLD using ANY metric ya wanna use.

I'm hoping to make half of it back on other investments this year and the rest next year. I'm looking at WMT, KO and SLV. It angers me that a company that reports record earnings and revenues gets a punished so dramatically while companies like NFLX or AMZN who don't make much earnings gets rewarded.

When I was just a baby my mama told me. Doc, Always be a good boy, don't ever play with stocks.

You need to call the desk and find out if they will let you close the position yourself. If so, you need to do the following: (1) be watching premarket. You can start to make trades at 8 am eastern in extended AM trading, but watch even earlier (2) DO NOT try to close 3k shares at once. Try and break it up into multiple trades and split the spread and come under last sale. (3) hold on to a few shares! This could end up being profitable, so don't freak yet. It is up to 441 post closing on Friday so you never know. I'm hoping for your sake its surges premarket and you learn.

Get ready to cover if you are not hedged.</Msg><Username>ccgames03</Username><Timestamp>1359332739245</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 19:25:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359332797346-1493</Id><Title>seriously people . who actally cares about getting an iphone . its time to wake up to reality . otherwise loose it all</Title><Msg>gggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg</Msg><Username>junior1rules</Username><Timestamp>1359332797346</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 19:26:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359332815512-1494</Id><Topic><Title>Bets On Where Apple Closes Tomorrow? $435.00?</Title><Username>southwankers</Username><Timestamp>1359332670953</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 19:24:30 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>470+</Msg><Username>dhmunoz1220</Username><Timestamp>1359332815512</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 19:26:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359332865652-1495</Id><Topic><Title>Bets On Where Apple Closes Tomorrow? $435.00?</Title><Username>southwankers</Username><Timestamp>1359332670953</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 19:24:30 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>420</Msg><Username>junior1rules</Username><Timestamp>1359332865652</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 19:27:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359332866725-1496</Id><Topic><Title>Bets On Where Apple Closes Tomorrow? $435.00?</Title><Username>southwankers</Username><Timestamp>1359332670953</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 19:24:30 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>$470</Msg><Username>ajmckay1000</Username><Timestamp>1359332866725</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 19:27:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359332872135-1497</Id><Title>Nothing coming from BOD...they knew about it and were fine.

On the other hand, when GOOG toppled in 2008-09, it lost about half its value, but now it is back to new highs, and I think Apple is more likely to follow that scenario.

I have no position. Just get a chuckle out of watching this collapse. And noting that they have $140 BILLION in cash at their disposal. So, they are not going bankrupt. But Samsung is destroying them and Cook needs to use some of the cash to diversify and expand the product line. beyond iTVs. If they cut gross margins by 60% they would double unit volume and still make amazing profits. They can't sell high priced equipment any longer. Too much competition with equal or superior products.</Msg><Username>binnybeoris</Username><Timestamp>1359337640597</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 20:47:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359337651081-1752</Id><Title>Hey wall street pigs</Title><Msg>You are the reason that almost all the jobs in this country are being exported overseas by demanding ridiculous earning from public companies and they have no choice but to ship everything outside US to save money.

Who gets the credit? That's the crucial question in advertising these days—particularly in Internet advertising, where it's easy to track clicks and links but often hard to pin down exactly which view of an ad drove a sale. Now Facebook is making it easier to show that an ad displayed on the social network led to a sale—even an ad seen days or weeks ago. The technology is called conversion tracking, and after years of testing the idea, Facebook quietly rolled it out to all advertisers in a little-noted move last week. The idea is pretty simple: Facebook creates a customized conversion pixel that advertisers place on a page—like a checkout page on an e-commerce site, or a signup page for a subscription, or an app-download page—where a consumer's taking the action they hoped their ads would prompt. That lets Facebook link sales to ad campaigns, showing in aggregate which ads generated the most response. Google has long had similar features, along with Google Analytics, a dashboard for doing deep analysis of users' actions on a website. But Facebook has rolled out something far more powerful that can consistently track users across mobile devices and desktop websites. It can do this because it has a single, unified identity for each of its users, who tend to stay logged in to Facebook far more than any other website. Google has responded by rolling out Google+. Often misunderstood as a social network, Google+ has been described by executive chairman Eric Schmidt and other executives as an "identity layer" across Google products. Its social features provide an incentive for users to log in with Google accounts. But they have yet to do so with anything like the consistency and frequency that Facebook users do.</Msg><Username>hotmodeltestid122</Username><Timestamp>1359338347961</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 20:59:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359338355961-1801</Id><Topic><Title>AAPL at $433 on Taiwanese exchange</Title><Username>white_sox_curse</Username><Timestamp>1359337786143</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 20:49:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>sure.

More recently, it has been combining a limited test of conversion tracking with a feature called Optimized CPM, which automatically tunes campaigns to specific marketing goals like product sales or app downloads, rather than crude link-clicking metrics. Those tests seem to be successful: On Tuesday, Facebook quietly announced that the feature was available to all advertisers around the world. Why does this matter? Google has dominated online advertising for a host of reasons, but the chief one is the measurability of its ads. When a user clicks on a link, that sparks a storm of data used by Google and its advertisers alike to tweak their next campaign. Search-engine marketing is now a science rather than an art. And because it is so easy for Google to show a direct link between a click and a sale, it has commanded the lion's share of online-marketing budgets, especially in direct-response categories. But any student of marketing knows that the demand funnel is long and complex, with multiple exposures to a message required to prompt a sale. Google dominates the end of the funnel, catching consumers when they are in a mood to buy (as they typically are when they type product-related keywords into a search box). Facebook, because of its ubiquity in people's daily habits, can play in the middle of the funnel, offering the kind of frequency marketers need to break through to ad-inundated consumers. And now Facebook can show how those ads lead to purchases—even if they don't happen in the moment a consumer clicks. Facebook still can't compete with Google at the end of the demand funnel. Its recently announced Graph Search is unsuitable for almost all product queries in its present form, save maybe for categories like movies and music. But if conversion data can shift some spending away from Google</Msg><Username>hotmodeltestid122</Username><Timestamp>1359338448185</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 21:00:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359338464758-1810</Id><Title>apple is closing stores</Title><Msg>get out now and save some of your profits</Msg><Username>doesthishurtyou</Username><Timestamp>1359338464758</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 21:01:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359338465560-1811</Id><Topic><Title>AAPL Will Come Out Swinging</Title><Username>pdufaman</Username><Timestamp>1359335374912</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 20:09:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>With all the cash they have i would think a buy back then news.</Msg><Username>oathout.david</Username><Timestamp>1359338465560</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 21:01:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359338470626-1812</Id><Topic><Title>AAPL Will Come Out Swinging</Title><Username>pdufaman</Username><Timestamp>1359335374912</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 20:09:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>that's what happened when someone loses too much money.. they can't cope with reality and ends up living in their own fantasy world</Msg><Username>harry_vachyna</Username><Timestamp>1359338470626</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 21:01:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359338514542-1813</Id><Topic><Title>AAPL Will Come Out Swinging</Title><Username>pdufaman</Username><Timestamp>1359335374912</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 20:09:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That is the most absurd thing I have ever heard.

That was the downfall of Microsoft. Thank you government. Now a different story is going on with Apple. They are going to have to shorten product cycles on certain products but overall they are still making tons of money. They even made big money during bad economic times(maybe it shows characteristics of value stocks). The street just wants a new entry point and this stock will be off to the races. Never been an apple shareholder but I am buying and will continue to add.</Msg><Username>uvahoos7</Username><Timestamp>1359338698059</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 21:04:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359338699894-1821</Id><Topic><Title>sheepskinner/ tendulrocks</Title><Username>nine23oh4</Username><Timestamp>1359337540861</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 20:45:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>just as I thought. ball less with a big mouth, nothing to back it up. keep posting, if it makes you feel worthwhile</Msg><Username>nine23oh4</Username><Timestamp>1359338699894</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 21:04:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359338700653-1822</Id><Title>Apple is building new stores and they are larger-crowded and packed too!</Title><Msg>Sales revenue and growth and new products</Msg><Username>moneywizard</Username><Timestamp>1359338700653</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 21:05:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359338728163-1823</Id><Topic><Title>AAPL Will Come Out Swinging</Title><Username>pdufaman</Username><Timestamp>1359335374912</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 20:09:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Really doubt that.

Most also know that AAPL aggressively uses all legal tax loopholes to pay as little State and Federal tax as possible, despite being one of the world's most profitable companies. Many know, courtesy of our exclusive from September, that Apple also is the holding company for Braeburn Capital: a firm which with a few exceptions, also happens to be among the world's largest hedge funds, whose function is to manage Apple's massive cash hoard with virtually zero reporting requirements, and whose obligation is to make sure that AAPL's cash gets laundered legally and efficiently in a way that complies with prerogative #1: avoid paying taxes. What few if any know, is that as part of its cash management obligations, Braeburn, and AAPL by extension, has conducted a mindboggling $600 billion worth of gross notional trades in just the past four years, consisting of buying and selling assorted unknown securities, or some $250 billion in 2012 alone: a grand total which represents some $1 billion per working day on average, and which puts the net turnover of some 99% of all hedge funds to shame! Finally, what nobody knows, except for the recipients of course, is just how much in trade commissions AAPL has paid on these hundreds of billions in trades to the brokering banks, many (or maybe all) of which may have found this commission revenue facilitating AAPL having a "Buy" recommendation: a rating shared by 52, or 83% of the raters, despite the company's wiping out of one year in capital gains in a few short months.

We have seen GM lower than this before (2010 had 2 quarters lower). The margins will never hit last years 2Q again unless something crazy happens. The revenue estimates for Q3 and Q4 show around 20%+ growth and I am assuming margins normalize back towards 40% to this past quarter on the conservative side not further contraction. The estimates call for just under $45 and I think we beat that rather easily for the year. I think $40 is almost impossible after close to $14 this past quarter. That would mean under $9/quarter for the rest of the year - I just don't see that happening. I see Q2 at just under $11, Q3 around 10.50 and Q4 at 10.25 without any tweaking for product launches but based only on revenue growth and consistent margins.</Msg><Username>monkey449</Username><Timestamp>1359340363276</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 21:32:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359340397979-1868</Id><Topic><Title>APPLE has really lost it's cool!!</Title><Username>classshopper</Username><Timestamp>1359340186487</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 21:29:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Soon,you will not have to go through Itones...

These two Chinese vendors are looking to establish a name with US consumers as they seek to mature into global brands. Huawei, the world's number two information and communications technology (ICT) solutions provider and maker of equipment for telecom carriers, has a great influence in China - the world's largest mobile phone market. ZTE, a multinational telecommunications equipment company has also moved into the mobile phone market to expand operations by primarily providing low-to-mid end devices. ZTE and Huawei have become quite the forces in the Chinese mobile phone market, ranking 4th and 5th, respectively, above US megabrand Apple (AAPL). The companies now have their sights set on the American market. Both companies have already gotten their foot in the American mobile market by taking center stage at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas (articles here, here and here). With notable absences of Apple and Google (GOOG), the Chinese makers took advantage of the opportunity to promote their newly released high-end smartphones. Huawei introduced the "world's largest display" smartphone, the Ascend Mate, which challenges the Samsung Galaxy Note II. In addition, the company intends to launch the Ascend D2, the "world's most powerful smartphone." Although ZTE has not claimed any world leading titles, they announced their new full featured Grand S smartphone as one of the thinnest in the market. With these newest product offerings, Chinese companies are now competing with high end smartphone-makers feature for feature. Foreign manufacturers face several roadblocks ahead before they can proceed with their invasion into the western market. For instance, in October of 2012, US Congress flagged both Chinese companies as security threats to consumers. Congress believed there to be Chinese government influence within the businesses. These regulatory barriers have raised concerns of consumer security, while also indicating trade protection between the world's two largest economies. The lack of brand awareness and acceptance are two common struggles foreign companies face when expanding into a developed market. This can be traced to Japanese electronics back in the 80s, and more recently, the HTC branded smartphone in 2006. At their respective introduction into the US market, these brands were considered unknown and unreliable due to their cheap manufacturing backgrounds. Nevertheless, with consistent innovation and marketing, the Japanese technologies dominated global production for over two decades and the Taiwanese smartphone manufacturer reached a peak of 12% market share in the US during 2010. However, consumer reaction to these advancing Chinese technologies has yet to be seen. Brand acceptance of Chinese technologies will have to overcome a biased reputation of fallibility and inferior quality. On top of that, a lack of brand awareness in the US market will add little support to either Huawei or ZTE's reputation. To rid this prejudice, both Chinese manufacturers will have to increase exposure of their product, as the main focus of both companies is to establish relationships with US mobile service carriers. In this recent interview, ZTE US chief Lixin Cheng signified the importance of signing with a big four carrier as the key to success in their western expansion. The company is currently working to address carrier needs for a potential launch of their Grand S phone later on in 2013. This is a crucial step for the Chinese manufacturer as carriers purchase the majority of phones, which are then sold to consumers. By successfully being implemented into a large carrier's system, ZTE can increase their exposure to the brand conscious consumer of the high end smartphone segment. Greater publicity will only be beneficial for the company as it would minimize lack of awareness and acceptance of launching in a new market. In addition, company advertising budgets would be reduced as the carriers would share in the cost of commercializing the product. Agreements with large US service providers would boost ZTE in their goal to double their US handset market share to 10% by 2015. Huawei is facing a similar situation to ZTE; needing to increase brand awareness across the US market. Developing relationships with US mobile service providers will expose Huawei to gain greater brand recognition and as a result, a greater market share of the US mobile market. Due to its size, ample resources (profits of $1.85 billion) and ambitions to breach the American mobile market, Huawei will splurge on advertising their products to their new target consumers. Before executing such a brute marketing strategy, influential carriers will need to be supporting the newly released high-end Ascend models. And yet, the Chinese players may need more than carrier contracts and feature filled phones to break into such a brand-conscious market. The smartphone field is full of players seeking to recapture past glory such as RIM's (RIMM) much anticipated BlackBerry 10 and Nokia's (NOK) road to relevance. To induce the cult following of already established names, such as the ones mentioned above, ZTE and Huawei must offer their high end smartphones at a discounted rate. This would slowly attract the bargain consumers and those without contracts, which in turn will enhance the hype factor of the new players. After all, price is king. A quality product tagged with a lower price than competitors will be hard to ignore, even if, at first, the brands remain relatively unknown. With Samsung and Apple controlling the top two positions in the US smartphone market, the battle for third is up for grabs. As competition heats up in a continuously saturating market, consumers should be looking forward to 2013 as this struggle for market share benefits the buyer with increased innovation and lower prices. Established firms like RIM and Nokia face uncertainties with their new devices (BB10) or operating systems (Windows 8) whereas the likes of Motorola and HTC seek to become relevant players a second time around. This volatility proves to be favourable for new entrants to compete in the market as current players struggle. We've yet to see how the new Chinese players will affect the smartphone market. However, with continuous innovation and additional brand awareness from a possible carrier partnership, a dent can be put in the American market share. These potent Chinese companies have made it clear that their next sight is set on the western mobile market. If the upcoming releases of established names prove to be subpar, both ZTE and Huawei offer cutting edge technology westerners have grown accustomed to. By staying on top of consumer demand while offering high end phones at discounted prices, ZTE and Huawei could become household names in 2013. In other words, the Chinese are coming</Msg><Username>meltdownman1</Username><Timestamp>1359341396279</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 21:49:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359341466426-1889</Id><Topic><Title>AAPL Will Come Out Swinging</Title><Username>pdufaman</Username><Timestamp>1359335374912</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 20:09:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Keep dreaming.

Most popular apps are developed for iOS and Android as an after thought. Android, as a platform, is too fragmented (different versions of OS, different hardware specs, different screen dimensions) Case in point. This week Twitter released the latest App of the Moment, Vine. The whole tech world is buzzing about it, but if you have an Android your in the cold. As to the app store--I have android devices and I would never in a million years go outside an app store. There is enough malware in the App store. The un-verified apps, outside the store, forget about it. So Google offers an alternative you can't use, vs. Apple not offering an alternative. Same difference.</Msg><Username>im_long_aapl</Username><Timestamp>1359342791178</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 22:13:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359342808945-1922</Id><Topic><Title>What did Apple do to CNBC?</Title><Username>dayvtrader79</Username><Timestamp>1359342220437</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 22:03:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think CNBC is in the Sumsang's pocket.</Msg><Username>uchina3</Username><Timestamp>1359342808945</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 22:13:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359342837214-1923</Id><Topic><Title>AAPL Will Come Out Swinging</Title><Username>pdufaman</Username><Timestamp>1359335374912</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 20:09:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Im dreaming with you !</Msg><Username>A Yahoo!

I'm a little reluctant to accept it will increase in what are typically slower quarters. I guess the new iPad could drive it. Once again going by Apple's guidance second qtr shouldn't be any better than 10.3-10.7. Meaning 3rd and 4th qtr would have to be total of 21 to hit $45+...that would be a lot of yoy growth. On the other hand at $24.3 after two quarters IF margins and growth dont increase after the second qtr I could easily see EPS in the second half of the year slipping to 15.50 from 18 to wind up right around 40. Not to be a broken record, but I just dont see why 3rd and 4th would be better than the 2nd when historically they are not. When I heard the guidance announced on CNBC I got a sick feeling.

That’s so last season! Apple will release three upgraded iPhones by the end of the year — despite launching its latest model just four months ago — tech analysts and Chinese newspapers report. Two of the new models — the iPhone 5S and a first-of-its-kind low-budget iPhone — are due out by June, according to the China Times. The third device, a larger-screened iPhone 6 with a 12-pixel camera, could be available by Christmas, analysts say. The business move may be coming because Apple is feeling demand from folks who can’t afford smartphones, Wall Street tech market analyst Peter Misek told The Post. He also said the Samsung-style look of a big screen is gaining popularity. “A large percent of the population wants bigger screens — so there’s a demand for that and it’s hurting them,” Misek said. Misek — who correctly predicted past iPhone features— said he is “confident” that the iPhone 5s will have an 8-megapixel camera and will hit shops by June. He also said the company’s “affordable” $250 iPhone will be heavier and made of polycarbonate material. The iPhone 6 will likely feature a 4.8 inch screen, he said. The move is unusual for Apple, which has in the past released only one iPhone per year. Natalie Harrison, a spokeswoman for Apple, refused to offer details about any in-the-works products.</Msg><Username>hijamesjon</Username><Timestamp>1359344092556</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 22:34:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359344116005-1956</Id><Title>Samsung selling mainly lower end..lower price point phones outside U.S.</Title><Msg>Apple making money on iPhone whereas Samsung selling cheap phones to countries where price point has to be very low.

They are impostors.</Msg><Username>catchawave57</Username><Timestamp>1359344116005</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 22:35:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359344186482-1957</Id><Topic><Title>Short with impunity</Title><Username>santacruzmogul</Username><Timestamp>1359342777120</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 22:12:57 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Spoken like a JEWloser who missed the boat.</Msg><Username>higuy100</Username><Timestamp>1359344186482</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 22:36:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359344191320-1958</Id><Topic><Title>Can't wait to et my BB10</Title><Username>blathering_idiot</Username><Timestamp>1359344041769</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 22:34:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good luck to RIMM, they have a hard road ahead of them 1.

I've been trading options for 4 years, and yes, i don't know why you would take advice from anyone on a mssg board, but i realize you're just trying to get ideas.. It's going to be tough, there'll be a lot of volatility as this sells off. Thoughts.. You could take a simple put option position as a hedge, it'll lock in your current position. with 200 shares, all you'd have to do is buy 2 put options at the money since each put represents 100 shares. I'd go with March options. If the price continues downward, you'll have to decide at which point you want to close them. Lets say it does go to 400, you could then take 2 call positions, or whatever you like, for the ride back up.. The problems You have no idea where it's going to bottom. Short term support is at 420, but could easily see 390. Any short term bounces will likely get shorted. there are a ton of uncertainties. One thing is for sure, wherever the retail public is invested, Wall Street will try to take it from you.. the other problem will be your inexperience in trading options. Your put premiums will see some depreciation due to a drop in implied volatilty. I just checked Mar 440 puts. IV is @ 28.7, down from 45%, so volatility is tanking. The low the past year is approx. 20%, so you could potentially see an approx. 30-40% drop in IV which will drag down the premium on your puts, subtracting from any of your gains of it were to continue to drop. You could also sell covered calls against your shares. I only sell options in spreads so i can't advise you there, but that may be a nice alternative because you won't have to worry about dropping volatility killing your trade, it'll actually help you... hope that helps. And just weed out the schmucks. The aapl board is full of newbies so you're going to get them.. Frankly, i like selling covered calls as the best option, less guesswork... good luck..</Msg><Username>golfrattt2000</Username><Timestamp>1359346933645</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 23:22:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359346982698-2057</Id><Topic><Title>Apple longs lets see what Samsung lovers really know</Title><Username>fp718591</Username><Timestamp>1359346408702</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 23:13:28 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I bet your correct, and i was thinking what you thought, the basher use Samsung and dont even know what that stock is wroth</Msg><Username>fp718591</Username><Timestamp>1359346982698</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 23:23:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359347014762-2058</Id><Title>Is this price the new normal?</Title><Msg>I look at this price and see that it would take 30%+ gains to get back to what I thought were cement floors on price 3 months ago.

If you sell this week's 460 strike calls you'll get .5% based on friday's close. If the stock opens higher tomorrow, and it rises on Mondays more than other days, you will get an enhanced premium. When the stock rises on Monday there is usually follow through on Tuesday and if the volume is good, it is followed by so additional gain on Wednesday. Then Thursdays the stock often weakens and Fridays are almost always disappointing unless the stock is on fire, and that hasn't happened in several months. So I would wait and see what happens tomorrow. If the stock starts strong and runs hard into Monday, wait until at least Wednesday morning and sell calls $15 higher than the current price. If the PPS sinks Thursday and Friday, then you'll keep your premium and can repeat the process for the next weeks, etc. You run the risk (or hope) of course of having the stock leap forward and you'll have to buy back the calls of sell the stock. But it is a reasonable strategy. Good luck.</Msg><Username>myronblender</Username><Timestamp>1359348360170</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 23:46:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359348366315-2114</Id><Topic><Title>I WILL SHORT MORE MORE FIRST THING IN THE MORNING....YAWN</Title><Username>sheepskinner6</Username><Timestamp>1359346451045</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 23:14:11 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You will be broke first thing in the morning !</Msg><Username>A Yahoo!

Great for longs. In August 2012, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase program (“ASR”) with a financial institution to purchase up to $1.95 billion of the Company’s common stock in 2013. In exchange for an up-front payment of $1.95 billion, the financial institution committed to deliver a number of shares during the ASR’s purchase period, which ends later in 2013. The total number of shares ultimately delivered, and therefore the average price paid per share, will be determined at the end of the purchase period based on the volume weighted average price of the Company’s stock during that period. In the first quarter of 2013, 2,582,782 shares were initially delivered to the Company. This does not represent the final number of shares to be delivered under the ASR. These shares were retired and accounted for as a reduction to shareholders’ equity in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company accounted for the ASR as a repurchase of common stock for purposes of calculating earnings per share and as a forward contract indexed to its own common stock which met all of the applicable criteria for equity classification, and, therefore, was not accounted for as a derivative instrument.</Msg><Username>seabow9981</Username><Timestamp>1359348700403</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 23:51:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359348700979-2131</Id><Topic><Title>Apple Stock Halted from trading, pending corporate announcement...</Title><Username>spectate_ulator</Username><Timestamp>1359348154654</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 23:42:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Geee sheepsweener... you sound a little frustrated??</Msg><Username>spectate_ulator</Username><Timestamp>1359348700979</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 23:51:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359348724050-2132</Id><Title>FUNDS SOON TO DUMP AAPL.

That however is not what you have , looking at you being suicidal . Please do not think to do that as it is not worth it. You should learn what not to do in the future. There are other ways to be in the market with relatively less risk than the weekly options . Try 3 to six months contracts if you must . But not weekly.

That is not a safeguard so much as a cash generating possibility. Others have recommended buying puts. This is a safeguard (presumably two contracts to protect your 200 shares), but is also a means to lose money as the stock rises. And figuring out which expiration/strike is kind of guesswork. My recommendation is this, work a "costless collar" using weekly or now you can use two weeks ahead options (I would use the latter because of higher premiums/lower commission costs). To do this, you sell 2 out of the money call contracts. If you use two week expirations, I would say use 20 to 25 point out of the money strikes. Then take the credit you get from those calls you sold and BUY the equivalent value in puts (you can just buy two puts, or may be one that is very close to the money etc) If the stock surges, you don't have to close, your shares will just get called away. If the stock is out to expire with your put position in the money, you need to sell unless you are okay with purchasing 200 more shares. In any event, this is the best way to protect your position without shelling out cash every week. Your only downside is that if the stock does surge 50 points or whatever, you will miss out on the portion that is above your selected strike.</Msg><Username>generalnesta111</Username><Timestamp>1359348856054</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 23:54:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359348880860-2141</Id><Topic><Title>Hey permabears!!

Better, Apple should borrow the money to buy shares. So many answers to the CNBC created malaise we are seeing in the stock price.

Only 2 things can happen the options you sold will go down in price as the stock price moves up and you can buy to close with a profit, or the stock will be put to you if the price drops to the strike price sold; at which time you have lowered your price point by the amount of premium paid to you. You will still collect the divy on the stock you hold while u wait for the stock to move up.
