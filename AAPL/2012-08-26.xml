One brother is poor and lives in Africa. The other is rich and lives in America. One lives in a shanty in a slum in Nairobi on dollars a month. The other lives at the most exclusive address in the world — 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Sound like a fictional Hollywood screenplay, one the Left would eat up? But it gets better. It turns out that the rich American brother made his fortune writing about his own life, and about the father from Kenya he didn’t really know. The poor African brother wrote a book about his own life, too, and about his father he didn’t know. The rich brother is a man the world knows: President Barack Obama. The poor brother is a man the world doesn’t know — George Obama To make this story even richer, it turns out that the wealthy American brother has not bothered to help his poor African brother. Not a bit. Indeed, President Obama has not even bothered to get to know, let alone help, his struggling brother George. The two met briefly when they were younger, back when Barack Obama was searching for his identity and selling what he discovered to an American publisher. At the National Prayer Breakfast this past February, President Obama gave an eloquent speech explaining why his faith informs his desire to serve the public, and why government should play a role in helping the less fortunate among us. This is what he said in front of some of the nation’s most distinguished religious leaders: “But part of that belief comes from my faith in the idea that I am my brother’s keeper and I am my sister’s keeper; that as a country, we rise and fall together.” I guess he was talking about his metaphorical brother. He certainly wasn’t talking about his real-life half brother, George. So why do we know so little about this brother and President Obama’s refusal to help him? Why hasn’t the media covered the story more fully? Can you imagine what fun they’d be having if the poor, estranged brother was Mitt Romney’s? But much more important than the media’s silence is the question why President Obama hasn’t bothered to help his brother George. Even the president’s harshest critics give him credit for being a solid family man and a great father, husband, and role model to his two beautiful daughters. Why doesn’t he want Malia and Sasha to know their uncle? There are several possible explanations. One possible motivation is sheer shame. It is certainly true that George Obama made some bad decisions in his life, decisions that led him to the life he now leads in the slums of Nairobi. He admits to grave mistakes in his youth, to trouble with gangs and alcohol, and attributes much of it to not having a strong male authority in his life. But isn’t this precisely the kind of person President Obama would want to champion, especially if he is related by blood? There may be, however, a more profound reason we don’t know George. One that has more to do with ideology than with pathology. In his book no one has read, Homeland, George Obama has the temerity to suggest that if Barack Obama had been born and raised in Kenya rather than America, the life he has lived would be much different. Being born in the greatest, richest, freest country — one where free markets prevail — has allowed Barack to exercise his talents and achieve greatness. For his new movie, 2016: Obama’s America, Dinesh D’Souza interviewed George. It was remarkable not for what George said about his brother (he had not a single bad thing to say about him) but about the anti-colonial mindset that drove his father and that animated his brother#$%$ book, Dreams from My Father.</Msg><Username>frankster1955a</Username><Timestamp>1345972468961</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 05:14:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345974759432-51</Id><Topic><Title>MIGHT BE HALTED MONDAY MORNING, MOST LIKELY</Title><Username>tamermou</Username><Timestamp>1345947393808</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 22:16:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You guys are light headed...There are certain criteria that must be met.for cases to go to the Supreme Court,,,,Most generally hot button issue decisions that lower courts don''t feel comfortable making....I don't see this being one of those cases.</Msg><Username>snjusnd</Username><Timestamp>1345974759432</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 05:52:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345974947328-52</Id><Title>Mobile phone operators need GigOptix Inc.

Rarely does a jury decision in a patent case get overturned. Judges rulings sometimes do, but when a jury sees all of the evidence and makes their decision, overturning that case by an appeals court would need compelling evidence to the contrary. That evidence does not exist since emails from Samsung clearly demonstrated to all that they intended to copy Apple.

Now that the Apple/Samsung decision will be considered prior case law in the United States, any suits that Apple files against all the other Android devices from other manufacturers can receive summary judgment of infringement, meaning there won't even have to be a case on the guilt, the guilt of infringement will already have been proven by prior case, law, so any Android manufacturer stupid enough to not jut pull their devices and remove all the Apple IP, will be dragged into a courtroom where the judge determined that they are already guilty by Summary Judgment, the defendant COULD NOT BE FOUND INNOCENT. The banning of the import into, or sale within, the United States, of the infringing devices also might be able to be decided by summary judgment based on the Apple/Samsung previous case law. If the banning of the offending Android devices also is decided by summary judgment, the only thing decided in any future Android case might be the total damages each Android manufacturer owes to Apple, while in the meantime they have to pull their devices from the market!

Steve Jobs did more in his short lifetime than most people could ever dream of doing. He was a visionary and he brought his vision to life. Apple, just like Berkshire Hathaway, will be here long after both Steve Jobs and Warren Buffett are gone. The success of their legacy will be measured not only by what they did while the were here, but also by what the did to ensure the continuation of their life's work. So far, you have been completely ignorant of anything Steve Jobs has done to ensure the continuation of Apple. However, all you need to do is look at the success of Apple since October 5, 2011 and you will see that Apple closed that day at $378.25. If you will take a peek at the price today, you will see it at $663.22. That's a whopping $284.97 or about 75% higher since the day Steve Jobs left us. It doesn't sound much like anyone is panicking over there at Apple. Maybe over at Samsung, but certainly not in Cupertino.</Msg><Username>mvp3986</Username><Timestamp>1345989843306</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 10:04:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345989891532-148</Id><Topic><Title>$52 X 16 P/E =$832</Title><Username>michaelmars128</Username><Timestamp>1345948342177</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 22:32:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No it's realistic based on what we can determine to be the turnover rate at which current Iphone users will upgrade to the 5 plus ( possibly 50 million sales)since July 20 China began selling Ipad's. The win against Samsung can increase the Iphone lead dramatically, but they still only have about 5% of the smartphone market world wide. Lastly after Coke I believe the BRAND name of APPLE is probably worth at least 150-200 billion of their market cap and goodwill. I am short Amazon ( with puts) because if Apple had only half the valuation Wall St. gives to Amazon ,Apple shares would be trading at over 5K per shr. And when you compare all the important financial metrics to Apple and Amzn it boggles my mind why any money manager would buy AMZN over APPLE in 2012.....

Yes,,,you can buy these back at a paper loss then sell a Jan 2014 call for $100+ or higher. Yes we suggested this earlier..buying back the Jan $600 call for a $40 profit then selling the Jan 2014 $600 call for $80 which gave you a $720 giveaway.....this trade now has a $200 insurance policy of your principle.

Huge Revenue Increase for APPL. Samsung will post a very large bond on appeal (given the Billion dollar judgment) but IMO, will do so and file an appeal only to support its negotiating position with AAPL. Neither company wants three plus years of uncertainty and costs. APPL can afford this far more than Samsung. WIthin months, Samsung will agree to a very large up-front payment to AAPL perhaps 1/3 of the judgment AND future royalties. Their respective worlds will stabilize and APPL's current and future revenues will increase. RESULT: PPS Increase. 2. Leverage APPL will have significantly increased leverage in negotiations with others who have infringed on its patents. They have "killed the chicken to scare the monkey." The jury verdict against Samsung, which was unequivocal AND upheld APPL patents, places competitors in a different position than before the verdict. IMO, this verdict will result in negotiated agreements within the next 6-12 months (depends on the time it first takes for APPL and Samsung to conclude their settlement) between APPL and Google, Motorola and others to avoid Samsung style litigation. APPL's current and future revenues will increase even more. RESULT: PPS Increase 3. Stability APPL is and continues to be a world leader and innovator. The patents filed in the future by AAPL will be even more aggressively enforced. Those seeking to utilize the newly patented APPL technology in their products (at a minimum those selling in the U.S.) will be more likely to consider some form of contractual royalty to AAPL just part of doing business. APPL's then current and future revenues will increase even more. RESULT: PPS Increase. CONGRATS APPL LONGS. TOO BAD APPL SHORTS. Apple: Better IS Better.</Msg><Username>nohype88</Username><Timestamp>1345993210917</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 11:00:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345993356084-178</Id><Topic><Title>TIM COOK IN A PANIC OVER SALES DROP</Title><Username>fireundersmoke</Username><Timestamp>1345984201511</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 08:30:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Tim is not in a panic that sales fell in China. Chinese are holding off until the iPhone5 in which SIRI can speak Mandarin/Cantonese. It cannot in the 4S version. Also, 4S cannot work with the network of the largest cell phone carrier in China. I think you are referring to the BETA version of SIRI in the iPhone4S as being a failure, but Cook said they were "doubling down" on SIRI, so I think you should wait for the non-test version on the iPhone5 coming out in 4 weeks, before you conclude anything. Given these facts, and the fact that the title of your entry reads like one from the National Enquirer, I would say that you are shorting AAPL stock, and that you are biased. Regarding the iPAD mini, if it has the look and feel of the current fullsize iPAD, then it is not in danger of looking and feeling like the Kindle, which did not copy the iPAD and does not feel like it. Amazon created its own unique product with the Kindle. So again you are saying misleading things.

The economy will continue to suffer in order to bolster the interests of off-shore corporate-financier interests, while the collective prospects of Americans continue to whither and blow away. A vote for Romney, however, will also bring war with Syria, Iran, and eventually Russia and China. The economy will also continue to suffer in order to bolster the interests of off-shore corporate-financier interests, while the collective prospects of Americans continue to whither and blow away. Why? Because the White House is but a public relations front for the corporate-financier interests of Wall Street and London. A change of residence at the White House is no different than say, British Petroleum replacing its spokesman to superficially placate public opinion when in reality the exact same board of directors, overall agenda, and objectives remain firmly in place. Public perception then is managed by, not the primary motivation of, corporate-financier interests. It is the absolute folly to believe that multi-billion dollar corporate-financier interests would subject their collective fate to the whims of the ignorant, uninformed, and essentially powerless voting masses every four years. Instead, what plays out every four years is theater designed to give the general public the illusion that they have some means of addressing their grievances without actually ever changing the prevailing balance of power in any meaningful way. The foreign policy of both Obama and Romney is written by the exact same corporate-financier funded think-tanks that have written the script for America's destiny for the last several decades. Bush = Obama = Romney As was previously reported, while the corporate media focuses on non-issues, and political pundits accentuate petty political rivalries between the "left" and the "right," a look deeper into presidential cabinets and the authors of domestic and foreign policy reveals just how accurate the equation of "Bush = Obama = Romney" is.</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1345998006230</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 12:20:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345998087713-226</Id><Topic><Title>Mobile phone operators need GigOptix Inc.

Samsung verdict is a "landmark" verdict!</Title><Msg>The courthouse victory is a big blow to Google Inc (GOOG), whose Android software powers the Samsung products. The verdict also empowers Apple in filing infringement cases against other Android manufacturers "The jury has now spoken," Cook said in the memo titled "An important day for Apple." "We applaud them for finding Samsung's behavior willful and for sending a loud and clear message that stealing isn't right," Cook said, adding that he hopes "the whole world listens." The verdict, seen by experts as one of the largest in patent history, came as a one-year anniversary present for Cook, who took over the CEO job from late co-founder Steve Jobs exactly a year ago. It also vindicates Cook's long-held position that the company cannot "be the developer for the world." But Samsung warned that the San Jose court's verdict was not "the final word in this case or in battles being waged in courts and tribunals around the world." Apple, meanwhile, said it will move to block sales of Samsung's infringing devices in the United States.</Msg><Username>whoozyurdaddi</Username><Timestamp>1345999958515</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 12:52:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346000076339-275</Id><Title>Experts now say $700 by November 1st</Title><Msg>Were almost there and imo we'll see $700 well before then - maybe next week!</Msg><Username>whoozyurdaddi</Username><Timestamp>1346000076339</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 12:54:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346000146564-276</Id><Topic><Title>Experts now say $700 by November 1st</Title><Username>whoozyurdaddi</Username><Timestamp>1346000076339</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 12:54:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It'll be closer to $750 or $800 by November.</Msg><Username>cramerstrophywife</Username><Timestamp>1346000146564</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 12:55:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346000250447-277</Id><Topic><Title>Guess for Monday opening price here</Title><Username>jeffreysauctions</Username><Timestamp>1345912673583</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 12:37:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Open 678...High of day 686....close 683</Msg><Username>stunato2002</Username><Timestamp>1346000250447</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 12:57:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346000257545-278</Id><Topic><Title>$52 X 16 P/E =$832</Title><Username>michaelmars128</Username><Timestamp>1345948342177</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 22:32:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well that should be a well known fact to anyone on these MB's But APPLE must do something with their cash hoard which is way to large IMHO. They are lucky there's no longer a retained earnings tax! I think they could buy Disney for horizontal integration with another very powerful Global Brand name! Yrs ago when Goog was over $600 and APPLE was about $300 I proposed that Google make an all stock offer of 1-1 swap of APPLE for 1 share of Google . think about that one for a while. I know most of Apples shareholders would have jumped at a virtual double of their shr. price. The DOJ would have green lighted it because Google wasn't in the hardware biz back then they were an advertising company. IMHO there's no reason for APPLE to hoard over 100 billion and not use that money to propel and keep APPLE at the top of the world of global business. That cash hoard is worth about $100 of their shre price just another metric to show how undervalued APPLE is</Msg><Username>michaelmars128</Username><Timestamp>1346000257545</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 12:57:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346000312261-279</Id><Title>UP AT LEAST 35 to 40 POINTS TOMORROW, THIS IS EXTREMELY BIG, RESONNATING WORLWIDE</Title><Msg>This is a jackpot for apple pr, image, competition on the consumer and enterprise worldwide</Msg><Username>tamermou</Username><Timestamp>1346000312261</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 12:58:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346000360640-280</Id><Topic><Title>Why did Apple sued samsung instead of GOOG?</Title><Username>pureinvestor</Username><Timestamp>1345987964831</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 09:32:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Is the same thing like buying and selling stolen parts, it will be a limited profit before legal times arrive.</Msg><Username>bernierosado</Username><Timestamp>1346000360640</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 12:59:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346000443116-281</Id><Topic><Title>Why did Apple sued samsung instead of GOOG?</Title><Username>pureinvestor</Username><Timestamp>1345987964831</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 09:32:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think that Apple is haunting two birds with a single shot.</Msg><Username>bernierosado</Username><Timestamp>1346000443116</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 13:00:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346000465687-282</Id><Topic><Title>Experts now say $700 by November 1st</Title><Username>whoozyurdaddi</Username><Timestamp>1346000076339</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 12:54:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Its at 775 now and the big funds were gone by the time news came out AH.

LTE can support rates to 25 Mb/s to the user, so multiply that by the number of people who’ll buy the next-generation Android and iPhone smartphones and you come up with a lot of data being transferred! GigOptix’s mission is to enable high-speed data communications, whether it is optically, wirelessly, or over copper. We expect high-speed wireless infrastructure to be rolled out to address the forecasted user demand for more bandwidth and we expect E-band technology to play a central role in enabling this revolution. GigOptix Announces Sampling of the New EXO8602ZZ Lange Coupler for High Capacity E-Band Radios SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Mar. 21, 2012-- GigOptix, Inc. (OTCQX: GGOX), a leading fabless supplier of semiconductor and optical components that enable high speed end to end information streaming over the network today announced sample shipments of its EXO8602ZZ, an E-band Lange coupler, to a number of European telecom customers. The EXO8602ZZ is a high performance Lange coupler featuring low insertion loss and is implemented in a small form factor GaAs MMIC die. The solution enables two E-band power amplifiers to be coupled together to substantially increase the output power for E-band Point-to-Point (PtP) radios. The EXO8602ZZ typically provides 1 dB insertion loss and excellent return loss from 71 to 86 GHz. The device can be used for a wide range of applications from defense electronics to commercial E-band PtP communication systems. "We continue to see increasing bandwidth demands in the mobile backhaul from consumers using smartphones and tablets with high speed 4G LTE network connections and GigOptix is excited to release the EXO8602ZZ, our latest E-band solution to help address these needs," stated Padraig O'Mathuna, Vice President of Marketing. "Network operators are now looking to E-band PtP radio links as a means of providing the gigabit and multi-gigabit wireless links to handle this increasing traffic over the mobile backhaul. The EXO8602ZZ solution enables E-band radio manufacturers substantially increase the output power of their E-band radios which translates into the radio being able to transmit more data over a longer distance. EJL Wireless Research, in a recent report, forecast E-band PtP radio links as being one of the fastest growing segment in the wireless mobile backhaul market with better than 100% Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) to 2015. We believe that GigOptix is well positioned with our current E-band product portfolio and development funnel to be a leading component supplier in the high growth E-band market."</Msg><Username>cotyrosense</Username><Timestamp>1346001518247</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 13:18:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346001531159-295</Id><Topic><Title>The next "Microsoft"</Title><Username>technectium</Username><Timestamp>1346000963753</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 13:09:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hey jack off put Msft multiple on Apple's stock and we're looking at 2,000 a share you loser!!!, LMAO!!!!! #$%$</Msg><Username>robpic5</Username><Timestamp>1346001531159</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 13:18:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346001613192-296</Id><Topic><Title>The next "Microsoft"</Title><Username>technectium</Username><Timestamp>1346000963753</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 13:09:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You're not mad, are you?</Msg><Username>mgiuseff</Username><Timestamp>1346001613192</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 13:20:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346001870245-297</Id><Topic><Title>Lawsuit victory is old news by tomorrow.

By Philip Elmer-DeWitt August 25, 2012: 7:58 AM ET Maybe eventually. But Apple is working its way up the food chain, and it's got a full plate FORTUNE -- There was an elephant in the courtroom when Apple (AAPL) won its billion-dollar patent infringement award against Samsung Friday, and its name is Google (GOOG). After all, Google engineers were directly involved in developing at least one of the phones (the Nexus S) found to have infringed Apple's patents, and every one of the accused devices was running Google's Android operating system -- the "stolen product" Steve Jobs had promised two years earlier to destroy. So why hasn't Apple sued Google directly? That's a good question. Clearly Apple made a strategic decision early on to go after the manufacturers of Android hardware -- first HTC, then Motorola, and finally Samsung -- rather than the company that designed their software platform. In retrospect, it was smart move. As Apple laid out its narrative for the jury in its closing arguments Tuesday, the Samsung story was an easy one to tell. Not only had the Korean manufacturer imitated Apple's designs down to the boxes the devices came in, but it left a paper trail that showed the company scrutinizing every aspect of the iPhone touchscreen for ways Apple's design decisions could improve Samsung's products. "The mountain of evidence presented during the trial," Apple CEO Tim Cook told employees after the verdict, "showed that Samsung's copying went far deeper than we knew." Whether Google left a similar paper trail remains to be seen. Moreover, Google can claim, as it did when it was sued by Oracle, that Android doesn't produce any direct revenue for the company, so there can be zero damages. Android may generate billions of ad dollars, but that's a harder story to sell a jury. "It's all about tactics," says FOSS Patents' Florian Mueller. "There's no reason Apple would have to be afraid of suing Google directly. It's just tactically more convenient to go against other device makers." Meanwhile, Apple's legal team has plenty on its plate. One of its first tasks after Friday's big win is to ask for preliminary injunctions that would ban the sale of all of Samsung's infringing devices. A hearing for that request has been scheduled for Sept. 20. Apple may also want to reassert the patents it withdrew to streamline the case and ask the judge to speed up a second suit it filed against Samsung last January that asserts four more patents -- some of which, according to Mueller, are even more powerful than the ones it just won with. There are dozens of Apple v. Samsung cases around the world yet to be decided, not to mention pending suits against HTC and Motorola Mobility, now a wholly owned subsidiary of Google. "Apple's strategy of enforcing patents against other device makers is starting to work out, so it may stay the course," says Mueller. "It could step up its enforcement against Motorola Mobility and later go against Motorola's parent company directly." But, he adds, "If I were in Apple's shoes the next company I would sue is not Google, but Amazon, which has an even weaker patent portfolio than Google and sells large volumes of Android-based devices with a subsidies-centric revenue model, which is even more of a threat to Apple's margins than Google's advertising-based model." amazon..now i had nto considered that.....put it on the menu apple</Msg><Username>faribachicagomed</Username><Timestamp>1346003895414</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 13:58:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346004155314-310</Id><Topic><Title>UP AT LEAST 35 to 40 POINTS TOMORROW, THIS IS EXTREMELY BIG, RESONNATING WORLWIDE</Title><Username>tamermou</Username><Timestamp>1346000312261</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 12:58:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I hear a shorty gonna get creamed on Monday.

Has samsung come out with something unique in phones? I admire Samsung for their beautiful TVs.

Socialism is a philosophy of failure, the creed of ignorance, and the gospel of envy, its inherent virtue is the equal sharing of misery." -- Winston Churchill The following are possibly the 5 best sentences you’ll ever read: Unfortunately, most voters don’t know this. 1. You cannot legislate the poor into prosperity, by legislating the wealthy out of prosperity. 2. What one person receives without working for, another person must work for without receiving. 3. The government cannot give to anybody anything that the government does not first take from somebody else. 4. You cannot multiply wealth by dividing it. 5. When half of the people get the idea that they do not have to work because the other half is going to take care of them; and when the other half gets the idea that it does no good to work, because somebody else is going to get what they work for, that is the beginning of the end of any nation..</Msg><Username>faribachicagomed</Username><Timestamp>1346007939536</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 15:05:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>11</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346007939754-367</Id><Title>YOU ASSDUMP DIARRHEA MOUTHED BASHERS AND SHORTS ....

Yahoo did this when they acquired Overture and they received a settlement, I don't think Apple with a $662B market cap will be seeking a petty settlement, Apple should look to acquire Vringo. Given the latest court ruling where Samsung has used Google’s Android free operating system to build phones that propelled it to the number one spot in the phone market. The Samsung e-mails presented as evidence during the trial included a Feb. 16, 2010, internal message describing minutes from a design meeting that was sent to “pass along only a few comments from Senior Designer Cho who went into the Google meeting yesterday,” according to the message. “Since it is too similar to Apple, make it noticeably different starting with the front side,” according to the message, referring to one of Samsung’s tablets. Steve Jobs didn't live to see the outcome of the bruising war that pitted his iPhone and iPad against mobile devices that use Google's Android software. But he issued the call to arms. "I am going to destroy Android, because it's a stolen product. I'm willing to go to thermonuclear war on this," Jobs told Walter Isaacson, author of a posthumously published biography of the Apple co-founder. "They are scared to death, because they know they are guilty." I strongly feel the Giant in the Room will start beating down the copycats. It is more of a personal issue since it was left in the hands of others now that Steve Jobs is gone. The best way for APPLE to attack is through to the core of the heart of Google by acquiring VRNG and the 420 and 664 patents. We can now see why James Altucher titled his article "Why Google might be going to $0".</Msg><Username>asia2468</Username><Timestamp>1346010476184</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 15:47:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346010538360-401</Id><Topic><Title>Just Like Earnings,All Out of the Money Options</Title><Username>skelfoker</Username><Timestamp>1346010267070</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 15:44:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>All greedy, whimsical Joos.

Out of 4 court cases in 4 countries, only in the U.S. and a brain dead jury, Apple has a victory. The Bounce Back Feature was the only thing I could find at the patent office that Apple could have removed. Nokia patents own almost all the features of the touch screen and some international patents pre-date Nokia. How did Apple build a smartphone without paying Motorola and Nokia a ton of money to license their patents?

None of the patents in the Apple v Samsung case mentioned rectangles of any kind. The trade dress infringement did, but it is a claim of overall similarity, not each feature. Also, there were a slew of patents that Apple holds that Sammy infringed. Nokia has no patents on multitouch, which were what these were mainly about. Finally, Apple DOES, in fact, license some patents from Nokia and will gladly license some of Motorola's FRAND patents if they weren't asking way more from Apple than anyone else pays.

In 1909, a team headed by Fritz Hofmann, working at the Bayer laboratory in Elberfeld, Germany, also succeeded in polymerizing methyl isoprene, the first synthetic rubber.[2] Methyl isoprene is 2,3-dimethylbuta-1,3-diene.[3] The Russian scientist Sergei Vasiljevich Lebedev created the first rubber polymer synthesized from butadiene in 1910. This form of synthetic rubber provided the basis for the first large-scale commercial production, which occurred during World War I as a result of shortages of natural rubber. This early form of synthetic rubber was again replaced with natural rubber after the war ended, but investigations of synthetic rubber continued. Russian American Ivan Ostromislensky did significant early research on synthetic rubber and a couple of monomers in the early 20th century.</Msg><Username>faribachicagomed</Username><Timestamp>1346017602792</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 17:46:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346017617582-468</Id><Topic><Title>Ride this microcap to apple stardom GIG got 10Gbps&amp;up wireless chips that operators need with iphone5</Title><Username>gig.engineer_2012</Username><Timestamp>1345925327118</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 16:08:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Looking to make a huge mint here</Msg><Username>cotyrosense</Username><Timestamp>1346017617582</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 17:46:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346017648861-469</Id><Topic><Title>THE MOST RIDICULOUS VERDICTS ALL THE CENTURY!!!</Title><Username>hana_2828</Username><Timestamp>1346016269152</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 17:24:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Look and design are very important.

Android disruption at a time iPhone 5 is coming out is incredibly positive outcome for AAPL. Combined with Mini iPad announcement, AAPL EPS for 2013 could be increased to $57 per share. However, the tricky part is assigning a suitable PE because AAPL's market cap is so huge (so high growth off large baseline is unsustainable) and AAPL's profit margin is very high especially in iPhone and iPad that also cann't be sustained if still want to maintain high growth and that means it would be very hard to justify a PE of 15 that Google has (GOOG has kind of monopoly on search and no competitor can beat them in the near-term but AAPL's marging could erode any day). That means a forward PE of more than 12-13 becomes risky (if AAPL is given a PE of 15-20, it's understood that one bad news could bring down the stock significantly). And that means AAPL stock is range bound between 684-740. I would be willing to sell it over $720 and find something else to invest in that has higher % potential.</Msg><Username>sm081969</Username><Timestamp>1346018189083</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 17:56:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346018230182-485</Id><Topic><Title>How the verdict will impact Google Mobility</Title><Username>mr_lambu</Username><Timestamp>1346017857242</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 17:50:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I know that pundits (myself included) love to slice and dice the sales and market share numbers, and put the two platforms up against each other, but the truth is that such comparisons really are pretty worthless. Even though that Android and iOS are both mobile platforms, trying to compare the two is like comparing chalk and cheese ... or apples to oranges. There too many differences between the platforms to make comparisons valid. For example: iOS is only offered on two sets of devices (iPhone and iPad) by one company, and it's a tightly controlled platform. Android on the other hand is open and far more diverse. If you're going to buy into the iOS platform, you have to buy into Apple. There's no escaping that fact. With Android people tend to consider the handset maker more than the fact that Google is behind the operating system. There's a lot more perceived choice in the Android market (I say perceived because a lot of it is illusionary and mostly based on branding). With the iPhone or iPad, you either like it, or you don't. Android handsets are available at a greater selection of price points. This is why trying to compare the two platforms is pointless. While you can put Android and iOS data on the same chart, there are just too many differences to make any comparisons or conclusions worthwhile. So, why do I think that iOS will never beat Android in the long game? It's for the same reason that Mac OS never beat Windows - diversity. Sure, Apple will continue to sell millions of devices and make stacks of cash from iPhones and iPads, diversity will always be on the side of Android. And there's a lot of diversity. There's diversity in terms of handset maker, diversity of models, diversity of price, and broad diversity when it comes to OS branding and features (bloat to many of us, but consumers love it). The power of Android is that this diversity allows it to appeal across the board. It's the one feature that iOS cannot emulate. And it's this diversity that will keep Android ahead of the competition. Bottom line, While iOS may be stealing column inches on headlines, always bet on Android!</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1346018230182</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 17:57:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346018270858-486</Id><Topic><Title>Sep Call Option Exit Points before or after iPhone 5 announcement?</Title><Username>db7j</Username><Timestamp>1346017987199</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 17:53:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Take profits before announcement.

Many were surprised that the jury in the San Jose case reached its $1bn decision against Samsung in just three days, despite the complexity of the suit; Groklaw has been gathering up some of the skepticism, pointing to obvious discrepancies in calculating damages – where Samsung had been charged for infringing with devices the jury had already deemed did not, in fact, infringe – as well as post-trial comments by jury members which suggested moral punishment not rightful compensation was the goal. The first points of concern were identified shortly after the initial decision was revealed, with Samsung spotting – among other things – that the Intercept smartphone and Galaxy Tab 10.1 LTE tablet had seen damages awarded despite not actually infringing. That forced a recalculation, dropping more than $2.2m from the overall damages. Potentially more concerning – or good news for Samsung’s appeal, depending on how you look at it – is the jury’s apparent lack of interest in the instructions, which contained 700 questions to be considered. The complexity and number of those questions – spread over a 109 page document [pdf link] – stand in contrast to statements by other legal experts that suggested a “consistent” judgement among jurors and “thoughtful” answers were sufficient to indicate a solid verdict. “If the jury rushed so much it assigned $2 million dollars to Apple, and then had to subtract it because there was no infringement, it raises a valid question: what was the basis for any of the damages figures the jury came up with? If they had any actual basis, how could they goof like this? Was there a factual basis for any of the damages figures?” Groklaw Meanwhile, juror Manuel Ilagan suggested to CNET that the process had been made “faster” based on initial assumptions of prior-art and that the group later realized that each had decided Samsung had infringed “on the first day.” Ilagan mentioned that “the e-mails that went back and forth from Samsung execs about the Apple features that they should incorporate into their devices was pretty damning to me.” Foreman Velvin Hogan also revealed that the jury’s motivation was a message “sufficiently high to be painful [to Samsung], but not unreasonable” rather than “just a slap on the wrist“; that’s despite an note in the instructions making clear that any penalties should be compensation not punishment: “The amount of those damages must be adequate to compensate the patent holder for the infringement. A damages award should put the patent holder in approximately the financial position it would have been in had the infringement not occurred, but in no event may the damages award be less than a reasonable royalty. You should keep in mind that the damages you award are meant to compensate the patent holder and not to punish an infringer” There has been no shortage of opinion and speculation shared about the Apple vs. Samsung outcome, by a wide range of experts. It’s worth noting that Groklaw approaches law with “open-source principles” in keeping with its community support of Linux and the open-source movement; that’s not to say it cannot put together a measured view of Apple’s legal case, of course. Samsung has already confirmed that it intends to first challenge this ruling and, should that process fail, present its case to the Appeals Court. Apple, in the meantime, is aiming for an injunction against multiple Samsung products, with the date for that injunction hearing tentatively set for September 20. Justice Lucy Koh could also opt to as much as triple the jury’s damages decision, to more than $3bn. Still, Samsung isn’t happy even with what legal avenues are open to it. “It’s absolutely the worse scenario for us” an unnamed senior Samsung executive told The Korea Times, with an emergency meeting called between the chiefs of the corporate strategy, mobile device, and marketing divisions. Some patent experts predict Apple will now be less stubborn in its patent cross-licensing negotiations, having left Samsung weakened in the courts, with particular interest in the Korean firm’s 4G LTE technology. LTE is expected to feature in the new iPhone, with Apple having opted to leave it out of models to-date over concerns about 4G battery life.</Msg><Username>aea_k9</Username><Timestamp>1346022129063</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 19:02:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346022270772-543</Id><Topic><Title>Name the Opening price!

I tend to have different philosophies with stocks vs. options. The shorter the duration of the expiration, the more likely I am to just close out the position. I never buy a short term option without some sort of event in mind so much of the strategy revolves around the event. For instance, I have weeklys for Friday based on the court case. I have Sept. monthlies based on the iphone 5 announcement. I also have leaps and stocks that I won't touch. I'll take a break next earnings because I think expectations will still be too high but I'll go in heavy with Q4 earnings. So while I'll close out my Sept. expiration options right around the event, I'll keep everything else longer term.</Msg><Username>ideadirect</Username><Timestamp>1346022439352</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 19:07:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346022463369-549</Id><Topic><Title>The validity of the jury decision in the Apple vs. Samsung patent trial has come under renewed scrutiny,</Title><Username>aea_k9</Username><Timestamp>1346022129063</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 19:02:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nobody cares what you think either Mr. College Degree.</Msg><Username>technectium</Username><Timestamp>1346022463369</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 19:07:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346022526237-550</Id><Topic><Title>The validity of the jury decision in the Apple vs. Samsung patent trial has come under renewed scrutiny,</Title><Username>aea_k9</Username><Timestamp>1346022129063</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 19:02:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>while the content of the article you pasted is ridiculous, the existence of such articles can cast doubt on investors and curb tomorrows rally.

The suit cites infringement of seven patents, including location reminders, e-mail notification, phone/video players, and even Siri voice recognition, according to Motorola. While Motorola has in the past sued Apple for patent infringement, this is the first one filed since Google officially took ownership of Motorola in May. It’s just the latest in a widening war of patent suits, and signals that Google is ready to get tough with its new patent portfolio in Motorola. Google could be trying to change the momentum in a battle that until now made Google’s Android look more vulnerable than Apple’s iOS platform. That’s because Google’s Android system was so young, it had little patent defense against other players. Indeed, Motorola’s 17,000 patents was the big reason Google chose to buy Motorola in the first place. Foss Patents has a good overview of Google’s strategic reasons for this. Notably, the Wall Street Journal is reporting that none of the patents asserted by Motorola in this newest claim is a “standards-essential” patent, which could help Motorola’s case for the ban, if the court finds that infringement did happen. Patents considered standards-essential are ones that courts consider so basically necessary for a given industry that patent-holding companies are required to license them at a fair, reasonable, non-discriminatory prices. However, if patents are not standards-essential, courts don’t require holding companies to license them. However, from Motorola’s statement, it doesn’t appear that Motorola is refusing to license per se: “We would like to settle these patent matters, but Apple’s unwillingness to work out a license leaves us little choice but to defend ourselves and our engineers’ innovations,” Motorola Mobility said in an e-mailed statement to Bloomberg. In a previous case with Motorola, Apple has argued that Motorola’s licensing fee demands are unreasonable. In that case, the ITC ruled that Apple had infringed on one of the four patents asserted by Motorola. In that case, the ITC will make a final decision next week.</Msg><Username>goam100_2000</Username><Timestamp>1346024822800</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 19:47:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346024863722-588</Id><Topic><Title>I just SHHHHHHIIIIIIITTTTTTT my pants!</Title><Username>ui88deddd</Username><Timestamp>1346022311245</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 19:05:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>u are a jackass</Msg><Username>kma412002</Username><Timestamp>1346024863722</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 19:47:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346024882199-589</Id><Topic><Title>How much will Samsung stock open down tomorrow morning in Korea?</Title><Username>bayareabob1</Username><Timestamp>1346022952889</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 19:15:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>8% lower...</Msg><Username>ravens9111</Username><Timestamp>1346024882199</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 19:48:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346024908799-590</Id><Topic><Title>How much will Samsung stock open down tomorrow morning in Korea?</Title><Username>bayareabob1</Username><Timestamp>1346022952889</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 19:15:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Bidding abt 8%down per cnbc</Msg><Username>pandapoo333</Username><Timestamp>1346024908799</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 19:48:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346024913935-591</Id><Title>CNBC: Breaking News:Samsung Shares Set to Open Sharply Lower, Bids Suggest 8% Drop After Apple's Legal Victory</Title><Msg>Oh boy!

Let's hope Judge Koh sends a message to the copycat companies of the world. If the Judge rules favorably for APPLE regarding the Galaxy Tab, then the Judge would be...doing her job and making the right decision if it indeed infringes APPLE's patents (or is virtually identical). Sometime is takes time for justice to prevail. Other times, justice never is delivered. With the financial muscle of APPLE INC., all copycats of the world....have been PUT ON NOTICE. The APPLE legal team is there to protect APPLE's huge investment into R&amp;D and multiple years of effort to create and design amazing products. It is a shame that it took this long for justice to prevail....but, better late than never. It took $amsung ONLY 3 months to BLATANTLY-COPY the iPhone. IN CONTRAST, it took APPLE five (5) years to research and develop the iPhone. $amsung = Blatant Copying THIEF. According to the Jury, $amsung was guilty of WILLFUL INFRINGEMENT (See below) which is grounds for Triple Damages which would equate to $3+ BILLION in damages. To Triple or Not to Triple...will be announced next month. At the same time, a potential FULL BAN (Sales Injunction) of $amsung Products could be implemented. $amsung's reputation is forever tarnished. I expect APPLE to begin purchasing components elsewhere in the future. INVEST in AAPL for the LONG-TERM !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Enhanced Remedies for Willful Infringement What is Willful Infringement? In a patent infringement lawsuit, willful infringement occurs when an infringer intentionally copies a patented invention or continues copying a patented invention after receiving notification of the patent infringement. If a court finds that the patent infringement was willful, it could award the patent holder up to three times the damages determined in court, in addition to attorney’s fees. Factors sometimes used in determining willful infringement include: 1.Whether the infringer blatantly copied the patent, or if the infringer legitimately attempted to design around the patent, 2.After receiving knowledge of the patent, if the infringer developed a good faith belief that the patent was invalid or not infringed 3.After knowledge of patent rights, if the infringer exercised due care to avoid infringement, 4.Whether the infringer received an attorney’s opinion, and 5.How the infringer acted during the litigation. It is important to note that simply finding that there was no “literal infringement” does not absolve a party from liability for willfulness. Enhanced Remedies In normal patent infringement cases, monetary damages are awarded based on the amount of money a patent owner likely lost due to the patent infringement. In the case of willful infringement, the court can enhance monetary awards by up to three times that amount as a type of punishment for the infringer’s egregious actions. A court is also allowed to award attorney’s fees and costs to reimburse the patent owner for the expenses involved in litigation.</Msg><Username>white_knight_in_texas</Username><Timestamp>1346025054862</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 19:50:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346025148750-596</Id><Title>Dear Shorts and Bashers!

Thankfully there is still a premium awarded for innovation and intellectual property.</Msg><Username>bayareabob1</Username><Timestamp>1346025688167</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 20:01:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346025716672-613</Id><Title>SAMSUNG OPENS DOWN 6%!!!!!</Title><Msg>DISASTER FOR THEM</Msg><Username>jeffreysauctions</Username><Timestamp>1346025716672</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 20:01:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346025719854-614</Id><Topic><Title>Not now not ever again will I buy an Apple product</Title><Username>wilddogpicker</Username><Timestamp>1346023942738</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 19:32:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Appeals are virtually impossible to overturn.

I'm tired of reading all these posts from whiners about consumers loosing. Before the iPhone, Samsung was not even really in the smartphone business. After the iPhone they looked at their product line and said we can't compete with the iPhone so let's copy it and offer it at a cheaper price. That is what Samsung did and there is little disputing that. And now we are seeing these whiny posts. Get over it. Samsung could have spent the effort to create their own look and feel of the phone and user experience but they did not, the just copied the iPhone. Microsoft spend years and millions in R&amp;D to create a Windows mobile phone.. they just didn't copy Apple. You don't see Apple suing Microsoft for the Windows mobile phone or Blackberry or Motorola. They are protecting their R&amp;D like ALL companies do. Apple is no more or less evil than any other company and if Apple had copied Samsung, Samsung would have sued Apple and deservedly won. Samsung is welcome to create smartphone products but they should be original and of their own design, not a copy of Apply, Microsoft or anyone else. And anyone who thinks Apple copied anyone else on the iPhone is an idiot. There was nothing like the iPhone before it came out. Most people thought it would be a flop. It was completely different that anything before it, not like Palm or Blackberry or Motorola or Nokia or anything else. It changed the smartphone market, helped define it. So if you don't like Apple or it's products then speak with your wallet and buy something else. No one is forcing you to buy an Apple product so don't. Apple is not going to change their prices because of this verdict and there are still multiple alternatives to the iPhone and other Apple products so buy them.</Msg><Username>acadia83</Username><Timestamp>1346026969879</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 20:22:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346027083038-645</Id><Topic><Title>$700 open for Apple likely-thats only a 5% move</Title><Username>jeffreysauctions</Username><Timestamp>1346026856883</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 20:20:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A 5% move is being consrvative.

Thanks Docpro, Fariba, Aiwal1, etc. etc. What causes an Innovative Society? Easy Answer: History has already given us the answer - and that answer is FREEDOM. For 5,000 years, this world we live in...was in the Horse &amp; Buggy Era, like the old Middle Ages. Some countries haven't changed in the Middle East...even now. People in many countries have (or had) despot dictators on their backs, or monarchs stealing from them, or communal-type living that left people stagnate with little motivation but the status quo. THEN, the founders of the United States wrote a constitution that UNLEASHED FREEDOM, IMAGINATION, INVENTIVENESS -- and, in ONLY 236 years, the world was pulled out of the Horse &amp; Buggy Era, which had trapped the human race for 5,000 years. There are so many very important US inventions: Telephone, Electricity, the Light Bulb, the Combine for Harvesting, Computers, etc...that came from American inventors. If a society has a despot dictator, monarch or central government that does not RESPECT and ADHERE to the RULE OF LAW, then --- what motivation is there to INVENT and PATENT anything? Your hard work would be simply stolen. I wish to recommend a book called The 5,000 Year Leap. Ronald Reagan recommended that it be taught in all public High Schools. FREEDOM is not a Left, Right or Centrist Idea... FREEDOM is desired by every human being in the world. And, given the FREEDOM to CREATE and INVENT...along with an environment in which there are laws that will PROTECT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, a society will flourish -- just as it has done in the USA. Amazing inventions by American inventors have changed the world. However, during the past 4 years, much government regulation has interfered with the Private Sector's ability to conduct FREE enterprise. Some regulation is needed, but... too much will stifle the FREE environment that has enabled the USA to thrive. In the book referenced above, it is recommended that the Burden of Debt be AVOIDED. Over-spending by the US Government is the wrong direction. A small, limited government made the USA an economic superpower; BUT....a large, bloated government could drag us down the path of Greece. Whether we like it not, economics and politics DO INTERSECT.

I guess to make this statement you read the trial transcript. I mean in such a complicated trial you couldn't be saying this from intuition. So what are the legal points you feel will be argued? Of course you understand that in order for an appeal to be considered the objection needs to be more than sour grapes. They won't accept aapl sucks and Samsung rules and sour or disdainful faces don't seem to have effect. Neither does saying nenee nanew and holding your breath seem to work. Do tell me from your vast legal experience how can Samsung gain the right to appeal. I'm sure they'd have an argument but you must have one to make the statement you made.

Easy Answer: History has already given us the answer - and that answer is FREEDOM. For 5,000 years, this world we live in...was in the Horse &amp; Buggy Era, like the old Middle Ages. Some countries haven't changed in the Middle East...even now. People in many countries have (or had) despot dictators on their backs, or monarchs stealing from them, or communal-type living that left people stagnate with little motivation but the status quo. THEN, the founders of the United States wrote a constitution that UNLEASHED FREEDOM, IMAGINATION, INVENTIVENESS -- and, in ONLY 236 years, the world was pulled out of the Horse &amp; Buggy Era, which had trapped the human race for 5,000 years. There are so many very important US inventions: Telephone, Electricity, the Light Bulb, the Combine for Harvesting, Computers, etc...that came from American inventors. If a society has a despot dictator, monarch or central government that does not RESPECT and ADHERE to the RULE OF LAW, then --- what motivation is there to INVENT and PATENT anything? Your hard work would be simply stolen. I wish to recommend a book called The 5,000 Year Leap. Ronald Reagan recommended that it be taught in all public High Schools. FREEDOM is not a Left, Right or Centrist Idea... FREEDOM is desired by every human being in the world. And, given the FREEDOM to CREATE and INVENT...along with an environment in which there are laws that will PROTECT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, a society will flourish -- just as it has done in the USA. Amazing inventions by American inventors have changed the world. Is FREEDOM increasing or decreasing in the USA? During the past 4 years, much government regulation has interfered with the Private Sector's ability to conduct FREE enterprise. Some regulation is needed, but... too much will stifle the FREE environment that has enabled the USA to thrive. In the book referenced above, it is recommended that the Burden of Debt be AVOIDED. Over-spending by the US Government is the wrong direction. A small, limited government made the USA an economic superpower; BUT....a large, bloated government saddled with debt could drag us down the path of Greece. Whether we like it not, economics and politics DO INTERSECT. INVEST in AAPL for the LONG-TERM !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</Msg><Username>white_knight_in_texas</Username><Timestamp>1346031444428</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 21:37:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346031446060-762</Id><Title>Samsung needs to learn a hard lesson</Title><Msg>Chinese manufacturals can start make and rebrand Samsung HDTV and sell them to Korean for half price.

Point well-taken! The US Gov't has built huge infrastructure projects and funded needed research in key areas in which the Private Sector has not moved forward. Typically though, the Private Sector will work circles around a Government Bureaucrat. Why is this so typical? ...I believe the salaried Government Bureaucrat lacks the motivation to CREATE, INVENT and PROFIT that the Private Sector Entrepreneur possesses at the core of his/her being. The Government Bureaucrat gets paid...regardless of whether the invention, e.g. - is a success or a flop. IN CONTRAST, the Private Sector Entrepreneur is very motivated to invent the RIGHT PRODUCT FOR THE MARKETPLACE -- that is needed ---- or, the product will not be "marketable". Therefore, there is EXTREME MOTIVATION at the core of the Private Sector Entrepreneur ...versus... the Government Bureaucrat. RE: Owe-Bama's "you didn't build it" statement --- In a macro view, the Government may have provided the infrastructure, but....there is a LOT OF WORK involved in building a Business. The Private Sector Entrepreneur must deal with competitors, rising energy costs due to NO ENERGY POLICY FOR INDEPENDENCE IN THE USA, regulations of gov't entities, reporting to various tax jurisdictions, advertising/marketing, employees, huge tax burden, etc. etc. Unless a person has owned a business, it's hard to have empathy. And, it's clear that Owe-Bama has no empathy and no clue about what it would take to own a business. On a side note, I think that any person running for President of the USA should be required to have taken at least an ECONOMICS 101 course --- so that they at least learn the Law of Supply &amp; Demand, e.g. - Less Supply of Energy = Rising Costs to Americans.</Msg><Username>white_knight_in_texas</Username><Timestamp>1346034303853</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 22:25:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346034335597-818</Id><Topic><Title>Samsung Electronics Getting Dumped big time by the Ma n Pa Samsungs...Whooo Hoooo</Title><Username>lord_chatterly</Username><Timestamp>1346033106470</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 22:05:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>samdung is going to fall more for rest of day...more than 10% loss is expected today....</Msg><Username>tendulrocks</Username><Timestamp>1346034335597</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 22:25:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346034482281-819</Id><Topic><Title>SHORTIES...

Why? Apple makes a profit margin that is 4 times Samsung. Also, this is just one Android product. Apple is entitled to royalties on ALL Androids and a agreement with Apple will soon be signed by Google is my guess. And then theres the injunction thats coming on 9/20. This will affect almost every Samsung product. They are gonna have to go back and make hanges to all their products so that they dont violate patents.

By Aabha Rathee | More Articles August 26, 2012 A survey by Robert W. Baird analyst William Power has found an extremely strong customer demand for the next-generation iPhone, which Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is rumored to be announcing in an event on September 12. Power surveyed 2,000 U.S. Internet users and found that 45 percent of those wireless subscribers who were currently eligible for a handset upgrade intended to buy an iPhone next. While 31 percent were undecided on their next device, only 22 percent said they planned to buy a Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) Android phone. Don’t Miss: This Retailer is Offering iPhones for a STEAL. Power concluded that the high demand could lead to unit sales of more than 50 million for the sixth-generation Apple smartphone in the U.S. alone, which would be “well above current forecasts.” However, the analyst felt the high number of eligible upgrades could pressure margins for U.S. wireless carriers in the third and fourth quarters of the year. “AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) appears to have the highest exposure among the iPhone carriers, with 42 percent of surveyed subscribers currently eligible,” Power wrote in a note on Thursday. Users are hoping for the new iPhone to have a longer battery life, 4G LTE support, improved functionality for the Siri voice technology, a better back camera, and a larger screen, the analyst found. Seventy-seven percent of current iPhone users plan to stay loyal to the brand, while 5 percent are planning to make the switch to Android. Among Android users, 48 percent plan to buy another Android phone next, while 17 percent are considering switching to an iPhone. Samsung topped the list of preferred Android handsets and was followed, in that order, by HTC, Motorola, and LG. Of current Research In Motion (NASDAQ:RIMM) users, only 2 percent plan to buy another BlackBerry. Interestingly, while 51 percent of those surveyed said they would be interested in a fictional Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) phone, only 7 percent expressed any sort of interest in a possible Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) smartphone.</Msg><Username>red_herring33</Username><Timestamp>1346035553262</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 22:45:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346035575279-837</Id><Topic><Title>Looks like down day tomorrow</Title><Username>musichead2005</Username><Timestamp>1346035289125</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 22:41:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sure and you went long just before the close on Friday.</Msg><Username>hairtriggerdiarrhea</Username><Timestamp>1346035575279</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 22:46:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346035590350-838</Id><Title>Yes....</Title><Msg>This is EPIC...relax longs, and enjoy!!!</Msg><Username>daleschre</Username><Timestamp>1346035590350</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 22:46:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346035606627-839</Id><Title>FISH-EYED GRASS-Hopper's LAST inovation was...

Buy and hold has worked with Apple, but being on the right side of the trade is key when investing in option strategies. GLTA and looking forward to tomorrow!</Msg><Username>santacruzmogul</Username><Timestamp>1346037036330</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 23:10:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346037164831-861</Id><Topic><Title>Samsung Electronics Getting Dumped big time by the Ma n Pa Samsungs...Whooo Hoooo</Title><Username>lord_chatterly</Username><Timestamp>1346033106470</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 22:05:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Absolutely huge volume...already twice the daily average...and it's early yet, too, folks.
