Skype is another matter. I use Yahoo offshore and Google here in the USA. Skype is very good quality. The old boards had the messenger icon displayed attached to the posters post and if you wanted you could use that rather than open chat on the message boards like we are doing.

Its not a question of fighting litigation, its a matter of whether the litigation is legitimate and a judgement enforceable.

No! Not even in Mexico. You'd be surprised as the usuage is around 60% in central MN, heard it from a Yellow Pages district manager herself, a few months ago. The Twin Cities metro is 30% I think, which is more normal IMO. That being said Yellow Pages, Dex One, Supermedia offer far more than that. The offer print ads, online ads, online websites, SEO(search engine optimization) and do it through Google, Bing and Yahoo. Yahoo handles the big corporations but those 3rd parties get the mom and pop businesses. I remember RIMM was sued for a patent violation that could have crippled the company and that was settled for $455-500M or something with royalties...this, a non-patent situation by a small subsidiary will not be worth billions IMO. I say $100M+ max. As for the share price that could have some more whipsaw action if Yahoo buys back more stock. If you watch the stock movement, it always seems to recover and end the day flat. I do think people will be looking to take profits from its straight run.</Msg><Username>hotmodeltestid122</Username><Timestamp>1354469441886</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-02 12:30:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354470075821-46</Id><Topic><Title>#$%$?</Title><Username>randybentwick</Username><Timestamp>1354402130261</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-01 17:48:50 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yea, it's the same thing, just incredibly awkward.

THE SUNDAY SIZEUP Good Afternoon, Bonsoir, Guten Abend, Buona Sera, Konichiwa, Readers, DuPont's sleazy top executives and their amoral army of PR con artists and little in-house lawyers from little known schools are so accustomed to cheating and lying their way out of every issue confronting this corrupt conglomerate, they continue their lying even after a federal district court judge has ruled against them! On Friday, Nov. 30, 2012 Judge Richard Wright who has presided over the trial involving DuPont's theft of Monsanto patent technology, unsealed his ruling from last December to keep the defendant DuPont and its corrupt bosses from continuing to lie and DEFRAUD the public and investors: "The public is entitled to a full disclosure of defendant's [DuPont's] fraud..." DuPont Senior Management's outrageous PR response? Basking in conspicuous self-adulation, they fire off another FRAUDULENT claim: "DuPont, its employees, and its counsel throughout this litigation have adhered to the highest ethical standards. All of the Company's representations to the court or the public regarding its claims in this case have been accurate." WHAT?? Dirty-playing DuPont execs are essentially heaping derision on Judge Wright and calling him a "liar." Investors, ask yourself: What kind of thugs and goons are running this Delaware-based chemical conglomerate corrupt to the core? This brazen executive misconduct and unethical behaviour cannot possibly be good for the stock of DuPont!

The rule here is that it is far better to negotiate than litigate. Here’s why. The Court Procedures in Mexico are very different. In the U.S. and Canada, the plaintiff’s lawyer files a complaint and the defendant’s lawyer files a response. The two attorneys go through the process of "discovery" and then the case is argued before a judge (and jury) using evidence and witnesses. A decision is made and “awards” are made which can be significant, including costs, damages, special damages and punitive damages. In Mexico, the plaintiff files a complaint providing written evidence with supporting documents and statements from witnesses. The defendant files a response, again in writing, with supporting documentation and witness statements. The judge reviews the submissions, asks for more evidence if he deems it necessary, and then renders a decision. There is no discovery process and lawyers are not allowed to be present when either party or witnesses are called in to make statements. Based on the decision, awards are made for damages but they are much smaller. There are no special or punitive damages and each party pays their own fees and costs. Litigation is expensive, a long process and judgments are often difficult to enforce, even against a solvent defendant. Judgments can be contested in a separate “Amparo” proceeding which can take several years. An “Interlocutory Appeal” can be lodged during the proceeding which will also lengthen the process (and the cost).

If you read the best investment analysis you will find that share buybacks are the worst possible use of cash unless the company has no better ways to use it. Cisco buys back shares at a lower cash rate than they use cash to buy companies - in fact every comapny does - do you really think that Google is deserving a lower PE than YHOO? I woulds like to know where Yahoo will grow...how it will be done....when it will be done....how much the bottom line will benefit from the growth...e very other company can tell you....right now you are trusting big hedge funds to be looking out for YOU - they are not. They will cover their shares with puts and will sell their holdings as fast as they bought them - and as secretly....at themoment all of the buybacks do is pad the pockets of the recently hired execs who have millions of shares in options....note - Yahoo ISSUES shares when they issue options and then they reduce shares by buying them back - in effect Yahoo is buying up their own options.

Perhaps some consolidation in the stock was going on as I expect there to be a slight 1.5 to 2% selloff in the open based upon the initial ruling in Mexico. I believe that was for 2.7B It is no doubt a large sum but let us not forget the due process/legal process is quite different in other countries than our own. I'm in Jan 17.5 and 19 calls but do believe Monday would be a nice day to average down. I'm convinced the opportunity should last for several days. As for why Meyer isnt saying anything-she doesnt need to at this point. Things will be fine for this very solid company with great prospects and solid leadership. I would not worry although we will see a little blip for a bit so shorts that got in at 19.15/19.16 you'll make out decent but dont gloat too much as we'll get you within the month for sure and definitely by the turn of the new year with ease.</Msg><Username>anuandamit</Username><Timestamp>1354491914477</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-02 18:45:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354492089835-97</Id><Topic><Title>I do think the CEO needs to come out before the market opens with guidance</Title><Username>optionstrader4u</Username><Timestamp>1354485250410</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-02 16:54:10 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I really dont think it's needed. yahoo as a company may issue a statement later but has issued something to the effect that there is no merit in the charge. we'll be fine as I hope you are not in weekly options but dec or Jan calls as you'll be fine.</Msg><Username>anuandamit</Username><Timestamp>1354492089835</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-02 18:48:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354492171931-98</Id><Title>Yhoo should give us news that get the market excited</Title><Msg>Convincing positive guidance, deal status of YHOO Japan stakes, any news of Alibaba IPO scheduled for next year, or any major partnership that significantly impact revenue positively or any major news that will excite the market.</Msg><Username>goingbravo</Username><Timestamp>1354492171931</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-02 18:49:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354492287568-99</Id><Topic><Title>Tiger Global also likes Potential Buyout Candidate, Yahoo!</Title><Username>xetra72</Username><Timestamp>1353523529507</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 13:45:29 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Would be very nice but I doubt anytime in the next 6-12 months until we see more evidence of earnings growth acceleration.

In both situations, we saw enormous growth. While the automobile industry slowed down, there was still a lot of profit to go around. The biggest players traded the top spot throughout the years and decades. The same will happen with Internet-related companies, such as Yahoo, Google, Amazon, and Facebook. It’s difficult to see Yahoo competing with some of these names, but they have plenty of firepower (i.e., cash) at their disposal. All they need now is a little innovation, especially with mobile and social. Yahoo’s long-term prospects are superb. Therefore, Yahoo is a long-term OUTPERFORM.</Msg><Username>b.coogan</Username><Timestamp>1354508559151</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-02 23:22:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354509069665-124</Id><Topic><Title>Alibaba's Tmall Will Overtake Amazon as the World's Biggest Ecommerce Site by 2015</Title><Username>bflathalfdim</Username><Timestamp>1354226559645</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 17:02:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I bought Yahoo for Alibaba Group.</Msg><Username>tarordble</Username><Timestamp>1354509069665</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-02 23:31:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354509112119-125</Id><Topic><Title>Buy Yahoo if the dips make Yahoo dip in the AM</Title><Username>theecoldone</Username><Timestamp>1354494885963</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-02 19:34:45 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'll buy Yahoo if it dips in the morning.</Msg><Username>tarordble</Username><Timestamp>1354509112119</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-02 23:31:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354509466510-126</Id><Topic><Title>Article from Forbes posted on Alibaba's investor relations site...</Title><Username>optionstrader4u</Username><Timestamp>1354503730048</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-02 22:02:10 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Not a clue on the big surprise.
