I continue to own shares of Apple, and based on the information available today, believe that Apple's best days are ahead of it. The iPhone 5 will reinforce Apple's lead in the smartphone industry (at least in terms of profitability). The iPad leads the tablet market, with 69.6% market share in Q2 2012, per data from iSuppli. And should Apple launch an Apple TV (or iTV), this will represent an entirely new line of business, one with significant revenue and profit opportunities.</Msg><Username>sun_wind2011</Username><Timestamp>1348301284375</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 04:08:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348301699208-23</Id><Topic><Title>SHORT FUNDS KEEP SHORTING AAPL OUT OF OBSESSION AND TO AVERAGE DOWN.

Should they happen. I dont think they should yet, but aapl does not trade like a normal stock. If you look at aapl growth rate, does the forward pe represent this. Hell no, it is at a substantial discount for the business it currently has. People spout law of big numbers, competition, etc. These are what keeps aapl depressed and allows manipulation and the aapl stock community has now unfortunately accepted this. What is in play now. A Great q4, a great q1 (holiday qtr), release of the mini ipad, and when does china mobile happen. I would love for a q1, but my guess is q2 (JAN-MAR). Here is why. Supply. I dont think there is enough supply to handle normal holiday demand and whatever number you want to put on the 700 million chinese on china mobile. 10% would be 70M, ie larger than the holiday qtr. This would pop the stock $75-$100. Based on the breakdown of the I5 and the qualcomm chip that is in there, it is not a matter of if, but when. Stole that from an article. So you see, the odds to me are that it reaches $900 before it ever has a chance to drop to $650. I do understand that 650 is less than 10% drop so certainly other market forces can move it down. If it does. I would load up as much as possible. Note China Mobile may occur later than q2. Long and Strong baby. ps CM is why I always have some type of option call going. Now I have the NOV 700 calls. I wIll be looking to extend this much farther out depending on prices to June 13 and Jan 14.</Msg><Username>hounddog86zz</Username><Timestamp>1348316051571</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 08:14:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348316384592-44</Id><Topic><Title>This is the Earnings RUN...</Title><Username>biglefthook_00</Username><Timestamp>1348315445056</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 08:04:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>this is not the earnings run. This is an earlier release than expected. Prior when the stock was beaten back a bit, the release was expected to be Oct, and when rumors became more concrete of a sept 21 release of I5, the stock moved. So is a product move, that helps earnings, but is not the earnings move yet. That averages around 2-3 weeks prior to earnings, so we are a bit early for that. Could be part, but not likely. I think 700 is a number the analysts want to play around with. Hope to see some big movement to $750-$775 around earnings in Oct. when we have earnings and some guidance for holiday.</Msg><Username>hounddog86zz</Username><Timestamp>1348316384592</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 08:19:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348316524304-45</Id><Topic><Title>Read the numerous stories of short lines and go short Monday. $500 by November.</Title><Username>rimmbberry</Username><Timestamp>1348304901162</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 05:08:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>lines were only short after the I5 sold out.

Waiting to reload as Apple tanks on schedule. Even after great 2nd qtr earnings, Apple fell from an alltime high 122 points. People were predicting under 500 and lower. Gary Kaminsky came on CNBC and brought another analyst who said everyone already has Apple and they dont need a new Apple. Another #$%$ Same with all the other losers on CNBC. Now we go down to 570 or lower. 522 could be retested also. We could have a super selloff into earnings too. So the market could tank 2000 points. All this rally is based on qe3. So profits could be down and the economic data keeps dropping. Also, if Obama gets relected... we could get big volatility. I think people really love and want Obama. People know he is going to get relected and the market has been going up big. But it could trigger a big move. Apple to tank big and come back towards earnings after January 1, 2013 like last year. If you can get mid 500s or evern below 600 that would be great. Even if it drops to 500 and you bought at 600, it will come back. But best to buy at or near the low.

I saw an article yesterday projecting China would come along over the next 3 months. Claim was that only regulatory approval stood in the way. Of course that could be a big deal, but the Chinese government may be motivated to keep Apple churning and their own national employees earning. Further, I don't think China will side with South Korean company Samsung about patent claims but that's just my conjecture. Too much demand overwhelming production is a problem, for sure, and for a cash-strapped company can be quite damaging. But if Apple's going to have a problem, that seems like the one to have.

You can save all of your visiting cards, movie tickets, retail coupons, loyalty cards and even your boarding pass in Passbook. They get updated automatically. Whenever you enter an airport, your boarding pass automatically opens up so that you don’t have to waste time doing it manually and the same goes for movie tickets when you enter a movie theater. If this doesn’t impress you, perhaps the news that credit card company, American Express is launching integration with it today! Even though details on recent transactions are updated, you still can’t pay with American Express using the Apple Inc (AAPL)’s Passbook. The updates occur because of real-time notifications, which also enable American Express to have two-way dialogues with its customers. For blind customers, real-time transaction information can be spoken out loud. This way, they can verify the amount to make sure it was authorized. With the help of real time alerts, any suspicious transactions can be caught. The alert will require the user to enter their PIN to verify the transaction. Another way of verifying is by checking whether the merchant and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s SmartPhones are in the same location. This can catch any clear cases of frauds where a transaction has occurred in Mexico, but the phone was in New York. You can recall what Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) did to the music industry and imagine what the popularity of Passbook could eventually lead to. It is still a matter of time because there are several other credit card companies out there and a few more major names in the industry need to join in to have a significant impact</Msg><Username>israelmichel</Username><Timestamp>1348329634464</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 12:00:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348329740058-134</Id><Topic><Title>options chain</Title><Username>stock02</Username><Timestamp>881624388000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 1997-12-08 18:39:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>From 15 years ago.

Have you noticed bagholder, telaviv76, aea (many of them), have all disappeared from the scene. Some have become desperate and abusive others have gone cynical and krazy, others continue to be snobbish and racist. Howerver there is nothing a good dose of some kind of medicine cannot solve. The krazy, cynical, snobbish, racist should set up some time with their health care provider(s) instead of taking out their frustration on us. Please continue to follow a simple principal "buy and hold buy and hold". If you want to diversify then you may want to buy a tech. mutual fund with aapl as a core holding. Meanwhile demand for 5i is so great whether in New York, Chicago, Sydney, Tokyo etc. or any other part of the world. SHALOM!

The changes are being considered by Dow owner Stndard &amp; Poor's because the index is supposed to be a measure of U.S. industrial titans but doesn't include Apple Inc [s:aapl], Google Inc. [s:goog] or Berkshire Hathaway Inc. [s:brk.a], the Financial Times reported, noting they are three of the largest U.S. companies. There would be problems adding them to the Dow bedause they would dominate the 30-stock index that's weighted by price, the FT said. David Blitzer, chairman of the index committee for S&amp;P DJ Indices, said the issue is being discussed, the FT reported.

Apple’s iPhone 5 is an improvement over its predecessor. It’s thinner, taller and lighter (all the things I want to be), it has a bigger screen, a faster processor and it can use the cellular carriers’ faster LTE networks. But, at the end of the day, it’s just a phone and mostly an incremental improvement over the iPhone 4s. Yes, it does feel good in your hand and yes it’s lighter, but I don’t recall too many people complaining about the weight and bulk of the old iPhone. To some extent, I miss the “heft” of the iPhone 4s, which also feels good in my hand. Also, the 4s fits nicely into my pocket and even though it weighs just under an ounce more than the iPhone 5, it’s hardly what I’d call a heavyweight. As far as I can tell, the only significant feature upgrades are the larger screen and the ability use LTE networks. The phone is a little faster, but the iPhone 4s is still plenty fast. LTE does download apps and load websites faster, but even this needs to be put into perspective. First, it’s only an advantage if you’re not on a WiFi network (I download most of my apps when I’m connected to my home network) and even if you do have to download something at 3G speeds, its still pretty quick. As for web surfing — remember you’re looking at a small cell phone screen so you’re not generally loading a lot of data when you hit websites. It will make a big difference when streaming video but unless you have an unlimited data plan, you may wind up having to avoid that little pleasure anyway. As for the larger screen — I agree it’s an improvement. But somehow I managed to love my old iPhone with its smaller screen and though I like the new screen better, it’s not a major game changer. In my side-by-side comparisons between a iPhone 5 using Verizon’s LTE network and an iPhone 4s on Sprint’s 3G network, I did notice a difference loading websites, but it wasn’t earth shaking. You can “upgrade” your old iPhone with iOS 6</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1348344801306</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 16:13:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348344892489-232</Id><Topic><Title>The reason for so many shorts on the board is because they are using free wifi outside starbucks in their car becuase they lost all their money.

Cover your shorts</Title><Msg>It was possible to walk into a store Saturday and buy an iPhone 5. But it took some hunting. Some stores reported having Apple's newest phone available for walk-up customers, though not all versions of it. A random check of about a dozen stores indicated that most were sold out. A Verizon store in New York City said the 32 and 64 gigabyte models, but not the 16 GB version, were available. A Sprint store in a suburb of St. Paul, Minn., said all but the most expensive 64 GB iPhone 5s were sold out. "Before we were even scheduled to open, we were pretty much out," said Eric Rayburn, a worker at a Sprint store in Phoenix. The iPhone 5 went on sale Friday, igniting intense interest around the world. Apple's website said phones bought online would ship in three to four weeks. Verizon's website said they would ship by Oct. 19. It's hardly uncommon for supply shortages to make it difficult to get new iPhones in the first days after their release. For Apple, the iPhone introduction is the biggest revenue driver of the year. Analysts say the company will likely sell millions of phones in the first few days. There were long lines Friday at Apple's stores in Asia, Europe and North America as customers pursued the new smartphone. Apple and the phone companies haven't provided sales figures from the first day. Apple is expected to announce early results Monday. Last year, Apple said on the Monday after the launch of the iPhone 4S that it had sold 4 million in the first three days.</Msg><Username>israelmichel</Username><Timestamp>1348345461508</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 16:24:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348345771336-238</Id><Topic><Title>THE RETURN LINES ARE BIGGER THAN THE PURCHASE LINES....ROTFLMFAO</Title><Username>bagholder_13</Username><Timestamp>1348345123097</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 16:18:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Do not see anyone returning after one day.

This product is expected to change the way people use and look at rubber dog #$%$. Apple's CEO was excited about the new product and said "this will really get people to part with their money to get their hands on this #$%$". Although no annoucement has been made yet on a follow up product, insiders say that Apple Rubber Dog #$%$ 4.0 is in the works and will probably be priced similar to the #$%$ 3.0 at which time #$%$ 3.0 won't be worth #$%$. Some bloggers were able to get the first looks at the highly anticipated Apple Rubber Dog #$%$ and most comments were overwhelmingly positive. Brad Michaels of Tech #$%$ says 'people will really be suprised by this #$%$, it like nothing I have ever seen. And its lighter and easier to use than any other #$%$ I have seen" People are expected to line up early and pre-order the new #$%$. One customer who plans on getting in early said "If Apple makes the best Rubber Dog #$%$, I've got to have it. I will be the coolest person with my Hollister shirt, Abercrombie pants, and the new Apple Rubber Dog #$%$ 3.0." Apple expects to expand its Rubber Dog #$%$ line in the coming years because Apple surveys have shown that people buy all kinds of #$%$ no matter what the cost. A New York marketing Exec said "Apple has show that people will part with their money to get #$%$ and any kind of #$%$ after that regardless of cost. Somehow overspending repeatedly makes the younger generation of this society feel important and good about themselves; that makes for some weird #$%$" Samsung is expected to follow with some rubber dog #$%$ of its own but at press time no details were available.</Msg><Username>wbobeli</Username><Timestamp>1348348004015</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 17:06:44

IPhone 5s?? What does that "S" stand for anyway? S = Suckers! or Stupid! Now that it is clear IPhone 5 is a flop Apple wants more money from Samsung. That's the only way Apple knows how to make money these days. Suing for "rectangles". What a joke. Samsung will take a HUGE chunk of the IPhone5 sales profit from LTE patent violation by Apple.

By Sascha Segan September 21, 2012 04:30pm EST The iPhone 5 looks to be the fastest smartphone we've ever tested at PC Magazine With its mysterious, Apple-designed A6 processor, the iPhone 5 is unique in the world of smartphones. Most high-end phones nowadays run on one of two architectures: ARM's Cortex-A9, which is used by Nvidia, Texas Instruments and others, and Qualcomm's Krait. But the A6, as AnandTech discovered, is something completely different—an ARM-compatible system-on-a-chip designed, top to bottom, by Apple. We'll focus on five tests here. First the browser benchmarks: Sunspider, Browsermark, and Guimark 3 Bitmap all test Web browser performance. Sunspider is about JavaScript, Guimark is about interactive HTML5, and Browsermark is an overall browser benchmark. Different browsers will score differently on the same phone. We test with the default browser, because that's what most people use. (Since you're wondering about Chrome, which is an optional download on Android phones, it gives similar Browsermark results to the default browser on the Samsung Galaxy S III.) The iPhone 4S running the Safari browser in iOS 6.0 on a dual-core 800MHz A5 processor is about on par with leading Android 4.0 phones like the Samsung Galaxy S III and the Motorola Droid RAZR M, both of which are using 1.5GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 processors. Obviously, the difference is that Safari is a faster browser than the Android browser. The iPhone 5 takes things to the next level with a processor that can compete with the S4 along with the fast browser. Its Browsermark score is 80 percent higher, and it shows much quicker Sunspider times. GUIMark, like most mobile on-screen graphics tests, maxes out at 60 frames per second because that's as fast as your screen updates. Geekbench is a processor benchmark, which tests the basic components of a phone's system. Here you see less of a difference, but it's still there. Look at the subscores. The A6 and the other processors do math about as fast as each other, but the "memory" and "stream" scores, both of which test loading data in and out of RAM, come out much better on the Apple device. Mix together the two sets and you see how much of a difference the Safari browser makes, but also that the iPhone 5 still wins with the browser taken out of the picture. GLBenchmark 2.5 is a graphics benchmark, creating and walking through simulated game scenes. Performance in the "onscreen" tests is dependent on a phone's graphics power but also on screen resolution (you can do more frames per second if you're pushing fewer pixels.) The "offscreen" tests are purely graphics-crunching power. The Galaxy S III has 26 percent more pixels than the iPhone 5 (921,600 to the iPhone's 727,400) but as you can see, in the "offscreen" measure of raw graphics performance, the iPhone 5 doubles the Galaxy S III's result. It's simply a more powerful phone. A phone's hardware performance can't be taken in isolation, but it's definitely a piece of the puzzle. Based on these benchmarks, the iPhone 5 lives up to the promise of being twice as fast as the iPhone 4S. It's also, for now, the fastest handheld computer sold in the US.

It took the Spanish language media outlet, Univision, to finally ask him some tough questions - and he failed badly - WATCH. Obama can’t answer why America’s embassies weren’t more secure Univision was the network to finally ask the President about the security at our embassies. Why wasn’t it better?

SOME HISTORY This story begins back before the United States was the United States. The original thirteen colonies printed their own currency, and it worked very well at empowering commerce and turning the young America into a powerful growing economy, free of the poverty and unemployment that even then crippled London. But the bankers of Europe, long used to private banks issuing the public currencies, were horrified by the American approach and saw it as a threat to their deeply cherished religious belief that the gods intended for the bankers to have all the wealth of the world. So, the Bank of England lobbied King George III to impose the Currency Act on the colonies, which forbade the colonies to use their own money and required them to borrow their lawful tender from the Bank of England, at interest. It took only a few years for this scheme to reduce the formerly prosperous and productive colonies down to the poverty and unemployment typical of London at the same time period, as depicted in the literature of Charles Dickens, among others. While the state-run American schools teach that the revolution was about the Stamp act and the Tea tax, it was primarily the rage created by the enforced impoverishment of the Currency Act which fueled the rebellion. Why the Currency Act is not mentioned in the public schools will become apparent further on. 2. THE ORIGINAL AMERICAN ECONOMY Following the American Revolution, the Founding Fathers reverted back to the system which had worked so well before the Currency Act.</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1348353109852</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 18:31:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348353133901-292</Id><Title>No Cut &amp; Paste iPhone 3, Antennagate iPhone 4, now Mapping problems iPhone 5...heard it all before...</Title><Msg>The bottom line is that Apple is going to sell tons of phones and they will fix the problem over the next few months...sorry shorts...this is the same old same old...not a game changer at all....sales will be HUGE!!!

If I'm right, I'll make $36,750 since I sold 150 calls and my net credit was $2.45 (Sold 150 715-Calls and bought 150 730-Calls in the vertical spread).</Msg><Username>ajmckay1000</Username><Timestamp>1348356485587</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 19:28:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348356583384-314</Id><Title>I Owe a Lot of Gratitude to Appl666</Title><Msg>I could never survive being Up Here on the Message Board.</Msg><Username>lord_chatterly</Username><Timestamp>1348356583384</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 19:29:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348356669204-315</Id><Topic><Title>PCMAG: The iPhone 5 Is 'The Fastest Smartphone We've Ever Tested'</Title><Username>market.kibble</Username><Timestamp>1348350159812</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 17:42:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>even pc magazine and android websites agree: i5 is the fastest smartphone ever tested.</Msg><Username>market.kibble</Username><Timestamp>1348356669204</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 19:31:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348356749972-316</Id><Title>$40 billion quarter</Title><Msg>Last quarter: Apple revenue was $35 billion. Apple sold 26.0 million iPhones in the quarter, representing 28 percent unit growth over the year-ago quarter. Apple sold 17.0 million iPads during the quarter, an 84 percent unit increase over the year-ago quarter. The Company sold 4.0 million Macs during the quarter, a two percent unit increase over the year-ago quarter. Apple sold 6.8 million iPods, a 10 percent unit decline from the year-ago quarter. This quarter: Last year, Apple did $28.27 billion in the same quarter. In order to generate $40 billion, the answer is simple. Apple needs to sell more iPhones - at least 33 million. Or sell more iPads. Or sell more Macs. It appears that the iPhone 5 launch was timed to have maximum impact on this quarter's iPhone sales. If we assume 30% decline of iPhone 4S sales because of anticipation of iPhone 5, this puts the iPhone 4S numbers at 18.2 million. Hence, Apple needs to sell 15 million iPhone 5. It already sold 2 million through the website, and will sell another 2 million by the time quarter ends. In essence, it needs to sell 11 million more through retail channels all over the world. Tim Cook is an operational genius. His team released the iPhone 5 already in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore and the UK on Friday, September 21. Next, iPhone 5 will roll out worldwide to 22 more countries on September 28, including Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. Can Apple sell at least 11 million new iPhone 5 in 30 countries worldwide?</Msg><Username>pricelinelong</Username><Timestamp>1348356749972</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 19:32:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348357145632-317</Id><Title>Appl666 Gets His Kicks Above the Waistlline Baby</Title><Msg>Needs all those ID's to get his "notification" fix.

After one day of using the black-and-slate 16 GB AT&amp;T model I got Friday, I'm very impressed with the phone, but that's not to say there aren't issues. As far as its body goes, the new slimmed-down and lighter iPhone 5 looks slick. It is noticeably lighter than its predecessors, and it is indeed much thinner. Its new 4-inch screen has made the phone a bit longer. This always sparks a debate about whether it's also more narrow, but that's not the case. Apple kept the same width, and that's a big reason the iPhone 5 still fits comfortably in your hand. PHOTOS: iPhone frenzy means lines, high-fives around world My one nit to pick with the phone's body is the location of the headphone jack. It's now located near the redesigned microphone and speaker grills, but it's on the bottom of the phone. At least for me, that's created situations in which I have to turn the phone upside down for the sake of my headphones, which can be annoying. As for the software, the addition of a sixth row of apps on the iPhone 5 is very helpful. I've now got all 80 of my apps on just two pages, and I haven't even filled either page up. As expected, the phone now runs super-fast, and the high-speed LTE connection is a joy ride after five versions of iPhones with less-than-4G connectivity. Maps' new turn-by-turn voice directions are also very useful, but the lack of a Google map is annoying. For example, at one point the app was unable to find a restaurant I was looking for, and it wasn't until I just scanned the map myself that I found where it was. So the maps app is great for car navigation, but in almost every other way, it's a step back. PHOTOS: Apple iPhone 5 Also, some apps have yet to update to support the new screen size. This forces the iPhone 5 to show the apps in the middle of its screen, framed by two black bars, above and below the app. Two other things that stand out on the new device are its new connector and its front camera. The front camera has been vastly improved, so you may start using it for taking pictures and not just video calls. The new Lightning connector is also impressive. It's sad that it renders all your previous dock accessories nearly useless, but it's very small and compact. I was expecting this connector to be about half the size of the previous 30-pin, but it's actually about a fourth the size. That's all for now, but we'll get more in-depth with this phone soon.</Msg><Username>market.kibble</Username><Timestamp>1348359390690</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 20:16:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348359483126-345</Id><Topic><Title>Theory: appl666 is a chick?</Title><Username>whettphartts</Username><Timestamp>1348354620448</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 18:57:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Poor Lips...lmao</Msg><Username>lord_chatterly</Username><Timestamp>1348359483126</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 20:18:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348359579192-346</Id><Title>Is iPhone 5 the most durable iPhone ever?</Title><Msg>Is iPhone 5 the most durable iPhone ever? [Videos] IPhone 5 drop tests seem to indicate this could be the most durable iPhone ever. (YouTube / September 21, 2012) By Salvador Rodriguez September 21, 2012, 4:00 p.m. Apple released the iPhone 5 on Friday and some people were already dropping them -- on purpose. And the verdict? It could be the most durable iPhone ever. As pointed out by MacRumors, Android Authority today posted a drop test video (see above). The site pitted the iPhone 5 against one of its top rivals, the Samsung Galaxy S III. Overall, the Apple device came out on top. The video, which includes a very enthusiastic tester, features a series of drop tests, including a pocket drop, a chest-height drop, an ear-height drop and, at the end, a drop from higher than the top of the guy's head. The iPhone 5 survives all four drops with just a few scratches; its screen had no major scratches or noticeable cracks. PHOTOS: iPhone frenzy means lines, high-fives around world By comparison, the Galaxy S III's screen does crack after being dropped from about chest height, or about 4 feet. It lands on its top-left rounded corner, which leads to cracks originating from that area. More cracks occur when it gets dropped from ear height. Although the iPhone 5 shows off its durability, you can see in the video that the black version of the phone's scratches are very noticeable. Unlike with previous versions of the black iPhone, when the black iPhone 5 is scratched its paint appears to come off, leaving white marks. PHOTOS: Apple iPhone 5 A second video also shows the durability of the iPhone 5 (see below). This video comes from iFixYouri, which drops the phone from a series of heights, starting at lap height. It takes seven drops before the phone starts to show significant damage (the video says the phone's frame bent a bit) and even after about 10 drops, the phone's screen never cracks. The guy has to finally throw it, not drop it, from about chest height for the iPhone 5's screen to finally crack.

It’s also impossible to say whether Jobs’ attention to detail is what Apple requires in today’s market. The conclusion that can be drawn, however, is that Apple is turning the corner to operate in favor of securing its market hold instead of delivering the best user experience. Now, other phone software, like Microsoft’s (Nasdaq: MSFT ) Windows Phone, has a viable chance to break into a market when previous iPhone owners look for superior mapping. And Android phones, which come closely tied with Google Maps already, will start to look very tempting for the ease of their mapping experience, even if other aspects of the phones aren’t as slick as an iPhone. Customers will begin to compare phones again, instead of defaulting to an iPhone, and if other phone makers can execute, there’s a big opportunity to disrupt iPhone’s market.</Msg><Username>heat800919</Username><Timestamp>1348364359380</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 21:39:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348364385025-375</Id><Topic><Title>Has any of you guys heard any iPhone 5 stories?</Title><Username>weirddrifterguy</Username><Timestamp>1348362220360</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 21:03:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>burn in hell whettphartss..you TROLL and evil man!</Msg><Username>freedomisfreee</Username><Timestamp>1348364385025</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 21:39:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348364449381-376</Id><Title>Agnostic evil people in wall street</Title><Msg>never seen so much evil people in one place. cesspool of evil.

Apple owns the media, just look at their board members. Never seen so many crooked judges in the U.S. before Apple came along. Any judge that rules against Apple will be trashed in the media, they have no backbone and they put the size of a market cap over the law. The results of the case against Apple by Motorola with the ITC is overdue, they don't know what to do after Motorola hit Apple with a slam dunk case. Patent infringement is OK in the U.S., if you are the right media controlled company. Microsoft just won a case against Motorola and could ban the sale of some of Motorola's products. A clear win for Microsoft or not? If Microsoft wants to ban those Motorola products, Microsoft would have to pay $68 Million dollars, remember, Microsoft won the case. The system of justice today is a scam in the U.S., A small company with a patent infringement case against a huge company like Apple can't afford to win a case in our Justice for some system. Those of you who remember now bankrupt GMGC, the company that gave GM the OnStar system. GMGC was owed over $60 million dollars and GM said they were not going to pay them. GM is still in business and GMGC is not. I lost big on GMGC. No Justice System .. Another company AFFI (I THINK) Held the patents for ATM Machines (WOW) That was big. Only one bank, Citi, paid them a few thousand dollars and they never collected a dime from anyone else. No small company with great patents can ever stand up to a huge company without spending 10's of millions of dollars and 10 years of fighting. A huge company IBM can win a case and put a small company out of business in a few months, they own the courts and judges. In the 1980's a company Clone made a copy of an IBM Bios Chip and put it in their Computers they were selling. IBM waited for Clone to make millions and then hit them with a patent infringement lawsuit. IBM won the case in about 2 months and put Clone out of business the day after the ruling.
