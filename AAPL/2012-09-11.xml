I bought at 557 from a 610 dip , and at 531 from another 625. Since there is always the probability-very low- that the iPhone 5 will not meet expectations initially, folks who are margining and not in for the long term find it wise to exit. I would not be on margin with Apple Stock at this point. Now if Apple comes out with some serious innovations, it will eat up everyone's lunch and dinner, and fly north of 1000. If the release is a mediocre, then we could crash back to 600.

And Apple is the iCulture that everyone wants to belong to. If the iPhone 5 has just a few innovations, you have hundreds of millions of phones to be sold. Right now, the folks margining or those shorting the stock, are getting scared. There is always the probability that the iphone 5 may not meet expectations. But it is a very low probability. The iPhone 5 has been in design and almost done when the iPhone 4s was released. Apple wisely sold the iPhone 4s with a few improvements like Siri rather than releasing the iPhone 5 a few months later.

The problem is the SPECS which will bring AAPL stocks down because AAPL is restricted in a way not to CRUSH competitors too much as they already won the billions from Samsung. Get ready to buy when it's low as MARKET MAKER will try to accumulate and profit as this stock goes down.

Don’t Miss: Will Apple Take Down Pandora? According to a report in The Korea Times, Samsung says it will “immediately sue Apple” and block airways if iPhone 5 is LTE-compatible. The faster wireless network is available on a lot of newer Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) Android devices, including those of Samsung’s, but current iterations of Apple’s iPhone don’t have the technology. According to Reuters data cited by The Korea Times, Samsung has the third-highest number of LTE patents, with Nokia (NYSE:NOK) topping the list. The feature is considered a big positive for Android phones over other platforms at the moment. “It’s true that Samsung Electronics has decided to take immediate legal action against the Cupertino-based Apple,” a senior Samsung executive told the newspaper. “Countries in Europe and even the United States ― Apple’s home-turf ― are our primary targets.’’ While Apple has not publicly spoken of adding the feature, analyst and supply sources suggest the company is using a new Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) LTE-enabled chip in the new device. Last month, Apple won more than $1 billion in damages against Samsung after suing its rival over design and feature patents in a California court. It is also seeking a ban on eight Samsung products: Galaxy S 4G, Galaxy S2 AT&amp;T, Galaxy S2, Galaxy S2 T-Mobile, Galaxy S2 Epic 4G, Galaxy S Showcase, Droid Charge and Galaxy Prevail. While Samsung countersued for $422 million, alleging Apple was violating its wireless patents, a nine-person federal jury ruled in favor of the iPhone maker.</Msg><Username>mercelena66</Username><Timestamp>1347346151844</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 02:49:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347346301017-70</Id><Topic><Title>Should not short</Title><Username>kdkellyllc</Username><Timestamp>1347343094160</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 01:58:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Apple’s NEW iPhone is in TROUBLE Already By Aabha Rathee | More Articles September 10, 2012 The patent battle between Samsung and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is far from over, with the Korean company threatening to sue the iPhone maker if its next-generation smartphone, rumored to be releasing this week, uses LTE technology.

Morgan (NYSE: JPM) analysts expect Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) to sell around 8 million iPhone 5s in the fourth quarter at about $600 apiece.</Msg><Username>ametrosixual</Username><Timestamp>1347359616316</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 06:33:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347359726413-106</Id><Topic><Title>Any thoughts on price action before event wednesday on apple</Title><Username>opt_trdr</Username><Timestamp>1347109838296</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-08 09:10:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>we wanted to, oh yes we did, but "you know how hard it can be the way things are goin`, they`re gonna crucify me" maybe today we`ll be singing redemption songs because "how long will they kill our prophets (profits) as we stand aside and look"</Msg><Username>aaplboost</Username><Timestamp>1347359726413</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 06:35:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347360398482-107</Id><Title>Shaw Wu of Sterne Agee sees 3% gain in apple share price between sept 12th iphone 5 announcement and sept 21st launch date</Title><Msg>“It’s very hard to predict,” said Shaw Wu of Sterne Agee, speaking of the behavior of Apple shares around big launch events, such as the one set for Wednesday in San Francisco that’s expected to feature a new iPhone and possibly updates to the iPod lineup, with another possibility being the introduction of a new, smaller iPad. Investing in Apple around launch events, Wu added, depends entirely on the time horizon an investor has on the company. For those focused on short- or middle-term trades, making predictions is challenging, given the volume of hype surrounding new products and the big run for the stock this year. “There’s been such a huge move already [that] there may be some near-term profit taking on the shares, like we saw [Monday],” Wu told MarketWatch in an interview. The stock’s near-term track record over the last four iPhone launches has been mixed. On average, the shares have picked up about 4% in the month prior to the announcement date for the last four iPhone models. It has then averaged another 3% gain in the period between the announcement date and launch date, according to MarketWatch calculations. However, the stock has then averaged a decline of about 8.5% in the month following the market launch for the last four iPhone models. Apple’s shares traded down 10% last year in the month after the launch of the iPhone 4S. Long term, Wall Street is overwhelmingly bullish on Apple. Nearly 90% of the brokers covering the company rate its shares as a buy. About two-thirds of the covering brokers have price targets for Apple at or above $700, with the current median target at $747.50 — nearly 13% above the stock’s current level. “It is important to note that the unprecedented breakout in Apple’s stock price has been primarily driven by the iPhone’s success in both revenue and profit contribution,” wrote Mark Moskowitz of J.P. Morgan in a note last week. Counseling investors to “not be alarmed by any near-term selling pressure,” Moskowitz cited his own research that shows Apple’s shares have averaged a 5.2% gain in the 30 days following a new-product announcement, taking into account the last seven of such events. In a study published last month, Toni Sacconaghi of Bernstein Research found that Apple’s shares tend to outperform “materially” in the two months leading up to a product launch, with an average gain of about 1,100 basis points before previous iPhone launches. Apple’s new smartphone could get credit for something Congress, the White House and Federal Reserve have struggled to do: Boost the U.S. economy in a measurable way. He also noted that the shares have “generally underperformed” in the two-month period following launches. “We believe that the Apple [blogosphere] has become increasingly effective and predictive, with major details of new products largely known before the announcement date,” according to Sacconaghi. The analyst maintains an outperform rating and $750 price target on the stock, saying that Apple represents a “very attractive” risk-versus-reward proposition “at current levels.” Sacconaghi added that a key question for the iPhone 5 remains component supplies and how they may or may not affect the initial rollout. For Wu of Sterne Agee, Apple’s shares still have plenty of potential. He noted that, as popular as the iPhone is, Apple still has only about 8% of the world’s total mobile-phone market and is likely to continue expanding its market share over several weaker rivals. “For long-term investors, now is as good a time as any,” said Wu, who has a $780 price target on the shares. “We think the stock has more upside from here.”</Msg><Username>ametrosixual</Username><Timestamp>1347360398482</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 06:46:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347360398601-108</Id><Title>Shaw Wu of Sterne Agee sees 3% gain in apple share price between sept 12th iphone 5 announcement and sept 21st launch date</Title><Msg>“It’s very hard to predict,” said Shaw Wu of Sterne Agee, speaking of the behavior of Apple shares around big launch events, such as the one set for Wednesday in San Francisco that’s expected to feature a new iPhone and possibly updates to the iPod lineup, with another possibility being the introduction of a new, smaller iPad.

R3, the consultancy, polled 1,500 people in the nation's ten largest cities to discover their favourite brands, which products boasted the highest online awareness and the general values associated with leading companies. Apple, the electronics pioneer, led the charts on 138.2 points, not least as a result of the launch of its iPad 3 tablet in the country. China Mobile, the telecoms group, came next with 124.7 points. One factor behind its success was the "Changing Our Lives" campaign, part of a wider effort to emphasise the firm's technological and corporate social responsibility goals. "Both Apple and China Mobile have been champions at driving engagement," said Greg Paull, R3's principal. "Both brands have achieved heightened awareness - the two brands have truly leveraged paid, own and earned media better than anyone else in China." Nike, the sportswear giant, followed next, and recorded 88 points. Making up the top five were Yili, the dairy conglomerate, on 81 points, and Coca-Cola, the soft drinks specialist, posting 76 points. Elsewhere, the analysis looked at which of 800 media outlets enjoyed the strongest perceptions. Sina Weibo, the microblog, took first place on 91 points, overtaking Baidu, the search engine, on 86.4 points. Q-Zone, the social media platform, claimed third on 83.4 points, ahead of Taobao, the ecommerce site, with 79 points and Tencent Weibo, another property similar to Twitter, on 74.8 points. According to R3's figures, some 65% of people who access Weibo platforms – of which there are several – currently do so from a smartphone, versus 62% using a PC and 23% logging on from a tablet. "These statistics go to show just how deeply embedded mobile has become into the daily rituals of Chinese consumers," said Paull. The study also found that 9.7% of Weibo users interacted with Coca-Cola via these channel. Samsung, the electronics company, scored 8.6% here, with Nike on 7.1% and adidas on 5.2%. "Coke's hefty investments in digital marketing have struck a chord with Chinese consumers, and it plays out in awareness," said Paull.

Apple’s popular iPhone is proving to be strong revenue driver for select chip firms. Apple AAPL +0.36% has become an increasingly important customer for the companies that design and manufacture processors for a range of functions in electronic devices, including data storage, memory, power management, audio controls, radio and Wi-Fi transmission. “New product launches out of Apple are becoming increasingly important to monitor, as we estimate the company consumes about 10% of worldwide semiconductor content in 2012, which is expected to grow in 2013,” RBC Capital analyst Doug Freedman wrote in a note to clients on Monday. Freedman estimated that the iPhone 5, which is what the new Apple smartphone is being referred to in the industry, will make up a little over 4% of total semiconductor shipments in the 2013. He said that could translates to $13.9 billion in annual chip sales into Apple’s new smartphone. Apple is already the world’s top purchaser of semiconductor products, and “increasing its buying rate faster than other top firms,” the industry research group IHS said in a July report. The company is expected to spend nearly $28 billion on chips this year, up 15% from 2011, according to IHS. In a note, Craig Berger of FBR Capital said, “We expect the iPhone 5 to be a home run, driving large volumes to critical device suppliers,” adding that 50 million to 52 million units could be built in the fourth quarter of 2012, “well ahead of street estimates.” That could translate to huge sales for Apple suppliers. But the company typically does not disclose suppliers for specific products, so analysts have been busy speculating on the potential winners in the upcoming launch, partly based on a tear-down analysis of previous products. Qualcomm QCOM -1.03% is expected to remain a key supplier as the provider of the iPhone’s baseband chip, which serves as the device’s modem. There have been concerns of insufficient supply as Qualcomm shifts to a new process technology, but Berger of FBR Capital said he sees Apple getting the supply it needs as Qualcomm “prioritizes Apple over other handset makers.” Freedman of RBC Capital named other potential suppliers, including SanDisk Corp. SNDK -0.61% and Toshiba TOSBF +3.07% for memory, Broadcom BRCM -1.46% for connectivity, Texas Instruments TXN -1.75% for touch-screen drivers and Omnivision OVTI -3.28% for image sensors. IPhone 5 could boost GDP The iPhone 5, which Apple plans to release this week, could get credit for something Congress, the White House and Federal Reserve have struggled to do: boost the U.S. economy in a measurable way. Sudeep Reddy explains on The News Hub. Omnivision has sparked speculation on its possible role in the iPhone 5 after the company issued a strong forecast during its Aug. 31 earnings report. “After having been excluded from supplying Apple its image sensor to the iPhone 4S , the company’s strong October forecast looks to be evidence that it has retaken the socket for the iPhone 5, a feat that not many suppliers are able to accomplish once being displaced,” Williams Financial analyst Cody Acree said in a note. In fact, getting displaced from Apple’s list can be painful for a company’s stock. That’s what happened to Audience Inc. ADNC +3.48% , which saw its shares lose two-thirds of their value last Friday after the company disclosed that Apple was not using its voice-processing chip technology in the next iPhone. On Monday, Needham analyst Vernon Essi speculated in a note that Cirrus Logic may be the “likely beneficiary” of the loss by Audience. Cirrus Logic CRUS -3.88% shares have jumped 11% over the past month. Analysts have also focused on RF Micro RFMD -1.30% , a maker of radio frequency chips, as one of the potentially big winners in the coming iPhone rollout. Edward Snyder of Charter Equity Research said he sees RF Micro scoring the largest percentage gain with the release of the iPhone. The company has “seen such a rapid ramp at Apple and has tripled its content to $1.05 from about 30 cents in the iPhone 4S,” he wrote.

No. In the secretive and exponential hightech world of Apple (and their co-conspirators) you can bet, much like our military, there are MANY more products in R&amp;D that will blow your mind in years to come. A company like Apple doesn't have the brightest minds, best engineers, most creative developers and designers just to be a one-trick company.

These companies have to "create some excitement before the iPhone 5 comes around," Michael Walkley, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity, tells the Wall Street Journal. Nokia, for example, may not even ship its new devices until next month, whereas the iPhone 5 will likely hit stores by September 21... Meanwhile, sales expectations for the iPhone 5 are high, but they may not be as high as they should be, says Piper Jaffray's Gene Munster. Currently, analysts predict that Apple will see sales of around 22 million to 23 million iPhones in the fiscal fourth quarter ending September 30. Munster, however, asserts that the figure could go up to 28 million, as Apple is likely to sell between 6 million and 10 million iPhone 5s in September, as long as supply can meet demand. That would mean an 8% upside to the Street’s consensus estimate of $35 billion in revenue and 12% upside to the earnings per share consensus of $8.46.</Msg><Username>ametrosixual</Username><Timestamp>1347369780040</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 09:23:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347369781293-195</Id><Title>WAITING FOR THE 3 BILLION TREBLE DAMAGES RESULTS</Title><Msg>AOKKKKKKKKKKKKKK</Msg><Username>kropy2002</Username><Timestamp>1347369781293</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 09:23:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347369869546-196</Id><Topic><Title>Bought 200c Sep14 665 Call at 9.40</Title><Username>aea_62</Username><Timestamp>1347306854894</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-10 15:54:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>should the Sept 670 you recommended yesterday also be sold when this gets closed?</Msg><Username>nomevoy</Username><Timestamp>1347369869546</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 09:24:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347369883981-197</Id><Topic><Title>to be safe over 668 taking off the table if you want, not that rosy as it look</Title><Username>aea_k2</Username><Timestamp>1347369028042</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 09:10:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yes... like i say yesterday as we approach 670 calls go exp, putz log. they will not like it up mash from there no matter how cheap is. need to get some neg sentiment and putz buyin like amzn, goog and stock could easily move up very mash.</Msg><Username>davidch14</Username><Timestamp>1347369883981</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 09:24:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347369969937-198</Id><Topic><Title>A little morning sunshine the rest of the is raining</Title><Username>aea_k2</Username><Timestamp>1347279962465</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-10 08:26:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>it was right there in the wekly options</Msg><Username>davidch14</Username><Timestamp>1347369969937</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 09:26:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347369974064-199</Id><Title>** "Analyst Sees 10M iPhone 5 Sales in First Three Weeks"</Title><Msg>By 24/7 Wall St. 7:08AM 09/11/12 Gene Munster of Piper Jaffray is considered one of the top axes as far as analysts who cover Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL). He has been a very vocal bull in Apple for years now, cheering every product along the way from the iPhone to the iPad. He is also hot on the coming Apple TV, whatever this television will be and whenever it will be finally unveiled. Bloomberg television reported this morning that Gene Munster believes that Apple can sell 10 million of the new iPhone 5 units in the first three weeks alone. This would be important because that gets the sales jammed into the current quarter, and it was just last quarter that Apple said that consumers were putting off iPhone 4s purchases in order to wait for the iPhone 5. We would note that at the end of August Munster was looking out beyond the iPhone 5 and he was optimistic for three reasons. He hinted that Apple might cut the price down to $200 from closer to $375 to make the phone more accessible in many of the emerging markets. He was also positive on the rumored iPad mini, as well as the Apple TV launch. Munster said in August that it is becoming increasingly possible for Apple to make a lower-end iPhone for those emerging markets in a $130 to $150 range. Munster rates Apple at Overweight and his price target is $910. JON C.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) to sell 5.1 million Macs in the September quarter – Analyst Call Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) is set to sell a record-breaking 5.1 million Macs in the three months to September, according to a forecast made by Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster. This means that sales of Apple computers will far outstrip the sales of the total industry in the United States, which showed a decline of 7 percent on year, in the first two months of the September quarter, according to data by NPD Display. Munster has based his forecasts on the March and June quarters when Apple surpassed industry sales by 12 percentage points. Last year Apple had set a record in the September quarter by selling 4.9 million Macs. The all-time record was set in the holiday quarter of 2011 when the Cupertino company sold a total of 5.2 million desktops and laptops, Apple Insider said. Will AAPL Hit $1000 This Year? Find Out Here Apple's focus has been on the sales of its iPhones and iPads and in recent months the company has seen a lower growth of its personal computers compared to last year. Though the 5.1 million units of expected sales is still a record it is much lower than what the company is used to. Munster said that sales of the Mac have been weak since the start of 2012, but also said that investors would not be unduly worried about it as the obsession now centres on the company's mobile devices. "More importantly, Apple is holding an event likely for the iPhone 5 on Wednesday, which will be the next significant event for the stock," Munster said, tacitly acknowledging the diminishing role the Mac now plays in Apple's business. Analysts are expecting a refurbished line of Macs this fall after its new iPhone, iPad and iPods are launched this month and next.</Msg><Username>ametrosixual</Username><Timestamp>1347370616795</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 09:36:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347370633163-215</Id><Topic><Title>680$ today !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</Title><Username>barronsfanatic</Username><Timestamp>1347370439256</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 09:33:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>it is fascinating to see how the traders with no conviction on this company are geting repeativly cleaned out times and times againright before major upside...</Msg><Username>merakss1977</Username><Timestamp>1347370633163</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 09:37:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347370693302-216</Id><Title>ALL THE TA FOOLS WRONG AGAIN</Title><Msg>Ta talking will look like fools adami is wrong again.</Msg><Username>wernerairhart</Username><Timestamp>1347370693302</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 09:38:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347370802072-217</Id><Topic><Title>LOL..THERE WAS THE BOUNCE.....TIME TO SHORT!!</Title><Username>sheepskinner25</Username><Timestamp>1347370613047</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 09:36:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Just like yesterday it hit its high 7 minutes into the trading day then sank like the Titanic.</Msg><Username>playboy210</Username><Timestamp>1347370802072</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 09:40:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347370830527-218</Id><Topic><Title>AAPL WILL SELL OFF AGAIN TODAY WITHOUT QUESTION!!!</Title><Username>sheepskinner25</Username><Timestamp>1347366694354</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 08:31:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>GREAT CALL!!!!

Developers and IT professionals from around the globe come together for the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference that runs 11-15 June to connect with Apple engineers and get a firsthand look at the latest technologies. (Image credit: AFP/Getty Images via @daylife) Will you be one of the eight million people expected to pay $600 for an Apple (AAPL) iPhone 5S later this year? If so, you will be contributing to some 32,000 students who were forced to work on the Foxconn assembly line building your order — or face expulsion from school. The New York Times reports that Foxconn claimed that it employs 32,000 “interns” — 2.7% of its 1.2 million workers in China. Foxconn says that schools “recruit the students under the supervision of the local government, and the schools also assign teachers to accompany and monitor the students throughout their internship.” But this bland statement may mask a more basic reality — those “interns” are being offered a choice of working in the Foxconn factory to meet demand for the iPhone 5S or getting kicked out of school. Li Qiang, founder of China Labor Watch, told the Times that as recently September 9 he learned that 10 if 87 workers on one iPhone assembly line were “interns.” And as Li said, they “don’t want to work there — they want to learn. But if they don’t work, they are told they will not graduate, because it is a very busy time with the new iPhone coming, and Foxconn does not have enough workers without the students.” But if a JP Morgan Chase (JPM) is right, eight million people will pay $600 to buy the soon-to-be-unveiled iPhone 5S. Even without taking into account the moral cost of buying a product that is built on the backs of the misery of 32,000 student interns, you are grossly over-paying for the “brand.” That’s because Apple is exercising an enormous competitive advantage at your expense and that of its workers and suppliers. It has managed to drive a huge wedge between what people are willing to pay and its cost to satisfy that demand. How so? Your iPhone’s price is 44% higher than the Lumia’s — looks to me like overpaying — while Apple takes home a whopping 71% gross margin — compared to Nokia’s 54%. Consider the comparison of the prices and bill of materials cost for the iPhone 4S and the Nokia (NOK) Lumia 900. According to iMore, the iPhone’s price is $649 while the total cost of all its components — an incomplete cost measure — is $190; whereas the Lumia 900 sells for $450 and its parts cost $209. As for the moral cost of building your iPhone, in January we learned that 23 people had died and 273 has been injured building your iWorld, including 19 who committed suicide at the Foxconn factory by “jumping or falling” off of its factory or dormitory buildings between 2008 and 2010; Four – including Mr. Lai — who died in two factory explosions at Foxconn and another 77 who were injured in them; 137 Wintek workers injured due to the use of a fast-evaporating chemical used to polish iPad screens; and 59 injured during a December 2011 Foxconn plant explosion in Shanghai. I am hoping that’s all in the past now. But it leads to a question: Why will virtually every Apple product owner react to this discussion as they would to an attack on a loved one? The answer to that is fairly simple: the iPhone stimulates the same part of the human brain that activates when you are near people you love. In September 2011, Martin Lindstrom wrote in the New York Times that he conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment on eight men and eight women between the ages of 18 and 25. His finding was that when exposed to their iPhones those 16 experienced a ”flurry of activation in the insular cortex of the brain, which is associated with feelings of love and compassion. The subjects’ brains responded to the sound of their phones as they would respond to the presence or proximity of a girlfriend, boyfriend or family member,” according to Lindstrom. As Lindstrom concluded, you love your iPhone and if JP Morgan Chase is right, eight million of you won’t let a little thing — like costing 32,000 Chinese students their education — keep you from spending $600 to smear your fingerprints all over your loved one’s glass screen.</Msg><Username>mercelena66</Username><Timestamp>1347371812423</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 09:56:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347371884709-237</Id><Topic><Title>HEY EVERYBODY, I just shorted sheepskinner25</Title><Username>duncansfree</Username><Timestamp>1347371682042</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 09:54:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Happened to catch sheepskinner25 at the high and I'm riding his #$%$ down like a $2 trollop.

Developers and IT professionals from around the globe come together for the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference that runs 11-15 June to connect with Apple engineers and get a firsthand look at the latest technologies. (Image credit: AFP/Getty Images via @daylife) Will you be one of the eight million people expected to pay $600 for an Apple (AAPL) iPhone 5S later this year? If so, you will be contributing to some 32,000 students who were forced to work on the Foxconn assembly line building your order — or face expulsion from school. The New York Times reports that Foxconn claimed that it employs 32,000 “interns” — 2.7% of its 1.2 million workers in China. Foxconn says that schools “recruit the students under the supervision of the local government, and the schools also assign teachers to accompany and monitor the students throughout their internship.” But this bland statement may mask a more basic reality — those “interns” are being offered a choice of working in the Foxconn factory to meet demand for the iPhone 5S or getting kicked out of school. Li Qiang, founder of China Labor Watch, told the Times that as recently September 9 he learned that 10 if 87 workers on one iPhone assembly line were “interns.” And as Li said, they “don’t want to work there — they want to learn. But if they don’t work, they are told they will not graduate, because it is a very busy time with the new iPhone coming, and Foxconn does not have enough workers without the students.” But if a JP Morgan Chase (JPM) is right, eight million people will pay $600 to buy the soon-to-be-unveiled iPhone 5S. Even without taking into account the moral cost of buying a product that is built on the backs of the misery of 32,000 student interns, you are grossly over-paying for the “brand.” That’s because Apple is exercising an enormous competitive advantage at your expense and that of its workers and suppliers. It has managed to drive a huge wedge between what people are willing to pay and its cost to satisfy that demand. How so? Your iPhone’s price is 44% higher than the Lumia’s — looks to me like overpaying — while Apple takes home a whopping 71% gross margin — compared to Nokia’s 54%. Consider the comparison of the prices and bill of materials cost for the iPhone 4S and the Nokia (NOK) Lumia 900. According to iMore, the iPhone’s price is $649 while the total cost of all its components — an incomplete cost measure — is $190; whereas the Lumia 900 sells for $450 and its parts cost $209. As for the moral cost of building your iPhone, in January we learned that 23 people had died and 273 has been injured building your iWorld, including 19 who committed suicide at the Foxconn factory by “jumping or falling” off of its factory or dormitory buildings between 2008 and 2010; Four – including Mr. Lai — who died in two factory explosions at Foxconn and another 77 who were injured in them; 137 Wintek workers injured due to the use of a fast-evaporating chemical used to polish iPad screens; and 59 injured during a December 2011 Foxconn plant explosion in Shanghai. I am hoping that’s all in the past now. But it leads to a question: Why will virtually every Apple product owner react to this discussion as they would to an attack on a loved one? The answer to that is fairly simple: the iPhone stimulates the same part of the human brain that activates when you are near people you love. In September 2011, Martin Lindstrom wrote in the New York Times that he conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment on eight men and eight women between the ages of 18 and 25. His finding was that when exposed to their iPhones those 16 experienced a ”flurry of activation in the insular cortex of the brain, which is associated with feelings of love and compassion. The subjects’ brains responded to the sound of their phones as they would respond to the presence or proximity of a girlfriend, boyfriend or family member,” according to Lindstrom. As Lindstrom concluded, you love your iPhone and if JP Morgan Chase is right, eight million of you won’t let a little thing — like costing 32,000 Chinese students their education — keep you from spending $600 to smear your fingerprints all over your loved one’s glass screen.</Msg><Username>mercelena66</Username><Timestamp>1347372256039</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 10:04:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347372289760-249</Id><Title>Fed will announce open-end QE on Thursday</Title><Msg>Will buy mortgage-backed securities when it deems necessary.</Msg><Username>abrachen1</Username><Timestamp>1347372289760</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 10:04:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347372346421-250</Id><Topic><Title>Sorry Bashers: AAPL Earnings Will Drive its Price Higher All Next Year</Title><Username>chuckpalot</Username><Timestamp>1347368542069</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 09:02:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>kibbles, Why not 35%? What will Apples' earnings growth be for this current year over last? Assuming you know that answer within a couple % points, and actually follow their business and near-term prospects, please tell me why it will slow dramatically to your "more realistic" 25% in the coming year. I personally think they'll grow earnings by closer to 45% in F13, not 35%, but certainly welcome a well reasoned argument for this sudden slow down. As for PE multiples, even if the Market keeps AAPL pegged at 15-16 (vs their historical norm of 20+), the march to $1,000 can not be stopped - it's only a matter of WHEN.

(Image credit: AFP/Getty Images via @daylife) Will you be one of the eight million people expected to pay $600 for an Apple (AAPL) iPhone 5S later this year? If so, you will be contributing to some 32,000 students who were forced to work on the Foxconn assembly line building your order — or face expulsion from school. The New York Times reports that Foxconn claimed that it employs 32,000 “interns” — 2.7% of its 1.2 million workers in China. Foxconn says that schools “recruit the students under the supervision of the local government, and the schools also assign teachers to accompany and monitor the students throughout their internship.” But this bland statement may mask a more basic reality — those “interns” are being offered a choice of working in the Foxconn factory to meet demand for the iPhone 5S or getting kicked out of school. Li Qiang, founder of China Labor Watch, told the Times that as recently September 9 he learned that 10 if 87 workers on one iPhone assembly line were “interns.” And as Li said, they “don’t want to work there — they want to learn. But if they don’t work, they are told they will not graduate, because it is a very busy time with the new iPhone coming, and Foxconn does not have enough workers without the students.” But if a JP Morgan Chase (JPM) is right, eight million people will pay $600 to buy the soon-to-be-unveiled iPhone 5S. Even without taking into account the moral cost of buying a product that is built on the backs of the misery of 32,000 student interns, you are grossly over-paying for the “brand.” That’s because Apple is exercising an enormous competitive advantage at your expense and that of its workers and suppliers. It has managed to drive a huge wedge between what people are willing to pay and its cost to satisfy that demand. How so? Your iPhone’s price is 44% higher than the Lumia’s — looks to me like overpaying — while Apple takes home a whopping 71% gross margin — compared to Nokia’s 54%. Consider the comparison of the prices and bill of materials cost for the iPhone 4S and the Nokia (NOK) Lumia 900. According to iMore, the iPhone’s price is $649 while the total cost of all its components — an incomplete cost measure — is $190; whereas the Lumia 900 sells for $450 and its parts cost $209. As for the moral cost of building your iPhone, in January we learned that 23 people had died and 273 has been injured building your iWorld, including 19 who committed suicide at the Foxconn factory by “jumping or falling” off of its factory or dormitory buildings between 2008 and 2010; Four – including Mr. Lai — who died in two factory explosions at Foxconn and another 77 who were injured in them; 137 Wintek workers injured due to the use of a fast-evaporating chemical used to polish iPad screens; and 59 injured during a December 2011 Foxconn plant explosion in Shanghai. I am hoping that’s all in the past now. But it leads to a question: Why will virtually every Apple product owner react to this discussion as they would to an attack on a loved one? The answer to that is fairly simple: the iPhone stimulates the same part of the human brain that activates when you are near people you love. In September 2011, Martin Lindstrom wrote in the New York Times that he conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment on eight men and eight women between the ages of 18 and 25. His finding was that when exposed to their iPhones those 16 experienced a ”flurry of activation in the insular cortex of the brain, which is associated with feelings of love and compassion. The subjects’ brains responded to the sound of their phones as they would respond to the presence or proximity of a girlfriend, boyfriend or family member,” according to Lindstrom. As Lindstrom concluded, you love your iPhone and if JP Morgan Chase is right, eight million of you won’t let a little thing — like costing 32,000 Chinese students their education — keep you from spending $600 to smear your fingerprints all over your loved one’s glass screen.</Msg><Username>mercelena66</Username><Timestamp>1347373060877</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 10:17:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347373083458-267</Id><Topic><Title>Same s/h/i/ z different day.

(Image credit: AFP/Getty Images via @daylife) Will you be one of the eight million people expected to pay $600 for an Apple (AAPL) iPhone 5S later this year? If so, you will be contributing to some 32,000 students who were forced to work on the Foxconn assembly line building your order — or face expulsion from school. The New York Times reports that Foxconn claimed that it employs 32,000 “interns” — 2.7% of its 1.2 million workers in China. Foxconn says that schools “recruit the students under the supervision of the local government, and the schools also assign teachers to accompany and monitor the students throughout their internship.” But this bland statement may mask a more basic reality — those “interns” are being offered a choice of working in the Foxconn factory to meet demand for the iPhone 5S or getting kicked out of school. Li Qiang, founder of China Labor Watch, told the Times that as recently September 9 he learned that 10 if 87 workers on one iPhone assembly line were “interns.” And as Li said, they “don’t want to work there — they want to learn. But if they don’t work, they are told they will not graduate, because it is a very busy time with the new iPhone coming, and Foxconn does not have enough workers without the students.” But if a JP Morgan Chase (JPM) is right, eight million people will pay $600 to buy the soon-to-be-unveiled iPhone 5S. Even without taking into account the moral cost of buying a product that is built on the backs of the misery of 32,000 student interns, you are grossly over-paying for the “brand.” That’s because Apple is exercising an enormous competitive advantage at your expense and that of its workers and suppliers. It has managed to drive a huge wedge between what people are willing to pay and its cost to satisfy that demand. How so? Your iPhone’s price is 44% higher than the Lumia’s — looks to me like overpaying — while Apple takes home a whopping 71% gross margin — compared to Nokia’s 54%. Consider the comparison of the prices and bill of materials cost for the iPhone 4S and the Nokia (NOK) Lumia 900. According to iMore, the iPhone’s price is $649 while the total cost of all its components — an incomplete cost measure — is $190; whereas the Lumia 900 sells for $450 and its parts cost $209. As for the moral cost of building your iPhone, in January we learned that 23 people had died and 273 has been injured building your iWorld, including 19 who committed suicide at the Foxconn factory by “jumping or falling” off of its factory or dormitory buildings between 2008 and 2010; Four – including Mr. Lai — who died in two factory explosions at Foxconn and another 77 who were injured in them; 137 Wintek workers injured due to the use of a fast-evaporating chemical used to polish iPad screens; and 59 injured during a December 2011 Foxconn plant explosion in Shanghai. I am hoping that’s all in the past now. But it leads to a question: Why will virtually every Apple product owner react to this discussion as they would to an attack on a loved one? The answer to that is fairly simple: the iPhone stimulates the same part of the human brain that activates when you are near people you love. In September 2011, Martin Lindstrom wrote in the New York Times that he conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment on eight men and eight women between the ages of 18 and 25. His finding was that when exposed to their iPhones those 16 experienced a ”flurry of activation in the insular cortex of the brain, which is associated with feelings of love and compassion. The subjects’ brains responded to the sound of their phones as they would respond to the presence or proximity of a girlfriend, boyfriend or family member,” according to Lindstrom.

As Lindstrom concluded, you love your iPhone and if JP Morgan Chase is right, eight million of you won’t let a little thing — like costing 32,000 Chinese students their education — keep you from spending $600 to smear your fingerprints all over your loved one’s glass screen.</Msg><Username>mercelena66</Username><Timestamp>1347373794974</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 10:29:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347373813362-294</Id><Title>21,000 shares buy $666.31 10:28:17</Title><Msg>Go Apple!</Msg><Username>plzplzplayfaster</Username><Timestamp>1347373813362</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 10:30:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347373818451-295</Id><Title>Buy the shares and reap HUGE rewards</Title><Msg>and put all the shorts on ignore.</Msg><Username>abrachen1</Username><Timestamp>1347373818451</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 10:30:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347373849804-296</Id><Title>MAKO !!!

(Image credit: AFP/Getty Images via @daylife) Will you be one of the eight million people expected to pay $600 for an Apple (AAPL) iPhone 5S later this year? If so, you will be contributing to some 32,000 students who were forced to work on the Foxconn assembly line building your order — or face expulsion from school. The New York Times reports that Foxconn claimed that it employs 32,000 “interns” — 2.7% of its 1.2 million workers in China. Foxconn says that schools “recruit the students under the supervision of the local government, and the schools also assign teachers to accompany and monitor the students throughout their internship.” But this bland statement may mask a more basic reality — those “interns” are being offered a choice of working in the Foxconn factory to meet demand for the iPhone 5S or getting kicked out of school. Li Qiang, founder of China Labor Watch, told the Times that as recently September 9 he learned that 10 if 87 workers on one iPhone assembly line were “interns.” And as Li said, they “don’t want to work there — they want to learn. But if they don’t work, they are told they will not graduate, because it is a very busy time with the new iPhone coming, and Foxconn does not have enough workers without the students.” But if a JP Morgan Chase (JPM) is right, eight million people will pay $600 to buy the soon-to-be-unveiled iPhone 5S. Even without taking into account the moral cost of buying a product that is built on the backs of the misery of 32,000 student interns, you are grossly over-paying for the “brand.” That’s because Apple is exercising an enormous competitive advantage at your expense and that of its workers and suppliers. It has managed to drive a huge wedge between what people are willing to pay and its cost to satisfy that demand. How so? Your iPhone’s price is 44% higher than the Lumia’s — looks to me like overpaying — while Apple takes home a whopping 71% gross margin — compared to Nokia’s 54%. Consider the comparison of the prices and bill of materials cost for the iPhone 4S and the Nokia (NOK) Lumia 900. According to iMore, the iPhone’s price is $649 while the total cost of all its components — an incomplete cost measure — is $190; whereas the Lumia 900 sells for $450 and its parts cost $209. As for the moral cost of building your iPhone, in January we learned that 23 people had died and 273 has been injured building your iWorld, including 19 who committed suicide at the Foxconn factory by “jumping or falling” off of its factory or dormitory buildings between 2008 and 2010; Four – including Mr. Lai — who died in two factory explosions at Foxconn and another 77 who were injured in them; 137 Wintek workers injured due to the use of a fast-evaporating chemical used to polish iPad screens; and 59 injured during a December 2011 Foxconn plant explosion in Shanghai. I am hoping that’s all in the past now. But it leads to a question: Why will virtually every Apple product owner react to this discussion as they would to an attack on a loved one? The answer to that is fairly simple: the iPhone stimulates the same part of the human brain that activates when you are near people you love. In September 2011, Martin Lindstrom wrote in the New York Times that he conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment on eight men and eight women between the ages of 18 and 25. His finding was that when exposed to their iPhones those 16 experienced a ”flurry of activation in the insular cortex of the brain, which is associated with feelings of love and compassion. The subjects’ brains responded to the sound of their phones as they would respond to the presence or proximity of a girlfriend, boyfriend or family member,” according to Lindstrom.

The installation of the new equipment needed for automatic mode operation was successful and the Company is now running production on the new tool in automatic mode. Samples of displays from the new machine were provided to customers and performed well based on their tests. eMagin is nearing completion of its own reliability testing (a long duration 1,000 hours testing) of the displays, which is showing positive results. The testing will conclude in mid-September, after which displays from the new machine, including those in inventory, can be shipped to fill customer orders. The new OLED deposition machine is replacing the Company’s current Satella machine for production purposes. The Satella will continue to be used primarily for research and development of next-generation microdisplays. The new machine provides significant advantages, including more up time, reduced maintenance, improved consistency, higher overall quality, greater speed of production and higher yield. Andrew Sculley, president and CEO of eMagin, commented, “Automated operation of our new state-of-the-art OLED deposition machine is a significant achievement by our team that will enable us to increase production and address the most demanding applications from the military, industrial, consumer and medical markets.” About eMagin Corporation A leader in OLED microdisplay technology, OLED microdisplay manufacturing know-how and mobile display systems, eMagin manufactures high-resolution OLED microdisplays and integrates them with magnifying optics to deliver virtual images comparable to large-screen computer and television displays in portable, low-power, lightweight personal displays. eMagin microdisplays provide near-eye imagery in a variety of products from military, industrial, medical and consumer OEMs. More information about eMagin is available at</Msg><Username>zeroletdown</Username><Timestamp>1347376840003</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 11:20:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347376922361-369</Id><Topic><Title>Red close is imminent</Title><Username>risc6k</Username><Timestamp>1347376799340</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 11:19:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>$725 is imminent.</Msg><Username>bone412000</Username><Timestamp>1347376922361</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 11:22:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347376927840-370</Id><Title>nate silver 538 blog in ny times</Title><Msg>the best in the business and no hes not a gay black marxist libturd on welfare. analyzes the race as follows..percentage obama wil win..83 percent..electoral college obama 313 mitt just over 200....sorry..suicide is your best option</Msg><Username>martikinz</Username><Timestamp>1347376927840</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 11:22:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347377077347-371</Id><Title>Options priced for big up move</Title><Msg>MM's collecting premiums</Msg><Username>i5unknown</Username><Timestamp>1347377077347</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 11:24:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347377096538-372</Id><Topic><Title>Fummiebucket, Fummiebucket come out come out wherever your are...lol</Title><Username>tradetheseknuts</Username><Timestamp>1347376685505</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 11:18:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>sounds like you NEED some sound advice on a trade...

(Image credit: AFP/Getty Images via @daylife) Will you be one of the eight million people expected to pay $600 for an Apple (AAPL) iPhone 5S later this year? If so, you will be contributing to some 32,000 students who were forced to work on the Foxconn assembly line building your order — or face expulsion from school. The New York Times reports that Foxconn claimed that it employs 32,000 “interns” — 2.7% of its 1.2 million workers in China. Foxconn says that schools “recruit the students under the supervision of the local government, and the schools also assign teachers to accompany and monitor the students throughout their internship.” But this bland statement may mask a more basic reality — those “interns” are being offered a choice of working in the Foxconn factory to meet demand for the iPhone 5S or getting kicked out of school. Li Qiang, founder of China Labor Watch, told the Times that as recently September 9 he learned that 10 if 87 workers on one iPhone assembly line were “interns.” And as Li said, they “don’t want to work there — they want to learn. But if they don’t work, they are told they will not graduate, because it is a very busy time with the new iPhone coming, and Foxconn does not have enough workers without the students.” But if a JP Morgan Chase (JPM) is right, eight million people will pay $600 to buy the soon-to-be-unveiled iPhone 5S. Even without taking into account the moral cost of buying a product that is built on the backs of the misery of 32,000 student interns, you are grossly over-paying for the “brand.” That’s because Apple is exercising an enormous competitive advantage at your expense and that of its workers and suppliers. It has managed to drive a huge wedge between what people are willing to pay and its cost to satisfy that demand. How so? Your iPhone’s price is 44% higher than the Lumia’s — looks to me like overpaying — while Apple takes home a whopping 71% gross margin — compared to Nokia’s 54%. Consider the comparison of the prices and bill of materials cost for the iPhone 4S and the Nokia (NOK) Lumia 900. According to iMore, the iPhone’s price is $649 while the total cost of all its components — an incomplete cost measure — is $190; whereas the Lumia 900 sells for $450 and its parts cost $209. As for the moral cost of building your iPhone, in January we learned that 23 people had died and 273 has been injured building your iWorld, including 19 who committed suicide at the Foxconn factory by “jumping or falling” off of its factory or dormitory buildings between 2008 and 2010; Four – including Mr. Lai — who died in two factory explosions at Foxconn and another 77 who were injured in them; 137 Wintek workers injured due to the use of a fast-evaporating chemical used to polish iPad screens; and 59 injured during a December 2011 Foxconn plant explosion in Shanghai. I am hoping that’s all in the past now. But it leads to a question: Why will virtually every Apple product owner react to this discussion as they would to an attack on a loved one? The answer to that is fairly simple: the iPhone stimulates the same part of the human brain that activates when you are near people you love. In September 2011, Martin Lindstrom wrote in the New York Times that he conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment on eight men and eight women between the ages of 18 and 25. His finding was that when exposed to their iPhones those 16 experienced a ”flurry of activation in the insular cortex of the brain, which is associated with feelings of love and compassion. The subjects’ brains responded to the sound of their phones as they would respond to the presence or proximity of a girlfriend, boyfriend or family member,” according to Lindstrom. As Lindstrom concluded, you love your iPhone and if JP Morgan Chase is right, eight million of you won’t let a little thing — like costing 32,000 Chinese students their education — keep you from spending $600 to smear your fingerprints all over your loved one’s glass screen.</Msg><Username>mercelena66</Username><Timestamp>1347377571053</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 11:32:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347377600862-384</Id><Title>on your mark. get set.

Li Qiang, founder of China Labor Watch, told the Times that as recently September 9 he learned that 10 if 87 workers on one iPhone assembly line were “interns.” And as Li said, they “don’t want to work there — they want to learn. But if they don’t work, they are told they will not graduate, because it is a very busy time with the new iPhone coming, and Foxconn does not have enough workers without the students.” But if a JP Morgan Chase (JPM) is right, eight million people will pay $600 to buy the soon-to-be-unveiled iPhone 5S. Even without taking into account the moral cost of buying a product that is built on the backs of the misery of 32,000 student interns, you are grossly over-paying for the “brand.” That’s because Apple is exercising an enormous competitive advantage at your expense and that of its workers and suppliers. It has managed to drive a huge wedge between what people are willing to pay and its cost to satisfy that demand. How so? Your iPhone’s price is 44% higher than the Lumia’s — looks to me like overpaying — while Apple takes home a whopping 71% gross margin — compared to Nokia’s 54%. Consider the comparison of the prices and bill of materials cost for the iPhone 4S and the Nokia (NOK) Lumia 900. According to iMore, the iPhone’s price is $649 while the total cost of all its components — an incomplete cost measure — is $190; whereas the Lumia 900 sells for $450 and its parts cost $209. As for the moral cost of building your iPhone, in January we learned that 23 people had died and 273 has been injured building your iWorld, including 19 who committed suicide at the Foxconn factory by “jumping or falling” off of its factory or dormitory buildings between 2008 and 2010; Four – including Mr. Lai — who died in two factory explosions at Foxconn and another 77 who were injured in them; 137 Wintek workers injured due to the use of a fast-evaporating chemical used to polish iPad screens; and 59 injured during a December 2011 Foxconn plant explosion in Shanghai. I am hoping that’s all in the past now. But it leads to a question: Why will virtually every Apple product owner react to this discussion as they would to an attack on a loved one? The answer to that is fairly simple: the iPhone stimulates the same part of the human brain that activates when you are near people you love. In September 2011, Martin Lindstrom wrote in the New York Times that he conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment on eight men and eight women between the ages of 18 and 25. His finding was that when exposed to their iPhones those 16 experienced a ”flurry of activation in the insular cortex of the brain, which is associated with feelings of love and compassion. The subjects’ brains responded to the sound of their phones as they would respond to the presence or proximity of a girlfriend, boyfriend or family member,” according to Lindstrom. As Lindstrom concluded, you love your iPhone and if JP Morgan Chase is right, eight million of you won’t let a little thing — like costing 32,000 Chinese students their education — keep you from spending $600 to smear your fingerprints all over your loved one’s glass screen.</Msg><Username>mercelena66</Username><Timestamp>1347377652255</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 11:34:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347377664421-387</Id><Topic><Title>670.15 NEXT BUY SIGNAL</Title><Username>bigghowie</Username><Timestamp>1347377403685</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 11:30:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Do not wait for order just buy beacuse at 2PM Announcement of QE by FED ( news conference)</Msg><Username>election00</Username><Timestamp>1347377664421</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 11:34:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347377686974-388</Id><Topic><Title>670.15 NEXT BUY SIGNAL</Title><Username>bigghowie</Username><Timestamp>1347377403685</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 11:30:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If I were you buy here and look for 778 780 close today</Msg><Username>election00</Username><Timestamp>1347377686974</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 11:34:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347377688044-389</Id><Topic><Title>670.15 NEXT BUY SIGNAL</Title><Username>bigghowie</Username><Timestamp>1347377403685</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 11:30:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>not so profitable to wait til Buy Signal; -- kind of like not long ago IBD said wait for Buy Point of 620, and the price at that time was just under 600. fundamentals rule, here; dont let Technicolor chart mumbo jumbo cost you!</Msg><Username>matthyatt511</Username><Timestamp>1347377688044</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 11:34:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347377766437-390</Id><Title>And the spread tightens</Title><Msg>Hmmmmmm</Msg><Username>i5unknown</Username><Timestamp>1347377766437</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 11:36:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347377876095-391</Id><Title>three tight weeks forming</Title><Msg>look out shortie. 720 next week.</Msg><Username>futuresrnow</Username><Timestamp>1347377876095</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 11:37:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347377911362-392</Id><Title>How often</Title><Msg>Do you see AAPL consolidate in a $2 range mid-day?

The company is suing prominent Android makers such as Motorola, Samsung and HTC in various worldwide markets alleging that they’re infringing certain patents related to iPhone, iPad and iOS. On their part, those companies are countersuing Apple and bringing their own patent claims to courts, with Google not having been directly involved in any of these lawsuits until now. As many of you already know, Google has been recently approved to purchase Motorola and the Search giant will now be actively involved in Motorola’s legal battles with the iPhone maker. Reuters on Wednesday reported that Apple and Motorola will face each other “at a crucial hearing” in Chicago where their legal advisors are scheduled to make their cases in a hearing presided by Federal Judge Richard Posner. That’s the same judge that decided to dismiss Apple’s case against Motorola a few weeks ago, only to quickly change his mind and grant a new hearing to the two companies.</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1347378585320</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 11:49:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347378747555-404</Id><Title>iPhone 5 launch to trigger 4G LTE-related legal action from Samsung, report confirms</Title><Msg>BlogPhonesTablets Home | News | Reviews | Phones | Tablets | Apps | Root | VS | How To | FeaturedTRENDING: #Jelly Bean #Galaxy Note 2 Next Amazon New Kindle Fire vs Kobo Arc Amazon Kindle Fire HD (8.9) vs Apple iPad 3 Amazon could cut Google out of the Android party Samsung Galaxy Note 2 – everything you need to know about the Jelly Bean phablet before launch Previous Previous Post Next Post iPhone 5 launch to trigger 4G LTE-related legal action from Samsung, report confirms by Chris Smith on Sep 11, 2012 with 4 Comments In case the title above sounds familiar that’s because we have already talked about this scenario – Samsung taking legal action against Apple once the iPhone 5, the sixth-generation iOS smartphone that will reportedly come with 4G LTE support, gets launched. Now, a new Korea Times report reveals that Samsung is indeed very interested in pursuing an LTE-based case against Apple, and it will do so as soon as the new iPhone 5 is unveiled and launched: Samsung Electronics will sue Apple over its release of the iPhone 5 for infringing on its fourth-generation (4G) long-term evolution (LTE) connectivity patents, according to industry sources, Monday. “It’s true that Samsung Electronics has decided to take immediate legal action against the Cupertino-based Apple. Countries in Europe and even the United States ― Apple’s home-turf ― are our primary targets,” said an industry source. The new iPhone is going to be announced during a special September 12 event, and released on September 21, according to some informed rumors, so we can only assume that a coordinated U.S. and European Samsung attack will follow very soon after that, although specifics are not clear on the matter. Previous reports on the next iPhone’s 4G LTE support revealed that while Apple is beefing up its already consistent LTE patent portfolio, HTC is also very interested in obtaining an LTE-based ban in the U.S. with the International Trade Commission. What about FRAND patents? Are the new 4G LTE patents also standard essential? In which case, would Apple have an easier time defending against any claim, just as it did in the recent U.S. Apple vs Samsung court? Here’s what another source told the newspaper: “Apple claimed the existing 3G-related patents are standard essential patents (SEPs) according to our earlier commitment to the FRAND (fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory) terms. But the story is totally different when you talk about LTE patents. These are new and highly-valued.” But since 4G LTE is going to be the new standard for post 3G and 3.5G telecommunications, chances are that all, if not most, LTE patents out there will be soon labeled as FRAND, if they aren’t already. In which case, any FRAND-based court dispute between any party involved is likely not to end up with injunctions or high royalty and damages payments. In case you thought the Apple vs Samsung conflict is nearing its end, grab some popcorn, as more legal action is coming. We’ll report on all the Samsung upcoming legal proceedings against the new handset in the following days and weeks.</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1347378747555</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 11:52:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347378864498-405</Id><Topic><Title>657 tomorrow , if not today</Title><Username>aea_62</Username><Timestamp>1347378815543</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 11:53:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Very scare, but it truce.....</Msg><Username>argtam</Username><Timestamp>1347378864498</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 11:54:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347378879883-406</Id><Title>GERMANS.

They have has another 12 months to polish this up and make it better. IF IT DOES TURN OUT TO BE A MEDIOCRE release then watch out. This could be the end of AAPL's dynasty. I was #$%$ that NOKIA didn't announce ship dates, but they did set the bar on what the next handset should be. Go watch the 920 youtube hands on demos. That is a sweet phone. SO, if the IPhone 5 is not kick asshss then I will be dumping all my shares I have held since I bought at 80$ (wish I bought more hahaha). Not being a hater, just being honest.

This follows on the heels of the intense scrutiny Apple (AAPL) and Foxconn faced last year, in the wake of a fabricated report that Foxconn employed workers as young as 13 and paid them like slaves. In response, Apple stepped up its commitment to monitoring its supply chain. So I guess Apple hippie don't care that their beloved Apple uses slaves to build their products LOL Apple is gonna die slowly.

It may be a smooth ride and a business as usual for Apple Inc. (APPL) but what if technology giant doesn’t live with public’s expectations, after all tomorrow’s event is probably just another product announcement where its iPhone 5 will be demonstrated and it’s availability date declared. Although Industry analysts are already predicting that Apple’s iPhone 5will be the best-selling smartphone of all times but it may turn other way around as there is not much different than its evolutionary predecessor iPhone4 S in term of fans hype. Expectations are high this time for iPhone 5 as Apple played foul of its fans previously, when it introduced iPhone4S with little changes dogged by poor signal problem after promising a total revolutionary product. Although iPhone was top-selling mobile phone since its debut in 2007 and every new iPhone version outsold its predecessor. But apart from iOS 6 and improved Siri integration, there is not much for Apple fans to cheer for the coming handset."</Msg><Username>mhundubey</Username><Timestamp>1347382024337</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 12:47:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347382089414-507</Id><Title>Want a quality bargain?</Title><Msg>Buy FB LOL Zuckerberg couldn't tie a tie Laughable Next Jobs, NOT</Msg><Username>i5unknown</Username><Timestamp>1347382089414</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 12:48:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347382126213-508</Id><Title>S&amp;P 500 Morning Call...</Title><Msg>we did a lot of trading today so 'bear' with us... sorry for being this late... here goes... PIVOT today is 1437-1438 yesterday's market trading had leaking due to the court ruling in germany wich could mean lower prices in stocks if they vote not for the europe bank bailouts... but more important was yesterday's AAPL red-dog-reversal... which was an island-reversal and took out under friday's-day-low... this turned the market sour and everyone began to re-think their position especially in the AAPL stock... this turn made bulls cancel their buy order across the QQQ and the stock market wouldn't find a floor until late in the session... and the S&amp;P 500 couldn't do much better at at 1438-area... then the sellers came out in full-force... but if it were not for the dumping going on in the QQQ and AAPL then most of the SPX time trading would have been spent at the 1335-1338-area let's talk today's trading now... pre-market SPX is positive but hadn't broken the 1428-area... so tomorrow's bank-bailout is important... open your newspapers to the heard on the street.. worth reading today... it talks about AAPL iPhone evolution risk... the article ends with the idea of AAPL always having to release a new product every half-year... and it has to be a #1 hit each time or else... and this is going to be tougher to do each release and we will explain why that is so in another post after we get all of today's data to you so let's get back to the S&amp;P 500 for today... PIVOT 1438-1439 should be a top on it's first visit at that pit-stop... and a drop is expected down to the 1432-area... this is a area that must hold up or there could be more trouble... overall we think buying the 1438-1439 area is a mistake today and it will be hard to turn a profit if you are a bull as a first time buyer up there today... so today the 1438-area is most likely a bull-trapper... do not buy hand over fist today Mr. Bully or you will not like yourself in the mirror later today Bull Scenario today... if you get over 1438-area then you got a shot at 1445-area Bear Scenario today... gotta stop the break-over-1439 we will post a lot more in just a moment on other items to be discussed... thanks for your patience</Msg><Username>funniebucket</Username><Timestamp>1347382126213</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 12:48:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347382131048-509</Id><Topic><Title>Burn those options</Title><Username>i5unknown</Username><Timestamp>1347381925134</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 12:45:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yep... same game, different week.</Msg><Username>davidch14</Username><Timestamp>1347382131048</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 12:48:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347382141913-510</Id><Title>DUMP DUMP DUMP CONTINUES</Title><Msg>Aaple can sue and waste all time and loose market share ..great keep up good work</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1347382141913</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 12:49:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347382151558-511</Id><Topic><Title>Another Apple Scandal POOR BUSINESS ETHICS</Title><Username>syecapsys</Username><Timestamp>1347382010374</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 12:46:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Just like last year NYTimes sucks</Msg><Username>mugardisgreat</Username><Timestamp>1347382151558</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 12:49:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347382175101-512</Id><Title>Now there is another buy point</Title><Msg>Keep getting this stuff cheap Wed will be a nice pay day</Msg><Username>i5unknown</Username><Timestamp>1347382175101</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 12:49:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347382209046-513</Id><Title>Was that the kiss of death?</Title><Msg>I don't know if it was Pete or John Nejarian who said he would not buy ahead of iPhone 5 release.

With the stock up 11 percent in the last 30 days leading up to the event and trading near all-time highs, investors are frantically asking: "what will happen now?" Well, JP Morgan has done the legwork for you based on past share price performance pre- and post product announcements. See the table below. The gist of their research suggests that while shares may see some weakness immediately following the announcement, on average they are 5.2 percent higher 30 days after. Over a longer-term horizon they are massively higher. In fact, Apple's stock is up 453 percent since the release of iPhone 2G version on June 29, 2007, versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of 7 percent. JPMorgan is recommending investors take advantage of any near-term selling pressure on the iPhone 5 announcement to buy the stock. They rate shares an Overweight with a $770 price target.</Msg><Username>election00</Username><Timestamp>1347383010077</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 13:03:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347383012364-540</Id><Title>China Mobile</Title><Msg>LTE capabilities makes the iPhone 5 "more global" ....... sets stage for Chna Mobile (1 billion subs) announcement.</Msg><Username>onlyup1331</Username><Timestamp>1347383012364</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 13:03:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347383019037-541</Id><Topic><Title>Again CNBC with their bash killed AAPL trade</Title><Username>israelmichel</Username><Timestamp>1347382773040</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 12:59:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Adami loses house with short positions Seymour lets him in the back door</Msg><Username>i5unknown</Username><Timestamp>1347383019037</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 13:03:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347383033295-542</Id><Title>target 800</Title><Msg>UPDATE: Investors Prep for Apple (AAPL) iPhone 5 Trading 12:40 PM ET, 09/11/2012 - Street Insider (Updated - September 11, 201212:49 PM EDT) Apple's (Nasdaq: AAPL) iPhone 5 announcement is just one day away.

Apple is not concerned about short term share price. There are not going to release two new "huge" products at one time to create a massive pop.

Its getting where whatever the market experts suggest doing, do just the opposite.</Msg><Username>cramerstrophywife</Username><Timestamp>1347385437667</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 13:43:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347385457939-640</Id><Title>what are you longs worried for . aapl is a sure thing . money in the bank . i dont get it</Title><Msg>shorttttttttttttttt</Msg><Username>junior1rules</Username><Timestamp>1347385457939</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 13:44:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347385462069-641</Id><Title>what are you longs worried for . aapl is a sure thing . money in the bank . i dont get it</Title><Msg>shorttttttttttttttt</Msg><Username>junior1rules</Username><Timestamp>1347385462069</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 13:44:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347385497513-642</Id><Title>Aapl at $ 664.06 , buy it now, mm's are buying now</Title><Msg>...........</Msg><Username>multiuse2012</Username><Timestamp>1347385497513</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 13:44:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347385555475-643</Id><Topic><Title>Now watch as the funnie turd tries to play trade talk jeopardy with me with him playing Alex Tribec only after he goes on investopedia to look for answers</Title><Username>applrun</Username><Timestamp>1347385104530</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 13:38:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You wouldn't be so smart if you didn't have those cards in front of you Trebec</Msg><Username>i5unknown</Username><Timestamp>1347385555475</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 13:45:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347385631121-644</Id><Topic><Title>Sorry Bashers: AAPL Earnings Will Drive its Price Higher All Next Year</Title><Username>chuckpalot</Username><Timestamp>1347368542069</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 09:02:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Here we go Chuck!!! My contract with VZ is up in December. So, I will be upgrading to the 5 then. Bottom line...with iOS 6, the new iPhone will be the best smartphone on the planet. Much attention is paid to the size of the new phone and 4G. I fully expect both. But the demand will be huge for the same reason it always is...iOS and the ecosystem and the aapl "cool" factor. Add China Mobile to mix in the coming months, and 2013 is going to be very strong!! Regarding mobile payments, it sounds like Passbook is a big step in that direction. We'll see. As a long in aapl, I expect the pps needle to move up in the coming week's as initial sales numbers start hitting the media. $750 by year-end is very possible and $800 by year-end is definitely in the discussion...maybe higher if the iPad Mini hits a grand slam AND China Mobile is announced this year. Keep an eye on the post-launch product tear-downs. It will be interesting to see off qcom's chip making the new iPhone compatible with China Mobile's network is found inside. Good luck as always!!</Msg><Username>todd0888</Username><Timestamp>1347385631121</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 13:47:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347385684658-645</Id><Topic><Title>IPHONE 5 can't dissapoint</Title><Username>peashooter14</Username><Timestamp>1347379793880</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 12:09:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>3 to 1, bad boy :(</Msg><Username>bassboneman2003</Username><Timestamp>1347385684658</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 13:48:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347385732826-646</Id><Title>Hedge Funds Now Locked &amp; Loaded</Title><Msg>Stand by for takeoff.</Msg><Username>lookingforskippy</Username><Timestamp>1347385732826</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 13:48:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347385738153-647</Id><Title>volume is growing today</Title><Msg>I think we may see a rally in the afternoon once we move north of 670. jmo!</Msg><Username>ihateoptions</Username><Timestamp>1347385738153</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 13:48:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347385755140-648</Id><Topic><Title>Now watch as the funnie turd tries to play trade talk jeopardy with me with him playing Alex Tribec only after he goes on investopedia to look for answers</Title><Username>applrun</Username><Timestamp>1347385104530</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 13:38:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Lol....</Msg><Username>applrun</Username><Timestamp>1347385755140</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 13:49:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347385764252-649</Id><Topic><Title>Aapl at $ 664.06 , buy it now, mm's are buying now</Title><Username>multiuse2012</Username><Timestamp>1347385497513</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 13:44:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I bought more at 663 and 661 Loaded the boat 685 Wed afternoon Rumor of Ipad reveal tomorrow Bend over Adami</Msg><Username>i5unknown</Username><Timestamp>1347385764252</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 13:49:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347385771639-650</Id><Topic><Title>our AAPL call...</Title><Username>funniebucket</Username><Timestamp>1347382946683</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 13:02:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In conclusion, as usual, you are FOS!</Msg><Username>cotyrosenstock</Username><Timestamp>1347385771639</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 13:49:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347385801654-651</Id><Title>THE BUYING WILL BE AS RELENTLESS AS THE SELLOFF!

(AAPL) triggered a near-term sell signal when it declined to a 668 print. It followed through to 659.41 in yesterday's aftermarket session, but this morning it has recovered into the 669/670 area so far. Purely from a point-and-figure perspective, Apple needs to print 670 to trigger a rising column of blue Xs. However, the Xs do not represent a buy signal, only that the prior downleg is complete for the time being. Apple needs to claw its way to a 682 print to trigger a new buy signal. Barring such a print, current strength represents a recovery rally within a still-active sell signal. Inability of Apple to print 670, and/or a resumption of weakness that prints 662, should trigger another bout of selling pressure that projects next to 650.

Hyperbole? Maybe. But given the iPhone’s history, it’s almost certain that Apple is poised to sell a ton of them at launch. The iPhone 3GS sold more than one million units during its first weekend at market. The iPhone 4 sold more than 1.7 million. And the iPhone 4S sold more than double that. So, what sort of first-weekend sales numbers can we expect for the iPhone 5, or whatever Apple chooses to call the device? More than the iPhone 4S, most likely. Potentially a lot more. “Given that the iPhone 4S received over 1 million pre-orders in the first 24 hours, we expect at least 1.3 million to 1.5 million pre-orders for the iPhone 5,” says Topeka analyst Brian White. “Assuming supply chain constraints aren’t a major issue and the seven country rollout ensues, we believe at least 5 million to 5.5 million iPhone 5’s can be sold in [the first three days].” Raymond James director Tavis McCourt offered a first-weekend sales estimate in the same ballpark. “Apple sold four million iPhone 4Ss in the first weekend of availability last year, and the iPhone 4 sold 1.7 million,” McCourt told AllThingsD. “We expect five million to six million to be a reasonable estimate of first-weekend sales for the iPhone 5.” Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster was by far the most bullish of his colleagues, saying Apple could sell 6 million to 10 million new iPhones in the device’s first three days at market. “There is no question iPhone 5 will be the largest consumer electronics launch in history,” Munster told AllThingsD. “Given the hardware redesign it will likely crush previous iPhone launch sales.” So, upward of 5 million seems to be the developing consensus around first weekend “iPhone 5” sales. Assuming Apple begins selling the device at retail on September 21, we should find out how close that estimate is to reality on September 23 or 24, when Apple broadcasts the inevitable “iPhone 5 Sales Top ? Million” press release.</Msg><Username>kibbles_lives</Username><Timestamp>1347386785055</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 14:06:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347386786859-692</Id><Title>CALLS PRICED HIGHER DOWN HERE THAN HOUR AGO</Title><Msg>GOING SHARPLY HIGHER</Msg><Username>bigghowie</Username><Timestamp>1347386786859</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 14:06:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347386815735-693</Id><Title>Galaxy Note 2 Rules!!!</Title><Msg>Apple about to be rotten apple!!!

Cupertino-based Apple's new phone, which is expected to be released Wednesday, will add between a quarter and a half percent to the GDP in the fourth quarter, according to Michael Feroli, chief economist at J.P. Morgan. Reuters reports that using Feroli's math, the U.S. can count about $400 from each of the anticipated 8 million iPhone sales into the GDP. The new iPhone release comes as Bellevue-based T-Mobile ramps up efforts to entice iPhone users to “unlock” their phones from AT&amp;T’s network and bring them over to T-Mobile’s network. In other iPhone 5 launch news, Apple contractor Foxconn is being accused of forcing interns from Chinese vocational schools to work at Foxconn factories to help fill orders related to Apple’s new iPhone.</Msg><Username>cchaker</Username><Timestamp>1347387351396</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 14:15:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347387351530-708</Id><Topic><Title>S&amp;P 500 Morning Call...</Title><Username>funniebucket</Username><Timestamp>1347382126213</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 12:48:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>the difference is when we say it that means its true... when you say it that doesn't mean much</Msg><Username>funniebucket</Username><Timestamp>1347387351530</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 14:15:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347387395132-709</Id><Topic><Title>I-Phone is technically inferior</Title><Username>shortburner2013</Username><Timestamp>1347386912728</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 14:08:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Your chosen method of comparison COMPLETELY misses why the iPhone, specifically, and all APPLE products are far superior...and will be for the foreseeable future.

Here's how it generally goes: Q-Has your galaxy ever locked up or had malware? A-Yes. Like twice. Conclusion-iPhones are far more stable and secure. Q-When you have a question regarding your phone, do you find the Verizon/AT&amp;T/Sprint stores to be of any use at all? A-No. They're predominantly young kids and have to go in the back and look up how to unlock my phone. Conclusion-Apple offers stores with employees that are second to none when it comes to fixing problems. That is, when an iPhone has a problem, and I'd bet for every problem an Apple phone has, an Android phone has 10. Overall, the Samsung Android line is a cheap plastic version on the outside and a feeble attempt to match iOS on the inside. Samsung released 4G LTE models far sooner than they should have, simply because they needed to showcase their speed as better, the heck with it only being available in 10% of the country at the time. Also, they had to make the screen larger, simply because they can't match the quality of the construction on the inside. They did the 2 simplest things possible, in that they copied everything and made the screen bigger and the speed (supposedly) faster. But when it comes to true innovation, they've still yet to bring ONE true "wow" moment to the table. Apple has done that with virtually every release. Then Samsung copies. Hardly a "superior" company or phone. Remember, Samsung has sold about 10 million Galaxy S III's over the past 3 or so months. Let's see how long it takes iPhone5 to do that. My guess one week. It's all about user experience and the superior ecosystem. Samsung and Android barely have the former and have yet to even try the latter. And that's why Apple will continue to dominate.</Msg><Username>scropos21</Username><Timestamp>1347387828306</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 14:23:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347387839556-732</Id><Topic><Title>nows the time to buy for the iPHONE relase - go baby go!</Title><Username>superventure</Username><Timestamp>1347387544388</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 14:19:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>loaded up tons of weekly calls - for the 20 point all time move. already up big - keep buying boys</Msg><Username>superventure</Username><Timestamp>1347387839556</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 14:23:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347387856634-733</Id><Title>SELL OFF already happened..gonna laugh if this SKIES tommorow</Title><Msg>does the OPP of what people are hoping. and obvously everyone wanrts a sell off now</Msg><Username>cwtripps</Username><Timestamp>1347387856634</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 14:24:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347387891810-734</Id><Title>Tomorrow Up 30 Points</Title><Msg>BUY BUY BUY</Msg><Username>flexibleshoe245</Username><Timestamp>1347387891810</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 14:24:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347387900286-735</Id><Topic><Title>nows the time to buy for the iPHONE relase - go baby go!</Title><Username>superventure</Username><Timestamp>1347387544388</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 14:19:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Apple has millions of loyal iPhone customers.

Developers and IT professionals from around the globe come together for the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference that runs 11-15 June to connect with Apple engineers and get a firsthand look at the latest technologies. (Image credit: AFP/Getty Images via @daylife) Will you be one of the eight million people expected to pay $600 for an Apple (AAPL) iPhone 5S later this year? If so, you will be contributing to some 32,000 students who were forced to work on the Foxconn assembly line building your order — or face expulsion from school. The New York Times reports that Foxconn claimed that it employs 32,000 “interns” — 2.7% of its 1.2 million workers in China. Foxconn says that schools “recruit the students under the supervision of the local government, and the schools also assign teachers to accompany and monitor the students throughout their internship.” But this bland statement may mask a more basic reality — those “interns” are being offered a choice of working in the Foxconn factory to meet demand for the iPhone 5S or getting kicked out of school. Li Qiang, founder of China Labor Watch, told the Times that as recently September 9 he learned that 10 if 87 workers on one iPhone assembly line were “interns.” And as Li said, they “don’t want to work there — they want to learn. But if they don’t work, they are told they will not graduate, because it is a very busy time with the new iPhone coming, and Foxconn does not have enough workers without the students.” But if a JP Morgan Chase (JPM) is right, eight million people will pay $600 to buy the soon-to-be-unveiled iPhone 5S. Even without taking into account the moral cost of buying a product that is built on the backs of the misery of 32,000 student interns, you are grossly over-paying for the “brand.” That’s because Apple is exercising an enormous competitive advantage at your expense and that of its workers and suppliers. It has managed to drive a huge wedge between what people are willing to pay and its cost to satisfy that demand. How so? Your iPhone’s price is 44% higher than the Lumia’s — looks to me like overpaying — while Apple takes home a whopping 71% gross margin — compared to Nokia’s 54%. Consider the comparison of the prices and bill of materials cost for the iPhone 4S and the Nokia (NOK) Lumia 900. According to iMore, the iPhone’s price is $649 while the total cost of all its components — an incomplete cost measure — is $190; whereas the Lumia 900 sells for $450 and its parts cost $209. As for the moral cost of building your iPhone, in January we learned that 23 people had died and 273 has been injured building your iWorld, including 19 who committed suicide at the Foxconn factory by “jumping or falling” off of its factory or dormitory buildings between 2008 and 2010; Four – including Mr. Lai — who died in two factory explosions at Foxconn and another 77 who were injured in them; 137 Wintek workers injured due to the use of a fast-evaporating chemical used to polish iPad screens; and 59 injured during a December 2011 Foxconn plant explosion in Shanghai. I am hoping that’s all in the past now. But it leads to a question: Why will virtually every Apple product owner react to this discussion as they would to an attack on a loved one? The answer to that is fairly simple: the iPhone stimulates the same part of the human brain that activates when you are near people you love. In September 2011, Martin Lindstrom wrote in the New York Times that he conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment on eight men and eight women between the ages of 18 and 25. His finding was that when exposed to their iPhones those 16 experienced a ”flurry of activation in the insular cortex of the brain, which is associated with feelings of love and compassion. The subjects’ brains responded to the sound of their phones as they would respond to the presence or proximity of a girlfriend, boyfriend or family member,” according to Lindstrom. As Lindstrom concluded, you love your iPhone and if JP Morgan Chase is right, eight million of you won’t let a little thing — like costing 32,000 Chinese students their education — keep you from spending $600 to smear your fingerprints all over your loved one’s glass screen.</Msg><Username>mercelena66</Username><Timestamp>1347390492840</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 15:08:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347390506404-833</Id><Title>bottom done been reach....recovery still to do, today and Tomorrow...rest of month.</Title><Msg>very high probability approach 700 soon...</Msg><Username>matthyatt511</Username><Timestamp>1347390506404</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 15:08:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347390523518-834</Id><Topic><Title>Long 1400shs aapl at 675.23 (for myself)</Title><Username>sonw_62</Username><Timestamp>1346961079411</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 15:51:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ggggggggggggggggggggggggg</Msg><Username>thecramerflipflop</Username><Timestamp>1347390523518</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 15:08:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347390542347-835</Id><Topic><Title>Long 1400shs aapl at 675.72 (for myself)......</Title><Username>sonw_62</Username><Timestamp>1347287657517</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-10 10:34:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>gggggggggggggggggg</Msg><Username>thecramerflipflop</Username><Timestamp>1347390542347</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 15:09:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347390543220-836</Id><Title>Above 720 next 9 days after Iphone 5 announce, that;s what happe in Iphone 4 and Iphone 4s</Title><Msg>I charted last two year introduction of Iphone 4 in 2009 and Iphone 4s in 2011, both drop 2 days exactly like last two days and then paraobolic increase 8%/11% respectivebly for 9 days after Iphone 4/4s announced.

I am hoping that’s all in the past now. But it leads to a question: Why will virtually every Apple product owner react to this discussion as they would to an attack on a loved one? The answer to that is fairly simple: the iPhone stimulates the same part of the human brain that activates when you are near people you love. In September 2011, Martin Lindstrom wrote in the New York Times that he conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment on eight men and eight women between the ages of 18 and 25. His finding was that when exposed to their iPhones those 16 experienced a ”flurry of activation in the insular cortex of the brain, which is associated with feelings of love and compassion. The subjects’ brains responded to the sound of their phones as they would respond to the presence or proximity of a girlfriend, boyfriend or family member,” according to Lindstrom. As Lindstrom concluded, you love your iPhone and if JP Morgan Chase is right, eight million of you won’t let a little thing — like costing 32,000 Chinese students their education — keep you from spending $600 to smear your fingerprints all over your loved one’s glass screen.</Msg><Username>mercelena66</Username><Timestamp>1347390648667</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 15:10:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347390682584-840</Id><Topic><Title>if you want , you can wait for my call before buy</Title><Username>aea_62</Username><Timestamp>1347390175467</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 15:02:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>OK, waiting</Msg><Username>blackplague8</Username><Timestamp>1347390682584</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 15:11:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347390686701-841</Id><Title>Maybe If Apple Broke Out Profits On Phones In Earnings This Would Be Easier</Title><Msg>The Cost To Keep All Those Beautiful Apple Store Lights On Have To Be Staggering.

Developers and IT professionals from around the globe come together for the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference that runs 11-15 June to connect with Apple engineers and get a firsthand look at the latest technologies. (Image credit: AFP/Getty Images via @daylife) Will you be one of the eight million people expected to pay $600 for an Apple (AAPL) iPhone 5S later this year? If so, you will be contributing to some 32,000 students who were forced to work on the Foxconn assembly line building your order — or face expulsion from school. The New York Times reports that Foxconn claimed that it employs 32,000 “interns” — 2.7% of its 1.2 million workers in China. Foxconn says that schools “recruit the students under the supervision of the local government, and the schools also assign teachers to accompany and monitor the students throughout their internship.” But this bland statement may mask a more basic reality — those “interns” are being offered a choice of working in the Foxconn factory to meet demand for the iPhone 5S or getting kicked out of school. Li Qiang, founder of China Labor Watch, told the Times that as recently September 9 he learned that 10 if 87 workers on one iPhone assembly line were “interns.” And as Li said, they “don’t want to work there — they want to learn. But if they don’t work, they are told they will not graduate, because it is a very busy time with the new iPhone coming, and Foxconn does not have enough workers without the students.” But if a JP Morgan Chase (JPM) is right, eight million people will pay $600 to buy the soon-to-be-unveiled iPhone 5S. Even without taking into account the moral cost of buying a product that is built on the backs of the misery of 32,000 student interns, you are grossly over-paying for the “brand.” That’s because Apple is exercising an enormous competitive advantage at your expense and that of its workers and suppliers. It has managed to drive a huge wedge between what people are willing to pay and its cost to satisfy that demand. How so? Your iPhone’s price is 44% higher than the Lumia’s — looks to me like overpaying — while Apple takes home a whopping 71% gross margin — compared to Nokia’s 54%. Consider the comparison of the prices and bill of materials cost for the iPhone 4S and the Nokia (NOK) Lumia 900. According to iMore, the iPhone’s price is $649 while the total cost of all its components — an incomplete cost measure — is $190; whereas the Lumia 900 sells for $450 and its parts cost $209. As for the moral cost of building your iPhone, in January we learned that 23 people had died and 273 has been injured building your iWorld, including 19 who committed suicide at the Foxconn factory by “jumping or falling” off of its factory or dormitory buildings between 2008 and 2010; Four – including Mr. Lai — who died in two factory explosions at Foxconn and another 77 who were injured in them; 137 Wintek workers injured due to the use of a fast-evaporating chemical used to polish iPad screens; and 59 injured during a December 2011 Foxconn plant explosion in Shanghai. I am hoping that’s all in the past now. But it leads to a question: Why will virtually every Apple product owner react to this discussion as they would to an attack on a loved one? The answer to that is fairly simple: the iPhone stimulates the same part of the human brain that activates when you are near people you love. In September 2011, Martin Lindstrom wrote in the New York Times that he conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment on eight men and eight women between the ages of 18 and 25. His finding was that when exposed to their iPhones those 16 experienced a ”flurry of activation in the insular cortex of the brain, which is associated with feelings of love and compassion. The subjects’ brains responded to the sound of their phones as they would respond to the presence or proximity of a girlfriend, boyfriend or family member,” according to Lindstrom. As Lindstrom concluded, you love your iPhone and if JP Morgan Chase is right, eight million of you won’t let a little thing — like costing 32,000 Chinese students their education — keep you from spending $600 to smear your fingerprints all over your loved one’s glass screen.</Msg><Username>mercelena66</Username><Timestamp>1347391501564</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 15:25:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347391517356-879</Id><Topic><Title>if you want , you can wait for my call see we should buy or not</Title><Username>aea_62</Username><Timestamp>1347391396856</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 15:23:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>we wait and be patient in dentist chair for xray to develop... thanks</Msg><Username>funniebucket</Username><Timestamp>1347391517356</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 15:25:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347391518375-880</Id><Title>36 minutes to go</Title><Msg>New day tomorrow</Msg><Username>i5unknown</Username><Timestamp>1347391518375</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 15:25:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347391521065-881</Id><Topic><Title>FunnieBucket has done it again...</Title><Username>funniebucket</Username><Timestamp>1347391377793</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 15:22:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>FB you buying AAPL per earlier thoughts here or still waiting ?</Msg><Username>duncvc</Username><Timestamp>1347391521065</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 15:25:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347391536098-882</Id><Title>Thanks Samsung for the 680ish ceiling</Title><Msg>Great point of reference to short</Msg><Username>hugsforfree00</Username><Timestamp>1347391536098</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 15:25:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347391562763-883</Id><Title>So Scared</Title><Msg>Horrible that all of you are so scared.

If so, you will be contributing to some 32,000 students who were forced to work on the Foxconn assembly line building your order — or face expulsion from school. The New York Times reports that Foxconn claimed that it employs 32,000 “interns” — 2.7% of its 1.2 million workers in China. Foxconn says that schools “recruit the students under the supervision of the local government, and the schools also assign teachers to accompany and monitor the students throughout their internship.” But this bland statement may mask a more basic reality — those “interns” are being offered a choice of working in the Foxconn factory to meet demand for the iPhone 5S or getting kicked out of school. Li Qiang, founder of China Labor Watch, told the Times that as recently September 9 he learned that 10 if 87 workers on one iPhone assembly line were “interns.” And as Li said, they “don’t want to work there — they want to learn. But if they don’t work, they are told they will not graduate, because it is a very busy time with the new iPhone coming, and Foxconn does not have enough workers without the students.” But if a JP Morgan Chase (JPM) is right, eight million people will pay $600 to buy the soon-to-be-unveiled iPhone 5S. Even without taking into account the moral cost of buying a product that is built on the backs of the misery of 32,000 student interns, you are grossly over-paying for the “brand.” That’s because Apple is exercising an enormous competitive advantage at your expense and that of its workers and suppliers.

(Image credit: AFP/Getty Images via @daylife) Will you be one of the eight million people expected to pay $600 for an Apple (AAPL) iPhone 5S later this year? If so, you will be contributing to some 32,000 students who were forced to work on the Foxconn assembly line building your order — or face expulsion from school. The New York Times reports that Foxconn claimed that it employs 32,000 “interns” — 2.7% of its 1.2 million workers in China. Foxconn says that schools “recruit the students under the supervision of the local government, and the schools also assign teachers to accompany and monitor the students throughout their internship.” But this bland statement may mask a more basic reality — those “interns” are being offered a choice of working in the Foxconn factory to meet demand for the iPhone 5S or getting kicked out of school. Li Qiang, founder of China Labor Watch, told the Times that as recently September 9 he learned that 10 if 87 workers on one iPhone assembly line were “interns.” And as Li said, they “don’t want to work there — they want to learn. But if they don’t work, they are told they will not graduate, because it is a very busy time with the new iPhone coming, and Foxconn does not have enough workers without the students.” But if a JP Morgan Chase (JPM) is right, eight million people will pay $600 to buy the soon-to-be-unveiled iPhone 5S. Even without taking into account the moral cost of buying a product that is built on the backs of the misery of 32,000 student interns, you are grossly over-paying for the “brand.” That’s because Apple is exercising an enormous competitive advantage at your expense and that of its workers and suppliers. It has managed to drive a huge wedge between what people are willing to pay and its cost to satisfy that demand. How so? Your iPhone’s price is 44% higher than the Lumia’s — looks to me like overpaying — while Apple takes home a whopping 71% gross margin — compared to Nokia’s 54%. Consider the comparison of the prices and bill of materials cost for the iPhone 4S and the Nokia (NOK) Lumia 900. According to iMore, the iPhone’s price is $649 while the total cost of all its components — an incomplete cost measure — is $190; whereas the Lumia 900 sells for $450 and its parts cost $209. As for the moral cost of building your iPhone, in January we learned that 23 people had died and 273 has been injured building your iWorld, including 19 who committed suicide at the Foxconn factory by “jumping or falling” off of its factory or dormitory buildings between 2008 and 2010; Four – including Mr. Lai — who died in two factory explosions at Foxconn and another 77 who were injured in them; 137 Wintek workers injured due to the use of a fast-evaporating chemical used to polish iPad screens; and 59 injured during a December 2011 Foxconn plant explosion in Shanghai. I am hoping that’s all in the past now. But it leads to a question: Why will virtually every Apple product owner react to this discussion as they would to an attack on a loved one? The answer to that is fairly simple: the iPhone stimulates the same part of the human brain that activates when you are near people you love. In September 2011, Martin Lindstrom wrote in the New York Times that he conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment on eight men and eight women between the ages of 18 and 25. His finding was that when exposed to their iPhones those 16 experienced a ”flurry of activation in the insular cortex of the brain, which is associated with feelings of love and compassion. The subjects’ brains responded to the sound of their phones as they would respond to the presence or proximity of a girlfriend, boyfriend or family member,” according to Lindstrom.

As for the moral cost of building your iPhone, in January we learned that 23 people had died and 273 has been injured building your iWorld, including 19 who committed suicide at the Foxconn factory by “jumping or falling” off of its factory or dormitory buildings between 2008 and 2010; Four – including Mr. Lai — who died in two factory explosions at Foxconn and another 77 who were injured in them; 137 Wintek workers injured due to the use of a fast-evaporating chemical used to polish iPad screens; and 59 injured during a December 2011 Foxconn plant explosion in Shanghai. I am hoping that’s all in the past now. But it leads to a question: Why will virtually every Apple product owner react to this discussion as they would to an attack on a loved one? The answer to that is fairly simple: the iPhone stimulates the same part of the human brain that activates when you are near people you love. In September 2011, Martin Lindstrom wrote in the New York Times that he conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment on eight men and eight women between the ages of 18 and 25. His finding was that when exposed to their iPhones those 16 experienced a ”flurry of activation in the insular cortex of the brain, which is associated with feelings of love and compassion. The subjects’ brains responded to the sound of their phones as they would respond to the presence or proximity of a girlfriend, boyfriend or family member,” according to Lindstrom. As Lindstrom concluded, you love your iPhone and if JP Morgan Chase is right, eight million of you won’t let a little thing — like costing 32,000 Chinese students their education — keep you from spending $600 to smear your fingerprints all over your loved one’s glass screen.</Msg><Username>mercelena66</Username><Timestamp>1347392148270</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 15:35:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347392168950-922</Id><Topic><Title>I don't think there are any sellers left</Title><Username>i5unknown</Username><Timestamp>1347392099054</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 15:34:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ain't seen nothing yet brother!</Msg><Username>hugsforfree00</Username><Timestamp>1347392168950</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 15:36:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347392178466-923</Id><Topic><Title>How do you say NO in German?</Title><Username>hugsforfree00</Username><Timestamp>1347392036979</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 15:33:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>32,000 Students Choose: Build Your iPhone 5 Or Get Expelled From School Apple Inc CEO Steve Jobs discusses the iPhone during his keynote address on the opening day of the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference 2007 (WWDC 07) at the Moscone Center West in San Francisco, California 11 June 2007.

(Image credit: AFP/Getty Images via @daylife) Will you be one of the eight million people expected to pay $600 for an Apple (AAPL) iPhone 5S later this year? If so, you will be contributing to some 32,000 students who were forced to work on the Foxconn assembly line building your order — or face expulsion from school. The New York Times reports that Foxconn claimed that it employs 32,000 “interns” — 2.7% of its 1.2 million workers in China. Foxconn says that schools “recruit the students under the supervision of the local government, and the schools also assign teachers to accompany and monitor the students throughout their internship.” But this bland statement may mask a more basic reality — those “interns” are being offered a choice of working in the Foxconn factory to meet demand for the iPhone 5S or getting kicked out of school. Li Qiang, founder of China Labor Watch, told the Times that as recently September 9 he learned that 10 if 87 workers on one iPhone assembly line were “interns.” And as Li said, they “don’t want to work there — they want to learn. But if they don’t work, they are told they will not graduate, because it is a very busy time with the new iPhone coming, and Foxconn does not have enough workers without the students.” But if a JP Morgan Chase (JPM) is right, eight million people will pay $600 to buy the soon-to-be-unveiled iPhone 5S. Even without taking into account the moral cost of buying a product that is built on the backs of the misery of 32,000 student interns, you are grossly over-paying for the “brand.” That’s because Apple is exercising an enormous competitive advantage at your expense and that of its workers and suppliers. It has managed to drive a huge wedge between what people are willing to pay and its cost to satisfy that demand. How so? Your iPhone’s price is 44% higher than the Lumia’s — looks to me like overpaying — while Apple takes home a whopping 71% gross margin — compared to Nokia’s 54%. Consider the comparison of the prices and bill of materials cost for the iPhone 4S and the Nokia (NOK) Lumia 900. According to iMore, the iPhone’s price is $649 while the total cost of all its components — an incomplete cost measure — is $190; whereas the Lumia 900 sells for $450 and its parts cost $209.

Some people are simply getting out before iPhone5 is showcased. There's a large group with sentiment out there that believes that there is more downside than upside, and that if Apple unveils a great product tomorrow (and I'm sure they will) that they can get back in on Thursday without much consequence. Conversely, if the unveiling disappoints, they could get hit pretty hard. I think the logic behind selling here is justified. *I'm* not doing it, but I understand why some are. The price drop doesn't affect the product at all, so I'm not sure why people get so bent out of shape.</Msg><Username>scropos21</Username><Timestamp>1347392232776</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 15:37:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347392234367-928</Id><Topic><Title>I don't think there are any sellers left</Title><Username>i5unknown</Username><Timestamp>1347392099054</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 15:34:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>32,000 Students Choose: Build Your iPhone 5 Or Get Expelled From School Apple Inc CEO Steve Jobs discusses the iPhone during his keynote address on the opening day of the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference 2007 (WWDC 07) at the Moscone Center West in San Francisco, California 11 June 2007.

(Image credit: AFP/Getty Images via @daylife) Will you be one of the eight million people expected to pay $600 for an Apple (AAPL) iPhone 5S later this year? If so, you will be contributing to some 32,000 students who were forced to work on the Foxconn assembly line building your order — or face expulsion from school. The New York Times reports that Foxconn claimed that it employs 32,000 “interns” — 2.7% of its 1.2 million workers in China. Foxconn says that schools “recruit the students under the supervision of the local government, and the schools also assign teachers to accompany and monitor the students throughout their internship.” But this bland statement may mask a more basic reality — those “interns” are being offered a choice of working in the Foxconn factory to meet demand for the iPhone 5S or getting kicked out of school. Li Qiang, founder of China Labor Watch, told the Times that as recently September 9 he learned that 10 if 87 workers on one iPhone assembly line were “interns.” And as Li said, they “don’t want to work there — they want to learn. But if they don’t work, they are told they will not graduate, because it is a very busy time with the new iPhone coming, and Foxconn does not have enough workers without the students.” But if a JP Morgan Chase (JPM) is right, eight million people will pay $600 to buy the soon-to-be-unveiled iPhone 5S. Even without taking into account the moral cost of buying a product that is built on the backs of the misery of 32,000 student interns, you are grossly over-paying for the “brand.” That’s because Apple is exercising an enormous competitive advantage at your expense and that of its workers and suppliers. It has managed to drive a huge wedge between what people are willing to pay and its cost to satisfy that demand. How so? Your iPhone’s price is 44% higher than the Lumia’s — looks to me like overpaying — while Apple takes home a whopping 71% gross margin — compared to Nokia’s 54%. Consider the comparison of the prices and bill of materials cost for the iPhone 4S and the Nokia (NOK) Lumia 900. According to iMore, the iPhone’s price is $649 while the total cost of all its components — an incomplete cost measure — is $190; whereas the Lumia 900 sells for $450 and its parts cost $209. As for the moral cost of building your iPhone, in January we learned that 23 people had died and 273 has been injured building your iWorld, including 19 who committed suicide at the Foxconn factory by “jumping or falling” off of its factory or dormitory buildings between 2008 and 2010; Four – including Mr. Lai — who died in two factory explosions at Foxconn and another 77 who were injured in them; 137 Wintek workers injured due to the use of a fast-evaporating chemical used to polish iPad screens; and 59 injured during a December 2011 Foxconn plant explosion in Shanghai. I am hoping that’s all in the past now. But it leads to a question: Why will virtually every Apple product owner react to this discussion as they would to an attack on a loved one? The answer to that is fairly simple: the iPhone stimulates the same part of the human brain that activates when you are near people you love. In September 2011, Martin Lindstrom wrote in the New York Times that he conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment on eight men and eight women between the ages of 18 and 25. His finding was that when exposed to their iPhones those 16 experienced a ”flurry of activation in the insular cortex of the brain, which is associated with feelings of love and compassion. The subjects’ brains responded to the sound of their phones as they would respond to the presence or proximity of a girlfriend, boyfriend or family member,” according to Lindstrom. As Lindstrom concluded, you love your iPhone and if JP Morgan Chase is right, eight million of you won’t let a little thing — like costing 32,000 Chinese students their education — keep you from spending $600 to smear your fingerprints all over your loved one’s glass screen.</Msg><Username>mercelena66</Username><Timestamp>1347392366757</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 15:39:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347392371785-937</Id><Topic><Title>Cantor on CNBC</Title><Username>minorityvoter</Username><Timestamp>1347391567286</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 15:26:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I know some phds but don't know any that are democrats, in fact I don't know any democrats, oh yea, everyone I know works.</Msg><Username>bvsnplus</Username><Timestamp>1347392371785</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 15:39:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347392392718-938</Id><Title>Morning pop!

As Lindstrom concluded, you love your iPhone and if JP Morgan Chase is right, eight million of you won’t let a little thing — like costing 32,000 Chinese students their education — keep you from spending $600 to smear your fingerprints all over your loved one’s glass screen.</Msg><Username>mercelena66</Username><Timestamp>1347392565414</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 15:42:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347392600454-949</Id><Topic><Title>Cantor on CNBC</Title><Username>minorityvoter</Username><Timestamp>1347391567286</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 15:26:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>what do you have 2 master in..stupidity and ignorance</Msg><Username>martikkkins</Username><Timestamp>1347392600454</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 15:43:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347392609759-950</Id><Topic><Title>How do you say NO in German?</Title><Username>hugsforfree00</Username><Timestamp>1347392036979</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 15:33:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Uuuuhhhhhhhhh......NEIN!</Msg><Username>hugsforfree00</Username><Timestamp>1347392609759</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 15:43:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347392667434-951</Id><Title>big buys coming in for the IPHONE 5 release - smart money is in for the east 10 point up day tomorrow</Title><Msg>possible 20 points up</Msg><Username>superventure</Username><Timestamp>1347392667434</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 15:44:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347392711688-952</Id><Title>AAPL will open +12 tomorrow and close up +22</Title><Msg>as the iPHONE5 AMAZES</Msg><Username>superventure</Username><Timestamp>1347392711688</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 15:45:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347392714492-953</Id><Title>FYI</Title><Msg>It is going up big time. good bye shorts</Msg><Username>usinbelt</Username><Timestamp>1347392714492</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 15:45:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347392749399-954</Id><Title>just bought 200 weekly calls at the strike of 675</Title><Msg>go baby go</Msg><Username>superventure</Username><Timestamp>1347392749399</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 15:45:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347392763717-955</Id><Title>If the stock splits - when is the best time to announce it?</Title><Msg>If AAPL splits the stock when would it be best to make that announcement? 1:6 split just before the iPhone is shown is my guess.</Msg><Username>tastehoney</Username><Timestamp>1347392763717</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 15:46:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347392776797-956</Id><Topic><Title>sheepskinner25 was successfully added to your IGNORE LOSER list</Title><Username>aaplpiper_owns_dimmy_2012</Username><Timestamp>1347390137285</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 15:02:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Captain...sheepskinner25's ...

Listen, Apple is fine making their products as is. They bring TONS of jobs domestically, but manufacturing is a gig for another part of the world and that isn't going to ever change. Unions sucked the profits out of the auto industry, the steel industry, the airline industry and they've destroyed government and education. I think it's a FAR safer bet to keep Apple products produced abroad. Let the shareholders here reap the windfall in stock performance and dividends.

(Image credit: AFP/Getty Images via @daylife) Will you be one of the eight million people expected to pay $600 for an Apple (AAPL) iPhone 5S later this year? If so, you will be contributing to some 32,000 students who were forced to work on the Foxconn assembly line building your order — or face expulsion from school. The New York Times reports that Foxconn claimed that it employs 32,000 “interns” — 2.7% of its 1.2 million workers in China. Foxconn says that schools “recruit the students under the supervision of the local government, and the schools also assign teachers to accompany and monitor the students throughout their internship.” But this bland statement may mask a more basic reality — those “interns” are being offered a choice of working in the Foxconn factory to meet demand for the iPhone 5S or getting kicked out of school. Li Qiang, founder of China Labor Watch, told the Times that as recently September 9 he learned that 10 if 87 workers on one iPhone assembly line were “interns.” And as Li said, they “don’t want to work there — they want to learn. But if they don’t work, they are told they will not graduate, because it is a very busy time with the new iPhone coming, and Foxconn does not have enough workers without the students.” But if a JP Morgan Chase (JPM) is right, eight million people will pay $600 to buy the soon-to-be-unveiled iPhone 5S. Even without taking into account the moral cost of buying a product that is built on the backs of the misery of 32,000 student interns, you are grossly over-paying for the “brand.” That’s because Apple is exercising an enormous competitive advantage at your expense and that of its workers and suppliers. It has managed to drive a huge wedge between what people are willing to pay and its cost to satisfy that demand. How so? Your iPhone’s price is 44% higher than the Lumia’s — looks to me like overpaying — while Apple takes home a whopping 71% gross margin — compared to Nokia’s 54%. Consider the comparison of the prices and bill of materials cost for the iPhone 4S and the Nokia (NOK) Lumia 900. According to iMore, the iPhone’s price is $649 while the total cost of all its components — an incomplete cost measure — is $190; whereas the Lumia 900 sells for $450 and its parts cost $209. As for the moral cost of building your iPhone, in January we learned that 23 people had died and 273 has been injured building your iWorld, including 19 who committed suicide at the Foxconn factory by “jumping or falling” off of its factory or dormitory buildings between 2008 and 2010; Four – including Mr. Lai — who died in two factory explosions at Foxconn and another 77 who were injured in them; 137 Wintek workers injured due to the use of a fast-evaporating chemical used to polish iPad screens; and 59 injured during a December 2011 Foxconn plant explosion in Shanghai. I am hoping that’s all in the past now. But it leads to a question: Why will virtually every Apple product owner react to this discussion as they would to an attack on a loved one? The answer to that is fairly simple: the iPhone stimulates the same part of the human brain that activates when you are near people you love. In September 2011, Martin Lindstrom wrote in the New York Times that he conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment on eight men and eight women between the ages of 18 and 25. His finding was that when exposed to their iPhones those 16 experienced a ”flurry of activation in the insular cortex of the brain, which is associated with feelings of love and compassion. The subjects’ brains responded to the sound of their phones as they would respond to the presence or proximity of a girlfriend, boyfriend or family member,” according to Lindstrom. As Lindstrom concluded, you love your iPhone and if JP Morgan Chase is right, eight million of you won’t let a little thing — like costing 32,000 Chinese students their education — keep you from spending $600 to smear your fingerprints all over your loved one’s glass screen.</Msg><Username>mercelena66</Username><Timestamp>1347393463245</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 15:57:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347393482868-997</Id><Title>a negative minus a negative equals a positive</Title><Msg>a negative minus a negative equals a positive</Msg><Username>usinbelt</Username><Timestamp>1347393482868</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 15:58:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347393528789-998</Id><Topic><Title>$670 CLOSE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</Title><Username>fjprz</Username><Timestamp>1347393312568</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 15:55:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>32,000 Students Choose: Build Your iPhone 5 Or Get Expelled From School Apple Inc CEO Steve Jobs discusses the iPhone during his keynote address on the opening day of the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference 2007 (WWDC 07) at the Moscone Center West in San Francisco, California 11 June 2007.

Cory Moll, who has worked in Apple stores four and a half years, said his current wage of $14.49 an hour will rise by $2.82 an hour beginning June 30. In addition to that nearly 20-percent raise, Moll said he and other staffers will be eligible for big discounts on Apple products, including $500 off a new Mac or $250 off a new iPad. Moll, 30, said those new discounts went into effect this week.

NOT only do you have to pay 15% on capital gains but you will also be caught with AMT so plan on paying about $120k total but that still leaves you with $340k on a $5k investment which should pay a lot of bills or allow for other investments I like the advise of selling half if it wasn't for the taxes. If you still want to own aapl buy it back one month after you sell it and hold but get advantage of the tax savings this year unless Romney is reelected then continue to hold.</Msg><Username>rlbeard6734</Username><Timestamp>1347396728506</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 16:52:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347396858058-1098</Id><Topic><Title>Well!!!!!...</Title><Username>trycomsen35</Username><Timestamp>1347396706641</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 16:51:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That would be your mom.

Developers and IT professionals from around the globe come together for the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference that runs 11-15 June to connect with Apple engineers and get a firsthand look at the latest technologies. (Image credit: AFP/Getty Images via @daylife) Will you be one of the eight million people expected to pay $600 for an Apple (AAPL) iPhone 5S later this year? If so, you will be contributing to some 32,000 students who were forced to work on the Foxconn assembly line building your order — or face expulsion from school. The New York Times reports that Foxconn claimed that it employs 32,000 “interns” — 2.7% of its 1.2 million workers in China. Foxconn says that schools “recruit the students under the supervision of the local government, and the schools also assign teachers to accompany and monitor the students throughout their internship.” But this bland statement may mask a more basic reality — those “interns” are being offered a choice of working in the Foxconn factory to meet demand for the iPhone 5S or getting kicked out of school. Li Qiang, founder of China Labor Watch, told the Times that as recently September 9 he learned that 10 if 87 workers on one iPhone assembly line were “interns.” And as Li said, they “don’t want to work there — they want to learn. But if they don’t work, they are told they will not graduate, because it is a very busy time with the new iPhone coming, and Foxconn does not have enough workers without the students.” But if a JP Morgan Chase (JPM) is right, eight million people will pay $600 to buy the soon-to-be-unveiled iPhone 5S. Even without taking into account the moral cost of buying a product that is built on the backs of the misery of 32,000 student interns, you are grossly over-paying for the “brand.” That’s because Apple is exercising an enormous competitive advantage at your expense and that of its workers and suppliers. It has managed to drive a huge wedge between what people are willing to pay and its cost to satisfy that demand. How so? Your iPhone’s price is 44% higher than the Lumia’s — looks to me like overpaying — while Apple takes home a whopping 71% gross margin — compared to Nokia’s 54%. Consider the comparison of the prices and bill of materials cost for the iPhone 4S and the Nokia (NOK) Lumia 900. According to iMore, the iPhone’s price is $649 while the total cost of all its components — an incomplete cost measure — is $190; whereas the Lumia 900 sells for $450 and its parts cost $209. As for the moral cost of building your iPhone, in January we learned that 23 people had died and 273 has been injured building your iWorld, including 19 who committed suicide at the Foxconn factory by “jumping or falling” off of its factory or dormitory buildings between 2008 and 2010; Four – including Mr. Lai — who died in two factory explosions at Foxconn and another 77 who were injured in them; 137 Wintek workers injured due to the use of a fast-evaporating chemical used to polish iPad screens; and 59 injured during a December 2011 Foxconn plant explosion in Shanghai. I am hoping that’s all in the past now. But it leads to a question: Why will virtually every Apple product owner react to this discussion as they would to an attack on a loved one? The answer to that is fairly simple: the iPhone stimulates the same part of the human brain that activates when you are near people you love. In September 2011, Martin Lindstrom wrote in the New York Times that he conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment on eight men and eight women between the ages of 18 and 25. His finding was that when exposed to their iPhones those 16 experienced a ”flurry of activation in the insular cortex of the brain, which is associated with feelings of love and compassion. The subjects’ brains responded to the sound of their phones as they would respond to the presence or proximity of a girlfriend, boyfriend or family member,” according to Lindstrom. As Lindstrom concluded, you love your iPhone and if JP Morgan Chase is right, eight million of you won’t let a little thing — like costing 32,000 Chinese students their education — keep you from spending $600 to smear your fingerprints all over your loved one’s glass screen.</Msg><Username>mercelena66</Username><Timestamp>1347402095945</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 18:21:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347402099136-1197</Id><Title>Privacy</Title><Msg>How can so few details of the phone been known?

Foxconn says that schools “recruit the students under the supervision of the local government, and the schools also assign teachers to accompany and monitor the students throughout their internship.” But this bland statement may mask a more basic reality — those “interns” are being offered a choice of working in the Foxconn factory to meet demand for the iPhone 5S or getting kicked out of school. Li Qiang, founder of China Labor Watch, told the Times that as recently September 9 he learned that 10 if 87 workers on one iPhone assembly line were “interns.” And as Li said, they “don’t want to work there — they want to learn. But if they don’t work, they are told they will not graduate, because it is a very busy time with the new iPhone coming, and Foxconn does not have enough workers without the students.” But if a JP Morgan Chase (JPM) is right, eight million people will pay $600 to buy the soon-to-be-unveiled iPhone 5S. Even without taking into account the moral cost of buying a product that is built on the backs of the misery of 32,000 student interns, you are grossly over-paying for the “brand.” That’s because Apple is exercising an enormous competitive advantage at your expense and that of its workers and suppliers. It has managed to drive a huge wedge between what people are willing to pay and its cost to satisfy that demand. How so? Your iPhone’s price is 44% higher than the Lumia’s — looks to me like overpaying — while Apple takes home a whopping 71% gross margin — compared to Nokia’s 54%. Consider the comparison of the prices and bill of materials cost for the iPhone 4S and the Nokia (NOK) Lumia 900. According to iMore, the iPhone’s price is $649 while the total cost of all its components — an incomplete cost measure — is $190; whereas the Lumia 900 sells for $450 and its parts cost $209. As for the moral cost of building your iPhone, in January we learned that 23 people had died and 273 has been injured building your iWorld, including 19 who committed suicide at the Foxconn factory by “jumping or falling” off of its factory or dormitory buildings between 2008 and 2010; Four – including Mr. Lai — who died in two factory explosions at Foxconn and another 77 who were injured in them; 137 Wintek workers injured due to the use of a fast-evaporating chemical used to polish iPad screens; and 59 injured during a December 2011 Foxconn plant explosion in Shanghai. I am hoping that’s all in the past now. But it leads to a question: Why will virtually every Apple product owner react to this discussion as they would to an attack on a loved one? The answer to that is fairly simple: the iPhone stimulates the same part of the human brain that activates when you are near people you love. In September 2011, Martin Lindstrom wrote in the New York Times that he conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment on eight men and eight women between the ages of 18 and 25. His finding was that when exposed to their iPhones those 16 experienced a ”flurry of activation in the insular cortex of the brain, which is associated with feelings of love and compassion. The subjects’ brains responded to the sound of their phones as they would respond to the presence or proximity of a girlfriend, boyfriend or family member,” according to Lindstrom. As Lindstrom concluded, you love your iPhone and if JP Morgan Chase is right, eight million of you won’t let a little thing — like costing 32,000 Chinese students their education — keep you from spending $600 to smear your fingerprints all over your loved one’s glass screen.</Msg><Username>mercelena66</Username><Timestamp>1347402442560</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 18:27:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347402451485-1209</Id><Topic><Title>Looking for some butt loving</Title><Username>coolrob15</Username><Timestamp>1347402121138</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 18:22:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I am ready!</Msg><Username>coolrob15</Username><Timestamp>1347402451485</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 18:27:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347402453795-1210</Id><Topic><Title>Privacy</Title><Username>chidelt2000</Username><Timestamp>1347402099136</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 18:21:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why doesn't even one of these students leak any information of what the phone looks like?</Msg><Username>chidelt2000</Username><Timestamp>1347402453795</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 18:27:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347402500442-1211</Id><Topic><Title>AAPL 5:1 Stock Split announced tomorrow</Title><Username>mablehardestofknockers</Username><Timestamp>1347398622848</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 17:23:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>there is not going to be a split and you can bet on that. you must not know much about business financials.</Msg><Username>spe754</Username><Timestamp>1347402500442</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 18:28:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347402509375-1212</Id><Topic><Title>Just had an afternooner with my dad</Title><Username>coolrob15</Username><Timestamp>1347402340425</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 18:25:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>32,000 Students Choose: Build Your iPhone 5 Or Get Expelled From School Apple Inc CEO Steve Jobs discusses the iPhone during his keynote address on the opening day of the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference 2007 (WWDC 07) at the Moscone Center West in San Francisco, California 11 June 2007.

When it bounces, I suspect it will be pretty dramatic at first. Will the bottom hold? There is a real simple way to find out. Draw a horizontal line at the bottom and draw a horizontal line at the old high of 683.29. Apple will try to break out over that old high of 683.29 and hold before going higher. If it does, Apple is going to 700 and maybe 723. If Apple doesn’t make 683.29 and goes back to the low it just set, and breaks through that old low and holds, then we have another leg down in this sell off.</Msg><Username>sandsforce665</Username><Timestamp>1347404800564</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 19:06:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347404879055-1234</Id><Title>BUSH DESTROYED THE US ECONOMY</Title><Msg>No bin laden no wmds found in iraq no nuclear materiels found in iraq us troops not treated as liberators do we know what their real thinking was for iraq war ?</Msg><Username>hhhhdddd9934</Username><Timestamp>1347404879055</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 19:07:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347404934755-1235</Id><Topic><Title>Now Listen Up ...

It becomes more and more the accepted belief that, if one wants to get things done, the responsible director of affairs must be freed from the fetters of democratic procedure." (end quote) It appears this is where we are with Obama now assuming that 'single individual' status. The author however also writes: "You assert that I contend that 'each step away from the market system and towards social reform of the welfare state is inevitably a journey that must end in a totalitarian state' and that government modification of market laissez faire must lead inevitably to political serfdom. How anyone who has read my book can in good faith say this when ever since the first edition I say right at the beginning..."Nor am I arguing that these developments are inevitable.

Now, a new Korea Times report reveals that Samsung is indeed very interested in pursuing an LTE-based case against Apple, and it will do so as soon as the new iPhone 5 is unveiled and launched: Samsung Electronics will sue Apple over its release of the iPhone 5 for infringing on its fourth-generation (4G) long-term evolution (LTE) connectivity patents, according to industry sources, Monday. “It’s true that Samsung Electronics has decided to take immediate legal action against the Cupertino-based Apple. Countries in Europe and even the United States ― Apple’s home-turf ― are our primary targets,” said an industry source. The new iPhone is going to be announced during a special September 12 event, and released on September 21, according to some informed rumors, so we can only assume that a coordinated U.S. and European Samsung attack will follow very soon after that, although specifics are not clear on the matter. Previous reports on the next iPhone’s 4G LTE support revealed that while Apple is beefing up its already consistent LTE patent portfolio, HTC is also very interested in obtaining an LTE-based ban in the U.S. with the International Trade Commission. What about FRAND patents? Are the new 4G LTE patents also standard essential? In which case, would Apple have an easier time defending against any claim, just as it did in the recent U.S. Apple vs Samsung court? Here’s what another source told the newspaper: “Apple claimed the existing 3G-related patents are standard essential patents (SEPs) according to our earlier commitment to the FRAND (fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory) terms. But the story is totally different when you talk about LTE patents. These are new and highly-valued.” But since 4G LTE is going to be the new standard for post 3G and 3.5G telecommunications, chances are that all, if not most, LTE patents out there will be soon labeled as FRAND, if they aren’t already. In which case, any FRAND-based court dispute between any party involved is likely not to end up with injunctions or high royalty and damages payments. In case you thought the Apple vs Samsung conflict is nearing its end, grab some popcorn, as more legal action is coming. We’ll report on all the Samsung upcoming legal proceedings against the new handset in the following days and weeks.</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1347414105964</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 21:41:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347414126773-1313</Id><Topic><Title>Do think Apple will.....</Title><Username>trycomsen35</Username><Timestamp>1347411168795</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 20:52:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The beatings have just begun AAPL has a deep war chest</Msg><Username>i5unknown</Username><Timestamp>1347414126773</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 21:42:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347414189603-1314</Id><Topic><Title>What Android features will Apple 'invent' tomorrow</Title><Username>kneeboardnews</Username><Timestamp>1347401958242</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 18:19:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Juanita is P.O.'d</Msg><Username>dorothyleroy</Username><Timestamp>1347414189603</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 21:43:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347414210094-1315</Id><Topic><Title>BUT YOU SAID IT WOULD CRASH TO $600 TODAY!!!</Title><Username>pitifulhumans</Username><Timestamp>1347410474276</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 20:41:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hey pitifulhumans..."you all told me it would be a blood bath today," eh?!?

Best Wishes trading Longs/Shorts.</Msg><Username>commander_response</Username><Timestamp>1347415442096</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 22:04:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347415723914-1330</Id><Title>smart money sells apple the pig at 9:30 am</Title><Msg>this slob is going down faster than the Lusitania downnnnnnnnnn get out be smart</Msg><Username>sellapplenow</Username><Timestamp>1347415723914</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 22:08:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347415973524-1331</Id><Topic><Title>Dive...dive..dive</Title><Username>powertrader200</Username><Timestamp>1347412276324</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 21:11:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The good news is one of us will be right and make some good money.

CBS Scot Paulsen on "2016: The Movie" The Right Politics This past week, “2016: The Movie” about President Barack Obama opened in the Chicago area, and I chose to get more of an education about Obama by seeing the movie. After the inundation of canned hype for the movie on conservative talk shows across the Chicago radio dial that sounded more like commercials than honest endorsements of the movie, I was skeptical of what I was going to see. While some talk show hosts sounded like they were genuinely impressed with the documentary and honestly endorsing the film, there were those who were obviously reading a commercial script which was not coming across as sincere to the regular listener – at least not to this often-skeptical listener. Perhaps, in future promotions of the film, it would be wise to have pre-recorded commercials done by the professional commercial-makers rather than having the likes of Mark Levin and Sean Hannity doing script after script to promote the movie. After all, the listeners aren’t stupid and resent any attempt at being conned. After many reads by the talk show hosts, the readings of the commercial script were no more enthusiastic than another Life-Lock commercial read – another commercial that ought to be professionally done. Yet, I’m glad I saw the hyped-film because it was more informative than I had thought it would be and included less propaganda than I had predicted. If anything, it was nearly too informative as there was an enormous amount of information condensed into the nearly one-hour-and-a-half documentary. Fact after fact is put forth which shows that President Obama definitely has many skeletons in the closet that have not been released prior to the nation’s trust in him with the Oval Office. To watch this movie and realize – or simply be reminded of – all that is unknown about President Obama is of concern. Much of the information has been ignored by the American media totally. When appropriately reminded as to what is still unknown about Obama to date, one has to ask: How can any logical-thinking person give a damn about Romney’s taxes while not asking any questions regarding our current President’s past? The man influences the entire globe, but liberal Americans want to know how much Mitt Romney paid in taxes in the past rather than learn about the man who they have entrusted with the country. Unbelievable. The movie undeniably links Obama to persons of suspicious-interest due to their past actions and statements, such as former radical activist and Chicago educator Bill Ayers. While the media and blinded-liberals cast such facts aside, the movie does not. No, this portion of the movie is not propaganda – it is the display of factual information about relationships between people that cannot be denied. Yet, the “left” does deny the facts that are right in front of them. Quite disturbing is the talk of the United States economy in the film. The current national debt which has increased two-fold during Obama’s presidency and the horrendous economy is suggested to be part of the plan to strip the nation of democracy – reasonable cause to make citizens totally dependent on the government. The “left” is aghast at this suggestion of the current economy. They actually believe that Obama is unintelligent enough to let this economy just happen. Ironically, it’s many of the people on the “right” who know Obama’s not stupid, and much of what has happened to the United States in the past four years is part of Obama’s plan. How could one so-highly educated and intelligent as Obama not know what he was doing when he incurred such debt? I left the movie thinking more strongly than I had in the past that the current debt and this economy was part of Obama’s plan all along. Increasingly making Americans dependent on the government is the plan. What’s more, he knew his blind followers would believe it was not the plan and, of course, was all Bush’s fault. He must be laughing at his blind followers all the way to the “new America” they’re allowing him to create. My belief is that Obama continues to prey on his die-hard followers’ stupidity to accomplish his personal goals for America. The most disturbing part of the film to me was the interview with President Obama’s half-brother George Obama from Nairobi, Kenya. How can Obama claim to want to help people when he has done absolutely nothing for his own family? It makes me wonder if he really cares about anybody if he can’t find it in his heart to help his own family. As the closing credits started to role upward across the screen, the audience applauded. Me, I just walked out – reasonably upset. Those who have already decided to vote for Obama will probably not even see the movie. It’s sad but they probably don’t want to know the truth when it is laid out so clearly for them in this documentary. The independents who are still deciding who they are going to vote for ought to see this film. I’m quite confident that any undecided voter who sees this film will know who to vote for after viewing this documentary. If you know you’re not going to support the “left” in this coming election, see the film out of interest if you like. But, fair warning, it’s disturbing – and quite frightening – to say the least.</Msg><Username>omni1tsd</Username><Timestamp>1347418987625</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 23:03:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347419272880-1364</Id><Topic><Title>AAPL 5:1 Stock Split announced tomorrow</Title><Username>mablehardestofknockers</Username><Timestamp>1347398622848</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 17:23:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>China Mobile will be saved for January, when the Chinese holiday is.
