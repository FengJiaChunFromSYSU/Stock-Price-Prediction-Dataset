Using your formula above would grossly understate a realistic EPS since they beat guidance by an average of 48% for the first two quarters (calendar ) In other words, with prior guidance for Q1 2012 at $9.30 a 20% increase would be $11.16 (using your formula) not $11.75 which is current guidance (which I believe is way too low). Once again, this does not correct the 49% understatement. With 4 new product cycles, this past quarter was probably more difficult to estimate (especially margins) so I believe that they decided to keep estimates low as usual. However, the current quarter should be much more predictable so AAPL should be obligated to give more accurate guidance numbers. There are no new products to complicate margin guidance. However, most importantly, depending on the "actual" EPS this past holiday quarter, APPL will need to base the current quarter EPS at least partially from that number. In my opinion, I believe that AAPL's EPS will be around $15 per share. If this is indeed the case, a guidance of $11.16 is way too low, but $12.25 would be justified even though it would represent a YOY EPS decrease . But, If I am wrong around $15 EPS, then the guidance will definitely be lower. Still, I understand that AAPL is notorious for lowballing estimates, but I believe that they will at least make up for some of their past gross miscalculations as they can not be consistently off by nearly 50%. Regarding Q2, I believe that iPhones are once again the key and they will sell 42 million iPhones which is 8 million more than the same quarter a year ago. However, I am a bit worried about the full size iPad.Revenues may go down due to increased sales of the mini, but supposedly it has better margins so this should not affect EPS or margins.</Msg><Username>docnaka12</Username><Timestamp>1358573996806</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 00:39:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358574443259-24</Id><Title>PLEASE!!!!!

Apple missed the train on social networks and cloud computing. 8. Android is open source, and windows 8 is multi hardware platform and open development. 9. Ask yourself, why is apple in the business of hedge funding? 10. Apple cannot be competitive without allowing their os in other hardware platforms. 11. See the charts, on every run up.

Basically its an old concept. Apple had no competition, with no competition the sky is the limit on the stock meaning it would have kept going up. When competition came in with other companies producing Ipads, touch screen phones investors saw what was going to happen to Apple and now they are viewing Apple stock as a value stock. What that means if Apple sold 25 million Ipads there profit would be say 2.5 billion, but if you bid up the stock 80 dollars a share the company is wroth 80 billion more on a 2.5 billion, those days for Apple are gone.</Msg><Username>fp718591</Username><Timestamp>1358575385653</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 01:03:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358575412484-29</Id><Topic><Title>Is it still too late to short??!</Title><Username>swingbydetailers</Username><Timestamp>1358570072602</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 23:34:32 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If you want to add to your losing track record, go for it!</Msg><Username>bmonte76</Username><Timestamp>1358575412484</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 01:03:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358575468070-30</Id><Topic><Title>I will NEVER buy another Apple product...NEVER</Title><Username>crecy_war_knight</Username><Timestamp>1358570872539</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 23:47:52 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The calls were at the money calls when he got them: AAPL was 7.11 in Apr 2003 (for instance).

The opposite as I couldn't stop laughing. It amazes me how people attack the guy who singlehandedly has kept this from being a penny stock. Over the years, I've seen it all and more often then not people don't give the guy much credit. People, especially Yahoo shareholders, should be thanking him. Bill Gates, is Chairman Emeritus, of MSFT and he hasn't did s*** for them in over a decade. He was Chief Software Officer, in the early 2000's but it hasn't been his focus for some time now. Whether Jack Ma cashes out really doesn't matter as my point is he's moved onto other endeavors particularly his cinema chain, Chinese medicine and his love for protecting the environment. As for Yang, he thought he could turn around Yahoo, he IS Yahoo, and he never had any other pursuit in life. For all intents purposes AG has been "public" for sometime just not to the little investor. Yes, I stand by this was the dumbest topic created and to say he is wise to step down in the face of all he did for AG is idiotic not even a defendable opinion.

Already one of China’s richest men, with a stake in Alibaba worth about $2.6 billion, Ma shows little interest in technology: He doesn’t spend much time online and depends on a colleague to help him download U.S. TV shows to his iPad. Instead, he dabbles in poker, traditional medicine, and other pastimes. He’s teamed up with movie star Jet Li to spread awareness of tai chi and is so into the ancient Chinese martial art that he brings along a personal trainer when he travels. Environmentalism is another pet cause. In 2010, Ma joined the global board of the Nature Conservancy. Says Orville Schell, a former dean of the journalism school at the University of California at Berkeley, and a close friend: “Business is not his first love.” Ma has been spending time in the Bay Area. He rents a home there, and he has audited history courses at Berkeley, where his son is an undergraduate. The time in the U.S. has clearly rubbed off on him. “I want people to learn what democracy means,” he says. One way to do that: The company’s 25,000 employees elect 10 representatives who determine how Alibaba spends part of its philanthropy budget. “This is the first test in China of a real democracy,” Ma says</Msg><Username>hotmodeltestid122</Username><Timestamp>1358579614064</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 02:13:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358580317565-56</Id><Topic><Title>PLEASE!!!!!

There is no quick buck to be made in my opinion, either long or short on AAPL stock, the only certainty is volatility in the stock. If I was to put money in play at the moment, I would probably short enterprise tech, like EMC, Dell, VMW, CSCO, ORCL and the like, due to a lot of capex spending cut backs, from companies small and large like the global back I work for at the moment. Some of the transports and the energy names are over bought just like the rest of the market. In my opinion the money on the long side has been made and short term looking into puts will be rewarded rather than chasing the market which is propped higher by the powers that be. all the talking heads are making a huge deal out of the billions of dollars waiting on the sideline, as soon as some of this money comes into the market, Wall Street will juice the markets by looking for any excuse to sell. Leaving the average joe with a strange look on their face like what just happened. I think that the fact the stock markets are pushing 52 week highs and AAPL is struggling with 52 week lows, is a big tell, AAPL's earning could prove to be a pivot point for the market direction.

AAPL's 42% drop in early 2008 was caused by a general bear market. That isn't happening right now, so the downside on AAPL is more limited. Perhaps a 33% drop ($472). AAPL is on an up cycle of a 10 day cycle, so it may not happen. Apple products enjoy tremendous brand loyalty and unlike RIMM and Motorola, are well designed and well built.

I believe he has several days after he sells to report it, which could be after the earnings information is public.

As an "Insider" I believe Mr. Gore is prohibited from selling until after earnings are announced, but all he has done is exercise the options, and acquired the shares awaiting Wednesday's market moving news. I'd expect that Melissa Lee of CNBC will need to take a vacation day on Thursday, as she will not be able to tolerate all the positive discussions about Apple.

But why have TSCM’s wafer shipments all of a sudden tripled, allowing it to achieve a virtual monopoly on the 28nm silicon? That’s where the Apple link comes into view... According to the China Times story (via The Next Web): In 2012, 28nm chips accounted for about 12% of TSMC’s revenues, or $2.1 billion (NT$61.5 billion). Chang expects that figure to soar to $6.2 billion (NT$180 billion). The company recently posted fourth quarter revenues of $4.5 billion (NT$131 billion) and net income of $1.4 billion (NT$41.5 billion). Now, TSMC will invest to the tune of $9 billion this year. Furthermore, the foundry will spend even more in capital expenditure in 2014 as it moves toward the more advanced 20nm and 16nm process technologies. Conveniently, another Chinese publication reported last October that TSMC is slated to start fabbing iPhone and iPad processors in volume beginning with 2014. Taking it all in, watchers believe such a sharp rise in TSMC’s market share has a massive Apple order written all over it. Even Chairman and CEO Morris Chang acknowledges TSMC’s lock on the 28nm process technology: We have enjoyed throughout the year, in spite of a lot of attempts at competition, close to 100% foundry market share in 28nm technology [in 2012]...</Msg><Username>squeezetracker</Username><Timestamp>1358602939142</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 08:42:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358602945599-89</Id><Title>Fresh seafood</Title><Msg>freestockwizard has everything ! well almost...</Msg><Username>stocks2cheap</Username><Timestamp>1358602945599</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 08:42:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358603243988-90</Id><Topic><Title>Here's what will happen...</Title><Username>traderapple</Username><Timestamp>1358568066609</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 23:01:06 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>how many apple's can you shove up your #$%$ ? #$%$. poor guy makes a simple post and you come on as if your some kind of expert. you can #$%$ and the rest of the members on this board. on second thought forget it , you would like that i bet.</Msg><Username>raypatsom</Username><Timestamp>1358603243988</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 08:47:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358603266937-91</Id><Topic><Title>iPad Mini will have absolutely STELLAR numbers.

Or look at the activity in WPRT around November 6, 7, 8 last fall. Goldman-Sachs downgrades; trading suspends; the DMM slams the price down to almost $23; the little guys panic and sell their shares at fire sale prices; they get scooped up; and immediately the price recovers and trends up. As somebody much smarter than me explained to me (thanks, Gene A.): It's not a market place. It's more like a retail operation that works in reverse: when they raise prices, the little guys buy from greed. When they lower prices, the little guys sell out of fear. When the little guy is buying, the MMs and big players are selling from their inventory at a profit. When the little guy is dumping, the bigs guys are scooping up the shares cheap, at the prices they set. That's why you see fundamentally sound stocks suddenly drop in price for no good reason, and then reverse a little while later. Or why upgrades and downgrades from Goldman-Sachs and others seem inexplicably 180 degrees out of phase with what seems logical. It's not conspiracy theory. It's just the way things are.</Msg><Username>chrisd771</Username><Timestamp>1358603306540</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 08:48:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358603457866-93</Id><Topic><Title>Goldman Sachs' price target for AAPL is $760 with a "BUY" Recommendation.</Title><Username>cchaker</Username><Timestamp>1358578890644</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 02:01:30 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A few years ago it was so, it would ake months for stock to mend.

As to the so-called 'tax implications'......having exercised his options, gore will not pay taxes until he actually sells the part or all his shares....and keep in mind, we don't know what he plans to do with these shares....maybe he will gift them to family members....just one possibility......but say he sells,.....for the best tax treatment, he must also satisfy the conditions of a 'qualified disposition,' which means he may have up to a two year 'holding' period AFTER he exercises, this could explain why he hasn't actually sold the shares.....he will then get the a favorable tax treatment, which would be anyone's aim........in this case, the 20% cap gains tax rate on proceeds........BIG DEAL. again, no one here can claim they know anything more about aapl earnings on tuesdy because of this event.</Msg><Username>txtrader77</Username><Timestamp>1358607591170</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 09:59:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358607651756-133</Id><Topic><Title>Apple Guidance for Q2 2013</Title><Username>kkafieh</Username><Timestamp>1358560904632</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 21:01:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well that all seems perfectly reasonable to me. I guess what I am really after here is this: What do we think Apple will guide to? Not, "what will the actual q2 results be?" , or "what is the current analyst expectation of actual results?" if we agree that actual Q2 results will be less then actual Q1 results, and that Apple is pretty consistent at how much they underestimate q1 &amp; q2 results, and that Apple knows better than any analyst how well they will do, then I have to think that apples guidance for q2 will certainly be less than guidance for q1. There is no doubt that actual result will be far better than Apple's guidance but the question remains: what is Apple's guidance be?</Msg><Username>kkafieh</Username><Timestamp>1358607651756</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 10:00:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358607833303-134</Id><Title>Will Apple announce a dividend raise??</Title><Msg>Thats what I would like to see.

Smart phones are more important than consumer staples. I use apple before brushing my teeth, peeing (with some exceptions, of course), drinking the first sweet sip of coffee, and looking in the mirror. Assuming we have food, water, and shelter, appl will be a priority for most people, and the priority will grow is tech improves. Yes, goog, sung and others will grow too, but who cares? Quality matters. 2. Children, those sweet digital natives, see tech as an essential part of life. After oxygen, water, and Captain Crunch, tech is essential for their beings My 12-year-old always has his iphone ready to rip his buds through texting, play games, and check homework (yeah!). While there can be too much phone time, as we get distracted from speech and other pre-tech acts, tech won't disappear until we do. And, unlike JNJ, etc, APPL will surprise us with new gadgets that meet wants/needs we don't now realize. Toothpaste, juice, and bread, however, are basically locked into their commodity natures. APPL is not a commodity! 3. Teens and young adults, those less-sweet digital natives, are reshaping culture with their gadgets. They will do so as long as they live. 4. Older folks, we non-sweet digital immigrants, find new meaning, expression, and identity through these gadgets. APPL will continue to fund our growth. 5.

The value investors will come in as uncertainly has been removed to some extent(a slight miss doesn't fundamentally change anything). If it's a huge miss(say by more than 10% top and bottom), then I can see it dropping to 400 over the next few weeks. This clearly shows things aren't going well and apple needs to do something to turn things around.

Cisco’s and Microsoft’s lofty stock prices were because their multiples were high.

Some damage is due to poor execution - e.g., Maps and scratches. Some fears are because of margin issues - iPad Mini taking away market share from more profitable iPad 4. Since Cook became CEO, innovation in new upgrades or new products (e.g., IPad Mini) have been less thrilling. In some cases, AAPL was actually trying to catch up (e.g., screen size on iPhone - Samsung came out with a bigger screen first). In the past, AAPL introduced features that nobody had and thus was able to maintain its special status as a superior product manufacturer which helped justify a price premium. What AAPL needs is non-stop churning out revolutionary new things that others may take a year or two to copy. Also, low-priced products from competition capturing bigger mkt share making it difficult for AAPL to maintain growth rate and if AAPL tried to produce low-priced products, its margin would suffer. So the stock price decline of $200 is a combination of perceived problems wrt lack of innovation, decline in market-share, pressures on margins, and absence of flawless execution. AAPL's inability to secure a contract with Chine Mobile has also hurt growth potential. Has decline in stock price been overdone? Perhaps. But unless AAPL starts producing startling new things and execute well, AAPL will not be a hot stock again and it will be stuck at PE of little more than say MSFT but less than other high-flying stocks. 4Q12 earning report this Wed is critical - what they report on revenues, EPS, margins, and what kind of outlook they give will determine if AAPL heads back to $700 or short-sellers move in with full force and push it down to $400. AAPL is no longer a sure thing, that's for sure.</Msg><Username>sm081969</Username><Timestamp>1358612032356</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 11:13:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358612206222-194</Id><Topic><Title>Melissa is starting to panic with this guest</Title><Username>abbeysmaster</Username><Timestamp>1358523282514</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 10:34:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I went to youtube and Melissa Lee and posted a comment.....saying "Melissa Lee is the most disliked reporter on CNBC" Do you think she visits herself on you tube?!</Msg><Username>snelsonagain</Username><Timestamp>1358612206222</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 11:16:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358612309846-195</Id><Title>Stock Price If AAPL Beats</Title><Msg>Why so much doubts that AAPL may miss estimates? From all the data with ATT, VERIZON, CHINA, etc. so far, I expect APPLE to be estimates handily. Everyone I know bought a least 2-3 APPLE products this past Holidays, you see people using iPhones, iPads, mini iPads everywhere you look. Christmas gifts for my company, everyone put up iPhones, iPads, and mini iPads, the boss went out and got them all - he had to wait 10 days for the entire order of 80 items to come in... So let get on with business. 1. Beats estimates by 10% - APPL will be 575-620 2. Beats estimates by 5% - AAPL will be 525-550 3. Just meets estimates - AAPL may trade down $10 but will bounce back to 505-510 But if guidance is upbeat, then add 5-10% on top of those numbers.

In all consumer products, there are high end and low end offerings. Apple is high end. The products are just a delight to use. I switched from an android phone to a 4s about a year ago. The android phone was OK. The iPhone is phenomenal. It is never not with me because I love it. I love my iPad. I spend more time with my iDevices than anything or anyone else. My husband, not at all tech savvy, got a Mini and fell in love with it. Now he wants an iPhone. My kids have only Apple devices because they never even considered anything else. There is room in consumer markets for high end and low end products. Audi doesn't "compete" with Kia.

Great stocks don't peak out with low PE's and 2 years income in cash value.</Msg><Username>edison20</Username><Timestamp>1358614071469</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 11:47:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358614117965-228</Id><Title>Long 20k DELL at 11.85 , wait for 13.75 or higher</Title><Msg>gggggggggggggggg</Msg><Username>aea_gt1</Username><Timestamp>1358614117965</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 11:48:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358614125383-229</Id><Title>Relief rally coming</Title><Msg>10x P/E vs. 200P/E for Amazon.

The simple reason it sold off was because it missed analysts estimates 2 Q's in a row in front of the biggest new role out of product it its' history.

Apple makes up about 20% of the Nasdaq and about 7% of the S&amp;P 500 (SPX). Many mixed signals are occurring in the markets. Perhaps the money running from Apple is simply moving into riskier small cap stocks, which is causing much of the short-covering rallies and strong movement higher in the small caps to begin the year. Seasonality-wise, the small caps do well this time of year. Thus, the broad indexes remain buoyant despite the AAPL selling but it is far more likely that if Apple weakens further, so will the markets. The five-year blue trend lines failed in the late summer off the double M top forecasting big trouble ahead. The upward-sloping channel middle rail failed in the October selloff. Price is now at the lower red trend line. The 20-week MA is about to fall thru the 50-week MA which signals long term bearishness ahead. As with all crosses, however, many times price will bounce as the negative cross occurs. The green falling wedge is in play now as explained in the daily chart during the week. Simply type 'AAPL' in the search box above to bring up the recent Apple charts for further study. The indicators are lining up with positive divergence wanting to see a bounce, but the MACD line wants a lower low and the RSI may turn more negative in coming days. Analysis is too long to post.

I expect an announcement closer to holiday of this year so China Mobile has for holiday and Chinese New Year. No split, no acquisition. Could do something with divi, but not likely. I believe this announcement will be about this qtr earnings and next qtr earnings. I did play the Jan 25 500 calls. I think with the Jan 19 options being so large, you saw that the traders closed it at 500 even. No one but those that sold the options won...hmmmm.

The agreement clearly states “Under the terms of the agreement with Yahoo!, Alibaba Group has the right to repurchase one-half of Yahoo!’s remaining stake upon a qualifying initial public offering in the future.” So the question is, would Alibaba rather repurchase this half of the remaining stake (let’s call it 10% of Alibaba) when Alibaba is valued at $60 billion or $80 billion? Although Alibaba would potentially be richer with a larger valuation, I assume they’d prefer to buy back that 10% stake at a lower valuation assuming that it will quickly appreciate in the coming years, as it has in recent years. 2. To end the IP Royalty Stream (the TIPLA clause in the agreement). The May agreement states: “Alibaba will make an upfront lump sum royalty payment of US$550 million to Yahoo! and continuing royalty payments for up to four years.” The key words there are “up to.” The sooner Alibaba buys out Yahoo, the sooner they can cease this IP royalty stream to them (or at least reduce it). 3. Pay down debt which they took on to buy back Yahoo’s first tranche. 4. Although Yahoo can keep its last 10% tranche in perpetuity, the sooner Alibaba IPOs, the sooner it would have more resources to potentially offer to buy back this last tranche in a block trade, thereby maximizing the rapid expected growth of Alibaba’s share value to management and employees. 5. The last round of investors in Alibaba might want to take advantage of the monetization opportunity from the IPO even, just as Facebook (FB) investors did. 6. Alibaba’s ambitions to expand outside China. Their investments in Auctiva and Vendio are viewed as unsuccessful despite both having significant installed user bases. Having the resources to launch a US-focused platform is something that should produce results as well as compete with eBay (EBAY) in their own backyard. 7. Talent retention. Start refuting. When you finish with these I'll give you the rest.</Msg><Username>remmy12554</Username><Timestamp>1358620297675</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 13:31:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358620308300-294</Id><Title>Brian White target 1111 is a total #$%$</Title><Msg>hahaahhaha what a fool apple will never hit 600 much less 1111</Msg><Username>bob428</Username><Timestamp>1358620308300</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 13:31:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358620346783-295</Id><Title>looking for 450 wednesday night</Title><Msg>soooo easy to see it coming</Msg><Username>bob428</Username><Timestamp>1358620346783</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 13:32:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358620366860-296</Id><Topic><Title>Al Gore to Right a WRONG</Title><Username>flytop32</Username><Timestamp>1358546590224</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 17:03:10 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I really think Hilary's biggest competition is going to be (I'm sorry to say this --------- JOE BIDEN).

Since the stock is only at $500 now and Andy recommended a bunch of different recovery spreads, his recovery spreads are down 40% more.

For instance, in October Andy Zaky said the $900 - $1,000 Jan 2014 call spread is an easy 10 bagger and you could recover losses with this great spread. That spread cost $8 back then. Today it is worth 80 cents. He also pushed the $850-$950 spread also down about 70%. All in 3 months. Zaky has missed EPS by as much an any independent analyst or professional out of the 50 that Ive read. His recommendations are horrible. His strategy is to take more and more risk without the fear of losing everything and big 90% drawdowns are part of his investment strategy tolerance. Of course his loyal follower are down 94% in their account values, so they won't be able to afford his $2,000 fees. If you want to lose your money faster than any other adviser, I suggest using Zakys service. He's a real charlatan with basically little understanding about risk.</Msg><Username>ace_92029</Username><Timestamp>1358620596481</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 13:36:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358620694154-301</Id><Title>Real data....more impressive than you claim to know.</Title><Msg>Annual NET income for the past 4 years is...2009=8.2B, 2010=14.0B, 2011=25.9B, 2012=41.7B.

The question is how they manage expectations for q2. I think they need to dispel several rumors out there. First, the threat of margin compression. Any positive language about maintaining current margins moving forward or margin expansion (which should happen as we get farther from the massive refresh of all products last quarter) will be great for the stock and will have Milissa Lee and her meat-head shills #$%$ in their pants. Secondly, The bears have been talking about no new positive catalysts for 2013 as a reason to sell. But smart people know that there are a ton of products and catalysts coming out this year starting with the retina mini and ipad 5 in March leading into a iphone 5s in June, followed by an iphone 6 in November, probably an iTV in there somewhere in the fall, and of course the CM deal to be announced anytime in 2013. Not to mention anything else that the public doesn't already have a pretty good idea about. Oh, and of course the many ways they can deploy their massive war chest to create shareholder value -- especially with the new Controller from Xerox it look a lot more likely. Not any catalysts, huh? LOL! They have to allude to a full schedule of product launches in 2013 without giving any detail. They should also allude to the fact that they are exploring ways to create shareholder value. That will crush the bears as will as taking away the margin compression issue.</Msg><Username>alphashort</Username><Timestamp>1358622045685</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 14:00:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358622062028-326</Id><Title>qvc selling ipad 4</Title><Msg>They are selling like hotcakes. 5,000 units since last night</Msg><Username>bigdadieeeeeeee</Username><Timestamp>1358622062028</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 14:01:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358622078662-327</Id><Topic><Title>May 10, 2013 is the date Jack Ma steps down at Alibaba Group</Title><Username>xisdamarkfonex</Username><Timestamp>1358608300644</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 10:11:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I did all my buying in the teens.

Either way you look at it, you have a good stock here at this price because there isn't a much better company out there with these balance sheet numbers. GOOG has just $38 B in retained earnings. From $231 Mkt Cap, then they get $589/share premium. With a similar consensus per share est. around $40/share for GOOG, you have a x14.7 forward earnings multiplier.

Earning will be around $11-12. In addition, the next quarters and the rest of the year guidance will be way BELOW consensus, due to the following four reasons: 1. Market leader Samsung's superior technologies and their new product cycle. Apple just can not catch up. Whether you like it or not, Samsung is the BEST! 2. OEMs' unwillingness to make parts for Apple. They should have never sued Samsung. It was a childish play. Cry-baby! 3. Thirdly, China won't adapt to Apple phones and the current stock price is already falsely baked in with the China play. When it becomes evident that China won't be there, this stock will dropped like hot potatoes. 4. There will be no Apple TV to speak of or show for. It will be a no-return-on-investment. American TV markers have long gone and the technologies from Asian manufactures are just too much for Apple to handle. Don't forget it's not just Smart TV, it is also the Blue Ray, HD, 4D, etc, etc... You guys are being so naive. Hopeful but naive!. I appreciate your patriotism but at the end-of-the-day, I want the best for my money. We gave and still giving 'Made in America" companies chances. But it won't be forever! Lastly, do not listen to those Analysts who are saying "Buy, Buy, Buy!" They are doing it for their own benefits. Remember what those same analysts said about Apple when it was trading at high $750 or so.</Msg><Username>kkwon</Username><Timestamp>1358622692582</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 14:11:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358622792281-338</Id><Title>*** I CANNOT BELIEVE I BOUGHT THIS POS ********</Title><Msg>I bought this POS and I'm down 7k $'s I hate aapl and I hope all you lose your a.s.s. on this POS</Msg><Username>whett_pharttss</Username><Timestamp>1358622792281</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 14:13:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358622861850-339</Id><Topic><Title>Buy back</Title><Username>abcdsteve123</Username><Timestamp>1358622397749</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 14:06:37 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>They are buying back shares dummie.

Apple will not even sell 25 Million Iphone 5's this quarter, get ready for $425 per share after crooked Cook reports earnings. Will Crooked Cook lie again? last year he said Apple sold 45 Million Iphones in the Christmas quarter, the truth came out a month later, only 37 Million were sold. Apple makes nothing and now depends on almost bankrupt companies for everything, without Google and Samsung, this party is over.

Even Horace only begrudgingly issued an earnings estimate ($60m Rev; $16 EPS; 55.5m iPhones; 24.5m ipads). Will the numbers mark a return to AAPL's long time penchant for smashing the snot out of sandbagged guidance beating by 35-50% as was typical until the june Q, or will the Q really suk out loud with another miss on consensus? Cook, and the amateur hour CFO and IR staff effort has hopefully figured this out last Q and took their heads out their azzes. On the other hand, the short gumpsters here are elated to think AAPLs revenues will suk, margins will be forever depressed, aapl has lost its "coolness" (LOL) and the stock is never going higher. Further, all good news is ignored and all questionable/less than flattering news is repeated 8x per day by the media, almost rejoicing that AAPL has joined the ranks of the once high performinf and now broken wing tech companies like Dell, HP, RIMM, etc. Funnier still, the companies who really are fallen (HTC, RIMM, HP, etc) all seem to be getting a pass these days, no matter how awful their news. And do we see any big huff re Samsung about to lose their entire AAPL sourcing franchise? Those who study know that ALL of Samsung's profitable business can be tied directly to AAPL iphones and ipads... but they are going to lose those and have only Samsung's proprietary "breakeven" phone business to show in coming quarters. Here's the wrap up: Despite the ongoing performance remaining stellar at AAPL, the negative sentiment is so absurdly negative that now the world's largest market cap company is trading at just half the s&amp;p500 earnings multiple even though they have trailing and haircut forward revenue and earnings growth of more than three times the broad market.</Msg><Username>squeezetracker</Username><Timestamp>1358622982656</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 14:16:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358622998105-344</Id><Topic><Title>May 10, 2013 is the date Jack Ma steps down at Alibaba Group</Title><Username>xisdamarkfonex</Username><Timestamp>1358608300644</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 10:11:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You have no vision and you're not a good liar.

You might live in a bubble with full security provided by several interested parties. But i can assure you theres no protection from justice. sometimes the wheels are slow to turn. but they do turn. Im saying this with a voice of authority. You see i know something that 99% of you all here will never know. Its a cultural thing you can say. Ill put it this way. The same things that can cure cancers and every disease imagine able. can also create them. It doesnt take a gun shot to kill some one., It just takes enough hate and anger directed at some one to cause these ailments to surface. they take many forms. You guys there laughing at us during your commercial breaks, have millions of people full of hate and anger directing that energy those thoiughts directly at you. what i know first hand about thoughts and energy, they can heal and destroy. i laugh about what is comming to you, you wont see it you wont hear it but youll know it in a very subtle way. but youll dismiss it away. your sick in the brain. all of you are. Your a perfect cross section of whats wrong with humanity, no one needs to see a story of kids being killed in school, or wars being waged, or women bing raped in other countries. You people at CNBC your a very clear snap shot of the sickness that humans suffere from. but whats the most diabolical of all, is you brocast your filth across the airwaves to the massses and you effect the lives of millions, your raf worse then a war, or kids being killed in school, uyour worse then a cancer or any other form of disease. You operate in plain sight, you cause more harm to humanity your a daily holocaust upon the world.

The 2nd is buy/hold all shares and he has to pay taxes on that $480 gain per share. Then if he holds those shares a year, that difference when he sells from $480 is a capital long term gain. Short term is before 12 months. Now the 3rd is buy/hold/pay for taxes with shares. Here he buys the shares and sells enough to cover the taxes so he isn't out of any money from pocket. Thus, say he has 100,000 options. Cashless sell = sells all 100K options/shares. 2nd he has 100K shares but owes taxes on all shares. 3rd option say he holds 50,000 shares and sells 50,000 shares to pay taxes so he's not out of pocket any money. Hope this helps.

This quarter and q2 will be behind us at that point and we will already have 26.00-27.00 in the bag in earnings. It will be easy for the market to expect 50.00+ earnings for fiscal 2013. Put 20% growth on that in 2014 and your talking about $60.00+ in 2014. Put a 12 times on 2014 and you have 720. Of course any big anouncements between now and then i.e. iTV or China Mobile and each one of those can add 50 points.</Msg><Username>alphashort</Username><Timestamp>1358630551432</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 16:22:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358630631285-470</Id><Topic><Title>IPAD 4 G IS THE WORST TABLET ON THE MARKET...I JUST BOUGHT ONE!!</Title><Username>sheepskinner6</Username><Timestamp>1358630320257</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 16:18:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>U have been bashing apple for Months and u just bought an iPad Yeah.

You are also correct Apples report will be less 1 week which many will calculate that into there earning report. If Iphones sells werent as great , thats a negative, only thing is the Ipad that can help them reverse lost phone sells as i believe the Ipads did well. Next issue is cash in hand and will it continue to grow? I say that will start to drop since there paying a dividend and growth in cash will not continue like it used to. Remember Apple stock holders made the mistake of requesting a dividend. Next you have to expect 10 billion less in cash as they did a share buy back, another bad move. We will have to wait and see there report Wensday. I am just not convince Apples out look on next quarterly sales will do good.</Msg><Username>fp718591</Username><Timestamp>1358630765850</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 16:26:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358630773328-475</Id><Topic><Title>Weekly options have destroyed Friday trading and threatens to destry thursdays</Title><Username>atrayu19</Username><Timestamp>1358628946150</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 15:55:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>When did they start with the weekly thing?

The use of iCloud, purchase of apps, and existence of Apple families makes switching inconvenient. The company’s success is creating a new generation of users such that iOS is the new Windows. In order to create higher barriers to exit, Apple needs to move faster in software and leverage iCloud more. Amazon and Google also are MSPs and increasingly threatening Apple.

Now, it appears he's making another big profit buying Apple's (AAPL) stock on the cheap. Al Gore According to a filing with the Securities and Exchanges Commission, Gore -- a director on Apple's board -- exercised an option to purchase nearly 60,000 shares of the tech giant at the bargain basement price of $7.48, costing him a total of about $445,000. But with Apple's current market price at about $500 a share, Gore's holdings are worth $29.75 million, giving him a huge windfall-on paper at least. Gore, however, could easily afford to buy Apple's stock at the prevailing market price.</Msg><Username>lilpimpinmf</Username><Timestamp>1358631643775</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 16:40:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358631684166-506</Id><Topic><Title>USB Milnovich Says Capitulation Still Needed!</Title><Username>calls_them_as_i_see_them</Username><Timestamp>1358629292717</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 16:01:32 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you may get it after earnings this week with any type of bad earnings or tempered guidance. but i think they report above street by a good margin.</Msg><Username>cincinatikid99</Username><Timestamp>1358631684166</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 16:41:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358631722855-507</Id><Topic><Title>If a genius like Al Gore is buying</Title><Username>mr_peanut645</Username><Timestamp>1358631088302</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 16:31:28 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He paid $7.48 a share you #$%$ while you and the other suckers pay $500!</Msg><Username>lilpimpinmf</Username><Timestamp>1358631722855</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 16:42:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358631768351-508</Id><Topic><Title>Melissa Lee and Jim Cramer</Title><Username>rc3eagles</Username><Timestamp>1358623372311</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 14:22:52 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Their time is coming..</Msg><Username>kdkellyllc</Username><Timestamp>1358631768351</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 16:42:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358631776658-509</Id><Topic><Title>Weekly options have destroyed Friday trading and threatens to destry thursdays</Title><Username>atrayu19</Username><Timestamp>1358628946150</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 15:55:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Listen to this Muppet..."it Appears".

Tim Cook doesn't want to be Steve Jobs and, in fact, he is better. The creating innovation at AAPL came mostly from Sir Jon Ives, not Jobs. And, as an operations guy, Cook runs circles around what Jobs could ever do. 2. Competition is getting fierce, no doubt. But, so far it is a two horse race and every other competitor is miles away from AAPL and Samsung. Samsung is merely a hardware company. They buy components and slap them together and mark up the aggregate. That is what they do. AAPL has a complete ecosystem with a proprietary OS, proprietary apps, and world class customer support and retail infrastructure. Both can survive and thrive, but AAPL will ultimately win because their selling an interface into the best ecosystem in the world. Samsung sells hardware, they have no proprietary OS. In fact, they will soon be in competition with their OS provider on devices. Samsung will be selling devices running 3 different operating systems this year. Talk about fragmenting a brand! 3. All surveys show that there is HUGE market appetite for an Apple TV. In fact, in the US, 60% of those surveyed said they would buy one without even knowing the specs or price! 4. Actually 88% of all mobile commerce is done on an ipad. I expect that number to go up with the HUGE sales of the ipad mini this quarter. Also, 72% of all mobile search is done on AAPL devices. The future of ecommerce and search is mobile, and AAPL is crushing all competitors by both metrics. As for MSFT, if the surface is any indication of their ability to leverage their installed PC user base, well....enough said. Also, the PC market continues to shrink while the tablet market continues its parabolic growth.</Msg><Username>alphashort</Username><Timestamp>1358632458468</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 16:54:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358632498519-514</Id><Topic><Title>How to access aapl trading ASIAN markets</Title><Username>eyesopen2013</Username><Timestamp>1358630924684</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 16:28:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>try this: http://www.bloomberg.com/markets/companies/computers/</Msg><Username>snelsonagain</Username><Timestamp>1358632498519</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 16:54:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358632514241-515</Id><Topic><Title>You IDIOTS pay $500 for APPLE while AL GORE pays $7.48/SHARE!</Title><Username>lilpimpinmf</Username><Timestamp>1358631643775</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 16:40:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Those calls were at the money calls when he got them in 2003.

Since the apple price went up since then, he is cashing in that is all. Lot of other employees and directors got options as a reward for their effort.. Lot of them paid off. I had an option in a company in Mountain View and another company in Colorado. Bu the stock never appreciated, instead it went down. So it was worthless. It is like buying options in any company except it is a long term option (years awyaya0 and the guy who gets it does not have to pay for it unless the stock goes up. If the stock goes up, people do exercise. That is all what Al Gore did. It is not a bad racket to be ex president and vice president. Actually one reason for the drop in Apple price recently is to lower the price for the option grants for the Apple employees. Every year since 2004, I noticed that the stock price will go down in the beginning of the year, when they grant options to their employees. If that is the case, the stock will go up this year as well. If you know someone at Apple who is granted options as a reward for their effort in the company ask them. You will know what I am talking about.</Msg><Username>michaeljoseph4040</Username><Timestamp>1358632949481</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 17:02:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358633008721-521</Id><Topic><Title>You IDIOTS pay $500 for APPLE while AL GORE pays $7.48/SHARE!</Title><Username>lilpimpinmf</Username><Timestamp>1358631643775</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 16:40:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Al Gore is a thief.</Msg><Username>jai_hakim</Username><Timestamp>1358633008721</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 17:03:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358633048825-522</Id><Topic><Title>PLEASE!!!!!

I suspect what worked well comming down from $700 will work even better going back up to $700. With the over all negativity towards AAPL, what batter way to do this all over again, then to drop it below $500 for the first time sell a bunch of PUTs to those who believe the bashers, and then walk it back to $700 again wiping out all the PUTs like they did the CALLS? Next week as AAPL trades near $600 you can bet CNBC wont give it much air time, if anything they will keep bashing, even as AAPL climbs above $600 on firday.</Msg><Username>rc3eagles</Username><Timestamp>1358633904122</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 17:18:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358633955465-534</Id><Topic><Title>pre earnings bashing at CNBC started last week.</Title><Username>rc3eagles</Username><Timestamp>1358629840455</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 16:10:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>let them scream</Msg><Username>rc3eagles</Username><Timestamp>1358633955465</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 17:19:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358633981287-535</Id><Topic><Title>PLEASE!!!!!

The current range for all analysts is 43-66 million units. They produced 37 million units last year. A Samsung analyst even predicted 45 million iPhones for the quarter. The most recent articles by the WSJ and Misek clearly stated that 65 million units were being cut in half for this quarter. Experts believe that this is very consistent with a 48-52 million unit quarter leaving around 15 million in surplus for Q2. The reduced production (32.5 million units) + the surplus leaves 47.5 million units for Q2. Imagine if they only sold 45 million units this holiday quarter, they would have 52.5 units available for Q2 which would be more than the holiday quarter. The reason for the layoff was increased efficiently and production. They reportedly hired 120K people just before the quarter launched, so it is not surprising that they no longer need them due to QoQ decline. To me, it is surprising that they were able to make so many iphones. Also, if you use ATT and Verizon's numbers, this will produce 48 million iphones based on historical US market share. With the introduction to 33 new countries, they will clearly BEAT 50 million units. Ironically, I disagree with you regarding iPads as I am a bit worried about the larger iPad. I hope that they can produce AT LEAST as many as last year. With the mini selling 8-10 million ($900 million profits), if the full size iPad's sells 14.5 million units, I guarantee you that Apple will be making somewhere around $15.5 per share or close to 28 % better than last year (accounts for extra week)</Msg><Username>docnaka12</Username><Timestamp>1358634382551</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 17:26:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358634410781-540</Id><Topic><Title>This is how iphone can easily complete with Samsung phones---very easy----</Title><Username>doing_good123</Username><Timestamp>1358633452426</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 17:10:52 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>well, if apple decides to make it, it's going to be extremely light and thin.</Msg><Username>theytookallthegoodloginnames</Username><Timestamp>1358634410781</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 17:26:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358634496889-541</Id><Title>SELL Apple shares and buy GOOG</Title><Msg>Apple sells 60,000 share of stock to Al Gore for $7.48/share.

They also report that the “whisper number” among analysts is really 14.00 EPS. Supposedly the whisper number is the EPS that analysts really think Apple will report versus their official reported number. Keep in mind that professional analysts are working under considerable pressure to never overestimate actual EPS by their employers. They do not want to ever be accused of hyping a stock. They want to report that a company beat their estimates. If an analyst overestimates he is vulnerable to being fired, thus the pressure to be conservative. If a CEO can’t beat the analyst’s estimate, the analysts will crucify the CEO. Thus we get CEO’s sandbagging the analysts every quarter.

Had to return to the apple store for a technical question. I reported yesterday that the store was about three quarters full, mostly new buyers. Could tell by the new bags of phones, pads and macs heading out the door. Well today I was shocked! It was the same story except to a greater number of customers and more bags heading out the door, wow! It's hard to me to believe the WSJ thinks there is a major drop in sales. They certainly haven't visited the apple store in Charleston. Couldn't figure out why so many people opted to visit apple instead on going to the beach on such a beautiful day? They say the proof is in the pudding and the show ain't over until the fat lady dances, well I love good pudding and certainly don't want to miss the fat lady. I am staying for the show! I believe we will see about 50m iPhones; 23m pads; and 5.1m macs sold . EPS over analysis projections of $13.44/shr and revs. At $54B. Guidance will be a little conservative, but that is apple's MO. GM will be 28 % +. If i am wrong and we have an apple miss we will have a short and I say short term dip. By year end we will be back to $700+. Good luck and wisdom to all the longs.

Forget about this week's Wall Street Journal reports claiming that Apple is in design talks with suppliers. This has been reportedly going on for a long time, and testing designs isn't the same thing as placing a big order. Steve Jobs teased about this before he died, and CEO Tim Cook has been dropping hints lately. It's easy to blow off TV as not being a game-changer for Apple. These aren't the portable iOS devices that folks will want to replace every year or two. There won't be wireless carriers willing to send hundreds of dollars to Apple to subsidize lower consumer-facing prices. However, portable media players were dead for more than a decade when Apple rolled out the iPod. Smartphones were largely corporate devices until the iPhone. No one took tablets seriously until the iPad. Apple can -- and probably will -- redefine the TV industry, legitimizing smart televisions in the process.</Msg><Username>stock_re_search</Username><Timestamp>1358642140843</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 19:35:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358642245647-635</Id><Topic><Title>Sources: AAPL to report Blowout results for Q4 - Stock headed back to 700</Title><Username>stock_re_search</Username><Timestamp>1358639465756</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 18:51:05 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Tim Cook will offer outstanding guidance and expending earning potential for AAPL, all concerns will be layed to rest soon.</Msg><Username>stock_re_search</Username><Timestamp>1358642245647</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 19:37:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358642255944-636</Id><Topic><Title>Whisper Number $14.00</Title><Username>keiretsunikkei</Username><Timestamp>1358633296763</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 17:08:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Gee are you Losing it already Gen ?</Msg><Username>lorde_chatterly</Username><Timestamp>1358642255944</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 19:37:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358642353344-637</Id><Title>How can revenue estimates go up by $8 million dollars, but EPS goes down?</Title><Msg>Consensus estimates have Apple's revenues up about $8 billion to $54 billion (from $46 billion) but EPS down 4% at $13.45 with margins at around 38.5%. How can operating expenses increase by $8 million? This would indicate the operating profit increase by the same amount of the increased net sales? At a minimum, this additional $8 billion should account for an increase of $.50 per share and likely $1.00 more since these revenues are coming from iPhones with gross margins around 65%.

Vendors will move 142 million units of this device in 2013 and up to 402 million by 2015, project analysts at Barclays. That’s more than three times the number of iPhones sold in 2012. And, oh yeah, Apple doesn’t make one of these. It’s called a phablet. As in, an extra-large phone that’s almost as big as a tablet, combining aspects of both. Phablet is the terrible name granted to this class of 5-inch and larger phones by a derisive press corps, which mocked one of the earliest and most visible examples of this trend, Samsung’s 5.3-inch Galaxy Note. Then, surprising everyone but Samsung, the Note turned out to be a hit, selling 10 million units as of last summer. An explosion of phablets Samsung recently rolled out the Galaxy Note II, which is a hair larger than the Galaxy Note and looks to be an even bigger hit, selling 5 million units in just the first three months since launch. Subsequently, dozens of phone makers have announced their own phablets, including the consumer electronics giants of mainland China, ZTE and Huawei; Taiwan’s HTC and Lenovo; Sony; American manufacturer Vizio; South Korea’s LG; and even one Shenzhen, China, manufacturer called Zopo that is making phablets its primary focus. Not to mention a stream of cheap knock-offs from vendors with no brand at all. So what’s going on here? When analysts declare that “we expect 2013 to be the Year of the Phablet,” have they lost their minds? Are phablets the netbooks of 2013, doomed to be produced in mass quantities but yielding a user experience so unsatisfying that the category eventually dies? Quite the opposite, I’d argue. In fact, I’m willing to bet that Phablets are going to be the PCs of this decade. http://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-refuses-one-mobile-device-124532012.html</Msg><Username>keiretsunikkei</Username><Timestamp>1358645921455</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 20:38:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358646001720-678</Id><Topic><Title>Sources: AAPL to report Blowout results for Q4 - Stock headed back to 700</Title><Username>stock_re_search</Username><Timestamp>1358639465756</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 18:51:05 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>link please ?</Msg><Username>bhias5</Username><Timestamp>1358646001720</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 20:40:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358646194788-679</Id><Title>stock_re_search ID only 1 hour 49 minutes ago another good lie</Title><Msg>lolllllllllllllll</Msg><Username>bhias5</Username><Timestamp>1358646194788</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 20:43:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358646236655-680</Id><Topic><Title>Sell confirmed on the weekly candlestick charts</Title><Username>jai_hakim</Username><Timestamp>1358644274442</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 20:11:14 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Get lost idiot.</Msg><Username>jai_hakim</Username><Timestamp>1358646236655</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 20:43:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358646337105-681</Id><Topic><Title>stock_re_search ID only 1 hour 49 minutes ago another good lie</Title><Username>bhias5</Username><Timestamp>1358646194788</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 20:43:14 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No doubt another JEW#$%$ trying to manipulate the share price.</Msg><Username>techs_long_horn</Username><Timestamp>1358646337105</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 20:45:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358646342982-682</Id><Topic><Title>Sources: AAPL to report Blowout results for Q4 - Stock headed back to 700</Title><Username>stock_re_search</Username><Timestamp>1358639465756</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 18:51:05 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Links will be posted soon, this is just a preview.

Every IPO, has insiders offer 5-20% of the company or whatever at which point the overall company gets a valuation. Facebook got over $10B on a valuation of $100B when it IPO'd. The goal is always to sell as little equity as possible to the public. Makes sense if you think the company has huge upside as you want all of it. Now if you got insiders like Lefofsky(sp) of Groupon or Pincus of Zynga selling then you got a problem...guess what both imploded. Insider transactions is what everyone should watch. Yahoo had no insiders buy for years, the occasional 5,000 shares notwithstanding.

Verizon and ATT's numbers indicate 47 million units which is already 10 million more than the same record quarter last year. This calculation is based on their historic US market share, but since the iPhone is now available in over 100 countries, their market share will go down. Therefore, these numbers are a MINIMUM estimate. Just add the number of iPhones that sold in these new emerging markets to determine total iPhone sales (50+ million) Also, "short supply"?

What does that mean for iPhone sales? Last quarter, Apple reported selling 26.91 million iPhone units and AT&amp;T said it sold 4.7 million iPhone units. That means AT&amp;T accounts for about 17.47 percent of total iPhone sales. Also, the 4.7 million iPhones were about 77 percent of AT&amp;T's total smartphone sales of 6.1 million units last quarter. If AT&amp;T still accounts for 17.47 percent (or so) of all iPhone sales, that means a best-case sales number of 7.7 million iPhones in the most recent quarter would equate to sales of just 44.1 million units for Apple.</Msg><Username>keiretsunikkei</Username><Timestamp>1358651551897</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 22:12:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358651566652-741</Id><Topic><Title>Year To Date Apple Is Down 10% From Her High Of $555.00</Title><Username>keiretsunikkei</Username><Timestamp>1358648977235</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 21:29:37 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It would be more depressing if you are short or sold Apple and it beats big time and the stock shoots up $80 or more.</Msg><Username>ccgames03</Username><Timestamp>1358651566652</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 22:12:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358651659146-742</Id><Topic><Title>RIMM WILL DESTROY AAPL WITH A BIG SURPRISE UP OVER $1</Title><Username>dextermossadharavkook</Username><Timestamp>1358516531615</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 08:42:11 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Actually made me laugh.

I remember reading articles where analysts were drooling at the possibility that Apple could sell 50 million units. But reading the news these days, you'd think it was a big flop. The Wall Street Journal just informed us that Apple is cutting their orders for parts. The reason supplied by the journal was "weaker-than-expected demand." This has since caused an already sliding stock to fall even further. Yet, interestingly, the same article provides an estimate that Apple did indeed sell 50 million units in the quarter. Analysts are hoping for 47 million units. Ok, those are big numbers. How does that stack up against other Iphones? Year Total Iphone Sales (Approximate) 2007 1.4 Million 2008 11.6 Million 2009 20.7 Million 2010 40 Million 2011 72.3 Million 2012 124 Million 2013 50 Million in the first quarter? If indeed Apple sold 50 million iPhones in the first quarter, this would not only be the greatest quarter for iPhones ever, it would also beat analyst expectations. And this at a time when some are calling for the Apple investors to abandon ship. Maybe, just maybe, the iPhone 5 isn't as big of a flop as they would have you believe. Actually, by these numbers, the iPhone is a screaming success. What About the Other Guys? Perhaps most impressive about a record breaking iPhone quarter is that it is coming at a time when the other guy, the iPad, continues to also gain ground. In the fourth quarter Apple sold 14 million iPads. This was 26% growth. The lowest estimates for iPad sales in this upcoming first quarter call for 17 million. Don't forget that the iPad has a kid brother now, the iPad Mini. There has been a waiting list to get this little guy ever since he came out. This coming quarterly announcement will be the first time we see iPad and iPad Mini results in the same report.</Msg><Username>stock_re_search</Username><Timestamp>1358656297784</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 23:31:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358656426293-791</Id><Title>$420 AAPL by this Friday.</Title><Msg>so will drop from $500 to $420 in four days 16% and Q's will decline 7% with weakness in other NDQ 100 companies. better sell at open Tuesday. after they report and have cc on Wednesday will be too late.

From sales growth and even current quarter estimates, things are looking good, but it may be all for not if Apple begins to compromise. According to a survey, public perception still has Apple as the number one innovator. Critics will point out that the iPad was the most recent true innovation, and that has been over 2 years ago now. But as Motley Fool writer Evan Niu pointed out, the iPod came out in 2001. The iPhone in 2007. The iPad in 2010. The first innovated the music industry. The second innovated the phone industry. The last innovated the computer industry. There is a significant gap between all three.</Msg><Username>stock_re_search</Username><Timestamp>1358656935593</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 23:42:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358657208907-794</Id><Topic><Title>Apple Now 32% Below Price Target.</Title><Username>robert10jones</Username><Timestamp>1358346371264</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 09:26:11 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Apple is reiterated a Buy with $760 price target at Goldman which says the company's opportunity in emerging markets is far greater than what investors give it credit for.
