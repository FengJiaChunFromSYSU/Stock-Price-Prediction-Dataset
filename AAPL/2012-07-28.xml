Post a Comment » Read All Comments (17) » While Apple has been hugely successful in selling phones and tablets, it has little traction in social networking, which has become a major engine of activity on the Web and on mobile devices. Social media are increasingly influencing how people spend their time and money — an important consideration for Apple, which also sells applications, games, music and movies. Apple has considered an investment in the hundreds of millions of dollars, one that could value Twitter at more than $10 billion, up from an $8.4 billion valuation last year, these people said. They declined to be named because the discussions were private. There is no guarantee that the two companies, which are not in negotiations at the moment, will come to an agreement. But the earlier talks are a sign that they may form a stronger partnership amid intensifying competition from the likes of Google and Facebook. Apple has not made many friends in social media. Its relationship with Facebook, for example, has been strained since a deal to build Facebook features into Ping, Apple’s music-centric social network, fell apart. Facebook is also aligned with Microsoft, which owns a small stake in it. And Google, an Apple rival in the phone market, has been pushing its own social network, Google Plus. “Apple doesn’t have to own a social network,” Timothy D. Cook, Apple’s chief executive, said at a recent technology conference. “But does Apple need to be social? Yes.” Twitter and Apple have already been working together. Recently, Apple has tightly sewn Twitter features into its software for phones, tablets and computers, while, behind the scenes, Twitter has put more resources into managing its relationship with Apple. Though an investment in Twitter would not be a big financial move for Apple by any stretch — it has $117 billion in liquid investments, and it quietly agreed to buy a mobile security company for $356 million on Friday — it would be one of Mr. Cook’s most important strategic decisions as chief executive. And it would be an uncommon arrangement for Apple, which tends to buy small start-ups that are then absorbed into the company. But such a deal would give Apple more access to Twitter’s deep understanding of the social Web, and pave the way for closer Twitter integration into Apple’s products. Twitter has grown quickly, amassing more than 140 million monthly active users who generate a vast stream of short messages about their lives, the news and everything else. An Apple investment would give it the glow of a close relationship with a technology icon, and would instantly bolster its valuation, which, like that of other start-ups, has languished in the wake of Facebook’s lackluster market debut. In fact, word of the talks comes at a time when some are asking whether expectations for the potential of social media companies have gotten out of hand, and shares of Facebook, Zynga and other companies have wilted. But Twitter does not need Apple’s cash. Earlier this year, Dick Costolo, Twitter’s chief executive, said the company had “truckloads of money in the bank.” The truckloads, according to people familiar with the matter, add up to more than $600 million in cash on hand. This comes from the $1 billion in financing it has raised over the years and, more recently, from a healthy flow of advertising revenue. Regardless, Twitter is widely expected to pursue a public offering within the next couple of years, whether or not it agrees to deals with investors like Apple. Apple and Twitter are logical partners in some ways. Unlike Facebook or Google, Twitter has no plans to compete with Apple in the phone business or elsewhere. And as Apple has found, social is just not in its DNA. “Those guys are a great partner,” Mr. Costolo said of Apple in a recent interview. “We think of them as a company that our company looks up to.” Mr. Costolo would not discuss any potential investments or anything else related to the company’s relationship with Apple. Spokesmen for both Apple and Twitter said on Friday that their companies did not comment on rumors.</Msg><Username>lord_chatterly</Username><Timestamp>1343477615917</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-07-28 08:13:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343477798197-22</Id><Topic><Title>Apple Fritter with Twitter</Title><Username>superwinpad_8</Username><Timestamp>1343477419185</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-07-28 08:10:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Load up on MSFT ... word has it the Stock is going to 400 !!!

Samsung is forced to incorporate 4G radios even though the current technology drains your battery much faster, huge screens even though they make the phones unwieldy, many separate models that keep the cost of goods high and profits slim, and a third party OS that places Samsung at the mercy of Google/Motorola, creates fragmentation of the customer experience with few customers able to move forward to the latest version, and affectively commoditizes the entire universe of phones using it. Meanwhile, Apple, with just three models (4S, 4, and 3GS) of a 3G handset that sports only a 3.5" display captures over 70% of the worldwide profits in the Smartphone market. How is it that Apple, with its vastly superior OS and integrated experience across iPhones, iPads, iPods, and Macs, NOT thinking several moves ahead. Samsung is playing the game Apple wants them to play. Among Apple's next moves will be incorporation of a power efficient 4G radio and a larger display, taking away from Samsung and others the two key differentiators they currently enjoy.</Msg><Username>radar_the_kat</Username><Timestamp>1343485131671</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-07-28 10:18:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343488083697-40</Id><Title>Apple to take an interest in Twitter</Title><Msg>nice article in WSJ today.

Samsung’s profits from its handset division more than doubled year over year. The company is estimated to have sold 50.5 million smartphones, almost double the 26.0 million iPhones Apple sold. According to IDC, in the second quarter Samsung’s smartphone market share climbed from 17% in the previous year to 32.6%, while Apple’s market share declined from 18.8% in the previous year to 16.9%. On the tablet side, competition is also rapidly increasing. The Google Nexus 7 tablet is gaining market share and is priced at just $199. In contrast, the New iPad starts at $500. Moreover, Microsoft is planning to release Windows 8 on Oct. 26. Along with Windows 8, Microsoft will release Windows RT, which is a version of Windows 8 designed to run on ARM (NASDAQ: ARMH) chips.</Msg><Username>valueplay_2000</Username><Timestamp>1343488302718</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-07-28 11:11:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343489089225-42</Id><Topic><Title>Mission Accomplished</Title><Username>thinkdifferent_98</Username><Timestamp>1343469056151</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-07-28 05:50:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>All of them are fake trades.

First, I am glad Apple is approaching this as an 'investment' and not a buyout. Seems like Twitter could benefit on their balance sheet from it, and Apple, since Twitter is integrated in their products. Also, it is a hedge against a Google possible buyout. In my opinion, I think the buyout of Authentec is more significant, and more of a catalyst for Apple. Just my opinion.</Msg><Username>lord_chatterly</Username><Timestamp>1343500744511</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-07-28 14:39:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343500994456-81</Id><Topic><Title>Lord Chatterfly likes it from behind!!!

Draghi can't convince Eurozoners of bailout. Reference "austerity" riots in Greece, Italy and Spain. Grexit pegged at over 90% certainty. And stop to think about all the past "Euro solutions" that never came to fruition. Thursday and Friday rally was the most massive dose of "hopium" (despise CNBC) injected into investors blood streams. Check out the large block selling even as buying (stocks) rose. Hmmmmm.... GDP report, consumer sentiment, and trade balance numbers will NOT prompt Fed to do anything other than implement some greater form of transparency. Bernanke won't allow himself to be a political puppet. Economic numbers not bad enough to shoot remainder of Fed load/wad. By next Friday DOW will be 12,300. Well maybe 12,450. Naw, 12,280. LAST NOTE: Whatever ECB and FED do will have a very brief effect. If you disagree, note the diminished reactions of last QE's. Like a junkie, bigger fixes are needed to get the same rush. Good luck to all next week.

The dividend is payable on August 16, 2012, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on August 13, 2012. “We’re thrilled with record sales of 17 million iPads in the June quarter,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “We’ve also just updated the entire MacBook line, will release Mountain Lion tomorrow and will be launching iOS 6 this Fall. We are also really looking forward to the amazing new products we’ve got in the pipeline.” “We’re continuing to invest in the growth of our business and are pleased to be declaring a dividend of $2.65 per share today,” said Peter Oppenheimer, Apple’s CFO. “Looking ahead to the fourth fiscal quarter, we expect revenue of about $34 billion and diluted earnings per share of about $7.65.” Apple will provide live streaming of its Q3 2012 financial results conference call beginning at 2:00 p.m. PDT on July 24, 2012 at http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2012/07/24Apple-Reports-Third-Quarter-Results.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1343518907000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-07-28 19:41:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343521257589-98</Id><Topic><Title>The big money for options next 3 month is analyzing why iphone5 is not huge success or as iphone4s release</Title><Username>aea_42</Username><Timestamp>1343478743345</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-07-28 08:32:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you should see their pix.
