U.S. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said if Congress were to pass the legislation calling for the land swap, the mine expansion could result in 4,000 jobs. Opponents of the swap include the Obama administration and many Democratic lawmakers. They have argued that an environmental review should be completed before the exchange is made. During debate in the House last fall, Democrats complained that the mining company would not have to pay royalties to the U.S. government for lucrative mineral rights that could be worth billions of dollars.</Msg><Username>fishnman1973</Username><Timestamp>1354535459943</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 06:50:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354536379517-18</Id><Title>buy all u can -- mexican courts are a joke</Title><Msg>buyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyying more</Msg><Username>winston10024</Username><Timestamp>1354536379517</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 07:06:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354537690030-19</Id><Title>Hey nut job fishnman, You realize the election is over?

Which explains why no other company is interested in acquiring Yahoo. It has nothing to offer another company. Remember when Time Warner purchased AOL for stock. AOL shareholders would have been destroyed without the buyout, but because of the asset transfer AOL shareholders only lost part of their investment. Time Warner investors ate the rest of the loss. The same thing will happen to any company that buys Yahoo. It will destroy its own shareholders capital. While Yahoo shareholders might like to be bought out, no CEO is going to make a deal for Yahoo. In Yahoo, Dan Loeb has met his Waterloo, his Stalingrad, his Black Hole of Calcutta, his Midway, and his Desert Storm. It is only a matter of time until he hang himself.</Msg><Username>grey116677</Username><Timestamp>1354564808832</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 15:00:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354566727889-103</Id><Topic><Title>They have not covered, calls are no out of money, Baba does not mean YHOO ...</Title><Username>quantum_analyst</Username><Timestamp>1354546634826</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 09:57:14 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hold the phone, back way the h*ll up.

The Securities and Exchange Commission began proceedings against the Chinese affiliates of Deloitte, KPMG, PricewaterhouseCoopers, BDO and Ernst &amp; Young. The agency on Monday also moved to pursue a case they had put on hold against Deloitte. It was the SEC's widest enforcement effort yet to procure documents in connection with probes of possible accounting fraud of U.S.-listed Chinese companies, and raised questions about whether talks have stalled between the U.S. and Chinese governments to resolve the issue. The SEC said it has been seeking documents related to investigations of possible wrongdoing at nine China-based companies. Chinese secrecy laws have stymied efforts to obtain audit documents that investigators need to determine whether there were accounting irregularities.
