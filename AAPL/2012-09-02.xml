Thank you for helping elevate the TRUTH....so it rises to the surface. It is VERY unfortunate that Owe-Bama was NEVER VETTED by the media. The media has MISERABLY FAILED the American People. And - NOW - many people feel that buyer's remorse feeling after being sucked into the "hope &amp; change" dream - which had ZERO SUBSTANCE behind it. I imagine most people were SHOCKED at getting to know the REAL Mitt Romney at the Republican National Convention. For months, the media just spewed out all kinds of blatant lie$, rumor$ and mi$leading information about BAIN CAPITAL - which has created over 100,000 jobs - still in existence today !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Celebrating American entrepreneurial success is something that escapes the Radical $ocialist movement which has hijacked the media. Here are the FACTS about Mitt Romney at BAIN CAPITAL and his other accomplishments that have gone UNREPORTED by the media (copied from the Romney website): Governor Romney's work at Bain Capital was about fixing companies that were broken and giving new companies a shot at success. Building Businesses, Creating Jobs Governor Romney's time at Bain Capital was spent fixing struggling businesses and giving new businesses a shot at success. From 1984, when Romney co-founded the firm, to February 1999 when he left to lead the Olympics, Romney helped save thousands of jobs at companies that were in trouble. And the businesses Romney helped start while at Bain Capital employ more than 100,000 people today. Since Bain Capital's founding, the company has had a remarkable record of success, especially considering that it largely invests with struggling or startup enterprises. Eighty percent of Bain Capital's portfolio companies have increased revenues, and only five percent of the companies under its control have filed for bankruptcy. Romney's work not only helped to save and create jobs, it also provided returns to investors, the majority of which were pension funds for retirees, university endowments helping with financial aid, and charities serving their local communities. This experience helped Romney fix a scandal-plagued and debt-ridden Olympics in 2002 and to fix a budget shortfall in Massachusetts. He knows how to provide strong leadership in challenging times, and he will bring that experience with him to the White House to fix America's broken economy and to create jobs for the millions of Americans who are out of work. The Obama campaign's attacks on business and free enterprise aren't just false; they explain why we aren't creating jobs. They reveal what this President really thinks about free enterprise. This is the most anti-business President in memory, and the results are clear: 23 million Americans are struggling for work, and unemployment has been above eight percent for 42 straight months. It's time to make a change to someone who understands the private sector and can get America working again.</Msg><Username>white_knight_in_texas</Username><Timestamp>1346560362523</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 00:32:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>13</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346560871722-4</Id><Topic><Title>president obama's accomplishments</Title><Username>faribachicagomed</Username><Timestamp>1346555478032</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-01 23:11:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Interesting you didn't reveal your source for this, ha?

The crystal clear difference between a RADICAL $OCIALI$T (OweBama) and a PROVEN BUSINESS LEADER (Romney) with PRO-CAPITALISM GROWTH POLICIES FOR MORE JOBS. On one side, you have the THUG TEAM (Led by Radical $ocialist Owe-Bama) -- throwing out personal insult attacks -- SAYING ANYTHING to distract from a RECORD OF FAILURE -- as the quality of life of the average Middle Class American has witnessed RISING FOOD COSTS, RISING ENERGY COSTS and RISING UTILITY COSTS. OweBama's solution is to RAISE TAXES, INCREASE SPENDING (More Debt -- Putting the USA on a DIRECT PATH TO ECONOMIC DISASTER like Greece). On the other side, you hear about a man of personal integrity and honesty -- whose company that he founded, BAIN CAPITAL, has created over 100,000 jobs -- which are still in existence TODAY !!!!!!!!! How did he do it? -- By turning around failing businesses for the most part. This type of man is EXACTLY what America needs at this very time in history !!!!! APPLE lobbied the OweBama Admin. for a Tax Repatriation Holiday to STOP DOUBLE-TAXATION. OweBama refused. This STOPPED over $1 Trillion Dollars being held overseas -- from coming DIRECTLY BACK TO AMERICA -- and stimulating the USA economy !!!!! What was OweBama thinking ??? Most EVERY OTHER DEVELOPED COUNTRY in the world allows its corporation to bring money (ALREADY TAXES overseas in a Foreign Tax Jurisdiction) to come back to their home country without a DOUBLE-TAX. This is just ONE EXAMPLE of the hately, hurting economic policies of OweBama. Check-out ROMNEY's ECONOMIC PLAN -- See below (directly from the Romney website).......(The USA would be the envy of the world with this plan) Mitt Romney’s Plan for a Stronger Middle Class A Plan For More Jobs And More Take-Home Pay Energy Independence • Increase access to domestic energy resources • Streamline permitting for exploration and development • Eliminate regulations destroying the coal industry • Approve the Keystone XL pipeline The Skills To Succeed • Give every family access to a great school and quality teachers • Provide access to affordable and effective higher education options • Focus job training programs on building valuable skills that align with opportunities • Attract and retain the best and the brightest from around the world Trade That Works For America • Curtail the unfair trade practices of countries like China • Open new markets for American goods and services • Build stronger economic ties in Latin America • Create a Reagan Economic Zone to strengthen free enterprise around the world Cut The Deficit • Immediately reduce non-security discretionary spending by five percent • Cap federal spending below twenty percent of the economy • Give states responsibility for programs that they can implement more effectively • Consolidate agencies and align compensation of federal workers with their private-sector counterparts Champion Small Business • Reduce taxes on job creation through individual and corporate tax reform • Stop the increases in regulation that are tangling job creators in red tape • Protect workers and businesses from strong-arm labor union tactics • Replace Obamacare with real health care reform that controls cost and improves care</Msg><Username>white_knight_in_texas</Username><Timestamp>1346599761810</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 11:29:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346600326080-48</Id><Topic><Title>REALITY CHECK: AAPL SELLS AT DISCOUNT TO S &amp; P and HAS MUCH HIGHER GROWTH RATE</Title><Username>alphashort</Username><Timestamp>1346598134054</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 11:02:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well said --- LOAD UP ahead of the herd -- AHEAD of key product launches.

The problem with this simplistic view is that the market cap is too large to sustain future growth and the margins will simply have to come down to maintain these levels of sales. So focus on the market cap and the potential size of the market and you will realize why AAPL can not maintain a 600 B valuation unless you believe every man, woman and child across the world will be standing in line for a new iphone 5.</Msg><Username>spx1018</Username><Timestamp>1346601449949</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 11:57:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346601728011-52</Id><Topic><Title>I am going to book profit here and come back in at $610</Title><Username>ladder_week</Username><Timestamp>1346590691392</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 08:58:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Just curious, when do you anticipate it getting to 610 again?

I have mixed emotions about the rise this week. part of me sees it happening, the other side of me feels it has all been baked in to the share price already. Now, I am not certain where the range to 744 from 12-24 Sep comes from, but that is lofty and with OE coming before the 24th I dont see if climbing that high. of course, if there is some earth shattering news coming out on Sep 12, it may be the case. What I think we should all be focused on is the next earnings. Last earnings, Apple guided lower which resulted in a sell off. Now, we have Iphone5 (or whatever it will be called) and the end of the year. So with that, I anticipate this quarter will be exceptional and they will guide up. THAT should propel the stock to the 750 range for sure. Now if history repeats itself (and I and others have had thier lunch handed to them following patterns), Apple will sell off after the product release. Again, this is my humble opinion. I own 50 Sep calls ATM.</Msg><Username>intercrime2</Username><Timestamp>1346609508543</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 14:11:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346609744034-71</Id><Topic><Title>What if there is an issue witht he product again?

If you knew anything about economics, you would know that. It means, that people will scramble to buy as quickly as it is announced. Expect it to have the opposite of what you believe.

Watching David Axeldingleberry on Fox Sunday with Chris Wallace again dem spinning like the merrygoround in fairy land. Again Axeldingleberry laying the blame on Bush and the last decade without ever once acknowledging the 100 years of failed primary dem party control that has handed us EVERY failed system and entitlement of today. Not just one or two but EVERY stinking yet dems such as Obamadungdufus and Axeldingleberry can rely on the FACT that most dems are as STUPID as themselves. As dem Mr. Alan 'Andrea Mitchell' Greenspan said in 2009 'we are ending a 100 year business cycle which was easily obvious to most of us 'in the know' as was the FACT they chose to begin ending the 100 year cycle 9/2008 just before the election and for one simple reason to crown Obamadungdufus. So gear up for the FILTHY RICH GEORGIE GIRL SOROS FUNDED Charlotte show beginning this week then the October surprise they will all have in store to provide more fake economic turn around instilling the ploy that Obamadungdufus is why. HA! Look at the $5.6 TRILLION debt increase in less than 4 years under Obamadungdufus and the FACT that it will most likely go over $16 TRILLION by the time the Charlotte Show ends. You have to be quite dumb to not see all these FACTS (i.e. 100 years of primary dem party control) and your dumbo leaders such as Obamadungdufus, Queen Pelosi, Dingy Harry the Body Reid and the DO NOTHING SENATE, Axeldingleberry...rely upon that FACT, that you indeed are just as STUPID as them!!! Now lets get off to Charlotte and watch all the hate inspired division of the dunce dem party of today! As the Roberts ruling continues to be analyzed I believe his words say it all: 1. It is a tax just as we all surmised from the beginning and 2; most importantly the court cannot protect the citizens from the consequences of an election. So you see, just as I and many said, Obama has indeed changed the country forever in a very bad way. We indeed will now have the UK failed system of socialized medicine, to replace our very outstanding previously profit driven capitalistic form of medicine that being the very factor that made it so great. What this is truly about is 100 years of primary democrat party failed control for which their chickens indeed have come home to roost and they spent all our money (SS/Medicare, income taxes etc..) on welfare to lock in democrat votes moving forward. 1913 dem Wilson Federal Reserve Bank CREATURE that has debt leveraged our currency to zero intrinsic value, 1933 dem FDR failed SS Ponzi that was only to cost $.03 per pay, 1964 dem LBJ failed Medicare Ponzi now completely broke necessitating socialized medicine with the death panels to preclude costly care for the boomers now retiring in mass and being told all the money taken from them was squandered on welfare, and now Obama under dem Pelosi Congress more debt increase than all prior Presidents combined in less than 3.6 years. Yes Justice Roberts is correct that the court cannot be responsible for the consequences of an election, indeed Obama Care is a huge cost and most importantly this decision will cost many more jobs and the USA as once known is now finished. Hopefully Romney can stand on the 10th Amendment which is correct asserting that healthcare in MA was a states issue and this Federal mandate is not but repealing it now will be tough and impossible without Repubs taking House, Senate and POTUS. Without Harry Reid gone nothing will ever be accomplished.</Msg><Username>obamadungdufus</Username><Timestamp>1346610077899</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 14:21:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346610137553-73</Id><Topic><Title>Negative Sentiment About AAPL Rising:</Title><Username>shortinguy</Username><Timestamp>1346595673157</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 10:21:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well, if your shorting AAPL, when it rises, of course your sentiments are negative :-)</Msg><Username>mrgizmo1</Username><Timestamp>1346610137553</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 14:22:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346610797990-74</Id><Topic><Title>Negative Sentiment About AAPL Rising:</Title><Username>shortinguy</Username><Timestamp>1346595673157</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 10:21:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The 5 better be outstanding otherwise there will be an unpleasant reversal.</Msg><Username>trycomsen35</Username><Timestamp>1346610797990</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 14:33:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346610798676-75</Id><Title>Honest Feedback Please We are in a Bind, I think?</Title><Msg>My girlfriend and I bought 308 shares of Apple last week at 671 dollars.

Our present health insurance evolved during World War II as an employee benefit to skirt around price and wage controls then in effect. Back then, if you got cancer, you went home and died. Today, you go home broke and sell your home, even with employer provided health insurance. Employer provided Heath insurance does not protect Americans from an economic catastrophy because the policy is owned by the employer, not the employee. Also today companies must compete on a global basis. American companies will lose against countries that have no health insurance every time. Obamacare is an attempt at private Heath insurance to correct some of these deficiencies It is less socialized than what we have now (half the beds in hospitals are occupied by people without health insurance and can not afford to pay).</Msg><Username>edison20</Username><Timestamp>1346616344912</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 16:05:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346616878190-87</Id><Title>(( MITT ROMNEY = DESTRUCTION OF YOUR AMERICA )))</Title><Msg>GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG</Msg><Username>swks_sucker_aapl_00001</Username><Timestamp>1346616878190</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 16:14:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346616893056-88</Id><Title>Short AAPL BACK TO $100 LEVEL</Title><Msg>With all these ridiculous lawsuit, consumers to flocking to Samsung products.</Msg><Username>ynexmp</Username><Timestamp>1346616893056</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 16:14:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346616942142-89</Id><Topic><Title>)) BEEN SHORT AAPL SINCE 144 DOWN OVER $2M BUCKS ((BUT I'AM A DEVOTED SHORT SO I'LL CONTINUE THE PAIN ((</Title><Username>bagholder_13</Username><Timestamp>1346605452384</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 13:04:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ggggggggggggggggg</Msg><Username>swks_sucker_aapl_00001</Username><Timestamp>1346616942142</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 16:15:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346616988870-90</Id><Title>((( bagholder rocks 24/7 ))</Title><Msg>gggggggggggg</Msg><Username>swks_sucker_aapl_00001</Username><Timestamp>1346616988870</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 16:16:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346617058126-91</Id><Topic><Title>When is enough Enough?</Title><Username>Locutus_IX</Username><Timestamp>1049212357000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2003-04-01 10:52:37 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>gggggggg</Msg><Username>swks_sucker_aapl_00001</Username><Timestamp>1346617058126</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 16:17:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346617103042-92</Id><Title>(( headed to soho house nyc 9th ave tonight )))</Title><Msg>ggggggggggggggg</Msg><Username>swks_sucker_aapl_00001</Username><Timestamp>1346617103042</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 16:18:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346617244074-93</Id><Topic><Title>Apple's POS has decreased 4% last five quarters, clearly solidifying the the reverse head and shoulders uptrend.</Title><Username>lord_chatlerly</Username><Timestamp>1346616026399</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 16:00:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What sick pub would assign herself the name whettphart?

At $75 per share, I estimate a 9 fold increase in share price (900%). Who says BUY &amp; HOLD doesn't work? BUY &amp; HOLD WORKS --- But only with a GREAT COMPANY --- and APPLE INC. is a GREAT COMPANY (maybe the GREATEST COMPANY ever) -- very well-managed with the most-efficient supply chain in the world. The company is making all the right moves to continue to make "APPLE" the most TRUSTED BRAND in the world. In my view, with the 1,000+ Employee Product Design Team led by Sir Jony Ive, I believe the Research &amp; Development of NEW INNOVATION to disrupt industries in the future -- will happen sooner than anyone thinks.

AAPL can be very volatile (up &amp; down swings). You have made an INVESTMENT into a Very Strong Growth Stock - which also pays a small dividend. AAPL is closely watched as a widely-held growth stock, and with that said, as EARNINGS EXPLODE higher due to the Calendar Q4 Report (to be disclosed in Mid-January 2013), I believe you will be rewarded with a much higher price. In early October, AAPL will begin a $10 BILLION DOLLAR Share Buyback Program which should make the volatility a little less. You must be informed....that almost ANY stock can swing positive or negative in a Three (3) Month time span - with macro-economic news swinging the market one direction or the other....dragging-down even the best stocks! HOWEVER, when you invest in a GROWTH STOCK, then you should have a LONG-TERM horizon to hold it (to give it time to GROW) -- because that is when you benefit from the UNDERLYING STRONG FUNDAMENTAL GROWTH -- which pushes the share price of AAPL higher and higher. Note: AAPL is trading at a Discount to the S&amp;P 500 with a low PE ratio -- and More CASH on hand than Any Corporation EVER in the history of the world. Furthermore, two MAJOR product launches (iPhone 5 and iPad Mini) are just days or months (likely before the holiday buying season) away. And - typically, the Calendar Q4 and Calendar Q1 are the strongest. Speaking for myself -- I have INVESTED in AAPL as a LONG-TERM INVESTMENT TO HOLD -- due to the fact that APPLE is the most valuable "Brand" in the world -- and has a VERY STRONG track record of INNOVATING new products that DISRUPT industries -- and I expect the same INNOVATIONS to continue for DECADES to come. The 1,000+ Employee Product Design Team, led by Sir Jony Ive, is the BEST in the WORLD...and will be bringing new mind-blowing products to market for DECADES to come !!!

XOM is conservatively and very well-managed and is one of the Top Brands in the World. I know the company well. Since Feb. 2011, XOM has been consolidating - banging up against the resistance level of $88ish. When it breaks it clearly, then I see a run to $96ish. In the Long-term, the technicals point to a move up to $120ish. When a clear break is made of resistance at $88ish, then I believe the P&amp;F Target will update to reflect a Price Target closer to $120ish. From a macro-economic perspective, XOM has benefited from both up &amp; down commodity cycles for many decades. Take a look at the LONG-TERM CHART. Low Nat-Gas prices are feedstock for the growing Ethylene chemical business - which XOM is expanding. If Exxon's Chemcial Business were to be "spun-off", then it would be the largest Chemical Company in the USA. Read this recent news release on the expanding Ethylene Plant - to take advantage of lower Nat-Gas costs... Bloomberg News Exxon Plans U.S. Ethylene Plant to Make Use of Cheap Gas June 01, 2012 Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the largest U.S. oil company, plans to build factories that produce ethylene and plastics in Texas, joining a growing group of competitors racing to use U.S. natural gas to make chemicals. A new plant at the company’s site in Baytown would produce 1.5 million metric tons of ethylene annually starting in 2016, pending regulatory approvals, Irving, Texas-based Exxon said today in an e-mailed statement. The gaseous chemical would be used to make 1.3 million metric tons of polyethylene plastic at two plants to be built in nearby Mont Belvieu, the company said. The Houston-area plants would “significantly” increase exports of plastics, Exxon said in the statement. Chevron Phillips Chemical Co. is planning a $5 billion ethylene project at its Baytown site and Dow Chemical Co. (DOW) is also expanding to use more gas-based raw materials that provide a cost advantage over oil-based production in Europe and Asia. “The proposed investment reflects Exxon Mobil’s continued confidence in the natural-gas-driven revitalization of the U.S. chemical industry,” the company said in the statement. Gas prices in New York fell to a 10-year-low in April and have pushed costs for U.S. chemical producers to the lowest outside of the Middle East, Cynthia Werneth, an analyst at Standard &amp; Poor’s, said on a conference call today. Exxon’s Largest The ethylene plant would be Exxon’s largest in the U.S. and its first in the country since 1997. The company has two ethylene plants in Baytown with capacities of 1 million tons and 1.2 million tons; a 800,000-ton capacity factory in Beaumont, Texas; and 1-million-ton plant in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, according to Exxon’s 2011 Financial &amp; Operating Review. The polyethylene plants would increase by 34 percent Exxon’s U.S. output of the resin used to make products such as food packaging and plastics bags, based on data in the company review. Globally, Exxon’s ethylene capacity would increase 17 percent and its polyethylene production would rise 18 percent. The project would create 10,000 construction jobs and would boost Exxon’s Baytown workforce of 6,500 by about 350, the company said. Margaret Ross, a company spokeswoman, declined to say in a telephone interview how much the project would cost.</Msg><Username>white_knight_in_texas</Username><Timestamp>1346624388714</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 18:19:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346624455017-124</Id><Topic><Title>the beginning of the end starts tuesday in spectacular fashion here we GGGGGOOOOOOOOOOOOO</Title><Username>musichead2005</Username><Timestamp>1346621755168</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 17:35:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thought I should drop by and say hi to you, MusicHead.

I cannot. If you vote for OweBama, then I feel sorry for your kids and EVERY kid in America -- because OweBama is doing more harm to America than I have seen in decades. Just use this Litmus Test: * Are Food Prices higher ??? -------- SKYROCKETING HIGHER. * Are Gasoline Prices higher ??? ------ SUSTAINED HIGHER PRICES -- ABOVE $4.00/GAL. * Are Utility Prices higher ??? ------ MUCH MUCH HIGHER. * Has Owe-Bama added $5 Trillion in Debt to now a TOTAL DEBT of nearly $16 TRILLION ??? ---- YES -- And, Owe-Bama would ADD MORE DEBT ---- Dragging the USA down the path to a Greece-like disaster. * Has the USA received a DOWNGRADE in its DEBT RATING under OweBama? ---- YES (MAJOR RED FLAG). RADICAL $OCIALISM (High Taxes, Debt-Spending and Over-Regulation) is a path straight over the cliff. It is simple -- to see the end-result. Just look at the European nations in trouble -- Spain, Portugal, Italy &amp; Greece !!! OweBama's economic policies have mirrored the Euro-$ocialist policies which have proven to be a disaster. Mitt Romney's ECONOMIC PLAN is fantastic. Scroll-up on this thread to see it on another post that I made. Step #1 would be to have an ENERGY POLICY....which would LOWER Food Prices, Gasoline Prices &amp; Utility Prices -- helping the USA's Middle Class and Poor. Isn't it ironic? Owe-Bama claimed to HELP the Middle Class and Poor -- and he has HURT THEM THE VERY MOST with high food, gasoline &amp; utility bills. Make the right choice - VOTE for Mitt Romney - The Businessman who will Turn American Around -- and get America back on track for GROWTH and MORE JOBS and LOWER ENERGY &amp; FOOD COSTS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</Msg><Username>white_knight_in_texas</Username><Timestamp>1346625495786</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 18:38:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346625597298-129</Id><Topic><Title>Got an app idea that will get at least 20 million downloads.

So far Apple has been lucky, The BOD at Google must own a large amount of Apple stock, there is no other reason I could find why Google is playing softball with Apple. Why has Google not pushed to invalidate those broad Apple patents? A large market cap should not have more power than patents, The ITC must follow the law and stop Apple in their tracks and halt the sale of all Apple products in the U.S.A. Some on CNBC have said the power of a huge market cap should win over the power of the patents, some crazy people there. If Google management will not take Apple to the matt, vote them all out. Apple is the King when it comes to Infringement on others patents. Look at the Cases against Apple..

The problem with this simplistic view is that they believe that the market cap is too large to sustain future growth and margins. When, as a point of fact, AAPL has maintained their parabolic growth rates and margins so far -- despite the fact that the "law of large numbers folks" have been calling for AAPL's market cap to cause problems for AAPL a couple hundred billion dollars of market cap ago. And, even if the growth rates began to decelerate, they would still be a lot better that almost all of the companies in the S &amp;P; meaning that AAPL should still be awarded a higher multiple than the S &amp; P. AAPL will earn between 60-70 dollars a share in 2014 and at a 16-18 p/e it will be trading well over 1000 dollars a share. AAPL will be the first trillion dollar market cap company. And, it will happen in 2014. Money goes where it can earn the best risk adjusted return. Growth and value funds can now invest in AAPL. Fixed income assets will be forced to come back into risk assets due to lousy yields in fixed income. There is plenty of money out there to continue to drive AAPL to much higher levels...and it will.</Msg><Username>alphashort</Username><Timestamp>1346627605875</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 19:13:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346627723032-138</Id><Topic><Title>Honest Feedback Please We are in a Bind, I think?</Title><Username>jefff47</Username><Timestamp>1346610798676</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 14:33:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Lol unfortunately the markets are closed tomm.

And, it seems Mr. Munster was correct - looking at DELL, RIMM, HP, SAMSUNG, etc. As more and more investors SEEK INCOME, I believe AAPL will be a logical part of a portfolio - since it has both GROWTH &amp; INCOME. In the FUTURE, investors will NEED to keep ahead of the inflation - which will happen. All the printing of money has consequences sooner - or later (in the future). Hold some energy stocks as well.

If on margin then you made a serious mistake, if cash then I will agree with the majority and chill out and don't look at it for several months as you are not astute enough to be trading this on a daily basis and should look at it as a longer term investment. My guess is though that you did it on margin as you are worried about the next few days and a few dollars down. In that case sell enough to get off margin then follow the above advice. Learn to invest or get out of the market. don't listen to the day traders here as you are not experienced enough to do so, and that is not a bad thing just a real truth. You need to be a professional to do that with a proper mental attitude. When you can't afford to lose money you are sure to do so. The fact that it had run a $100 in a month doesn't mean it will continue to straight line do more.

I have done this again this week as I believe it will be hard for the Sept 12th to live up to the hype that has already been given. I don't think there will be as much as some expect and therefore a temporary pullback, this in part was exposed last week when Sharp said they couldn't deliver on the glass panels that were due 8/1 and wasn't sure when they could, I realize they are just one of 3 suppliers but it is a problem and will cut deeply into sales. I expect more news of that order, AAPL wants to get away from Samsung as a supplier but is having trouble finding a replacement, that is another hiccup. The positive is they are discussing with GOOG. I will get back in after I see the reaction to the sept 12 product announcement. I am expecting a dip to 630 area. Downside risk after a 100 point run up is higher than upside, I don't mind missing a little up side but the big down side I will try to miss. Time for a small correction IMO. Also the market is ready for a correction, the big boys need to shake a few trees before this can go up more. Then there is the typical worst month of the year for the market. Everything seems to be pointing as a time to be on sideline and currently i am in 50% cash.</Msg><Username>rlbeard6734</Username><Timestamp>1346631045843</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 20:10:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346631454425-155</Id><Topic><Title>(( DRINKING VERY EXPENSIVE WINE RIGHT NOW ))</Title><Username>bagholder_13</Username><Timestamp>1346623076278</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 17:57:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Feeling pretty loose right now :-)</Msg><Username>bagholder_13</Username><Timestamp>1346631454425</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 20:17:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346632170965-156</Id><Topic><Title>Way overbought and overpriced.

Samsung is a company that all of South Korea was proud of. Innovation in new products has never really been Asia's forte ... culturally they just got used to making inexpensive knock-offs and didn't realize how wrong it was to make exact copies. The croc knock-offs that are sold in Walmart are kind of exact copies but China has gotten away with that for years so Samsung was just using the same model. I would like to see them make peace with Apple, pay their fines, and make knock-offs that aren't exact copies, and maybe even try a little innovation. A lot of the world can't afford an iPhone, they depend on companies like Samsung making far less expensive products available, they just need to learn where the line is. I don't think Samsung is evil, they just didn't understand that they couldn't do an exact copy.</Msg><Username>cofunloving</Username><Timestamp>1346634166491</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 21:02:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346634789025-166</Id><Title>Samdung supporters need ...</Title><Msg>to live in South Korea to copy American technology.

In AMERICA, the Free Enterprise Capitalist Model has, at its VERY CORE, the word PROFIT. It is the amount of money left over -- to reinvest in RESEARCH &amp; DEVELOPMENT of future products and fund ongoing operations. So, without PROFIT, the entire Capitalist model does not work. APPLE makes a healthy profit because it has created a TOP BRAND in the world - creating a loyal customer base who appreciate the beautiful, easy-to-use products that are state-of-the-art in every way -- the CUTTING-EDGE of the TECHNOLOGICAL REVOLUTION. To maintain the leadership position of the Top Brand in the World, APPLE INC. must reinvest in RESEARCH &amp; DEVELOPMENT to keep INNOVATING. And, APPLE INC. is doing just that -- and the world is always excited to see the New Product Launches -- and what new product may AGAIN change the world. So, PROFIT SEEKING entrepreneurs across AMERICA look to invest in, or organically-build and/or invent new products, etc. This is the magic of FREEDOM in AMERICA -- it just MOTIVATES people !!!!!!!!!!! What causes an Innovative Society? Easy Answer: History has already given us the answer - and that answer is FREEDOM. For 5,000 years, this world we live in...was in the Horse &amp; Buggy Era, like the old Middle Ages. Some countries haven't changed in the Middle East...even now. People in many countries have (or had) despot dictators on their backs, or monarchs stealing from them, or communal-type living that left people stagnate with little motivation but the status quo. THEN, the founders of the United States wrote a constitution that UNLEASHED FREEDOM, IMAGINATION, INVENTIVENESS -- and, in ONLY 236 years, the world was pulled out of the Horse &amp; Buggy Era, which had trapped the human race for 5,000 years. There are so many very important US inventions: Telephone, Electricity, the Light Bulb, the Combine for Harvesting, Computers, etc...that came from American inventors. If a society has a despot dictator, monarch or central government that does not RESPECT and ADHERE to the RULE OF LAW, then --- what motivation is there to INVENT and PATENT anything? Your hard work would be simply stolen. I wish to recommend a book called The 5,000 Year Leap. Ronald Reagan recommended that it be taught in all public High Schools. FREEDOM is not a Left, Right or Centrist Idea... FREEDOM is desired by every human being in the world. And, given the FREEDOM to CREATE and INVENT...along with an environment in which there are laws that will PROTECT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, a society will flourish -- just as it has done in the USA. Amazing inventions by American inventors have changed the world. Is FREEDOM increasing or decreasing in the USA? During the past 4 years, much government regulation has interfered with the Private Sector's ability to conduct FREE enterprise. Some regulation is needed, but... too much will stifle the FREE environment that has enabled the USA to thrive. In the book referenced above, it is recommended that the Burden of Debt be AVOIDED. Over-spending by the US Government is the wrong direction. A small, limited government made the USA an economic superpower; BUT....a large, bloated government saddled with debt could drag us down the path of Greece. Whether we like it not, economics and politics DO INTERSECT.

The case, not to be confused with the recently decided Apple v. Samsung trial, was first lodged in February, with Apple leveraging eight utility patents against 17 Samsung devices. At the time, it was said that Apple was taking direct aim at the Samsung-built Google-branded Galaxy Nexus with the complaint. Along with the Galaxy S III and the Verizon version of the handset, Apple added the Galaxy Note and Galaxy Note 10.1 to the list of infringing devices, bringing the total tally up to 21 accused devices. The S III made its U.S. debut in June, more than one year after Apple lodged its first complaint against Samsung in April 2011, accusing the company's products of copying the look and feel of the iPhone and iPad. Apple claims it is suffering and will suffer irreparable harm from Samsung's violation of eight utility patents, four being asserted in the Apple v. Samsung case and four issued after that suit began. According to Apple, Samsung has "continued to flood the market with copycat products," since the separate landmark case started last year. In the intervening months, the Korean company has "continued to release new infringing products, including its current flagship device, the Galaxy S III."</Msg><Username>davidch14</Username><Timestamp>1346637721853</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 22:02:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346638004510-173</Id><Title>Virgin Mobile discontinuing iPhone sales...Bloomberg</Title><Msg>All you Cocc suing hoommoos go lock your daddy's #$%$ crack.</Msg><Username>lord_chatlerly</Username><Timestamp>1346638004510</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 22:06:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346638163314-174</Id><Topic><Title>Virgin Mobile discontinuing iPhone sales...Bloomberg</Title><Username>lord_chatlerly</Username><Timestamp>1346638004510</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 22:06:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And who would vote for a white honkey like Mitt.

You must search for any bad news for Apple because you will never see any on pump sites like CNBC. You will not even see all those lawsuits against Apple in their SEC filings. How many Iphones will be sold this quarter? Any number Timber Cook picks out of the clear blue sky, even when they reduce that number long after the wild guess caused the stock price to jump up, CNBC will pump the highest numbers every day even if they are true or not. No judge would triple the damages from that wacko one sided court. Apple is mad because Samsung has 19% of the market in China and they are growing fast, Apple Iphone just can't beat that. Amazon now has 22% of the tablet market, on CNBC someone said Apple has over 90% of that market. I guess Samsung is not selling any G 10.1 tablets.

You said in your reply to my post: "You are off in LEFT field. Only the lefist $ocialist have had anything bad to say about Clint's remarks." Read my post again before name calling. Did I say anything bad about Clint? Nope! I consider myself one of his biggest fans. I've seen and bought all his movies first on DVD, then when blu-ray technology came around I sold my DVDs and bought all the blu-ray versions. So think before you make a comment about who I am. I said: "So did he help the Republicans by his speech? I am not so sure...." The evident was how Republicans shoed how they felt about his speech that they didn't even include any of it in their "Highlight Reel", you don't find that odd? Let's see if you understand what I said, this time? And by the way, the profession of a president before he/she gets elected is not that important, we've had all kinds. Nixon was a lawyer and Carter was a successful business man and we know how their presidency turned out -- not so good. So your argument, of Obama is a lawyer and we should put a businessman in office, in my opinion is baseless. Further, ever since Obama got elected, Republicans went on a mission to make him fail. Here is what Fox News and Romney himself said soon after he got elected, these are facts and on record. Google search: "RNC 2012 - The Road to Jeb Bush 2016 - Republican Time Travel" I know Jon Stewart is a Democrat but what the clip above shows are not his saying but only facts with evidence. So watch this 5 minute clip and learn what conclusion it makes towards the end, you might learn something you had not known before!</Msg><Username>didihala_1</Username><Timestamp>1346644315156</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 23:51:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346644585763-193</Id><Topic><Title>Clint Eastwood's performance</Title><Username>didihala_1</Username><Timestamp>1346625126236</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 18:32:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Can't say O'bama doesn't have at least a little class.(I could say more. lol) After that awful speech o'bama could of thrown Clint Eastwood and the replublicans under the ol bus BIG TIME.</Msg><Username>bskall2000</Username><Timestamp>1346644585763</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 23:56:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346644720290-194</Id><Topic><Title>Way overbought and overpriced.
