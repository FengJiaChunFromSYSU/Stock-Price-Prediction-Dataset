Companies do business as usual and IPO while on the list without problem. The list has little meaning and no legal standing. That is the main reason for it going unnoticed. This was a nonevent. With the AliPay agreement Jack Ma reluctantly agreed to a possible IPO as early as late 2015. Today Jack Ma controls Alibaba Group. After an IPO that might not be the case since he will not hold a controlling interest and the new Alibaba Group public company board of directors might chose some other CEO. Jack Ma has nothing to gain by Alibaba Group going public, but much to lose. He would not be the first founder to be kicked out of his company after going public. And I am also sure he has no burning desire to become the Jerry Yang and David Filo of Alibaba Group.</Msg><Username>dr.gloom</Username><Timestamp>1355596372737</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-15 13:32:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355596798840-28</Id><Topic><Title>Game Over at $20</Title><Username>co1done</Username><Timestamp>1355523426392</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-14 17:17:06 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If the game is over at $20 does that mean you are resigned to never getting your original $28 buy and any profit?

If you sell part of or all of your private pool cleaning company to the public who gets the cash? Alibaba Group does not own a part of itself to sell in an IPO. Can Alibaba Group then use the funds Yahoo gets in the IPO to grow the business?</Msg><Username>dr.gloom</Username><Timestamp>1355602852994</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-15 15:20:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355604519822-37</Id><Topic><Title>coldone is a nutcase but he is right about dr gloom, grey, hotidiot, etc. While "notorious market"....</Title><Username>mewag51</Username><Timestamp>1355601165215</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-15 14:52:45 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why are you obsessed with coldone?

Isn't it great this is my 8th or 9th post in 8 days and you're still obsessed with me! Its not my fault you denied about being Dariencat, then pompous enough to offer $100K, only to be him all along when outed in your "synergy" topic. What an entertaining liar you've become! I've been right about AG for 5 YEARS and if Ma DOES IPO in 2013, then I'll be right there as that was the date he indicated MARCH of 2010. Coldone, your fiancée, said AG was IPO'ing in 2010 then it was 2011, then 2012 and now I've seen he's hedged with 2013 and 2014. Ma doesn't need to IPO though as he HAS billions at his disposal thus the credit lines, investments by sovereign funds. Ma has already INVESTED over $1.2/1.3B into his companies in the last 3yrs. Cargill is the LARGEST private company in the world with revenues of $140 BILLION and 130,000 employee's and I don't see them IPO'ing. The ONLY reason he will is he promised Yahoo that he would by 2015. I gave those 2 stakes left a valuation at $70B and $150B, earlier in the week, and the stock still would be worth $24+.</Msg><Username>hotmodeltestid122</Username><Timestamp>1355605416835</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-15 16:03:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355605583052-42</Id><Topic><Title>coldone is a nutcase but he is right about dr gloom, grey, hotidiot, etc. While "notorious market"....</Title><Username>mewag51</Username><Timestamp>1355601165215</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-15 14:52:45 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Too bad you went short when coldone told you to buy at $11, $12, $13, $14, $15, $16, $17 and $18.</Msg><Username>nanobot8042</Username><Timestamp>1355605583052</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-15 16:06:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355605586832-43</Id><Topic><Title>Coldone's Buys at $11, $12, $13, $14, $15, $16, $17 and $18 are all up!</Title><Username>nanobot8042</Username><Timestamp>1354656401298</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 16:26:41 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Coldone's buys anger the board basher.</Msg><Username>nanobot8042</Username><Timestamp>1355605586832</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-15 16:06:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355605630380-44</Id><Topic><Title>$20 in 2012...</Title><Username>split29_2005</Username><Timestamp>1325280091000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2011-12-30 16:21:31 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>split gets burnt.</Msg><Username>nanobot8042</Username><Timestamp>1355605630380</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-15 16:07:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355605644581-45</Id><Topic><Title>Game Over at $20</Title><Username>co1done</Username><Timestamp>1355523426392</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-14 17:17:06 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>#$%$ is wrong with you???

Coldone is absolutely right that the longer Jack Ma waited to launch Alibaba IPO is better off for YHOO. However, I am betting that the announcement will come very soon (1st Q my prediction) and the IPO is middle of next year.</Msg><Username>goingbravo</Username><Timestamp>1355620692393</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-15 20:18:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355621231389-71</Id><Topic><Title>Alibaba's 2013 IPO value said to reach $78 billion usd..

Key statistics show it at 1.18B outstanding. If they bought 150M shares at say $17.50avg($14-$19) is $2.625B which would mean they've spent most of their buyback money and $2 of the pop is simply from removing shares. Too funny...both YOU and COLDONE wanted AG sold years ago...what flip-floppers!</Msg><Username>hotmodeltestid122</Username><Timestamp>1355621231389</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-15 20:27:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355622800943-72</Id><Topic><Title>Alibaba's 2013 IPO value said to reach $78 billion usd..

That is how buybacks work. They take a long, long time. With the public and institutional interest in this stock Yahoo would be lucky to buy back 500k shares a day at the most...

He still doesn't get the difference between gross and net revenue. The article refers to gross revenue and Alibaba reports net. The accounting concept is over his head. As per Eric Jackson, Alibaba is already blowing Amazon away on profits, which are the same regardless of which way you report the revenue. The first rule of bashing is don't be an idiot. Gloom shouldn't be lecturing anybody.</Msg><Username>ancientchinesesecret2000</Username><Timestamp>1355625607952</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-15 21:40:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355629917689-74</Id><Topic><Title>Alibaba's 2013 IPO value said to reach $78 billion usd..

So ancientchinesesecret2000; this gross revenue comes from where? Not any report from Alibaba Group since they don´t report gross revenue, Alibaba reports net. And how is pointing out discrepancies in a pumpers post bashing? Do you pumpers think you should enjoy immunity from criticism? Try posting real reported facts instead of made up numbers and see how the alleged bashing disappears.</Msg><Username>dr.gloom</Username><Timestamp>1355629917689</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-15 22:51:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355631550309-75</Id><Topic><Title>Alibaba's 2013 IPO value said to reach $78 billion usd..

It turned out to be worth less than the $100B Jackson and tetheredbird preached. And Yahoo got just over $4B for the part tetheredbird said was worth at least $20B in his upcoming cash rich split. tetheredbird has a very selective memory and a vivid imagination, he has already forgotten all his buys in the high 20s, imagines buys in the teens and thinks everyone who ever shorts Yahoo shorts low, never buys and covers years later whet the stock is high.
