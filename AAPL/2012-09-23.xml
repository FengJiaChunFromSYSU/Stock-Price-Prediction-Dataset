Third, put your Iphone 5 down and don't touch it because the your bars while holding the phone will go down when you touch the Iphone 5 and the you must have at least 4 bars to connect to your wifi network. Forth, Hold up your index finger next to the phone and move it around until 4 bars are on the phone. Fifth, point your middle finger up to the Iphone 5 and say, I should have bought the Samsung G III.

The judge would not allow Samsung lawyers to show the pictures of Sony's phones to the jury and the judge even went a step too far and banned Samsung's lawyers from showing those pictures to anyone outside the court room. Samsung at that point could have asked for a miss trial but they played the game and knew they would win an appeal the judge was in the pocket of Apple.

That would be 30 more than the rollout of the predecessor phone, the 4S, over a similar period, Jeffries analyst Peter Misek calculated.

Every year Apple releases a new iPhone and while most of the customers are delighted a subset of buyers pull the short end of the stick. With the iPhone 4, it was the antennagate issue, with the iPhone 4S it was the battery life problem and now some iPhone 5 buyers are noticing dents on their prized possession. Yes, many owners, particularly of the Black &amp; Slate colored model, are reporting dents and scratches along the chamfered edges of their new iPhone right out of the box. We haven't seen many reports from owners of the White &amp; Silver model, but that just might be because the color isn't particularly popular. Now, anodized aluminum is known to pick up scuff marks easily. Because the color is painted on top, even a minor scuff can make it come off, revealing a shiny silver spot below. Also, aluminum is a soft metal, so it dents very easily, especially along thin edges. You'll find scuffs and dents on practically every anodized aluminum object that has been used for a while. Which is why it wasn't a shock to us when we saw the iPhone picking up dents along the edges in this drop test. However, it is surprising when the device comes with scuff marks out of the box and points to poor quality checks at Apple's end. Of course, Apple will readily replace any such device for you. But if you're importing this device to a different country (and we know many do), you will need to be careful and hold on till the issue gets sorted. Update: Apparently, white units have the same issues as the black ones. We are really hoping Apple makes an official statement soon enough and explain the cause.

All analysts agree that maybe the maps are flaw but with no doubt this is the best smartphone out there. All the 4.3-5" screens are because of junk leftover particles that need a very big battery so that comes in the fact that screens are larger.A design bug that all those companies shows like it some kind of innovation.The 4" is the perfect size to use a phone with one hand so cut the b***s AAPL has taken a calculated risk with the maps but like Gene Munster said you have at some point take the band from the wound so any time is agood time.it will get better trust AAPL to create a good product and AAPL will create a better product than Goog you can take that ro the bank</Msg><Username>israelmichel</Username><Timestamp>1348387860306</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-23 04:11:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348388056062-57</Id><Topic><Title>ALERT: SAMSUNG IS CALLING THE JUDGE PROCEDURE AND THE JURY DECISION BASED ON QUESTIONABLE EVIDENCE!!

The Swiss Federal Railways (SSB) has accused Apple of stealing the look of its station clocks for the iOS 6 operating system used by iPhone and iPad devices. The designs of both firms have a round clock face with black indicators except for the second hand, which is red. "We are proud that this icon of clock design is being used by a globally successful company. We've approached Apple and told them that the rights for this clock belong to us," the Sydney Morning Herald quoted Reto Kormann, a spokesman for the rail firm, as saying. Kormann said the Apple design was ''identical'' to the one designed by the rail company in 1944, adding that SBB would seek an ''amicable agreement'' with Apple that could see the clock design used in return for a licence fee.</Msg><Username>djmoqp03</Username><Timestamp>1348409497107</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-23 10:11:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348409499279-117</Id><Topic><Title>Maps took ne the Jewish Temple this morning.

It follows after the launch of the new iPhone 5 was proceeded by leaks weeks before it was announced, suggesting that Apple is no longer so interested in keeping upcoming product launches a secret. The latest images of the iPad mini come from a Chinese site, that puts the dimensions of the new slate at around 7.8″ x 4″ (20cm x 13cm approx). The general appearance remains very much in line with the current iPad style, with the caveat of having a “lightning” 9-pin connector, in line with the already announced changes to the iPhone 5 and iPod 5th generation. While the iPad mini has already been suggested as a competitor for the Amazon Kindle Fire and Google Nexus, we think it’s not going to carry a budget tag at all. With the new iPod 32GB priced at £249, and iPad 3 32GB priced at £479, this creates the expectation that any new iPad mini will probably carry price tags in the region of £370 for a 32GB model, and £299 for a 16GB model, if available. This would not compare favorably with the current cut-throat pricing of the Fire and NExus. However, with the launch of the new colour schemes for the new iPhone and iPod releases, it would not be surprising if the October refresh for the iPad also brought these in – with the same applied to the iPad mini. And because the new iPod has a 5MP iSight camera, the expectation would be that the iPad mini will also be carrying a similar iSight camera. This would make the iPad mini very much more feature packed than either the Amazon or Google tablets, perhaps justifying the higher end price. The curiosity remains on how Apple are actually going to market any new iPad mini. After all, is it small iPad or a large iPod? Either way, we should be able to find out more in the first week of October, when Apple are expected to announce a refreshed line for iPad, the iPad mini – and a release date for the new iPod. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------</Msg><Username>lord_chatterly</Username><Timestamp>1348409874198</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-23 10:17:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348409959243-121</Id><Topic><Title>Now, Apple Inc accused of stealing designs</Title><Username>djmoqp03</Username><Timestamp>1348409497107</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-23 10:11:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Was that clock design patented?

However, this was just a detail, one feature where Apple didn't measure up, I thought. Reality, though, surprised even me. Apple basically shipped a feature filled with bugs and utterly lacking quality. Indeed, Apple Maps is so filled with monstrous bugs, lack of quality and lack of detail that it represents a giant step backwards from where iOS 5 stood. And it's this incredible lack of quality which I believe wouldn't have made it past Steve Jobs. Yet, in today's Apple, it reached the market. The Problems Apple's Maps have a large number of problems in several areas, the main being: A huge lack of detail when compared with what Apple shipped with iOS 5 (using Google Maps). This is made even worse when abroad, where the lack of detail borders on the absurd and would sometimes compete mostly with GPS software from 10 or 15 years ago. A half-baked 3D approach which produces ugly artifacts (such as roads and bridges that appear to be buckling) time and time again. Routing which seems inclined to drive customers off a cliff or in roundabout ways towards their destination - that is, if it points to the destination at all. Badly curated satellite images, especially abroad, where one can easily find entire zones whose ground is clouded. In a way, the defects are too many to mention. For those wanting to check on how bad the situation is, I recommend this Tumblr page: "The Amazing iOS6 Maps," which has hundreds of examples of the inaccuracies of Apple's Maps app, including one where the North American continent is labeled "Australia." The point is, the product is quite obviously flawed. It's so flawed that one can't believe Steve Jobs wouldn't have killed it before it reached stores.</Msg><Username>aea_7ms</Username><Timestamp>1348410714413</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-23 10:31:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348411006030-129</Id><Title>Apple Maps is so filled with monstrous bugs, lack of quality and lack of detail that it represents a giant step backwards Paulo Santos</Title><Msg>ggggggggggggggggggggggg</Msg><Username>aea_7ms</Username><Timestamp>1348411006030</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-23 10:36:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348411339207-130</Id><Title>Apple basically shipped a feature filled with bugs and utterly lacking quality.a giant step backwards from where iOS 5 stood Paulo Santos</Title><Msg>gggggggggggg</Msg><Username>djmoqp03</Username><Timestamp>1348411339207</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-23 10:42:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348411423614-131</Id><Title>I am returning this scratched one.

Now we have Map Gate and the same folks who just live to find flaws in every Iphone are at it again,only this time they say if S.J. were alive this would never have happened. Thus the double standard is applied. I think this Map flap will get fixed just like the Antenna did. I also think losing calls and getting no reception was alot more important that this map flap. PEOPLE WILL NOT RETURN THERE PHONES BECAUSE OF THIS. They will expect a fix from Apple and they will get one. STAY FOCUSED MY FELLOW LONGS.

I have two teenage boys involved in homecoming this week. I was around a couple hundred teenagers at five different homecoming events this week. I brought the subject up a few times. Over 90 percent of them said they would buy an i phone 5 right now if their phone plan was up, would switch when it was, or plan to buy one as soon as they could.

People are probably holding off buying so that they can buy the newest version when it comes out, just like they did with the iPhone. P.S. were the people right saying that demand for the Iphone was slowing because people held off buying for a few months when it got close to the release date of that device? The new Iphone is the fastest selling gadget ever, and is selling more than twice the pace of the Iphone 4S.</Msg><Username>miguelsicluna</Username><Timestamp>1348415278329</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-23 11:47:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348415370962-185</Id><Topic><Title>Cannot wait until Monday AM</Title><Username>brian.bovey</Username><Timestamp>1348413911619</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-23 11:25:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Map is cloud based and improves as more people use it. imaps will get better with time.</Msg><Username>chipsarethegame</Username><Timestamp>1348415370962</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-23 11:49:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348415400493-186</Id><Topic><Title>I am returning this scratched one.

Many borrowers will get teaser rates once more, and interest rates on cars and credit cards will drop. Housing will correct one more time as loan modification laws and pressure on banks kicks in and artificial home prices will be at rate that the lower wage job market can afford and investors want the mortgages to be close to rental rates or ,lower. Borrowers will get confident to apply for credit once again because Lenders cannot expect to win suits against borrowers in many states due to statute of limitations. Romney by coincidence, ( or design and did not want to elaborate has a point). He will still lose the election, nevertheless.

By Aabha Rathee | More Articles September 23, 2012 Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) analysts love the iPhone 5. On Friday, Deutsche Bank’s Chris Whitmore raised his price target on Apple stock to $850 on expectations that “the iPhone 5 will fly” because there was a “large, captive audience for upgrades.” Whitmore said his prior estimates for sales of the new smartphone were too conservative and added that he was extremely impressed by Apple’s plans for a rapid international launch. He estimated Apple may have sold 5 million to 6 million iPhone 5 units in the first weekend alone, and raised his estimates for the current year to 138 million from a previous projection of 133 million. For calendar year 2013, he has even higher hopes, expecting unit sales of 180 million. “We believe demand for the iPhone 5 is extremely robust and will prove more durable than the iPhone 4S cycle due to its substantial feature set upgrade,” the analyst wrote in a note to investors. “With a fast geographic ramp … we expect supply to be the gating factor to near-term unit shipments; not demand.” Among factors in favor of the iPhone 5, according to Whitmore, are Apple’s rich application offerings and third-party ecosystem, the idea that Google’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) Android may get more expensive or lose features as a result of litigation, an expanded geographic reach, and meaningful iPhone 4 and iPhone 3GS installed base upgrade potential. He said the iPhone may make up about 20 percent of total annual smartphone sales share, but added that even that estimate could eventually prove conservative because Apple had “ample room for additional share gains going forward.” If supply constraints reportedly being experienced by Apple extend into the December quarter and the holiday shopping season, Whitmore said iPhone 5 sales would be deferred to the first half of next year and give the device a more sustained cycle.</Msg><Username>ingramjohn65</Username><Timestamp>1348421940873</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-23 13:39:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348422106576-257</Id><Topic><Title>may open 25 to 30 points higher tomorrow.

The gold striker iPhone is one of the expensive phones available in the market. The cell phone is encrusted with 227 gm gold and finishing touch is given with gems and diamonds. It is worth the price! The Vertu signature cobra is another phone which is very expensive. It is designed by Boucheron, the famous French designer. It has 2 diamonds and the cobra is designed with 439 rubies. It has a royal look and costs over $310,000. Diamond crypto smartphone is another exam of most expensive phones. It is made up of 50 diamonds out of which 8 are rare blue diamonds. So, you can imagine why it is so expensive. It has a smart look with a platinum body and navigation keys are made up of rose gold. Apple and Motorola also produce jeweled phones Apple has launched another very expensive gadget called iphone princess plus. It costs more than %175,000. In total it contains more than 17 carats diamond and the whole body is made up of 18 carat white gold. 138 diamonds out of 318 are cut in princess shape, which gives it the name. So, it is indeed one of the most expensive. Now, the GoldVish le Million is a cell phone which looks totally different from other cell phone of its category. Designed by Emmanuel Gueit, this holds a Guinness record. Other features of this phone are regular with the only exception of its having a WS1diamonds with 18 carat of white gold. But none of these phones are android phone. Motorola has also joined the competition with its v220. You may ask what is so special about this phone. The v220 is designed with 1,200 diamonds with a body of 18 carat gold. It prices more than $3000. Android comes up with “the chairman” Most of the phones discussed are not android phones. But, android is not far away from them. Ulysse Nardin has designed the most expensive android phone available in the market. It is called the “chairman”. It looks extremely sophisticated. Ulysse Nardin is famous for his world famous watch designs. So, you will see the cell phone’s design is somewhat inspired from a clock. The volume button in the cell phone is designed like a watch knob for adjusting time. Other than that, “the chairman” is made up of 3,000 diamonds and has 18 carat white gold case. It has 3.2 inch touch screen and a camera with 8 megapixels. Technology is always evolving Technology has blessed us with various facilities. This helped us to make dream gadgets like the above discussed below. They are very well designed and can only be afforded by rich humans. But, it is not the end. Day by day we are advancing with the help of science. So, it is expected that in the coming decade you will experience more valuable gadgets which will surprise us even more than this</Msg><Username>faribachicagomed</Username><Timestamp>1348423126413</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-23 13:58:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348423246231-265</Id><Topic><Title>Samsung Galaxy note 2 coming up soon " Phablet" = Phone+ Tablet !!!</Title><Username>one_dogydog</Username><Timestamp>1348412018345</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-23 10:53:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Where will you put your 5.5" note in your pocket? you will need new pants.

Instead, the iPhone 5 competes with them, but doesn't necessarily beat them head to head. And Samsung will likely come up with S4 soon. Consumers want more nowadays. They want a bigger and sharper screen (at least 4.5 inches), zoom video recording, camera with more mega pixels, instant sharing (when phones touch each other), NFC, streaming music / video, live TV, live weather, live stock info, something really exciting!! Did Apple iPhone 5 fall short of the consumer expectations? I am long Apple. iPhone 5 is the best iPhone, no doubt. But, the competition has raised the bar.

Would it continue selling well through next year? Not sure. The reason why it's selling well is owing to pent-up demand from existing iPhone users who are waiting to upgrade, and new users who haven't bought a smartphone yet. The big question is: Would current Samsung S3 or potential Nokia Lumia users switch to the iPhone 5? This is the litmus test. Can Apple take away users from competition? If the answer is may be or no, then Apple didn't do enough in my opinion. I love the new iPhone 5. I just feel that Apple left out something that takes it over the top. Perhaps iPhone 6 will do that. I am not trying to bash Apple nor I am talking about going short.

That would shore up the lagging sales you suggest. Of course they would have to incentives the 5 buyers to move up. But don't forget about Apples roll-out into other markets like China where the iPad is immensely popular. That would ultimately add about $100 to the share price based on modest sales projections. And unless there is war with Japan, that roll-out should occur before the end of the year. Add in a mini-iPad and the sky's the limit.</Msg><Username>myronblender</Username><Timestamp>1348431259869</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-23 16:14:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348431508456-341</Id><Topic><Title>Baffles me that Apple...</Title><Username>pricelinelong</Username><Timestamp>1348423496931</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-23 14:04:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Your clueless ! the next thing you will be telling us is obama is a good president!

Apple store numbers will be huge and the carrier numbers will also be huge but most likely for the holidayQ.

Mini-iPad is coming this fall. China is likely coming this fall. iPhone 6 is not years away, It's a year away, and maybe closer. Plus there's the specter of Apple TV although I think that's a long shot. But most notably is the history. Every AAPL investor is better off than they have ever been before. That won't last forever, but there is certainly room for a massive run further. But next week may be tough. The vertical call spread seems like good idea except if the stock jumps you're immediately screwed. Long or short, you have time to wait it out. I've been long for 4 years and have added to my position at higher entry costs but my average allows me to wait out any shake out. Besides, if I put in stops and stop out, I have a tax problem that I'm not eager to face.</Msg><Username>myronblender</Username><Timestamp>1348432026288</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-23 16:27:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348432106246-348</Id><Topic><Title>Baffles me that Apple...</Title><Username>pricelinelong</Username><Timestamp>1348423496931</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-23 14:04:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Union Square SF store looked like a rush hour and a line of a few hundred outside.

Let’s not call it ahead, let’s just say it’s a fine phone. Where it falls short is that it’s not an I5 which is so well matched to other Apple products. Do I have that right? Basically is that the story in a nut shell. The HTC is slightly larger and has a camera with slightly more mega pixels.

TomTom may be called upon to help and that would probably help since their device is excellent.

Remember the first few versions of Google Map? It was pretty bad. The 3D images are pretty good though and have much better quality and higher resolution. That poster who said you can't even find NYC is a liar. It does find it and if you go to 3D and rotate it clockwise, you can see lower Manhattan skyscrapers and the new Tower under construction and also the previous twin tower memorials that were built in the footprint of the towers.</Msg><Username>plzplzplayfaster</Username><Timestamp>1348437681842</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-23 18:01:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348437702884-403</Id><Topic><Title>Foxconn is opening it's own store..why use Apple's ?

Follow me for a second. I am a big AAPL shareholder (at least to me, anyway)...it is my biggest holding in retirement and kid's education accts. 1. There will be an increase in capital gains taxes because of Obamacare (It's in the bill....something like an additional 3% on CG for healthcare). Some may want to take profits in AAPL before EOY. 2. The Bush tax cuts may not be renewed and CG taxes are going to go up in '13 anyway with an Obama victory...ditto...'12 FY harvesting of LTCG in AAPL. 3. Here's a little one no one talks about. Education Savings Accts (ESA). The Bush era tax cuts allowed the proceeds of an ESA to be used for elementary and secondary "private" school tuition. i.e. parochial schools and preps school tuition could be paid from an ESA. If Obama is re-elected you can be guaranteed that that provision is gone. Yes, ESA's will still be available for college tuition and expenses as they were originally meant to be used, but private school tuition will be kaput. So I expect a lot of ESA holders will sell some proceeds to pay tuition in '12. I don't think it's far fetched to think that AAPL is a common long term holding in an ESA (for the kids, you know). DIS is probably another. ESA's only allowed $2000/yr to be put aside, so these accts. are not particulary big. But I put 2/3 my kid's ESA money in AAPL (the other 1/3 is in GLD). I am going to be selling some of my AAPL in the next few weeks. I have 400% gains...like a lot of AAPL shareholders....nothing very uncommon there. I won't sell it all, but my kid's tuition is due in Nov. and Feb. I'm going to pay the Nov. payment with AAPL proceeds. If Obama wins, I'll pay the Feb payment in Dec. with AAPL shares and get the freebie before the ESA law changes in '13. Families with kids in private elementary and secondary schools want to use that ESA $$$ before they go to college.</Msg><Username>warnbeeb</Username><Timestamp>1348439800994</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-23 18:36:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348439881536-425</Id><Topic><Title>Why does Market.kibble double space after every sentence!?</Title><Username>whettphartts</Username><Timestamp>1348438717446</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-23 18:18:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Really.

But will the iPhone meet expectations of 250 million units sold? The answer is no. Many will be turned off by these issues. And that number is just what is required to MAINTAIN the current bloated stock price. Not to mention the huge loss Apple is taking due to returns due to scratches, dents and other scuff marks on their phones out of the box. In most cases they are replacing them for the customer.

AAPL is a great buy and hold stock for ESAs. Just like DIS. I can't be the only parent who's in this predicament. Use it now or wait until they go to college years down the road to get the ESA tax benefit. Trust me, a lot of parents want to use ESA money for private elementery and secondary tuition. It's also good to have your "assets" be smaller for college financial aid. I actually think if Obama is re-elected AAPL will sell off big. It will probably recover, but it certainly won't go up in Nov.</Msg><Username>warnbeeb</Username><Timestamp>1348447027473</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-23 20:37:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348447048574-534</Id><Topic><Title>iOS 6 sucks</Title><Username>rxfdrums</Username><Timestamp>1348446285285</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-23 20:24:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Contact Apple, we are investors not the help desk.</Msg><Username>jambros3</Username><Timestamp>1348447048574</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-23 20:37:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348447097084-535</Id><Topic><Title>Samsung GS3 Commercial</Title><Username>sl1pp3ry_pete</Username><Timestamp>1348446991873</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-23 20:36:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sums up just how classless and desperate they are.</Msg><Username>hairtriggerdiarrhea</Username><Timestamp>1348447097084</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-23 20:38:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348447166192-536</Id><Topic><Title>apple up $20-$25</Title><Username>admd98</Username><Timestamp>1348440370032</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-23 18:46:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>a lot of potential catalysts. ipad mini china mobile iTV stock split continued revenue and earnings growth I've ordered the iPhone 5 and plan on buying the Macbook Pro Retina 13" and also the iPad Mini.

Googe "Apple Gave Few Phones to Other Retailers". If you haven't figured it out, games like these can easily work in Apple's/Pumping Analysts' favor. The online pre-orders are already booked as sales so Apple just needs to satisfy the foot patrol at their stores. Heck, you have to wait 3-4 weeks if you order now. Apple has a supply constraint issue that will be to their disadvantage as competitors release phones that appeal to customers. Beyond the Apple Head core customer base, the rest is fair game and that's where the money lies for competitors.</Msg><Username>bored_andexperimenting</Username><Timestamp>1348447856408</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-23 20:50:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348447909447-549</Id><Title>((((WhettPharrts Rocks))))))</Title><Msg>Ggggggggggg</Msg><Username>lord_chatterly</Username><Timestamp>1348447909447</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-23 20:51:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348448008245-550</Id><Title>((((Robpic5 Rocks))))</Title><Msg>Gggggggggg</Msg><Username>lord_chatterly</Username><Timestamp>1348448008245</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-23 20:53:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348448017530-551</Id><Topic><Title>GIVE UP THE MAP ISSUE ALREADY!!!! it's a non-issue, nobody cares anymore</Title><Username>snb778</Username><Timestamp>1348420917886</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-23 13:21:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's a complete non-issue.

That's what software version updates are for and they do keep software houses busy, a.k.a. employing people. To keep running DOS because of strong desires to run Wolfenstein v.1 is not a very wise idea these days. New Iphone was designed with many strong features, including weight reduction (which I am sure was a major design constraint and challenge for all, reduction of power consumption for 4G (larger phones, screens, etc. WILL draw more power). Even smooth video conferencing capabilities over the faster networks. Apple has also submitted a patent for new power source to be able to run devices for several weeks! New materials have been utlized also. PROGRESS. Youtube can be downloaded. It was a corporate decision to drop Google services, and thus, their ads, due to royalties. Granted, it had to be done a long time ago, but hey, might as well to have these growing pains at these stages, because smartphones are not going away and will only get better, more functional. Droid phone is only waht, 4 years old? Maybe Apple was waiting for this moment after building-up some pockets to sustain the critics. A major revolutionary design change is not only non-feasible every year, but not possible. And even if it was, everyone else and their brother would copy it and brag about it. What is so revolutionary about other phones, besides bigger screen and tapping to share information between several devices (with some potential leaks of personal stuff you wouldn't want to share?) Oh, filters?

It is still unclear what exactly happened, but posts on China’s popular twitter-like service, Weibo, from users in the area show photographs and video of large numbers of police in and around the factory – many in riot gear – blocking off throngs of people. Other photos show debris strewn around the Foxconn compound and in one case, an overturned guard tower. According to popular tech blog engadget, the disturbance kicked off after Foxconn security guards allegedly hit a worker around 10 p.m. on Sunday. Censors in China have reportedly already started deleting pictures from the scene. This is not the first time that Foxconn has had problems with its Taiyuan facility, which is reportedly responsible for the fabrication of the back plate of the immensely popular new iPhone 5. In March, strikes broke out there after workers did not receive a pay raise they had reportedly been promised.</Msg><Username>sipx36</Username><Timestamp>1348451052660</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-23 21:44:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348451055453-588</Id><Title>I think the iPhone 5 really clarifies the problem with America...it's neat but who really needs it?</Title><Msg>I'm long 3 calls and don't want to upset any of you dudes and dudettes, but take a deep breath and just think about this for a minute.

Dalio said (via BI): I don't know whether we're beyond the point of being able to successfully manage this. And I worry then about – social disruption. I worry about – another leg down in the economies – causing – social disruptions. Because deleveraging – can be very painful, it depends how they're managed. But when people – get at each other's throat, the rich and the poor and the left and the right and so on, and you have a basic breakdown,that becomes very threatening. And for example, Hitler came to power in 1933, which was the depth of the Great Depression because of the social tension between the factions. So I think it very much is dependent on how the people work this through together and worry about the social elements. This is not the only major player I have heard this from. There are others who believe the die is cast and that it will be near impossible to get out of the current environment without major unrest (in the U.S.), and once the unrest hits, it is unclear what will emerge.</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1348453110631</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-23 22:18:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348453205410-614</Id><Topic><Title>I think the iPhone 5 really clarifies the problem with America...it's neat but who really needs it?</Title><Username>weirddrifterguy</Username><Timestamp>1348451055453</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-23 21:44:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nothing fancy.

We also discuss Larry Summers and the revolving door between academia and Wall Street, as well as the key role Democrats have played in deregulating the financial industry. According to Ferguson, a "predatory elite" has "taken over significant portions of economic policy and of the political system, and also, unfortunately, major portions of the economics discipline."

Cohan Jul 1, 2012 3:30 PM PT Lord knows we’ve had more than enough scandals ginned up by Wall Street over the years, and the message that banking executives proclaim after each is: “Don’t worry, we’ve learned that lesson, and it will never happen again.” Which is how we got to the recent spectacle of Jamie Dimon, the chief executive officer of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (JPM), testifying twice before Congress that although the bank’s chief investment office was taking huge proprietary risks with some $350 billion of its depositors' money -- and lost $3 billion (and counting) by making a bunch of risky bets on an obscure, thinly traded derivatives contract -- everything is now fine and dandy because the unjustifiable gambling has been stopped dead in its tracks.
