For how many times we here SHIPPED that is no sales.????????Samsung was tokd they shipped 2M of the Tab yet they not sold even 500K in 2 years of this copy. AAPL market share in the tablet is much more than what IDC tells you.I dont think that AMZN even sold so many Kindle like those ana-ysts kepps saying.I think the real iPad numbers are 80-90% of the tablets market.It's time for Samsung to tell the world how many they realy sell and the picture will be much brighter for AAPL than those anal-ysts presents.</Msg><Username>israelmichel</Username><Timestamp>1344676603905</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 05:16:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344677769633-13</Id><Topic><Title>Paul Ryan as VP....</Title><Username>trycomsen35</Username><Timestamp>1344660495949</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 00:48:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Trycomsen35 is "typical name calling Democrat".

While other Apple derivative plays have been exploited, Sprint is a fresh new play. Key points: 1) Sprint offers the only unlimited data plans 2) Sprint subsidiary Virgin offers a compelling pre-paid iphone option, ie. they will sell a ton of these 3) AT&amp;T and VZ are fast reaching a point of spectrum saturation in some markets - adding more customers means more frustration for existing customers 4) T-Mobile and regional carriers are bleeding customers for lack of the iphone Add this all up, toss in the overall turnaround in progress, and recognize that the word is getting out that Sprint is THE place to have your iphone due to unlimited data - then peer ahead to the upcoming iphone5 release, Sprint may add 4 Million customers or more in Q4. Customer gains like this would move Sprint toward the kind of scale that make VZ and AT&amp;T so profitable. That clearly looks to be where Sprint is headed.</Msg><Username>greekmonster101</Username><Timestamp>1344697246012</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 11:00:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344697248167-41</Id><Topic><Title>how can I pease put martikkkins on ignore?</Title><Username>gatokup</Username><Timestamp>1344697001173</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 10:56:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>just dont read the post if you have the self discipline</Msg><Username>martikkkins</Username><Timestamp>1344697248167</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 11:00:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344697435397-42</Id><Topic><Title>SPX 100% can't hold 1400 today</Title><Username>aea_48</Username><Timestamp>1344526008691</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-09 11:26:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>?????</Msg><Username>davidch14</Username><Timestamp>1344697435397</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 11:03:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344697545503-43</Id><Topic><Title>STOCK MARKET FLIES ON MONDAY AT ANNOUNCEMENT OF NEXT VP.

Four years ago, the day after Obama Biden ticket was nominated, the Dow Jones started its painful drop from about 12000 to about 6,000. If the Romney-Ryan team wins they can reduce the crushing budget. It will be painful for every one who gets money from the government including me who is retired. The question is will the pain be equally distributed or only for certain groups and free ride for certain interest groups. Remember Obama was good for his union supporters. He nationalized, GM and gave it away to union thugs. He preaches saving the jobs of teachers, policemen and firefighters every chance he gets. Half of he 2009 stimulus money went for that cause. Remember all of them are union jobs. How about the rest of the country who are not unionized. .</Msg><Username>michaeljoseph4040</Username><Timestamp>1344697545503</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 11:05:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344697563736-44</Id><Topic><Title>VERY LITTLE PROFIT TAKING OVER 620 ON AAPL...NO CHEAP STOCK AROUND</Title><Username>valueplay_2000</Username><Timestamp>1344452444534</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 15:00:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>bump....</Msg><Username>valueplay_2000</Username><Timestamp>1344697563736</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 11:06:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344697621363-45</Id><Topic><Title>BREAKING : Google said to be paying Samsung's legal bill under IndemnityK- Also the $2 Billion Damages Due Apple????</Title><Username>palisadesestateplanninglawyer</Username><Timestamp>1344616859599</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-10 12:40:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>now all they need is a memo from google stating that google will pay bills for Samsung if patent infringements are upheld this would prove that it was done on purpose at googles request to infringe and get treble damages.</Msg><Username>rlbeard6734</Username><Timestamp>1344697621363</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 11:07:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344697657522-46</Id><Topic><Title>WHAT'S UP, NO ONE WANTS TO SELL--WEEKEND NEWS MAYBE--SAMSUNG LOSS,NEW PRODUCTS</Title><Username>valueplay_2000</Username><Timestamp>1344620997888</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-10 13:49:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>News is Samsung was in negoitiation the buy into AAPL patents</Msg><Username>valueplay_2000</Username><Timestamp>1344697657522</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 11:07:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344697771113-47</Id><Topic><Title>how can I pease put martikkkins on ignore?</Title><Username>gatokup</Username><Timestamp>1344697001173</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 10:56:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>cant read someone who disagrees with you..guess you are insecure about your beliefs</Msg><Username>martikkkins</Username><Timestamp>1344697771113</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 11:09:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344697834320-48</Id><Topic><Title>WHY THE IPHONE 5 WILL NOT LIVE UP TO THE HYPE ARTICLE</Title><Username>tamermou</Username><Timestamp>1344656096856</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-10 23:34:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>and when they announce the agreement with China Moblie because iPhone 5 will have LTE then the 50 million will be a little low. this is absolutely huge and explains part of the $50 run up we have experienced since earnings.</Msg><Username>rlbeard6734</Username><Timestamp>1344697834320</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 11:10:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344697972984-49</Id><Topic><Title>If AAPL wins</Title><Username>chad_podz</Username><Timestamp>1343770263703</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 17:31:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I guess if you work a 40 hr week and I go get your check you are going to be happy.

That would be a mistake. I just pray that Microsoft doesn't cave to pressure from partners to punt on Surface. The first public plea came this week from Acer, which, in effect, begged Microsoft to drop Surface. If that happens, Microsoft will lose the consumer to Apple for good. Probably sooner rather than later. And if Acer is that worried about Surface, then it should out-design Microsoft or look elsewhere. Right now I don't see anything from Acer that would make me chuck my MacBook and iPad. But Surface could. And it gets even more interesting when I see that Redmond is already working on Surface 2. (Of course, if Microsoft isn't able to follow through with a stable, reliable finished product that lives up to the hype, all bets are off. In other words, it needs to be as good as Apple at executing.) But whatever happens, Hewlett-Packard or Dell or Acer would never have conceived of a Windows 8 Pro Surface. It's not in their design DNA and Microsoft knows this better than anyone. So, MS came up with a 10.6-inch, 903-gram device packing a 1,920x1,080 display (that's some pretty serious pixel density), Mini DislayPort (means I can hook it up to my Apple Cinema display), Core i5 processor (let's hope it's a very power-frugal variety), and a 128GB solid-state drive. And of course that 5mm-thick physical keyboard. To counter Surface, PC makers will engage in a lot of Windows 8 puffery about their ultracool convertible or touch-screen ultrabook. I don't know about you, but I need more than that to give Windows 8 equal time on my desktop. OK, so Mac users aren't going anywhere and Windows 8 means diddly-squat (or worse) to them. But that's not Microsoft's objective. It simply needs to staunch the flow of defections to OS X and iOS. Thus the June 15 Windows-8-plus-Surface pre-announcement. A soup-to-nuts hardware and software platform that is unmistakably Apple-like. And proposes to trump Apple and make Tim Cook eat his refrigerator-toaster analogy in the process. The only remotely valid reason for Microsoft to abandon Surface is if it suddenly spurred HP, Asus, Acer, et al to design consumer devices that are cooler than Surface and go head-to-head with Apple. Anyone out there think that's possible?</Msg><Username>lord_chatterly</Username><Timestamp>1344719189490</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 17:06:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344719325965-108</Id><Topic><Title>To fight Apple-flight, Microsoft must hang tough on Surface</Title><Username>lord_chatterly</Username><Timestamp>1344719189490</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 17:06:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Article appears in Cnet dated today. 8-11-12</Msg><Username>lord_chatterly</Username><Timestamp>1344719325965</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 17:08:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344720562580-109</Id><Topic><Title>The ongoing court battle between Samsung and Apple has been nothing short of entertaining, no matter what side you are cheering for all good publicity for Samsung and GIII</Title><Username>aea_dm2</Username><Timestamp>1344707377053</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 13:49:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yes... because self incriminating oneself as a thief, liar and hypocrit in a public forum is something to be proud of. they are a disgrace to the the ethical asian cultures from that region (japanese, taiwanese, etc).</Msg><Username>davidch14</Username><Timestamp>1344720562580</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 17:29:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344720722010-110</Id><Topic><Title>If AAPL wins</Title><Username>chad_podz</Username><Timestamp>1343770263703</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 17:31:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I am sure if your parents had to do it all over again, they would have a pet pug instead of retarded children.</Msg><Username>technectium</Username><Timestamp>1344720722010</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 17:32:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344721123654-111</Id><Topic><Title>MITT ROMNEY &amp; PAUL RYAN--REAL AMERICANS TO TAKE BACK OUR COUNTRY...</Title><Username>valueplay_2000</Username><Timestamp>1344687526795</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 08:18:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I guess we will have the Mormon brotherhood now!</Msg><Username>rockpir</Username><Timestamp>1344721123654</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 17:38:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344721881460-112</Id><Topic><Title>SONW Apple Qts 3 dividend</Title><Username>sonw_75</Username><Timestamp>1344704572897</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 13:02:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Because I'm a Rounder , not a trader ...Nothing personal against Apple (for example here is few my daily trade) Shorted trade against the Box Shorted 1400shs aapl at 583.48 (for myself)...COVERED at 581.30 Shorted 1400shs aapl at 583.45 (for myself)...COVERED at 582.35 Shorted 1400shs aapl at 587.57 (for myself)....COVERED at 583.80 Shorted 1400shs aapl at 573.18(for myself)...COVERED at 571.75 Shorted 1400shs aapl at 582.47 (for myself)....COVERED at 580.46 Shorted 1400shs aapl at 582.47 (for myself)....COVERED at 580.46 Shorted 1400shs aapl at 587.17 pm (for myself)...COVERED at 583.78 Shorted 1400k aapl at 577.68 (for myself)...COVERED ah at 575.80 Shorted 1400shs aapl at 579.40 (for myself)...COVERED at 568.50 Shorted 1400shs at 569.73 (for myself)....COVERED at 566.80 Shorted 1400shs aapl at 564.10 (for myself)...COVERED at 561.43 Shorted 1400k aapl at 571.86 (for myself)...COVERED at 569.30 Shorted 1400shs aapl at 570.58 (for myself)....COVERED at 567.65 Shorted 1400shs at 562.43 pm (for myself)....COVERED at 558.60 Shorted 1400shs aapl at 561 pm(for myself)....COVERED at 554.72 Shorted 1400shs aapl at 576.78 pm (for myself)...COVERED at 574.18 Shorted 1400shs aapl at 576.53 (for myself)...

I think PureInvestor answered this very well. That is too bad for your loss. All you can do now is begin to recover from it. Get some educational help also, to make sure you know what you are doing.

Ryan has an expertise in the budget process and was, by far, the most qualified pick to help Romney execute a plan to return the US of A back to fiscal sanity. Does ANYONE believe Owebama, who was against a Balanced Budget, will stop the Debt-Spending?.....Owebama is a clueless Politician heck-bent on holding onto power....ATTACKING &amp; SAYING ANYTHING to get re-elected. Just look around --EVERYWHERE.... The Owebama European-Style Radical $ocialism has failed miserably: California, Greece, Portugal, Spain and more &amp; more bankrupt cities due to fiscal irresponsibility. And, if Owebama continues driving the US of A "off the rails", then the US of A will end up just like Greece, etc. Do NOT whistle past the graveyard in November. When you get in that voting booth, ask yourself this question: Is Owebama qualified to LEAD, UNITE and get the US of A on a path to FISCAL SANITY? Music to my ears.... Hearing Ryan say today - We are going to get America "back on track". Right now, Capitali$m is off-the-rails with Owebama. And, if you do not see this, then you are part of the problem. This post is not politically-correct. It was meant to Wake Up every American that loves FREEDOM, FREE ENTERPRISE and CAPITALI$M (Defined as Success from Private Sector, Small-Business Effort -- Not Anything Government Related). The US of A did not become an economic superpower because of a bloated, fat government. The Private Sector is the "engine" of growth -- NOT the government. It fumes me to hear Owebama, clueless when it comes to the economy, talk as if the Government is the main creator of jobs. CLUELESS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! VOTE ROMNEY-RYAN IN NOVEMBER -- AND GET THE US OF A "BACK ON TRACK". P.S. - If you have spare time, then VOLUNTEER to help the Romney-Ryan Campaign in YOUR CITY...to help them win...and get the US of A "back on track".</Msg><Username>white_knight_in_texas</Username><Timestamp>1344735049472</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 21:30:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344735197745-138</Id><Topic><Title>After All that BalleyHoo over the Divvy ...</Title><Username>lord_chatterly</Username><Timestamp>1344734048695</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 21:14:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Reinvesting the Dividends to buy more AAPL.

When Obama was elected I heard that he was going to send troops to Wall Street and take over all finance in this country. I’ve heard he is a Muslim when he has been in Christian churches all his adult life. I’ve heard he is not American when he has a birth certificate and there are newspaper stories of his birth in Hawaii. I’ve heard he is a terrorist when he has systematically gotten rid of many terrorist leaders. I’ve heard he did not deserve the grades received in Harvard even though the Harvard Law Review, generally considered the most prestigious in the country, elected him to that job, which is considered the highest student position at Harvard Law School. I’ve heard he is a tax and spend President when taxes are the lowest in 30 years. I’ve listened to his speeches and then listened to the Conservative Republican spin and sat with my mouth opened after hearing the distortions and exaggerations. I’ve seen Republican ads that have edited Obama speeches in ways that make it look like Obama is saying what he is not saying. Now I’m told he will get rid of religion and he will bend religious institutions to his liberal views. I’m told he is a Communist because of Obama care and that Americans want Obama care repealed when polls show 50% of Americans want it, and that number is growing as the plan is unfolding and people realize how important it is. My God will it ever stop! I’ve heard he has no good economic plan; well, there you got me because, he has proposed many plans that the Republicans have blocked. So how can I tell you any of them would have worked, except they come from one of the best minds in America. What do the Republicans offer, lower taxes and greatly reduced regulations, increase in military spending, removal of family planning, poorer contraception rights, restriction on gays, and poorer schools with fewer and fewer teachers. Some of these things are the very things that got us in trouble in the first place. And to get what the Conservative Republicans want all we have to do is gut SSI, Medicare, and Medicaid. Look, it depends on how you see America. Are we the rich country that takes care of people, old, young and sick or are we so individualistic that we won’t help anyone, living a kind of dog eat dog existence? Many Conservative Republicans say we can’t afford to be so altruistic, and, they have a point, but, we can work together and try to do our best to have the best society possible. Putting our elderly on ice floats letting our poor sick die, letting our school children down and letting families with sick aging parents go broke with medical expenses is not my America, but maybe it’s yours.</Msg><Username>magicseeker101</Username><Timestamp>1344737434510</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 22:10:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344737491689-157</Id><Topic><Title>If apple making Samsung too mad they may delay few parts for iphone 5 'till after Christmas,So they can flood more G III, and killing Appl market share and stock to $400 as the same time</Title><Username>aea_dm2</Username><Timestamp>1344737102068</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 22:05:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>that's scare</Msg><Username>bihooder</Username><Timestamp>1344737491689</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 22:11:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344737797079-158</Id><Topic><Title>Paul Ryan: Obama's Policies Creating Nation of 'Dependency'</Title><Username>texexec60</Username><Timestamp>1342110536946</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-12 12:28:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Funny, Mr Ryan voted for Congress to keep their Healthcare plan.

I guarantee you once the GOP is done, our deficit will be worse, but that's OK. The great GOP will be in the whiteqhouse.</Msg><Username>jambros3</Username><Timestamp>1344737797079</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 22:16:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344738267910-159</Id><Topic><Title>If apple making Samsung too mad they may delay few parts for iphone 5 'till after Christmas,So they can flood more G III, and killing Appl market share and stock to $400 as the same time</Title><Username>aea_dm2</Username><Timestamp>1344737102068</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 22:05:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Are you married yet, Johnny?

However, you're full of crap. Obama begins every speech with "I inheirited the greatest financial crisis since the the Great Depression." So what does OBama make his first priority? The economy? No. Healthcare so we can add a few more trillion to the deficit. He is a good campaigner but a weak President.The American people did not give Obama a mandate to spend tax payer money like he has a blank check. Two words that Republicans and Independents all understand: Fiscal Responsibility. Obama really should begin every speech with "If I'm re-elected I promise to turn the US of A into another Greece or Spain."</Msg><Username>gatordogz</Username><Timestamp>1344740648125</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 23:04:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344740690457-168</Id><Topic><Title>If apple making Samsung mad they may delay few parts for iphone 5 'till after Christmas, they can sell more GIII, and Appl stock can down to $400 easy</Title><Username>aea_dm2</Username><Timestamp>1344736412882</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 21:53:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>thank you</Msg><Username>aea_dm2</Username><Timestamp>1344740690457</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 23:04:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344740788357-169</Id><Topic><Title>I dunno</Title><Username>inclusive_or_exclusive</Username><Timestamp>1344738957149</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 22:35:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This the secret message thread ?
