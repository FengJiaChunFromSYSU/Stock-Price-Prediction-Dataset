But everyone thinks their own stocks are cheap. Maybe not. You think AAPL cheap. I think HPQ cheap. I think AMZN expensive, but some say if you are patient 20 years. I think FB expensive, but they say invest for the long run. They say gold is cheap, but it is up 250% for the past 10 years. Here is my take. It is all about perception. Monster Gene said 240M iphones. well it didn't happen. So down AAPL goes. Selling pressure continues. They say the world is ending. But it is not. No risk. If there is no risk. Banks are cheap. Housing is rising. People will chase house available. Suddenly, you feel good again. Yes. people are buying houses again. Market is ahead of itself. It has been and always..

The last week in January into Feb 1 is bullish on technicals (look at the Stock Trader's Almanac). Also, you only have 1 dow30 stock in your portfolio (CAT). DJIA is up 4.45% so far this year. S&amp;P 500 is up 3.45%, NASDAQ is 2.15%. Your portfolio is, tbh, atrocious. You can get away with 8-9 stocks, but they should be different sectors. How did you pick these stocks?

The Dow is an aggregate of blue chips. You mentioned only one Dow component. You mentioned several tech stocks, too and they're volatile. The "death of the PC" has decimated some areas of tech. Plus, there's the AAPL drop. You also mentioned several Basic Materials/Industrials. Not doing well. Also, read the financials on some of these companies. Some have visible problems.

Then just integrate AAPL software into Sony's Smart Tv's and the new Playstation, thereby integrating the whole user expirience with a TV, Game Console, iPad, iPod and iPhone. This move would move the value of AAPL to new all time highs and destroy samsung/MSFT in the TV/Game console markets. Plus as a bonus,, Sony is holding 4th place for smartphone sales right now (because they produce really good lower end smartphones), slapping an AAPL logo on their lower end smartphones would kill Samsung/Nokia's smartphone markets. This move is a no-brainer for AAPL.</Msg><Username>frtgrdn21</Username><Timestamp>1359809155778</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 07:45:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359809328048-41</Id><Title>WOW!!

Larger iphone should have been released in Q1 at the latest, probably sooner.</Msg><Username>cookindabooks9</Username><Timestamp>1359817125852</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 09:58:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359817190520-109</Id><Topic><Title>Apple needs a 4.9 inch screen iPhone</Title><Username>cookindabooks9</Username><Timestamp>1359815176949</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 09:26:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>what is the incentive to upgrade to Apple..are they going to price lower than s3 .

They also mentioned that this is the first time the Cupertino-based company earned the lead spot for mobile shipments. Neil Mawston, executive director for Strategic Analytics reported, “Apple’s success has been driven by its popular ecosystem of iPhones and App Store, generous carrier subsidies, and extensive marketing around the new iPhone 5 model.” The fact that Apple Inc.

The slew of bad news would create a temporary fall long enough for the manager to resolve his short position and conclude a tidy profit. Cramer refused to talk about some of his techniques, saying he was “not going to say it on TV.” Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne, said the CNBC reporters used this technique to spread lies and rumors about his company, combined with a slew of bad / false financial reports and analysis around the Internet and otherwise. Many analysts are suggesting that much of the CNBC enterprise and Jim Cramer’s specifically success came from a strong understanding of how to control the system — control the news, you control the stock. “We had it down to a science in 1992: my wife would pick stocks that technically looked ready to go up, or she would keep track of merchandise to see what was down to tag ends. She would then generate a list of stocks that could move quickly on good news. Jeff would then go to work calling the companies to try to find anything good we could say about them [...] we would load up with call options and common stock and then give the good news to our favorite analysts who liked the stock so they could go do their promotion. That would get the buzz going and we would then be able to liquidate the position into the buzz for a handsome profit,” said Cramer in his 2002 book Confessions of a Street Addict</Msg><Username>one_dogydog</Username><Timestamp>1359820017841</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 10:46:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359820086415-140</Id><Title>2/1/13 was options expiration Friday so MM/ hedge funds couldn't buy a lot.... so were they waiting to BUY BUY on 2/4/13 ?</Title><Msg>2/1/13 was options expiration Friday so MM/ hedge funds couldn't buy a lot.... so were they waiting to BUY BUY on 2/4/13 ?

If you suggested Samsung's margins were going to be clobbered by giving away their plastic galaxy series, I'd agree. fpor starters, they are going to lose the entire AAPL feed franchise to others and likely soon be paying AAPL a royalty fee per device. Also, check out the TMobile story with Samsung phones. If they offer a no cost G2 or G3, the store dusts off the boxes and sells some. But if they charge for it? EVERYONE would rather have an iPhone. Quick now: Audi A8 or Nissan Maxima? Ask people who have an iPhone if they like it and they'll tell you "I love my iphone" and the entire app book, calendar, music, videos, photos and links to their mac/macbook, itunes, cloud, and other devices as well as ease of use and no need to program explains why. Margins were guided to 36% last quarter, by far the biggest launch and many hindrances on the margin. They reported 38.7% despite getting up the learning/yield curves only late in the quarter on the i5 and having global product availability issues all quarter. Even worse was the Mini -- the cheapest model AND all of the other 5 Models of it. This quarter they guided top of range at 38% --if history and their propensity to be circumspect and careful/conservative on guidance is a guidepost, they will likely be closer to 40% or better depending on product mix.</Msg><Username>jlbhgb</Username><Timestamp>1359823347954</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 11:42:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359823441489-174</Id><Topic><Title>Apple in Cars</Title><Username>larthecableguy</Username><Timestamp>1359819737512</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 10:42:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Siri would be apologizing every minute that the car does not have Apple maps.

Analysts are all afraid and don't matter anyway... the buyside matters and is taking up the tossaway shares down here as seen in the low level of short interest. You stay on the short bus though -- all the geniuses posting bs here are with you. As for street estimates? Poised to be trounced now... maybe you and most of the street don;t get it yet, but they are now guiding to what is committed shipping levels -- topping orders are not in the guide, nor is material yield, cost curve benefits they may derive in the run for the quarter.

The rich get richer and the poor get to bail out the rich when their bets go bad. Expect the WallStreet banks to short America again soon. Only this time lets not make the same mistake and bail them out.

Equal opportunity, free public education, and to quote Obama: "life liberty and the pursuit of happiness" ( he should have added at the expense of the rich.) It certainty was implied in his inaugural address. Delayed gratification, good health, and hard work separates those that have drive ambition and goals from those that take more then they have sacrificed. Seems we are in a period of generational dysfunctional families. The greedy seem unwilling to even consider raising the age limit for social security knowing that those within 10 years would be exempt from the increased age qualification. Union members continue to resist "right to work" states and demand more while being exempt from Obama care. People on food stamps now have a credit card to purchase supplies. The shame in accepting help while not helpful oneself is denied these slackers. I believe in helping those truly in need but I haven't heard one of the 99%ers claim we need 'regulation" when it comes to prolonged unemployment benefits and increased numbers of people on food stamps (plastic). Finally immigration reform. The 99%ers are too proud to take the jobs that the illegals will take. They are also too stupid to accept the fact that with reform comes cost. I celebrate the new citizens of the USA that have gone through our system. I can't celebrate anyone who's first act within our borders is violating the law.</Msg><Username>appleraptor</Username><Timestamp>1359827322918</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 12:48:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359827386576-204</Id><Topic><Title>Long Call Buyers are every bit as culpable for Apple's decline as the JEWmm's are.</Title><Username>lorde_chatterly</Username><Timestamp>1359799674736</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 05:07:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>As greedy, bloated, ignorant and repulsive as the real thing.</Msg><Username>coffeebook1</Username><Timestamp>1359827386576</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 12:49:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359827585124-205</Id><Topic><Title>No doubt Apple is worth $600 - $700/share right now; When will start moving to $600s again?</Title><Username>davidba1960</Username><Timestamp>1359820695804</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 10:58:15 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Those who post in all capital letters are the most ignorant people on the board.</Msg><Username>allanj_97</Username><Timestamp>1359827585124</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 12:53:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359827610720-206</Id><Topic><Title>Hey, let's send Israel another 21 billion so the dogs can continue to steal blindly from Wall Street and Medicaid.</Title><Username>sybil10000</Username><Timestamp>1358202604418</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-14 17:30:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Another Holicaust?</Msg><Username>coffeebook1</Username><Timestamp>1359827610720</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 12:53:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359828021563-207</Id><Topic><Title>Apple in Cars</Title><Username>larthecableguy</Username><Timestamp>1359819737512</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 10:42:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Siri integration was announced by a couple of car makers.

That Amazon despite selling its Kindle Fire at GIVE-AWAY PRICES (at cost), could barely grow revenues 22% vs. prior year. But Apple selling superior goods at 50% to 100% higher prices, made 38% profit margin and grew sales 27% year-over-year (after adjust for last year Apple's Accounting had a 14 week quarter, and this year a 13 week quarter). AMAZON has nothing "proprietary" and about NO no innovation, its only a marketer and sales channel with a website, that other stores (perhaps Macys, Sears, Best Buy, Home Depot) can get together and offer a Consortium to set up a competing on-line retailer. To achieve 22% sales growth, Amazon had to cut its prices so much, that its profits (which were not much to begin with) plunged 45%. Apple on other hand beat aggressive profits forecasts and earned its biggest profit ever. Plus Apple has more Innvoation coming -- vs. Amazon has never had any innovation (unless you call neg. cash-flow most of its years to try and buy sales innovation).</Msg><Username>aiwal1</Username><Timestamp>1359832620386</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 14:17:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359832802812-239</Id><Topic><Title>Stop picking on AAPL</Title><Username>sameas55</Username><Timestamp>1359830961227</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 13:49:21 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why are you blaming it on Jews?

With the enormous increase in the taxation of dividends, high net worth investors may be tempted to abandon dividend-paying stocks entirely. This is not necessary. Corporations will reduce their dividend payments. And wealthy investors can use strategies to alleviate some of the effect of these tax increases. Here is the tax problem and its solution. Stocks that pay significant dividends are a subset of value stocks. Some companies pay earnings to shareholders in the form of dividends. Other companies retain their earnings in an effort to put that capital to work expanding the company’s value. Apart from differences in taxation, these two options should be equivalent to the shareholder. Imagine buying shares in a company whose stock is trading at $10 a share with earnings of $1 per share. The company has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 10. If the company paid all its earnings in dividends, it would take you 10 years to get paid back in earnings. After a decade you would have both your money back and also still own the stock. And if you used your dividend to purchase additional shares, you would own 2.594 times as many shares thanks to compounding dividends. Now imagine that same company decides to retain its earnings and use them to grow the company’s physical locations by reinvesting the 10% each year. In that same decade the stock price would rise to $25.94. Whether a company chooses to pay a dividend or retain earnings doesn’t make a difference economically. My conclusion, Apple should increase its spending on RD and work on the next OMG device and at the same time double repurchase program.</Msg><Username>appleraptor</Username><Timestamp>1359834629371</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 14:50:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359834640570-255</Id><Title>If 435 was NOT the bottom ? why did it shoot back up from 435 ?

In the past Apple board has really not been able to swerve direction of the company, especially with Jobs since he pretty much had the board in his pocket and no one dared go against him and why would you, look what he accomplished. Now with Cook, a change in personality and him being more of a regular CEO "hire" perhaps the board might push for more market or investor friendly decisions and votes. That was one of the key factors in the dividend announcement last year. So going forward we could be looking at decisions ranging from a stock split (unlikely as they seem to think it doesn't do squat for a company and they may be right), a higher dividend (higher chance, but then again the outside world doesnt really know what the company has been up to. A recent article author discovered a rather large expense by Apple in its recent earnings report that left many people scratching their heads. Was that a new investment of some sort in a chip manufacturer etc we don't know. So knowing what's coming up in R&amp;D the board might not vote for a higher dividend payout. Other than that I dont see them firing Cook, or doing anything like that, aside from stock price slump, he has been solid so far. He has come through the China Labor issue, the maps issue and handled them well. Will we see something more from Johny Ive. Possible. So although there is perception that the board meeting might result in some news, I doubt it. But the stock may still pop in the next few weeks in anticipation. If stock splits then we see a pop and then sag for years unless a major new revolutionary product is introduced. If dividend maybe new investors come in but price move up from just that will not be huge but will support stock.</Msg><Username>tangos88888</Username><Timestamp>1359835079726</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 14:57:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359835131101-261</Id><Topic><Title>Stop picking on AAPL</Title><Username>sameas55</Username><Timestamp>1359830961227</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 13:49:21 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I know it seems like suddenly basic rules of investing have reversed.

Just look at the free cash flow they are generating. This can't be stopped unless they completely change their business model. Apple simply makes the lion's share of profits in mobile by far. Forget market share. Now going forward how can they keep a stock that will have half its market value in cash at this low level. It's impossible. Apple would have to begin a series of qtrs where their business falls off a cliff for the market to ignore them or send them lower. Just look at the people who buy their products and ask yourself what percent are going to switch brands. The answer has been very few. These folks buy several apple products and down load tons of apps and are fully engaged in the apple ecosystem. Apple has plenty of enhancements in the pipeline including fingerprint recognition and Iwallet transaction capability. All it costs is 200 to upgrade to the newest model. Apple will soon have half a billion in the IOS system and billions more when you include China mobile and the prospect of a cheaper form factor phone for the masses. This stock will be 600 in a year or less based simply on what we know. Now if they produce another disruptor ie an ITV who knows where this can go.</Msg><Username>ditzil</Username><Timestamp>1359837063332</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 15:31:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359837173370-286</Id><Title>No Real Innovation Korean or Japanese Electronics Manufacturers</Title><Msg>Think of all the Major Electronics Innovations / Breakthroughs of the past 100 years... even of the past 40 years, whether in Audio or Electronic Components or Computers.

When distribution takes place it usually over-shoots by about 20% "by rule of thumb" before retesting a new bottom. AAPL came in from 510 down to 435 before bouncing to the 460 area and is now back in distribution mode. This sell of has nothing to do with fundamentals and everything to do with Accumulation vs. Distribution. In order for AAPL to recover to any great extent, you will need to see a large number of Institutions that will step to the plate to not only absorb the current selling/Distribution, but be able to but their way through that. And with no real catalyst on the Horizon, the stock will more than likely see new lows before moving back to the 500 mark. The problem is that everyone and their brothers always held AAPL to the highest of standards in terms of innovation and growth, and with growth projections now being collared by Corp. and no new game changers on the immediate horizon it looks more and more like dead money. The Street also views all of the cash on hand as a negative not positive. Don't believe that, then look at AMZN and you'll understand why. AMZN spends and re-invests every dime they can every chance they get and the stock continues to power through new highs. The Street cares about growth and innovation, not money on a foreign bank account. I would write calls against any long position you might have to help lower your exposure until they can turn this around. Unfortunately it takes a really strong tide to turn a vessel of this magnitude. Best of luck.</Msg><Username>hitdabid1972</Username><Timestamp>1359838222860</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 15:50:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359838232459-298</Id><Title>Are analysts stupid or lazy ?

As my regular readers know, Apple, like many retail firms affected by weekend sales, defines its fiscal quarters not as three months, but as 13-week periods.

Apple's share of the U.S. mobile phone market, including feature phones and smartphones, jumped to 34 percent from 26 percent, while Samsung's share grew to 32.3 percent from 31.8 percent, the research firm said. Samsung had been the top mobile phone vendor in the US since 2008, the firm said. Indeed, for the full year, Samsung still held the crown for mobile phone sales; it had a 31.8 percent share of the U.S. market in 2012, against Apple's 26.2 percent. Apple investors have recently been anxious about the future growth prospects for the company amid intense competition from Samsung's cheaper phones, powered by Google's Android software, and signs the premium smartphone market may be close to saturation in developed markets. Overall, mobile phone shipments rose 4 percent to 52 million units in the U.S. during the fourth quarter of 2012, driven by strong demand for 4G smartphones and 3G feature phones. But in all of 2012, U.S. mobile phone shipments fell 11 percent to 166.9 million, Strategy Analytics said. Apple sold 17.7 million iPhones in the U.S. in the fourth quarter, up 38 percent from the previous year, driven by aggressive marketing of its new iPhone 5 and steep carrier subsidies, the firm said. Samsung shipped 16.8 million phones during the same period. In the international arena, Samsung Electronics, with a range of handsets, has overtaken Apple as the world's top smartphone seller.

Amazon's 22% revenue growth and 455 profits plunge last quarter was bought by it pricing things where it can't make pos. cashflow. Now I see you meant Apple earned $5 billion greater cashflow this last quarter , and $21 Billion Cash Flow added to its already over $100 BILLION Cash pile, than the $16 billion the prior same quarter the other year. Yes. Apple is expected to have $180 billion or more cash on its balance sheet by end of 2013.

RCA and Zenith were innovative and leaders in their fields. The problem is the "mercantilist economics" Japanese in the late 1960s and 1970s kept their Yen artificially too low, so they could undercut RCA and Zenith making home electronics and TVs. RCA invented Color TV and the VideoDisc (pre-cursor to CDs and DVDs). Japan kept its YEN too low vs. $, what China is doing now, that is hurting Japan. But this does not hurt APPLE... as APPLE MAKES ALL ITS PRODUCTS IN CHINA... YES IN $1 AN HOUR CHINA, WITH NO PENSION COSTS TO PAY BILLIONS SOME DAY FOR 1 MILLION APPLE WORKERS IN CHINA...

They're gone. They've all sold. There were massive, massive margin calls that ended last Thursday, and then there were still people and institutions that had decided that they were going to get out no matter what by this past Friday as a result of the implosion the week before. So that's likely why there was still pressure Friday. As bad as the one-day collapse was, it created a vacuum for everybody to get out that wanted a final excuse to get out in a very short period of time, and that's what they did. Now, there will be no more motivated sellers. They are gone, whiped out. That's what sets you up for the Island Reversal Tom DeMark was talking about Friday for this coming Monday. Carter Worth has also indicated that this stock is set up for an "epic bounce", based upon it's bounce off of the $435 mark with massive volume. Even with all the selling pressure last week, the stock still finished up 3.0% on the week.

This stock is switching from a value stock from growth. They trade at lower PE's much less volatility. For it to become a growth you will need the following: 1.3 straight quarters of smashing guidance..oh wait non was given so beat wall st estimates is MUST! You will need to see double digit growth each of those quarters. 2. A NEW INNOVATITIVE ITEM(S)! Apple has put out a product every two or so years from the iPod to the reinvention the apple combuters to the iPod Touch to the iPhone to the iPAD to Apple tv box. It desperately needs to release something. TV, Camera, a new PC out of this world I mean something! Upgrades to the same #$%$ will not work for a growth stock unless..3. THEY GET CHINA MOBILE! Now, lets discuss the problem with it being a value stock. ITS NOT AN ATTRACTIVE VALUE STOCK AT THESE PRICES or at leas that is the sentiment. The following things need to happen: 1. Need to see positive sentimennt 2. THEY NEED(BOARD) TO SHOW THE SHAREHOLDERS THEY CARE ABOUT THEM AND ISSUE A BUY BACK OR DIVY OR SPLIT THAT WILL MAKE THESE SAFE FUNDS TO BUY HEAVILY INTO the stock. Of course there is so much more than this but I truly believe these are just a few basics that can give you an idea. Most transistions from growth to value take a while. If you want growth look at stocks like DDD or Goog or if you want shorts then go to NFLX. AAPL will probably drop to low 400's and rise to 500.</Msg><Username>brandnerjoshua</Username><Timestamp>1359861553481</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 22:19:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359861620121-469</Id><Topic><Title>Anyone else worried a new iPhone is not going to help AAPL stock since the iPhone 5 came out and the stock dropped?</Title><Username>readyforwhat100</Username><Timestamp>1359855514079</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 20:38:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Are you really that stupid?

Believe it or not, there are some educated investors here and if someone is just asking an honest question then I say its ok. I do agree that spend time where it counts and that they are stealing from the retail. For that reason I am pulling out after one last big gamble. After losing 30K on AAPL ( I day traded and played puts to make up half but then lost another 15K on it but I will probably make another 5K on it with my options hedge and then when the stock comes up, that will even help the loss more. I am going BIG and I mean BIG ON NFLX SHORT AND PUT OPTIONS! I am already in a little bit with abotu 10 contracts and 100 shares short averaged in at 168. That stock is the most overbought thing I have seen in a long time. With that said, MS just raised a price target to 200 and at the same time were the one who handled the issue of 500M in notes..hmmm so I could very well lose out because of pure manipulation. I been day trading for almost a decade and manipulation is at its worst. Whether you are a techie or fundamentalist and ALL signs point the smart educated trade, it somehow still does the opposite. I really think something needs to be done about this. I almost wonder if there is a conspiracy to wipeout the retail investor. Did you see how many retail investors pulled out over the past two years? THe MM's manipulate stocks so that we will then use them to invest our money at a ridiculous rate since we are no longer successful.</Msg><Username>brandnerjoshua</Username><Timestamp>1359862170607</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 22:29:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359862175648-476</Id><Title>I was so lucky to sell AAPL and buy GOOG we win at GOOG MAPS</Title><Msg>AAPL is a junk now.</Msg><Username>lekinsh01</Username><Timestamp>1359862175648</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 22:29:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359862392229-477</Id><Topic><Title>Readforwhat100 please grow a set.</Title><Username>gaingreen800</Username><Timestamp>1359861681918</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 22:21:21 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good luck Brandon, seems like a good play.

However, my point us that every iPhone sale is a good sale for Apple in order to expand the network base. This will allow Apple to deliver content, mobile payment, etc and get people locked into their eco-system. This is really what MSFT did with DOS/Windows in the '80's to lock people into WinTel for life. I forget the exact YoY iPhone unit increase, it was substantial, but that number is actually slightly more important than the exact 4S/5 breakdown - it's the total number of iOS devices out there that counts - the size of the audience they reach and capture. Apple gets that, which is why they came out with the Mini and there is talk of a less-expensive (I hate the word cheap) iPhone for the not-as affluent segments....</Msg><Username>kokohead1</Username><Timestamp>1359863643927</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 22:54:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359863752634-490</Id><Topic><Title>bought calls Feb 08 strike 470</Title><Username>elrrambu</Username><Timestamp>1359842862188</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 17:07:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Not this week.

There was a seminar about how to use the Ipad. There were at least 40 people there, all following along with their Ipads. There was a Samsung rep there with a big display of tablets, it was completely empty. I know this is one story and one snapshot in time but the theory that the days of Apple are over a way off. I' have had my Ipad for 3 months (just added keyboard which really helps) and I can tell you it blows away the Galaxy tab I had. In all fairness my galaxy was purchased 2 years ago so i'm sure the newer generation is better. I think the very worst case for Apple is it becomes a value stock which pays a decent dividend. However, if you believe there is any possibility of innovation (there are 80k employees and probably 5k engineers? They work evryday on R&amp;D and nothing new is going to come out. Like many others I am in the hole but the odds are way in the favor of holding here and even picking up more shares on dips.</Msg><Username>oldslur</Username><Timestamp>1359867401108</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 23:56:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message></Date>
