The market could sell off 15-25% at any moment. You're also gonna deal with the release of the new Fire and the inevitable selling after the iPhone 5 is revealed. After 2.5 years, adding half an inch to the screen size isn't gonna cut it and the market will react accordingly. Aapl could easily drop 10% from the 12th to the 14th. If the market sells off you could be lose 25% in short order.

Apple sold 35mil iphones in q2 of this year, 88% yoy growth. To even grow 30% yoy, they'll need to sell 46mil in q2 2013, and 60 mil in 2014, and 80 mil in 2015, and 105 mil in 2016. Does any sane individual think aapl will sell over 100mil a quarter a few years out. Maybe if the Chinese poor are willing to pay a year's salary for a phone! Even at 10% growth you're looking at having to sell 60mil iphones a quarter a couple years out. It's called the law of large numbers and it'll be the main reason aapl will have a PE of 6 or 7 in a couple years. What happens when the new iphone looks the same as the 4 and 4s? You'll see 10-15% growth and aapl will fall $200 very quickly. The money to be made is long gone. Sell and don't look back.</Msg><Username>rimmbberry</Username><Timestamp>1346654604090</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 02:43:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346656554272-25</Id><Topic><Title>Justin: Sharp has admitted they have not started mass producing iPhone display screens for Apple</Title><Username>aea_35</Username><Timestamp>1346629351959</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 19:42:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>no iphone 5 before the holidays.

What this is truly about is 100 years of primary democrat party failed control for which their chickens indeed have come home to roost and they spent all our money (SS/Medicare, income taxes etc..) on welfare to lock in democrat votes moving forward. 1913 dem Wilson Federal Reserve Bank CREATURE that has debt leveraged our currency to zero intrinsic value, 1933 dem FDR failed SS Ponzi that was only to cost $.03 per pay, 1964 dem LBJ failed Medicare Ponzi now completely broke necessitating socialized medicine with the death panels to preclude costly care for the boomers now retiring in mass and being told all the money taken from them was squandered on welfare, and now Obama under dem Pelosi Congress more debt increase than all prior Presidents combined in less than 3.6 years. Get ready now for the Charlotte Show:constant bemoaning Obama inherited blah blah blah, Bush, Bush, Bush and remember Reagan never once mentioned that IDIOT JAMMY CARTER after taking the helm from the now 2nd worst economy EVER now superseded by the Obamadungdus economy. So come on dems and realize your IMAGE ONLY voting in 2008 landed us here with a community organizer as POTUS that has been completely ran shod over by the leftist wing of the dem party and the Pelosi Congress giving us now MORE DEBT THAN ALL PRIOR PRESIDENTS COMBINED. So get off you Hollywood vision spectrum and see the past 100 years clearly to know dems have put us here not Bush. The Bush's are indeed too much like big spending dems for me and always have been but that does not even come close to the past 100 years of dem damage. Just listen to the FACTS of the day. What systems and programs are discussed DAILY as our biggest problems: SS/Medicare, welfare, healthcare etc.etc and of course the BIG DADDY DEBT LEVERAGING MACHINE FOR WHICH DEMS NEEDED TO CREATE ALL THIS DEBT THE FED RESERVE CREATURE BANK all signed into law by dems. As for the wars dems will also bemoan remember small minded dems the Afganistan War ramping up daily belongs to Obamadungdufus and HE SAID last week we must gear up for a long fight implying what those of us in the know KNOW that being the Miltary Command makes such decisions and a smart POTUS will listen. As for the Iraq War Bush, unlike Obama, got Congressional approval with most dems signing on including Hilary Billary and John Kerry who was against it before he was for it. So get ready for the Charlotte Rhetoric Show with Obamadungdufus on Thursday in GM car salesman fashion stating TRUST ME!!!

It is very probable aapl is due for a swift 100 point pullback at this point as this last 100 point rally has been based on no fundamental justification.

ROMNEY DRANK COOL-AID REALLY???</Title><Msg>Better re-think who's truly drank/drinking the Koolaid dems. As we head into what appears to be the 'Bush-Charlotte Dem Show' with most spin thus far being what a bad mess they inherited blah blah blah. Keep in mind Reagan did not ONCE MENTION JAMMY CARTER after taking the helm 1980 from what has been up to now under Obamadungdufus the worst USA economy since the 1929 Great Depression. Obamadungdufus has now siezed that great claim WORST EVER!!! But just watch how much Bush is either directed or indirectly implied all this week from the Charlotte Show with Obamadungdufus wrapping it up Thursday telling us we can't turn back now to those failed policies. HA! Anyone with more than 2 brain cells realizes ALL of the FAILED systems and entitllemtns being scrutinized today as our most horrific problems were SIGNED INTO LAW BY DEMS OVER THE LAST 100 YEARS OF PRIMARY DEM PARTY CONTROL. To be so blind as to not be able to scrutinize these blantantly glaring FACTS is a sure sign of IMAGE ONLY VOTING AND INDEED SUCH TYPE VOTING HAS LANDED US HERE WITH THE SMOODGE OPERATOR COMMUNITY ORGANIZER CHILD PRODIGY WHOM WAS RAN SHOD OVER BY THE LEFTIST WING OF THE DEM PARTY. This seems to be the mantra for the upcoming Charlotte dem Show 'I've failed big time in my first 4 years but just give me another chance and see what 2016 will look like.' NO THANKS, I've seen enough! Now we've got BOY CLINTON out spinning for his portion of the dem Charlotte Show bemoaning we must help the middle class reminding folks that he did and look what happened under his term. HA! He fails to mention that what truly happened was the 1994 Republican class lead by the Newt Congress that took BOY kicking and screaming daily to the woodshed for a lesson in true economic reforem. Thank goodness BOY is a true politician and realized I can coattail this baby and get credit. I will hand him that but Obamadungdufus is a Saul Alinsky radical at heart and will ram the Dreams of His commie Daddy from Kenya furher down our throats. Add to this the FACT that dems will continue spinning the war on women with Sandra Fluck assetting she needs to FLUCK a lot and needs FREE RUBBERS FOR ALL and FREE BABY KILLLING REGARDLESS IF PARTIAL BIRTH OR WHAT and all OFF THE TAXPAYERS BACKS. Add to this the blatant hypocrisy of BOY CLINTON out front a man accused of RAPE and IMPEACHED FOR A HUMMER!! Man if you cannot see through this charade you is DUMB BOY(S) and GIRLIES!!!! As the Roberts ruling continues to be analyzed I believe his words say it all: 1. It is a tax just as we all surmised from the beginning and 2; most importantly the court cannot protect the citizens from the consequences of an election. So you see, just as I and many said, Obama has indeed changed the country forever in a very bad way. We indeed will now have the UK failed system of socialized medicine, to replace our very outstanding previously profit driven capitalistic form of medicine that being the very factor that made it so great. What this is truly about is 100 years of primary democrat party failed control for which their chickens indeed have come home to roost and they spent all our money (SS/Medicare, income taxes etc..) on welfare to lock in democrat votes moving forward. 1913 dem Wilson Federal Reserve Bank CREATURE that has debt leveraged our currency to zero intrinsic value, 1933 dem FDR failed SS Ponzi that was only to cost $.03 per pay, 1964 dem LBJ failed Medicare Ponzi now completely broke necessitating socialized medicine with the death panels to preclude costly care for the boomers now retiring in mass and being told all the money taken from them was squandered on welfare, and now Obama under dem Pelosi Congress more debt increase than all prior Presidents combined in less than 3.6 years. Yes Justice Roberts is correct that the court cannot be responsible for the consequences of an election, indeed Obama Care is a huge cost and most importantly this decision will cost many more jobs and the USA as once known is now finished. Hopefully Romney can stand on the 10th Amendment which is correct asserting that healthcare in MA was a states issue and this Federal mandate is not but repealing it now will be tough and impossible without Repubs taking House, Senate and POTUS. Without Harry Reid gone nothing will ever be accomplished. . 0users liked this posts0users disliked this posts Reply ..

Furthermore, today's Democrat Party has been HIJACKED by Radicals -- and it is NOT the Democrat Party of the past. Today's Democrat Party looks more like the leadership of a 3rd World Radical $ocialist Dictator -- trying to buy votes via REDISTRIBUTION which is a stark contrast to the Founding Fathers of America who favored FREE WILL -- FREEDOM of the Individual Man vs. Government-Engineered Economic/$ocial Policies.

Bob Pi$ani wrote a blog piece -- which refuted it very well - by just stating the case for GROWTH AHEAD. The Law of Large Numbers does NOT apply to APPLE for the reasons clearly laid out below. See below......... Why Apple Isn't Finished Yet I have been listening to debates on our air about Apple all morning, particularly about the fact that it is now has the largest market cap ever. The debate has been: is Apple [AAPL 665.24 1.372 (+0.21%) ] worth it? Can it keep up the innovation? On the surface, the stock is having a tough day — a rare downgrade has caused a reversal, and the stock has given up almost all of its gains from yesterday on very heavy volume. I rarely editorialize on individual stocks, but since I have been a rabid Apple user for a decade I do have a strong opinion, and the answer is, yes, they can keep going. First, one argument against AAPL is its sheer size. Very few companies have ever had market caps over $500 billion, let alone $600 billion: Exxon Mobil [XOM 87.30 0.10 (+0.11%) ], General Electric [GE 20.71 0.07 (+0.34%) ], Intel [INTC 24.83 0.56 (+2.31%) ], Microsoft [MSFT 30.82 0.50 (+1.65%) ] and Cisco [CSCO 19.08 0.18 (+0.95%) ]. The argument is that these companies (with the exception of XOM) eventually fell dramatically, why shouldn't it happen to AAPL? There are several reasons: 1) Apple is not overpriced. Apple is trading at about 11 times forward earnings, at a time when the S&amp;P 500 is trading at almost 14 times forward earnings. According to Topeka Capital Markets, the three tech companies (INTC, MSFT and CSCO) were trading at an average P/E of over 80 times earnings when they passed the $500 billion level. 2) Apple has plenty of room to increase its share of the products it sells. Here's the stats: Apple share of the market for: PCs 4.7% Mobile phones 6.4% Source: IDC/Topeka Capital Yes, it has 68 percent of the tablet market, but it invented that category and it is now facing stiff competition. Compare that to the share of the market that the other $500 billion market cap tech companies had at their height: Microsoft share of PC operating systems 90% Intel share of PC processor market 80% Cisco share of networking market 70% Get it? These other guys already had thoroughly penetrated their markets when they hit those big market caps. They had nowhere to go but down. That is not the case with AAPL. 3) Apple continuously reinvents its products and is growing into new categories. The iPhone 5 is the gift that keeps on giving; millions of Apple users like myself will reflexively go out and buy it. They are working on an iPad "mini." And they may be on the verge of cracking the TV conundrum. They have tried for years to get a foothold in TV, and have fallen short. But word that they are now working on a set-top box that can deliver a cable feed, rather than a full-scale TV, may be just the right approach. Forget the hardware, create software that is linked to iTunes. The problem: it's not clear they can get buy-in from cable companies. But just wait until the numbers get worse, and cable companies realize they are losing subscribers faster than they thought. This would integrate the iPad, the iPhone and Macs with iTunes...and cable TV content. Watching anything you want on your iPhone?

Why Apple Isn't Finished Yet I have been listening to debates on our air about Apple all morning, particularly about the fact that it is now has the largest market cap ever. The debate has been: is Apple [AAPL 665.24 1.372 (+0.21%) ] worth it? Can it keep up the innovation? On the surface, the stock is having a tough day — a rare downgrade has caused a reversal, and the stock has given up almost all of its gains from yesterday on very heavy volume. I rarely editorialize on individual stocks, but since I have been a rabid Apple user for a decade I do have a strong opinion, and the answer is, yes, they can keep going. First, one argument against AAPL is its sheer size. Very few companies have ever had market caps over $500 billion, let alone $600 billion: Exxon Mobil [XOM 87.30 0.10 (+0.11%) ], General Electric [GE 20.71 0.07 (+0.34%) ], Intel [INTC 24.83 0.56 (+2.31%) ], Microsoft [MSFT 30.82 0.50 (+1.65%) ] and Cisco [CSCO 19.08 0.18 (+0.95%) ]. The argument is that these companies (with the exception of XOM) eventually fell dramatically, why shouldn't it happen to AAPL? There are several reasons: 1) Apple is not overpriced. Apple is trading at about 11 times forward earnings, at a time when the S&amp;P 500 is trading at almost 14 times forward earnings. According to Topeka Capital Markets, the three tech companies (INTC, MSFT and CSCO) were trading at an average P/E of over 80 times earnings when they passed the $500 billion level. 2) Apple has plenty of room to increase its share of the products it sells. Here's the stats: Apple share of the market for: PCs 4.7% Mobile phones 6.4% Source: IDC/Topeka Capital Yes, it has 68 percent of the tablet market, but it invented that category and it is now facing stiff competition. Compare that to the share of the market that the other $500 billion market cap tech companies had at their height: Microsoft share of PC operating systems 90% Intel share of PC processor market 80% Cisco share of networking market 70% Get it? These other guys already had thoroughly penetrated their markets when they hit those big market caps. They had nowhere to go but down. That is not the case with AAPL. 3) Apple continuously reinvents its products and is growing into new categories. The iPhone 5 is the gift that keeps on giving; millions of Apple users like myself will reflexively go out and buy it. They are working on an iPad "mini." And they may be on the verge of cracking the TV conundrum. They have tried for years to get a foothold in TV, and have fallen short. But word that they are now working on a set-top box that can deliver a cable feed, rather than a full-scale TV, may be just the right approach. Forget the hardware, create software that is linked to iTunes. The problem: it's not clear they can get buy-in from cable companies. But just wait until the numbers get worse, and cable companies realize they are losing subscribers faster than they thought. This would integrate the iPad, the iPhone and Macs with iTunes...and cable TV content. Watching anything you want on your iPhone?

Samsung isn’t the only company considering the patents; Apple and Google along with a number of other potential buyers are also in the race, according to sources that preferred to remain anonymous due to the private nature of the talks. IDCC recently sold 1700 patents to Intel (INTC) for $375 million in cash. As of the end of 6/30/12 Qtr, IDCC had current assets of $622 million with liabilities excluding long term charges of approximately $200 million, leaving a net cash position of $422 million on a relatively clean balance sheet. Adding the $375 million from the sale to Intel, IDCC's cash before taxes would total $797 million, which is more than half of its current market cap of $1.4 billion. Considering just the cash and the 17,800 patents remaining in IDCC's portfolio, strategic purchasers such as Samsung or Google should view IDCC as a bargain at its current low price. It has been forecast that sales of smartphones are going to double by 2015, according to Gartner Inc. Lee Seung Woo, an analyst based in Seoul, said that there are a lot of important patents which belong to the InterDigital portfolio and as the fight between Samsung and Apple heats up, Samsung can’t afford Apple to get the assets. Thus for reducing the risk on itself, Samsung will have to go ahead and bid, even if it costs them a huge premium. Wake up guys.... The deal should be announced in the coming days... !!</Msg><Username>patentsaddicted</Username><Timestamp>1346687179828</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 11:46:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346687425436-108</Id><Topic><Title>Apple be Surrounded and Zoom in by the EOY, 2013</Title><Username>aea_35</Username><Timestamp>1346597563659</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 10:52:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>why don't you sell your lock box then? what is with all this garbage posting. are you trying to help or confuse? actions not mere words carry weight. sell your lock box and put your money where your mouth is. cut the crap. grow up. aea 35...more like 3 or 5..your age that is.</Msg><Username>faribachicagomed</Username><Timestamp>1346687425436</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 11:50:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346687682632-109</Id><Topic><Title>CLINT EASTWOOD DRANK A SIX PACK OF BUB BEFORE SPOKE .

So be greedy or be smart, it's up to you. Smart is scaling back your investment to a level you are comfortable with.

The new claim was filed in San Jose, California on Friday and it says that Samsung, which last month was fined $1.05 billion by an American court for "willfully" infringing Apple's patents, is still using its rival's technology. "Despite that lawsuit, Samsung has continued to flood the market with copycat products," Apple said, adding four of Samsung's most recent releases -- including the flagship Galaxy S III smartphone -- to an earlier complaint filed in February. "Apple will suffer and is suffering irreparable harm" because of the alleged infringement, said the maker of the iPhone and iPad. The new US claim is the latest chapter in a long-running global patent war between the smartphone giants, which have accused each other of stealing intellectual property for their own products. Apple won $1.05 billion on August 24, when a California jury found the South Korean electronics giant infringed dozens of patents held by Apple. However a Japanese court on Friday rejected the US tech giant's claim that Samsung stole its technology. Apple had sought damages and sought to block sales of some Samsung products in Japan (EUREX: FMJP.EX - news) , where both firms have seen their popularity rise in a market traditionally dominated by domestic powerhouses such as Sharp and Sony (Stuttgart: 853687 - news) .</Msg><Username>election00</Username><Timestamp>1346690562677</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 12:42:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346691080979-141</Id><Topic><Title>THE ONLY TIME AAPL SOLD OFF IS AFTER 4S, NOT THE OTHER PHONES, EXPECT 726 IN SEPT</Title><Username>tamermou</Username><Timestamp>1346689486621</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 12:24:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Go check out the charts.

Im not so sure Jobs would have handled this Samsung fight the way Cook is, it's appears to have a pretty negative response so far to me. Not only does Apple want more Samsung models banned, but the fine be placed at over $3 billion from the $1billion award from the court. I used to like Apple, not I can't stand them anymore. I will never buy anything from them, ever. This is a repeat of a bad movie, it's just like Intel wanting to control the chip market and basically tried to put AMD out of business AND got caught doing so. How much is enough for these companies???? How much more does Apple need? They reek of greed and it just puts a bad tasted in your mouth knowing that these guys want you to buy ONLY what they make and leave the scraps to the little guys.

Apple even licensed some of their tech to MSFT. Apple is leaving RIM alone. Apple is leaving Amazon alone, even though it is Android based. What do these competitors have in common? They didn't clone the iPhone in every detail. Samsung wasn't really giving you more CHOICE anyway. Just copy the iPhone as best they could and slap a bigger screen and faster chip inside, battery life notwithstanding. Is that innovation? Is that choice? There are plenty of smartphones out there that aren't iPhone clones. If you want something very different from iPhone, get one of those. If you want an iPhone, get an iPhone not a clone.

Stem cells bring back feeling for paralysed patients 14:38 03 September 2012 by Andy Coghlan For similar stories, visit the Stem Cells Topic Guide For the first time, people with broken spines have recovered feeling in previously paralysed areas after receiving injections of neural stem cells. Three people with paralysis received injections of 20 million neural stem cells directly into the injured region of their spinal cord. The cells, acquired from donated fetal brain tissue, were injected between four and eight months after the injuries happened. The patients also received a temporary course of immunosuppressive drugs to limit rejection of the cells. None of the three felt any sensation below their nipples before the treatment. Six months after therapy, two of them had sensations of touch and heat between their chest and belly button. The third patient has not seen any change. "The fact we've seen responses to light touch, heat and electrical impulses so far down in two of the patients is very unexpected," says Stephen Huhn of StemCells, the company in Newark, California, developing and testing the treatment. "They're really close to normal in those areas now in their sensitivity," he adds. "We are very intrigued to see that patients have gained considerable sensory function," says Armin Curt of Balgrist University Hospital in Zurich, Switzerland, where the patients were treated, and principal investigator in the trial. The data are preliminary, but "these sensory changes suggest that the cells may be positively impacting recovery", says Curt, who presented the results today in London at the annual meeting of the International Spinal Cord Society. Persistent gains The patients are the first three of 12 who will eventually receive the therapy. The remaining recipients will have less extensive paralysis. "The sensory gains, first detected at three months post-transplant, have now persisted and evolved at six months after transplantation," says Huhn. "We clearly need to collect much more data to demonstrate efficacy, but our results so far provide a strong rationale to persevere with the clinical development of our stem cells for spinal injury," he says. "We need to keep monitoring these patients to see if feeling continues to affect lower segments of their bodies," says Huhn. "These are results after only six months, and we will follow these patients for many years." Huhn says that the company has "compelling data" from animal studies that the donated cells can repair nerves within broken spines (Neurological Research, DOI: 10.1179/016164106X115116). There could be several reasons why the stem cells improve sensitivity, says Huhn. They might help to restore myelin insulation to damaged nerves, improving the communication of signals to and from the brain. Or they could be enhancing the function of existing nerves, replacing them entirely or reducing the inflammation that hampers repair.</Msg><Username>soupnazi100</Username><Timestamp>1346707647695</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 17:27:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346707715836-207</Id><Topic><Title>AVOID Apple products...</Title><Username>ruckpral</Username><Timestamp>1346706081582</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 17:01:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Think about blue jeans ... they all kind of look alike ... but if you put a large W on the back pocket then Wrangler will come after you.

Samsung got what it had coming to them. I'm sure Steve would be right proud of Tim for where he's brought the company since his passing. It's nearly doubled in value since Steve passed away. Just because Samsung and others don't have the innovative prowess of Apple doesn't mean they are entitled to just rip off Apple. They are granted patents for a reason.

APPLE spent Five (5) YEARS researching and developing the iPhone -- and Samsung comes along and WILLFULLY INFRINGES (Blatant Copying - or, better said - CLONING it) --- and you say -- it is just okay ??? Think for a second.... --- If YOU were to spend sweat, effort and YOUR hard-earned money and hard work developing a product, and THEN get just RIPPED OFF overnight. How the heck would you feel ??? Would you tell yourself -- that the thief needed to steal from me -- because it helps their consumption or something ??? ..... Of course not, you would want JUSTICE just like APPLE. APPLE pumps a LOT of money back into Research &amp; Development -- and APPLE has a PROVEN track record of developing and bringing-to-market products that are incredible -- which literally have disrupted entire industries -- and changed the world for the better !!!!!!!!!! APPLE is one well-run, well-managed company. Most inventors applauded the Court Decision which gave APPLE the long-awaited JUSTICE they deserved. On the subject of inventing things, I had a few sentences on the topic a while back which you may learn to appreciate. See below.... What causes an Innovative Society? Easy Answer: History has already given us the answer - and that answer is FREEDOM. For 5,000 years, this world we live in...was in the Horse &amp; Buggy Era, like the old Middle Ages. Some countries haven't changed in the Middle East...even now. People in many countries have (or had) despot dictators on their backs, or monarchs stealing from them, or communal-type living that left people stagnate with little motivation but the status quo. THEN, the founders of the United States wrote a constitution that UNLEASHED FREEDOM, IMAGINATION, INVENTIVENESS -- and, in ONLY 236 years, the world was pulled out of the Horse &amp; Buggy Era, which had trapped the human race for 5,000 years. There are so many very important US inventions: Telephone, Electricity, the Light Bulb, the Combine for Harvesting, Computers, etc...that came from American inventors. If a society has a despot dictator, monarch or central government that does not RESPECT and ADHERE to the RULE OF LAW, then --- what motivation is there to INVENT and PATENT anything? Your hard work would be simply stolen. I wish to recommend a book called The 5,000 Year Leap. Ronald Reagan recommended that it be taught in all public High Schools. FREEDOM is not a Left, Right or Centrist Idea... FREEDOM is desired by every human being in the world. And, given the FREEDOM to CREATE and INVENT...along with an environment in which there are laws that will PROTECT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, a society will flourish -- just as it has done in the USA. Amazing inventions by American inventors have changed the world. Is FREEDOM increasing or decreasing in the USA? During the past 4 years, much government regulation has interfered with the Private Sector's ability to conduct FREE enterprise. Some regulation is needed, but... too much will stifle the FREE environment that has enabled the USA to thrive. In the book referenced above, it is recommended that the Burden of Debt be AVOIDED. Over-spending by the US Government is the wrong direction. A small, limited government made the USA an economic superpower; BUT....a large, bloated government saddled with debt could drag us down the path of Greece. Whether we like it not, economics and politics DO INTERSECT. INVEST in AAPL for the LONG-TERM !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</Msg><Username>white_knight_in_texas</Username><Timestamp>1346717378369</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 20:09:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346717505202-277</Id><Topic><Title>Four year from now our President will be known as Romney the Great for...</Title><Username>obadidos1</Username><Timestamp>1346716467378</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 19:54:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Bump</Msg><Username>obamasuxcockwithnegrolips</Username><Timestamp>1346717505202</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 20:11:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346717600348-278</Id><Title>Prediction: What is the stock market going to do this week?

The companies are battling over the smartphone market, estimated by Bloomberg Industries to be worth $219 billion last year, with patent lawsuits on four continents. “German patent judges do take notice of rulings from the U.K. or the Netherlands,” said Peter-Michael Weisse, an intellectual-property attorney at the Wildanger law firm in Germany, where there are at least three hearings and one ruling in Apple-Samsung patent cases this month. “The farther away you get from Europe, the less influence foreign rulings have.” Since the verdict was handed down by a San Jose, California, jury, which normally doesn’t have to specify how it reached its conclusions, there isn’t much judges from other nations can rely on as precedent, lawyers from Europe and Australia say.</Msg><Username>sexybitchcrafty</Username><Timestamp>1346721609140</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 21:20:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346721982038-311</Id><Topic><Title>Most Asian Stocks Fall</Title><Username>sexybitchcrafty</Username><Timestamp>1346720118094</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 20:55:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hmmmmm....

And, Judge Koh will very likely announce a TRIPLE (3x) DAMAGE AWARD – which will raise the total award up to $3 BILLION !!!!!!!

In the not too distant future --- ALL of the phones using Android Software (Blatant Copies of the APPLE Mobile iOS Software) will likely be removed from the market !!!

Note how they keep saying that MITT ROMNEY does NOT have a plan -- yet ROMNEY keeps referring to his Simple 5-Point Plan - repeatedly !!!!!!!!!!! The truth is -- They FEAR the business accumen of this powerful plan. And - if the OWE-bama Admin. continues their FAILED POLICIES of DEBT-SPENDING for Infrastructure --or-- just whatever GOVERNMENT PROGRAM, ----- THEN ---- they run into a $16 TRILLION DEBT WALL. Radical $ocialism is a FAILED ECONOMIC MODEL worldwide.....and people are not stupid. People have seen how Greece failed...and Portugal, Spain &amp; Italy have all gotten up to their necks in DEBT. To continue OWE-bama's policies of HIGH TAXES ON BUSINESS OWNERS, DEBT-SPENDING PAST $16 TRILLION (Very Dangerous) and OVER-REGULATION OF BUSINESSES (Literally killing an entire industry - the American Coal Industry). NOW -- Look at the ROMNEY PLAN (Simple, Smart and it will usher-in an American Growth Cycle similar to that of Ronald Reagan's Plan).... See below.... Mitt Romney’s Plan for a Stronger Middle Class A Plan For More Jobs And More Take-Home Pay Energy Independence • Increase access to domestic energy resources • Streamline permitting for exploration and development • Eliminate regulations destroying the coal industry • Approve the Keystone XL pipeline The Skills To Succeed • Give every family access to a great school and quality teachers • Provide access to affordable and effective higher education options • Focus job training programs on building valuable skills that align with opportunities • Attract and retain the best and the brightest from around the world Trade That Works For America • Curtail the unfair trade practices of countries like China • Open new markets for American goods and services • Build stronger economic ties in Latin America • Create a Reagan Economic Zone to strengthen free enterprise around the world Cut The Deficit • Immediately reduce non-security discretionary spending by five percent • Cap federal spending below twenty percent of the economy • Give states responsibility for programs that they can implement more effectively • Consolidate agencies and align compensation of federal workers with their private-sector counterparts Champion Small Business • Reduce taxes on job creation through individual and corporate tax reform • Stop the increases in regulation that are tangling job creators in red tape • Protect workers and businesses from strong-arm labor union tactics • Replace Obamacare with real health care reform that controls cost and improves care</Msg><Username>white_knight_in_texas</Username><Timestamp>1346723769334</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 21:56:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346724213173-339</Id><Topic><Title>What's the ECB going to do?

Samsung also said its audit into working conditions at an HEG Electronics facility in Huizhou in southern China found no under-aged workers. New York-based China Labor Watch said last month seven children younger than 16 were working in the factory that makes phones and DVD players for Samsung.

(Source: Bloomberg) A Tokyo judge ruled Aug. 31 that Samsung smartphones and a tablet computer didn’t infringe an Apple invention for synchronizing music and video data with servers. Apple won the verdict in the U.S. on Aug. 24, with a jury finding that its Suwon, South Korea-based rival infringed six patents for mobile devices. While the rulings dealt with different patents, courts outside the U.S. tend to discount jury verdicts because they lack legal reasoning typically included in judges’ rulings, lawyers said. The companies are battling over the smartphone market, estimated by Bloomberg Industries to be worth $219 billion last year, with patent lawsuits on four continents. “German patent judges do take notice of rulings from the U.K. or the Netherlands,” said Peter-Michael Weisse, an intellectual-property attorney at the Wildanger law firm in Germany, where there are at least three hearings and one ruling in Apple-Samsung patent cases this month. “The farther away you get from Europe, the less influence foreign rulings have.” Since the verdict was handed down by a San Jose, California, jury, which normally doesn’t have to specify how it reached its conclusions, there isn’t much judges from other nations can rely on as precedent, lawyers from Europe and Australia say. ‘Without Reasons’ The U.S. jury verdict was a “decision without reasons” and isn’t “particularly persuasive,” said John Swinson, an intellectual property lawyer at King &amp; Wood Mallesons in Brisbane, Australia. “Legally, it has almost no consequence.” Alan Hely, a spokesman for Cupertino, California-based Apple, referred to the company’s Aug. 24 statement in which it said it was “grateful to the jury for their service.” Samsung also referred to its Aug. 24 statement where the company said the U.S. verdict wasn’t the “final word” in courts and tribunals around the world. Samsung fell 1.2 percent to 1,218,000 won in Seoul trading yesterday as Apple sought a ban on U.S. sales of new Galaxy smartphones. Courts around the globe have issued divergent rulings on similar intellectual property disputes between the companies. While the San Jose jury found that Samsung’s Galaxy Tablet 10.1 doesn’t violate a design patent Apple filed for its iPad, a German court last year issued a ban over an equivalent right Apple registered in the EU.</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1346729912763</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 23:38:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346729983890-398</Id><Topic><Title>WOW !!!! --- SEVEN CHILDREN UNDER AGE 16 WERE FOUND WORKING AT SAMSUNG FACTORY !!!!!</Title><Username>white_knight_in_texas</Username><Timestamp>1346724525558</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 22:08:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Lord_Chatterly, Poor kids being taken advantage now (WOW).... What is next for this crazy outfit ??? Is Samsung going to continue lying about sales numbers? Will Samsung continue to INFRINGE on APPLE's patents? In my view, I think Samsung is immoral and unethical from the Top Management to the Lower level Management. Furthermore, their Attorneys seemed to be very "lowlife" types even....as they refused to follow Judge Koh's orders. I would not INVEST a Thin Dime into a company like Samsung. I have an old saying -- "KNOW THEM -- BY THEIR DEEDS &amp; ACTIONS." Wow -- Look at what this company is doing --- and how it conducts itself. Pathetic!!!!!!!!!!!!!! INVEST in AAPL for the LONG-TERM !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</Msg><Username>white_knight_in_texas</Username><Timestamp>1346729983890</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 23:39:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346730000947-399</Id><Topic><Title>OT - But probably worth a look.</Title><Username>soupnazi100</Username><Timestamp>1346707647695</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 17:27:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Indeed!</Msg><Username>stem_cur</Username><Timestamp>1346730000947</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 23:40:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346730044945-400</Id><Title>warning sell apple warning sell apple urgent</Title><Msg>The run is over you can post this on your foreheads so you don't forget it when apple hits 400 early next year, don't come crying cause I will have no mercy for you .
