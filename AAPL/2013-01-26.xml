Dummie ole me, got out with 70% and went into 3 year TBs. So, when they matured in September, guess what I bought? Yep, AAPL. I watched it drop almost every day, but CNBC said it was going to $1000, so I decided to ride it out. BAD IDEA. Fortunately, my wife's IRA is in safer than safe, 30 year TBs. Unfortunately, she left with the kids in November after a big fight over money. I have nothing left now, AAPL and Marie got it all. I'm a laid off broker, and-no pun intended-BROKE. After my unemployment ran out 4 years I started looking. Anybody out there need a broker with 12 years experience in derrivatives? One time I had over $14 million to play with-my own money-and was responsible for 14% of all the profit my firm made in 2005. Hey, this is not a resume, or, maybe it is, I don't know. I know one thing for sure, when you lose as much as I have, Johnny Walker Red is a good ole friend. After 1/2 a bottle, IT DON"T MATTER! BOL to y'all still holding.

January 24, 2013 SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR APPLICATION-INTEGRATED INFORMATION CARD SELECTION Abstract A selector daemon can run in the background of a computer. Applications that are capable of processing information cards directly, without requiring the use of a card selector, can request the selector daemon to list information cards that satisfy security policy. Upon receiving such a request, selector daemon can determine the information cards available on the computer that satisfy the security policy, and can identify these information cards to the requesting application. The applications can then use the identified information cards in any manner desired, without having to use a card selector: for example, by requesting a security token based on one of the information cards directly from an identity provider.

January 24, 2013 AUTOMATED DETERMINATION OF APPLICABILITY AND VALUE OF DISCOUNTS FOR A PURCHASE ORDER Abstract A method for automatically determining applicability and value of any discounts for a purchase order from a client computer, the determinations being made by the client computer itself. In some embodiments, the client computer receives (from a server to which the order is being placed) coupon programming, determines applicability and value of discounts using the coupon programming, and sends discount information for an order to the server. The coupon programming may comprise a rule engine, implemented by rule programming, having one or more sets of rules and a processing relationship between the sets of rules and the rules in each set of rules. The rule engine may comprise a recursive rule program. In some embodiments, the applicability and value of any discounts for an order is determined by a server that receives the order, the determinations being made by using a rule engine implemented by rule programming.

For now, I think it's prudent to stay on the sidelines and watch for a better entry point and a change in trends and investor sentiment.</Msg><Username>soccerdad6264</Username><Timestamp>1359177654655</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 00:20:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359177685026-34</Id><Topic><Title>Did a crazy option trade late in the day and oddly enough it might payoff on Monday (or not!)</Title><Username>croesus_intervention</Username><Timestamp>1359164079477</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 20:34:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Oh Boy!

And now we know. That apology from Apple indicates more than a minor screw up or a #$%$ in the armor for the near trillion dollar company, it’s representative of the huge paradigm shift that has taken place at Apple. It is now painfully obvious that Apple CEO Tim Cook is not Steve Jobs. The press release disguised as an apology tells us all we need to know: "At Apple, we strive to make world-class products that deliver the best experience possible to our customers. With the launch of our new Maps last week, we fell short on this commitment.…we wanted to provide our customers with even better Maps including features such as turn-by-turn directions, voice integration, Flyover and vector-based maps. In order to do this, we had to create a new version of Maps from the ground up". Translation: "We tried to reinvent something without the help of our visionary leader and failed miserably. It’s back to the drawing board while the product that we hyped as our greatest invention fails miserably.You can now unlock the original practically for free via ebay". It’s now apparent that without Steve Jobs at the helm, mistakes are okay for Apple, as long as they are followed by an immediate and somewhat genuine apology. How many apologies did Steve Jobs ever offer? How many times did he ever release a product that was blatantly inferior to its predecessor?</Msg><Username>fartyfartmaster</Username><Timestamp>1359178182741</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 00:29:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359178183573-60</Id><Title>Apple at almost 2 times next years cash snd people are telling u to sell that is blatant criminality</Title><Msg>Would you sell IBM coke jnj pg msft at 2-3 times cash????

This is ridiculous. They must be basing it on what the CFO said on the conference call. Either way, this would be the first quarter in a long time when Apple earnings are projected lower year over year. Sure the P/E looks really low and hence the automatic thinking is to buy the stock. However, if projected earnings are declining rapidly, the stock will get dragged lower until Apple will blow the earnings again and show growth. Do your own DD.

Apple will lose half it's market share or more before they realize tens of millions of people want a bigger phone. Read the WSJ article about Apple losing its cool. In it a customer says the iphone just looks tiny compared to the Galaxy. So true. Phones, more now than ever are used for everything but phone calls. Sure, millions want a smaller phone, but millions more want a bigger phone. Here is a quote from the earnings call: Tim Cook - CEO: Bill, its Tim. The iPhone 5 offers as you know a new 4-inch Retina display which is the most advanced display in the industry, and no one comes close to matching the level of quality as the Retina display. It also provides a larger screen size for iPhone customers without sacrificing the one-headed ease-of-use that our customers love. So, we put a lot of thinking into screen size and believe we picked the right one. Is Tim Cook serious? No one comes close?? Lol When the 5s is released make sure you're short, as i foresee a 15-20% drop when they stick with the 4 inch screen. Further, i don't think they'll release a larger iphone until late 2014 after sales have dropped over 50%. The same thing happen to Rimm. They thought no one wanted a touch screen. When they realized they were wrong, it was far too late. They were finished. Apple, to a certain extent is going down the same road. Short any and all rallies for the foreseeable future. Short with impunity.</Msg><Username>rimmbberry</Username><Timestamp>1359181057468</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 01:17:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359181105917-104</Id><Topic><Title>I'm long 300 shares and i'm buying more im the Mon. morning !</Title><Username>A Yahoo!

They are up over 50% in 2 days. I would at least stay away until the gap fills at around $420. Basic stock charting 101 says that when a stock gaps up big later down the road the gap fills. In January of last year there was a big gap up from $420 to about $450, leaving a hole/gap in the chart. Other than that there really isn't any indicator for a bottom on AAPL. Every indicator on the chart looks very bearish. And it's way below every moving average you could possibly use as a support line. So it's either round numbers as a bottom ($400, $350, etc.) or the gap at $420. To be safe I would not try to guess the bottom. I would wait until the bottom actually occurs and the chart starts to turn back around. And then buy on the way up. The 50 day moving average is at $532 (it is dropping fast though because the new calculations [today's closing price, yesterdays, tomorrow's] are bringing the average down. Long story short wait maybe wait until a clear breakout above the 50 day moving average. (You see what happened when AAPL fell below the 50 day moving average in October? That was a screaming sell indication and the price was $650 when this occurred.)</Msg><Username>nathan28dx8</Username><Timestamp>1359182748231</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 01:45:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359182811239-137</Id><Title>Here's a thought .....</Title><Msg>AAPL LOST 260 billion in market cap and has 130 billion in cash.

They have $ 137 Billion in Cash, cash equivalents and short and long term marketable securities. Basically, they have $137 Billion that is liquid. There are other notable figures that came out. 1. Inventories doubled from a year ago. This could be a good or bad thing depending on what that inventory actually consists of, but the fact that they have a 2-3 week delivery for the IMac it isn’t the one product that is declining in sales. 2. They gave back $4.5 billion in dividends and stock repurchases last quarter. They still have authorization to repurchase another $7.5 Billion over the next three years. I am not sure about the fine points of the authorization, but if they repurchase $7.5 Billion shares over the next few quarters and give a dividend of $2.5ish a quarter they will give back roughly $20 Billion to shareholders in FY13. 3. They increased their R&amp;D by 33% to over a $1 Billion from Q1 '12. I am priced in at a decent price, but the fire sale still hurts. If you’re priced in over $600 I am sorry, but it may be better to cut your losses.

Within this report it gives you a breakdown of Apple's $137.1B in cash &amp; cash equivalents. Also, if you listen to the conference call, Oppenheimer states how much cash they have. Apple's cash increased $16B this qtr from $121B to $137.1B. Also, for the clueless, Apple has accrued $15B for tax repatriation on the $96B held oversees. You can also verify this in the 10Q report as deferred tax liabilities. There is so much misinformation on this board. Apple is hated right now. I don't know why, but I don't care, I am going to hold for years. If the price drops to $400, I am going to go all in.

Think about the revenue increase for next quarter. From 11 to 12 it was 55%, and from 12 to 13 they are projecting 7%. 3rd and 4th quarter could be negative revenue growth if that trend keeps up and then EPS willl really be f'd. Sure they wont go to 0, but if the EPS drops to $30 by end of 2014 I wouldnt be surprised. Still a cash cow, but they have to spend about 3 billion a year just to stop the dilution, the dividend is pathetic compared to what other stocks are paying (although getting better every day).

This stock is crazy volatile and it will get back to $460 in no time at all. Once it does I suggest you sell 80% of your stake and get diversified. Buy stocks in different sectors and before you do please do your homework. I already posted this, but here it is again. Do yourself a favor and look at the press release for AAPL. They have $ 137 Billion in Cash, cash equivalents and short and long term marketable securities. Basically, they have $137 Billion in cash. There are other notable figures that came out. 1. Inventories doubled from a year ago. This could be a good or bad thing depending on what that inventory actually consists of, but the fact that they have a 2-3 week delivery for the IMac it isn’t the one product that is declining in sales. 2. They gave back $4.5 billion in dividends and stock repurchases last quarter. They still have authorization to repurchase another $7.5 Billion over the next three years. I am not sure about the fine points of the authorization, but if they repurchase $7.5 Billion shares over the next few quarters and give a dividend of $2.5ish a quarter they will give back roughly $20 Billion to shareholders in FY13. 3. They increased their R&amp;D by 33% to over a $1 Billion for just last quarter. I am priced in at a decent price, but the decline still hurts. Don’t just look at Yahoo finance, look at the numbers yourself and you may be able to sleep at night.</Msg><Username>wait4itorsell</Username><Timestamp>1359190088086</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 03:48:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359190191109-198</Id><Topic><Title>need serious advise</Title><Username>investor101</Username><Timestamp>1359153412909</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 17:36:52 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You made the mistake that a lot of investors make.

At the open it sores up and then plummets immediately. When the stock bombs like that, I wait a few days and watch it before considering something if I am on the sidelines like you were. Based on fundamentals, AAPL is one of the best, but right now the shorts and the panic sellers have control of it right now. Like one post said, it is up to how much you are willing to risk.

With the hot heads in Congress, we will see a massive depression coming. I would say start trading &amp; investing overseas. Our economy is driven by consumption, to the tune of 80% of GDP. Without a vibrant middle class, cutting expenses and QE forever, is a recipe for disaster. The top 5% won’t make up for the drag on the middle class that balancing the budged over the next 10 years will bring to our economy. You can be sure the very well off will not share the burden proportionally and they will not consume as the majority of our society did in previous decades. Soon the world biggest economies will figure that out too and abandon the US to stew in its own juices. So, yes, buy and sell and play the margins but at least be honest that nothing is free there is a cost to everything. What is being masked by the boy/girls in congress of either party is that it is their failure to make responsible choices over the last 50 years that has let us to massive deficits in this nation. For them to actually believe they are going to eliminate the deficit in 10 years is ludicrous. They’ll kill the Golden Goose doing it. We will be trading company stocks not on the USD. Probably in a basket of currencies and Gold. The big spenders will be other people.

The iPhone 5 offers as you know a new 4-inch Retina display which is the most advanced display in the industry, and no one comes close to matching the level of quality as the Retina display. It also provides a larger screen size for iPhone customers without sacrificing the one-headed ease-of-use that our customers love.

They are unsustainable and have to come down to the teens or lower. People payed more because they perceived them as better. I think we are past that now and that is why the stock is falling. So if margins go to 20% from the peak of 40% then what happens to earnings? They go in half. So the 13 per share they earned this quarter will go to less then 7. So if they earn 28 a share for the year and you put a 10 multiple on it then you get a 280 stock. That is what the sellers are frightened about. Personally, I wouldn't pay more than 300 for apple stock.

It is too big to return to its quirky niche product days and competition will force them to lower their prices. As customer demand declines, the wireless carriers will put unbearable pressure on AAPL to reduce their prices even more. AAPL, not being as fully integrated in hardware as a Samsung or a software powerhouse like GOOG, is less able to respond. Once the price wars begin in ernest, margins will decline precipitously and AAPL will continue to lose pricing power. They will use their cash hoard foolishly to buy smaller more innovative companies, but will suffer the same fate as CSCO and MSFT has with this strategy. Look at their stock performance over the past few years as a guide to where AAPL is headed. I hate to see that happen because AAPL has been a great trading stock. But it will happen. People with blind faith in AAPL will continue to lose their capital as the market adjusts to the new reality. A 50% initial decline is quite normal, in situations like this, so $350 is a realistic target that should be achieved over the next few weeks/months.</Msg><Username>fight_the_fed</Username><Timestamp>1359205438742</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 08:03:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359205520081-267</Id><Title>LOL</Title><Msg>http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/25/tech/mobile/smartphone-unlocking-illegal/index.html?hpt=hp_bn5 Consumers demand-can't buy a phone unless I can pick the carrier.

I have a better tip for you, set a sell limit for your 5 AAPL shares at , don't wait after 10:30 it will drop below $440. Bring your $2000 (keep $225 for bus, tip, lunch, etc) on February 5th to Taj Mahah, must wearing all navy blue clothes, red underwear and shower before walk out of your house to the bus terminal at 9:30 am. Wait at roulette table for the dealer name John (which he will arrive around 3:25pm), and wait for he scratch his head, then his nose. Immediately place your $2000 on Red. That's how you get all your money back plus $700 profit. You've asked people for advise, but seem like your mind already concrete with a thought that you are not gonna sell. If you are losing money on this stock, but still have money to live another 5 years without have to work. Sell all the stock, forget about everything, live the next 5 years with everyday like your last day on earth.

They don't waste anytime when you play the weeklies. Let's see if I get out of this with my head above water. Right now it says I am down a mere $120.00 due to the close at 439.88.

If you even half-way were thinking about selling your shares, you did it last week for sure, or before. Additionally, you had MANY, MANY investors and institutions who HAD to sell because of massive margin calls. When the tide changes with a huge, huge up move next week (and then another follow-through up day the day after) there will be CLIMATIC buying thereafter. Then, instead of talking about all the fools that bought at $700, they'll be talking about all the fools that didn't buy at $450. This stock is trading back down to where it was 1 year ago, (down 38% in 4 months!) AND they have 60 billion MORE in cash.

Apple products sales will continue to climb q over q as evidenced by the last q. Apple returned 13.81 eps and just missed by 200M in sales on 54.4B in sales. This with a Q that was one week shorter. 13 weeks. This whole move has everything to do with Wall St resetting retail and collecting their money. Did you not see to 500 print on January OE? Did you not see the 439 print on the weekly oe? These two oe's were the most heavily played options in the history of a corporate company. Apple will have sales for 2013 of 217B and an EPS of 58. Cash will be over 190B. Given a choice and the means consumers will select Apple products. If they do not have the means they will buy a cheap second tier phone like samsung for now until they can afford an Apple iPhone. This was a shakeout of option money and weak retail investors. They also caught some retail traders who they know have to sell due to margin and or not wanting their money tied up. The numbers speak for themselves and greed will always rule. This companies stock per the financials is worth well over $750 today. Good luck.</Msg><Username>brattle_smattle</Username><Timestamp>1359209571651</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 09:12:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359209582825-360</Id><Title>Action at Friday's bell was proof</Title><Msg>this entire action was option related.

Apple made a lot of money and sold 48M iphones even with a constrained supply chain. We bought several phones at Christmas (AT&amp;T Contract subsidized) and had to wait several weeks to even get them. Even with this, Apple sold a ton of phones. I heard one analyst say anything with a 5 in it (for predicting phone sales) is good; anything with a 4 is bad. What kind of logic is that ... pick some random delineation point? Apple was just fine for the quarter but missed some arbitrary targets? the real issue is that Hedge Funds are worried about their future business slowing and looking out years from now (no one can tell). If it stays at 11+ EPS every quarter, then it will be no issue, If earnings start to slow (say 10 or 9), then obviously the P/E will have to adjust which brings the stock valuation down. This is why the big boys are dumping some of their positions until they can really see what is happening. Remember many bought when the stock was sub-150 so they are still making profits. What Apple needs now is new products to ensure growth or growth oversees to ease concern about future EPS. No analyst can predict that ... it is wait and see and decide which side you want to bet on. I think Apple will produce a lower price phone in China, India, etc. to compete with Samsung, Nokia, etc. in those markets and to keep those companies from making too much money for the R&amp;D war-chests. Time will tell ... I like Apple at these levels.</Msg><Username>ala_tx_2001</Username><Timestamp>1359211138926</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 09:38:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359211140232-402</Id><Title>10% of AAPL shares were traded in last two sessions.</Title><Msg>Since the selling started after hours on Wednesday 95 million shares were traded, roughly 10% of total shares, thoughts?</Msg><Username>wait4itorsell</Username><Timestamp>1359211140232</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 09:39:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359211167509-403</Id><Topic><Title>I cloud users were up about 200% from 85 million in the years ago.</Title><Username>one_dogydog</Username><Timestamp>1359211047229</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 09:37:27 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>what do 'iCloud' users pay for the service?.....if i'm not wrong, a certain amount of icloud storage is available to product buyers for free.....so that whole metric is very 'cloudy'....no pun intended.</Msg><Username>txtrader77</Username><Timestamp>1359211167509</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 09:39:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359211209657-404</Id><Topic><Title>Juews are the most racist people on earth.

Of the $0.69 left, half goes to the label. The other half goes to the publisher once the label's initial investment in the artist has been recouped. Generally speaking, a label invests somewhere in the neighborhood of $300-500k for artists. And with digital sales being what they are these days, that means an artist really only starts getting paid after they've sold nearly half a million downloads. To put this into perspective, the most downloaded song ever on iTunes ("I Gotta Feeling" by the Black Eyed Peas) has sold 6 million copies. So you can imagine that most artists don't see much revenue from iTunes sales, given that their sales numbers are significantly lower than the most popular artists. Indie artists fare a bit better, but not by much. That being said, Apple's not the worst offender in royalties paid to artists, though some argue that 30% is a pretty hefty fee for processing a digital transaction. Below is a great visualization for some additional insight on how much artists get paid per additional distribution method.</Msg><Username>fairtradernyc</Username><Timestamp>1359211257553</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 09:40:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359211303175-406</Id><Topic><Title>100% of my option suggestions made money</Title><Username>biglefthook_00</Username><Timestamp>1359210534066</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 09:28:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Did you sell the Jan 2013 $600 calls for $80..WINNER $80! or SEll the Jan 2014 $600 calls for another $80....WINNER $73 Did you sell the Jan 2014 $520 call and put for $147 and buy the $390 put for $24..can be closed out at $124...

How easy would it be for AAPL to produce Iphone 3 with a chip that is compatible with China Mobile's network? So easy that production of these units could not be noticed by prying eyes. The ASP and the margins on these models would benefit both China Mobile and AAPL by selling a handset that most Chinese could afford, and if not, could finance with the credit facility AAPL recently announced. AAPL's margins on Iphone 3's are near or above the 50% range. With 700,000,000 subscribers, AAPL could easily penetrate 20% of the market, or 140,000,000 new subscribers. If AAPL priced the Iphone 3 at $200, that would result in $280 billion in sales, and at 50% margin, $140 billion in profit. Now if China Mobile demanded a cut from AAPL of say 20%, AAPL would still clear $100 billion in profit. And what about ecosystem profits? Profits from financed Iphone sales? People seem to have forgotten that IPad mini began selling in China last Friday. Naysayers would have you believing that NO Chinese desire an AAPL product. Culturally Chinese New Year in the biggest time where "the best of the best" gifts are purchased. Additionally, Chinese social standards frown upon buying anything but the best. Giving a gift of lesser quality is a major insult. Now if AAPL announces a pact with China Mobile China New Years day, what kind of impact would sales during Q2 have on EPS targets? A 40-50 beat would perhaps be modest. AAPL's production costs will also lower as yields and constraints are resolved. That also means higher margins for Q2 earnings reporting. The other monster in the room is India that has a population 3/4 the size of China. While I am no Cook fan, the master of the supply chain, AAPL has not lost the engineering talent to produce the next gadget that none of us knew we needed, or wanted. Content acquisition, cloud, iTV, and the potential for AAPL to buy a satellite company and run their own wireless network, capturing all that data plan income</Msg><Username>i5unknown</Username><Timestamp>1359211533696</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 09:45:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359211556119-415</Id><Topic><Title>100% of my option suggestions made money</Title><Username>biglefthook_00</Username><Timestamp>1359210534066</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 09:28:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I ALWAYS "suggested" put a 15% tax deferred CASH dividend in your pocket...

What it all comes down to is sentiment. Why else would AMZN be trading at thousands times earnings? On the Nasdaq there are a slew of companies that only have hopes of creating a winning product and, although they're LOSING tons of cash, they're trading at astronomical values. Then you have AAPL a company that's basically printing cash due to a winning lineup of products and has many products in it''s pipeline that have excellent chances for blockbuster success? I think you need to ask yourself: who is more likely to deliver? And when AAPL announces that next product and people start to swoon over it's implications we will start to fly again.</Msg><Username>chin_music</Username><Timestamp>1359211643974</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 09:47:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359211660719-420</Id><Topic><Title>Next Support - $365</Title><Username>informedstockman</Username><Timestamp>1359211306500</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 09:41:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Another scare clown here with this post - o yes - stock will go down to $100 .. .really its "fake" cash ...

Digging through this week's post-earnings mess, I've dug up three investment-worthy stocks: Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Google (NASDAQ: GOOG), and Coach (NYSE: COH). Apple Apple's stock has plummeted over 10% since it announced earnings on Wednesday. Despite the horrific drop in the stock price, there was plenty of great news: Year over year revenue and iPhone units sold increased 27% and 29%, respectively (numbers adjusted to reflect the shorter quarter in FQ1 2013). Net income was less impressive, declining slightly from $13.87 per share in the year-ago quarter to $13.81 per share. Furthermore, a few key items were buried in the debate on the company's financials. For instance, iCloud users were up about 200%, from 85 million in the year-ago quarter to 250 million. Plus, iTunes users topped 500 million, adding a nice $2.1 billion to the bottom line. Apple CEO Tim Cook refers to Apple's cloud services as a "strategy for the next decade." After the sell-off, Apple has a nice dividend yield of 2.4%. Even better, the stock is priced for zero growth despite average analyst estimates of double-digit growth in earnings in 2013. Operating on such a large scale already, Apple is no longer a growth stock. But it's a solid, profitable mega-cap with a nice yield that should serve investors well for years to come.

Buy long dated deep in the money call ( e.g. oct $350) and sell an at or just out of the money call with same expiry (e.g. Oct $450) ... At Fri closing price, this would have cost you ~$6600 and if AAPL can get above $450 by Oct expiration, your positions would be worth $10K for a gain of ~$3400 or 50% .... Plus if you already own shares of AAPL, the money you collect from selling the $450 call (~$3400) can help be a hedge against any further short term fall in AAPL stock. This trade won't lose money unless AAPL falls below $405 ... ($439 close price - $34 from sale of call = $405) Thoughts?</Msg><Username>asiabynight</Username><Timestamp>1359212377560</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 09:59:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359212377698-462</Id><Topic><Title>ITune monney making machine takes 0.33 cent of the 99C</Title><Username>fairtradernyc</Username><Timestamp>1359211257553</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 09:40:57 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So?

Samsung does not control smartphone sales in the U.S. ... See info below. Only on a global basis because Chinese, Indians, etc can't pay $700 for a phone. Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone continues to be mighty in the U.S., but its growth internationally is slowing, an analysis by Raymond James analyst Tavis McCourt has found. According to McCourt’s calculations, combined fourth-quarter iPhone sales at AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) were up 25 percent to 14.8 million units, while all other smartphone sales declined by 2 percent at the two carriers. From a market share basis, Apple took 74 percent share of smartphones at these two carriers against 69 percent a year ago. “Assuming modest success at Sprint (NYSE:S),” the analyst said iPhone sell-through estimate outside of the U.S. could be put at 29.2 million. This would represent a 35 percent year-over-year growth, or a deceleration from the 40 percent growth of the third quarter.</Msg><Username>ala_tx_2001</Username><Timestamp>1359213108852</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 10:11:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359213142958-492</Id><Topic><Title>Tim Cook did nothing wrong!

Suddenly, the stock price is dictating the fundamentals if you listen to all the negative buzz out there. The slide could continue at least to $425 imo, but its getting near the stick a fork in 'em level if it goes into the $300s. Hedge funds are key here - do they continue to sell shares under pressure down here or do whales not already in decide to get in. The problem with a truly over loved stock is that you run out of potential buyers unless a big drop occurs. The selling keeps forcing more selling as the hedge funds get crushed for now under negative mojo.

Lower stock price benefits Apple and longs until August 2013</Title><Msg>In August 2012, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase program (“ASR”) with a financial institution to purchase up to $1.95 billion of the Company’s common stock in 2013. In exchange for an up-front payment of $1.95 billion, the financial institution committed to deliver a number of shares during the ASR’s purchase period, which ends later in 2013. The total number of shares ultimately delivered, and therefore the average price paid per share, will be determined at the end of the purchase period based on the volume weighted average price of the Company’s stock during that period. In the first quarter of 2013, 2,582,782 shares were initially delivered to the Company. This does not represent the final number of shares to be delivered under the ASR. These shares were retired and accounted for as a reduction to shareholders’ equity in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company accounted for the ASR as a repurchase of common stock for purposes of calculating earnings per share and as a forward contract indexed to its own common stock which met all of the applicable criteria for equity classification, and, therefore, was not accounted for as a derivative instrument.</Msg><Username>seabow9981</Username><Timestamp>1359214909650</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 10:41:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359214919656-537</Id><Topic><Title>Mayer: Yahoo Entering a Great Period of Execution</Title><Username>co1done</Username><Timestamp>1359161591063</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 19:53:11 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Mayer is clearly super intelligent and an expert in all things Yahoo.

Also, the iphone 5 was launched in september vs october for the 4s robbing the holiday quarter of 5 to 6 million iphones. More accurate comparison is 59 million iphones vs 37 million last year. Add the supply problems which Tim Cook himself said reduced sales, and you're looking at over 60 million vs 37 million.

But to say you can NEVER lose money (unrealized loss) is not correct. Whether or not you overall net a gain or loss selling covered calls fully depends on what call strike and expiration you sell, and where the stock is trading then. Yes, the premium from shorting calls is yours to keep no matter what happens. However, the stock can definitely fall faster than one can hedge a stock long position selling calls. Only sales of deep in the money calls then which are initially nuetral in premium recieved would now give very effective hedge on this falling knive stock price.</Msg><Username>slacytechtick</Username><Timestamp>1359215224087</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 10:47:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359215224457-550</Id><Topic><Title>Do the math and you will see the light. 60 EPS and 200B in cash at a 5 PE this is a $550 stock.</Title><Username>alvin555</Username><Timestamp>1359214430525</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 10:33:50 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>how will they earn 60 eps?</Msg><Username>by_hi_sell_lo_1</Username><Timestamp>1359215224457</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 10:47:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359215290934-551</Id><Title>This inordinate freefall may be a historic, once in a lifetime opportunity,</Title><Msg>The daily freefall we have been seeing is clearly inordinate and WAY out of proportion for the "crime" committed.

I meant that a China mobile deal, even if with lower margin iPhones, could drop the average GM%, but the additional billions in net margin $ will increase the EPS. I agree that the mix is heavily weighted with the iPhone GM%. In my profession, I often deal with this dilemma. Do you dilute your GM margin % with lower margin work/sales, but increase your GM and net margin $ in the process, or do you go after business that keeps your GM margin % high, but you lose sales and market in the process? The fact is, yes, the iPhone will not be able to maintain the ridiculous margin % forever, but if you can make it up with more volume, who cares about the %? I believe this why the stock price has cratered. The conference call was a disaster. Wall Street wants Apple to diversify with bigger screen phones, and cheaper phones to slow Samsung down. They have the same fears that you mentioned. If your GM% is shrinking, you must make it up with increased revenues, and a mix of new iPhones would do just this.</Msg><Username>go4two2001</Username><Timestamp>1359215302818</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 10:48:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359215303203-553</Id><Topic><Title>NY Post -&amp; China News - 3 New Phones by June - HUGE/ CHINA MOBILE IT IS - !!</Title><Username>palisadesestateplanninglawyer</Username><Timestamp>1359211366011</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 09:42:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>need it sooner.

Last quarter revenue was up 18% yet earnings were flat. Yes an extra week would have added to the EPS, but most quarters are 13 weeks, but, and try to grasp this, Apple released the iPhone5 earlier this year so while the quarter was shorter the iPhone5 sold in the US for the entire quarter and in 100 other countries during the quarter. There are NO new countries to release the phone in this quarter. IE they stacked the deck for last quarter and packed more sales into it than the year before by releasing their biggest product earlier. Are you being deliberately obtuse? THE ISSUE (emphasis added so you stop looking backward) is next quarter's growth and what it means for the FUTURE (ie the IMPORTANT part). REVENUE GROWTH in the second quarter from 2011 to 2012 was 55%, but from 2012 to 2013 it projects to just 7% Can you understand that is a HUGE slowdown? EPS during that time will drop significantly as well due to the lower margins? Margins that most predict are not done compressing. So try to think in the future. Revenue growth is SLOWING, margins are getting SMALLER, new products like the mini and a cheaper phone will have even WORSE margins so while they will help revenue to an extent (ie the extent they don't cannibalize sales of the more expensive versions) it will require significantly more revenue to keep EPS from dropping. Obviously next quarter they will fail to do that for the first time in forever. Can you also not understand that by the end of last quarter supply was not an issue for the iPhone5 and in fact they had EXCESS inventory? Supply did impact the iPad Mini and iMAC, but GOING FORWARD it isnt an issue and yet second projections show very little growth.</Msg><Username>tkell31</Username><Timestamp>1359215617776</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 10:53:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359215630330-563</Id><Topic><Title>Child Labor Investigation</Title><Username>retiredexaon</Username><Timestamp>1359215345382</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 10:49:05 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It was Apple's investigations that uncovered this and they are taking action</Msg><Username>A Yahoo!

While you are blatantly correct on the surface your comment means you either dont understand how falling margins impact that calculation or dont know about them. I was lazy and didnt mention it, but margins are dropped from 47% to 38% as well which means 7% growth from 39 million at 38% is much worse than 55% growth from 26 million at 47%.

Right now, AAPL has not lost direction, which is obviously down. Watch the open on Monday. Even if AAPL gaps up, (open higher than 439.88) be careful not to be surprised and buythe open as it may not be a short term bullish sign. Patience is going to be key early next week. Now, same higher open than Friday's close Monday. Wait it out, watch the action. If AAPL dips below Friday's close, (even 10-15 bucks) wait it out. Do not buy. However, if AAPL does make that big dip-trip, and manages to close above Friday's close, (still wait it out for Tuesday's action). This could be a sign of capitulation, but it hasn't been confirmed until Tuesday is watched. On Tuesday, if AAPL gaps up, above Monday's close, buy at the open- watch pre-market. You need confirmation, that this downtrend is over, and it will take Monday's action and Tusday's action to confirm. I know what you are thinking, if AAPL gaps down and goes lower 10-15 bucks Monday, I'm buying. Why? It may go another 10-15 lower Tuesday. Wait for confirmation of trend reversal and that really won't occur until Tuesday, at the earliest.

That's the trillion-dollar question when it comes to Piper Jaffray's prediction that Apple (AAPL_) could see its shares top $1,000. Jim Cramer told his "Mad Money" TV show viewers Tuesday that it's perfectly rational for investors to doubt this bold target, but after they do the math, $1,000 a share may not seem all that illogical. See if (AAPL) is in our portfolio Cramer said that analyzing Apple, a stock he owns for his charitable trust Action Alerts PLUS, is just like analyzing any other stock. One must first determine how much the company will earn as earnings, then multiply that number by how much the markets are willing to pay for those earnings. According to Piper Jaffray, Apple will earn $51 a share by 2013 and up to $80 a share by 2015, a solid assessment, said Cramer, given the company's dominance in smart phones, tablets and computers. But are investors really willing to pay $1,000 a share for those earnings? Cramer said this is where the research gets interesting. According to Piper Jaffray's research, Apple will be shaving hundreds of millions of dollars worth of market cap from its rivals over the next two years. Yet when analyzing the company to achieve its $1,000 price target, the Piper analyst still values Apple's earnings at just 12 times, less than that of the competition it will continue to crush. Cramer said that Apple, of course, deserves a multiple far greater than that of the competition. But shares have historically always been valued as the underdog, he noted, so Piper Jaffary just extended that trend into its analysis. And that's why, he said, thinking of Apple as a $1,000 stock is not "irrationally exuberant" as some have claimed, but likely a foregone conclusion.</Msg><Username>A Yahoo!

I bought this way too early this month. I have 170 shares long at $575 cost basis. I have no more money to buy anything else.

I want to just let is expire so I can make some money/ help on my losses. Keep in mind that I'm at a loss, so I guess I would have to sell $500 strike price options to even make some money on sell calls ... hoping that it won't get assigned.

I came up with 681. The formula is here. Do your own calc.</Title><Msg>Step 1 Check the company's most recent quarterly report (10-Q) and look up their earnings per share (EPS). You'll find two figures: The number of shares of stock the company issued and the earnings. To calculate the EPS by hand, divide the earnings by the number of shares. You'll quickly realize that you can't compare Company A to Company B based on price alone, even if they're trading at similar prices. The number of shares matters when you calculate earnings. Step 2 Divide the the company's price-per-share by its EPS to get the price-to-earnings ratio, also called the P/E ratio. This number can stump new investors. But it's part of an investing vocabulary and helps you come to terms with the difference between price and value. The P/E defines how much each dollar of earnings costs the investor. You pay almost twice as much for a dollar of earnings for a company with a P/E of 85 than for a company with a P/E of 45. Step 3 Factor in the sales and you have another measure of value. Divide the share price by the total sales and you have the price-to-sales ratio. Keep this in mind when a company catches your investment eye. Once considered an old-fashioned and dated metric, the P/S ratio has been dusted off and used to cut through the fluff of earnings statements. It's risky and difficult for companies to fudge sales (revenue) numbers. Historically, companies with low P/S ratios beat companies with low P/Es. Step 4 Include the company's growth rate and calculate the PEG rate. Take the P/E and divide it by the current growth rate. For example, FatWallet Company has a P/E of 67 and a growth rate of 25 percent. Its PEG is 67/25 = 2.68. According to MSN Money, stocks with PEGs higher than 1.0 are trading above their growth rate; those with PEGs around 1.0 match their projections.</Msg><Username>ram9751</Username><Timestamp>1359217609942</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 11:26:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359217644592-650</Id><Topic><Title>PLEASE Help Me - I am Devastated!

LOL Cook does not inspire confidence, but AAPL has far too many talented people not to produce the next "wow". Emerging markets seem to be the elephant in the room that analysts don't mention. They don't want you too. Those markets will dwarf what AAPL has done domestically. And no one ever mentions the billions of people in India. Don't watch the show, pay attention to the man behind the curtain. Literally. The baby is fine. It's the bath water (retail and funds that need to show a return) that have been rushing to exit. Heck, PG has a higher PE than AAPL. Want to value AAPL as a value stock. Try 650 minimum. It's an investment, not a short term trade like NFLX. Their model is much like BETA and VHS was to media. AAPL does need to deploy cash. Content, satellite wireless and emerging markets ecosystem revenues so huge that AAPL making $250 billion in profit a year is grossly under estimating the potential.</Msg><Username>i5unknown</Username><Timestamp>1359218285337</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 11:38:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359218289515-676</Id><Topic><Title>NY Post -&amp; China News - 3 New Phones by June - HUGE/ CHINA MOBILE IT IS - !!</Title><Username>palisadesestateplanninglawyer</Username><Timestamp>1359211366011</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 09:42:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No doubt, he is got a different style.

Apple has from 12 to 16% of the subs on each of the other two networks in China so it's reasonable that Apple can get as much from a China Mobile deal. A conservative estimate would be around 10 mil mors subs added to the total in the first full qtr apple is offered. The kicker is this gets apple's foot in the door as 3G is a growth area where additions look to be from 20 to 30% per year and maybe more. Looking at China Mobile alone if Apple can maintain their 12 to 16% share of the total 3G market they can get anywhere from 30 to 50 mil more subs per year. An addition of 10 mil subs to the 47 mil sold this past qtr would have given Apple a blowout in Revs and earnings. The conversation about apple would be totally different. Now if apple can offer a lower cost phone to the entire over 1 billion subscriber base on all the Chinese carriers we're looking at a market that will easily surpass the US and if you add India where Apple has minimum exposure we once again see double difit growth per qtr. and that's without any new sources of revenue.</Msg><Username>ditzil</Username><Timestamp>1359218480177</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 11:41:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359218548809-689</Id><Topic><Title>How to calculate Apples true stock price value.

And how many ? I am just trying to get a sense of your over all cost basis including the premium you paid for the calls. As long as you sell calls against long stock, you do not need to put up any money. The one issue you have is that you own 170 shares, that will only allow you to sell a 1 lot. if you had 2 calls you could sell 2 calls. The one issue you need to ask yourself is do you think the selloff is over done. You could sell some " covered calls" have the stock run up big and they give away your upside. Get back to me with the other info. I would suggest you look into selling your stock and buying some deep in the money calls. You will take a loss, but you could leverage yourself a little more while getting your cash out. One scenario , would be to sell 170 shares at 440, and buy 2 or 3 of the Feb 375 calls. the debits on that would be 12 to 15k and you have all the upside.</Msg><Username>apex_trex</Username><Timestamp>1359218793935</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 11:46:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359218813575-695</Id><Topic><Title>spoke to an insider</Title><Username>brattle_smattle</Username><Timestamp>1359216651009</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 11:10:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There may be more pain to come....but I think you have suffered most of the pain to this point.

Is this the best place right now to grow your money back to what you have lost so far and is it the best place for me to make money from this point forward. In other words, what other options to we have to make money...because clearly this isn't the only place. Hopefully, this is not a large position for you as a percentage of your total portfolio. From my reading of your message, it appears as it might be...."heart wrenching". If it is, then lesson learned - not to sound mean...but I had to learn that lesson myself - you just cannot bank on one stock. So, here is what I do now. I trade UPRO and SPXU pretty much everyday...at least right now. Both are 3X ETFs on the S&amp;P. Yes, that is alot of risk...but wait. AAPL, by the way is about 2% of the holdings . Today, the direction of the S&amp;P is up,up, up. Currently, and I am talking recently, the S&amp;P hits its daily low sometime around 10:30 am to 11:30 am EST...not always. At this point, I buy UPRO (because I think S&amp;P is going up)...now...I don't go all in...I use about 10% to 20% of my account (in fairness...this is risk money...wouldn't change my lifestyle if I lost it...but emotionally...would be very difficult...I would want to "make it back"...this sounds like where you are). I then place a stop....you got to have a stop!!!!!....if I buy at $100, I would set my stop at $98....just knowing this ETF "today"...that is a safe distance to let the trade cook...now, I am looking at getting out by the end of the day. I will take a profit of say 50 cents to up to $2 per share. The S&amp;P just keeps going up "today". Seriously, I have not lost on one single trade in 2013.

Fear is a strong emotion. Greed accompanies and magnifies fear. Events this next year will shock many. But just like the railroads that were dismissed as unnecessary, AAPL is tightly interwoven into the fabric of our world. Warren Buffett got it right with railroads. Intelligent money knows the same with AAPL. And name one other company that could get ONE TRILLION in loans if they wanted. Don't bankers want to loan to credit worthy customers? Say AAPL bought a satellite company and added being a wireless provider to their ecosystem? Then offered their products at prices rivaling competitors? And offered data plans 20% cheaper than their rivals? Just try to estimate the revenue and profit. You think people are going to stop using their wireless devices? Somehow LEAP, S, VZ and T, plus numerous regional carriers make a profit, or manage to stay in business. And if AAPL told those carriers that they couldn't have their product, where would all these users flock to? AAPL needs to diversify like Samsung. Deploy that cash and borrow if needed. $250 billion in profits annually with no growth would be an attractive value stock.</Msg><Username>i5unknown</Username><Timestamp>1359219109660</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 11:51:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359219121091-702</Id><Topic><Title>ALL THE DUMB SHEEP BEING SLAUGHTERED...LOL..YAWN.....LIKE ALWAYS!!</Title><Username>sheepskinner6</Username><Timestamp>1359218348965</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 11:39:08 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Little envious a&amp;&amp;hole stealing coolr's phases again...love how you remembered what I used to say that to all you patristics wannabees.

They are debt free. They are still growing much more slowly due to competition. So I don't understand the selloff. Their p/e is in the 9s!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Their future prospects are good. China Mobile, iTv, something else. The next Q earnings should be good. No more manufacturing issues preventing customers from buying. Launched in over 100 countries. iPad minis still hot. Yes Apple needs to come up with some new products. Although Samsungs model of improving existing products and making cheaper ones is a great business!!! Apple can instantly have a cheaper iPhone by reducing prices on the iPhone 4. There will soon be an iPhone 5s. I understood why it went to $500s because of real definite manufacturing/supply issues. But inspite of the manufacturing issues, Apple came in with a great quarter of earnings. Yes they had manufacturing issues - look at the iMac numbers. Customers wanted them - &amp; none for sale. In fact this is Apples bad imo. Apple had no Macs for sale. (Not even the previous versions - that's what I heard). Cant' do anything about it crashing -- but I don't get it. Apple making $13+ Billion in profit with no debt, should have a stock price of $600s. The manufacturing /supply issues have been resolved. That leaves valuation &amp; growth. Apple value is astronomically high. It will continue to grow in single digits. Don't understand the CRASH. Obviously it will probably go down to $300s &amp; maybe even $200, but I still won't understand it. Is Apple p/e going to be 1? Below 1?</Msg><Username>davidba1960</Username><Timestamp>1359219303302</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 11:55:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359219361982-710</Id><Title>GG, SLW same chart as AAPL last 3 months probably due to hedge fund liquidation not fundalmentals !</Title><Msg>Gold, Silver and AAPL were favorites of hedge funds, now the hedge funds are blowing up and forced to sell.

The catalyst for that would be new products (I-must have new gizmos) or increasing market share in markets where you are lagging. Insert China, Brazil &amp; India as fertile fields for Revenue growth and you can see how compressed margins become of lesser concern. Let's say tha it costs you $100 to manufacture an I-widget. If you can sell 100 I-widgetswith a 50% markup or sell 500 widgets with 20% markup, which would you prefer. The former gives you a profit of $5,000 whereas the latter case gives you $10,000. I would embrace compressed margins on specific products if I knew it would increase market share. On the new OMG products, they should be able to maintain higher margins for the first couple of years.</Msg><Username>_booger_2000_</Username><Timestamp>1359219478989</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 11:57:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359219534777-715</Id><Title>Hey most beileve what their told.

Look I think you will be fine. I would look to sell 5% otm ( out of the money) calls on a weekly basis and trail them. If the stock shoots up you will need to roll them up and out a week keeping that 5% buffer against the stock. Example, on Monday, you might want to sell 1 of the Feb 460 calls expiring that week. The premium may not be that much but it will give you a little income. Plus you have the div in mid Feb ( 2.65). Then is the stock is say 470 by the end of the week, you will need to buy them back and sell the 500 strike the following week. Best case scenario the stock closes 460 and you keep the premium. The one thing with Apple is they at anytime can do something that will catch people by surprise, meaning they are holding alot of powder here. There are a dozen or so catalysts that could send this off to the races. My advice is wait a few weeks and see how the stock plays out. Please keep in mind, the media and the analysts are 100% responsible for this mess. The media treated this company like it was some high P/E stock and the analysts all seem to think they can come out with numbers that if they are not met, than they have the final say. As of now, Apple has 140 bill in cash. They make a billion a week. If the past is any indicator I would not count them out in terms of innovation. Lastly, this is the cheapest tech stock out there in terms of growth and p/e multiple. Do not let the dopes on this board tell you otherwise.

Everything eventually matures and slows down. Smart phones are coming out of the woodwork now and Apple has got to come up with the next big innovative idea! Even Vizio is about to put a smart phone on the market. Many fear that the market is being over-saturated and the costs of these gadgets are going down fast! This selloff was more a showing of the lack of confidence in Tim Cook more than anything! jmo of course!</Msg><Username>kudlowsflooziegirl</Username><Timestamp>1359221225592</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 12:27:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359221239117-771</Id><Title>YHOO finally got a true Internet CEO</Title><Msg>During MM interview in Bloomberg, she truly tell the market that she is the best fit CEO of YHOO.

We all know that the board could take action if they wanted to. But then again think of the issue of the stock buy back. I think the board is happy with the stock tanking so apple can buy back more shares at the lower price.. They figure the stock will have a bounce back at some point anyway. The sad part about this is that in the meantime many investors have to take a loss if they don't hang in there.</Msg><Username>garysund12</Username><Timestamp>1359221293667</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 12:28:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359221294640-774</Id><Topic><Title>Is it possible some hedge funds maybe selling stock to themselves?</Title><Username>sotossssotos</Username><Timestamp>1359220999279</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 12:23:19 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good luck with that!

Lets say you own 100 shares and you want to sell March call. So you sell to open 1 contract of March $470 call for $7.50 which nets you $750 minus fees. Let suppose stock rebounded to $480 on March expiration. On that day, your call will worth a little over $10, maybe $10.50. If you want to close it, you will need to come up with $1050 plus fees to buy it back with a buy to close order. I don't like to buy back covered call for a loss. What I will do in this case is to roll the covered call out and up to a later date contract. To do this, you can issue a two legged order. First leg buy to close the March 470, second leg sell to open another covered call at a higher strike price a few months out. The key here is to pick the second leg far enough that will offset the cost of buying back the March 470, preferably net you some cashes. So if March $480 costs $10.50 to close out, you want to sell the second leg for at least $11 to $12.</Msg><Username>pureinvestor</Username><Timestamp>1359221789883</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 12:36:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359221870452-786</Id><Topic><Title>Fundamental research method</Title><Username>bakert82</Username><Timestamp>1340465556000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-06-23 11:32:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>AAPL@440 is crazy cheap</Msg><Username>robert.white</Username><Timestamp>1359221870452</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 12:37:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359221891351-787</Id><Topic><Title>How to calculate Apples true stock price value.

Thank you very much for this. Greatly appreciated. I do have another general question.... if a person is say... initiates a long ONE 400 strike price April calls and they are in the money in April. So then, they get exercised the shares in April. Can they sell the 100 shares of stock that they were assigned, can they sell it without paying for the 100 shares? Or would that be a free ride violation? Say, they get exercised the 100 shares, can they just sell it the next day when they got exercised? Sorry for all these questions. I'm really trying to learn and it seems like you're really experienced in options. If you buy a call, can't you exercise it at anytime, even if you're not IN the money ? I know that's a dumb move because you're at a loss, but can you exercise it knowing that you'll be at a loss ? If you buy a call, you have the right to exercise... so can't you exercise it anytime?

That is to say, the company has to discount on price. There was some small evidence in the Holliday quarter that iPhone 5s were discounted but it appeared to be the particular retailers promotion and not an Apple concession. Walmart comes to mind. Great marketing on the part of Walmart, but not indicative of any discounting on the part of apple. Remember, Walmart only ran the promotion in select physical stores and probably only had very limited inventory in those stores (at most 10 to 15 phones per location). What would you prefer? Tens of millions in running an additional national ad campaign or a small iPhone promotion that would get just as much press, as many people to your website, and as many people in your stores. So there was no credible evidence that apple discounted the iPhone 5. In fact there was evidence of supply constraints. This all means that any margin compression due to the iphone 5 was most likely not due to competitive reasons because as I said above, we usually see that in selling price discounts. What we did know before earnings was that the iPhone 5 would have lower margins due to direct material cost and other overhead fixed type cost due new design and form factor and new production that the iPhone 4S did not have associated with it. With this in mind, the arguments that margin compression is an indication of apple stumbling at the feet of android is muted especially given the fact that apple sold more iPhones year over year and that they sold more iPhone 5 than 4 s from a year ago. That is to say, they grew.

It is the same as you are buying 100 shares at $400. In general, there is no reason to take in-money long call assignment because you will loss all time values as soon as the calls are exercised. You will be better off selling the calls before expiration. If for some reasons the calls become illiquid (ask/bid spread getting wide), which can happen if calls are getting deeply in money just before expiration, and you don't have cash to take the assignment. There are two ways to deal with it. You can call your broker and instruct them to do a cashless exercise. Your broker will exercise your calls and immediately sell the shares at the market price. Or you can lock in your profit by shorting the same number of shares before expiration. You can than use the assigned shares to cover the short position and keep the profits. I prefer using shorts to lock in profit because I have full control of the price. Sometimes it is difficult to control what price the booker sells your shares in a cashless exercise. You can exercise any call at any time. But why would you want to exercise an out-of-money call? It will be cheaper to just buy the shares.</Msg><Username>pureinvestor</Username><Timestamp>1359225437264</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 13:37:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359225439087-937</Id><Topic><Title>Long Vacation for The Coldone</Title><Username>co1done</Username><Timestamp>1357174149301</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-02 19:49:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You are so right .

"In recent years," Apple's chief financial officer Peter Oppenheimer noted in his prepared comments in the company's earnings call, "our guidance reflected a conservative point estimate of results every quarter that we had reasonable confidence in achieving. "Going forward, we plan to provide a range of guidance that reflects our belief of what we are likely to achieve. While we cannot forecast with complete accuracy, we believe we are likely to report within the range of guidance we provide. Therefore, for the March quarter, we're providing revenue guidance of between $41 billion and $43 billion compared to $39.2 billion in the year ago quarter." Fool me once, Can't get fooled again For years, Apple has offered forward looking guidance outlining the minimum performance that company executives were reasonably confident they could reach over the coming quarter. As the company's performance has accelerated over the past several years of rapidly increasing sales of iPods and then iPhones, iPads and new Macs, Apple has consistently trampled its own guidance, resulting in the cynical perception that the company's forward looking figures were excessively conservative, to the point where critics began describing them as "sandbagging." Sandbagging figuratively suggests an effort to misrepresent one's own abilities early on in order to throw off one's competition. The term is often applied to billiard, chess or poker players who deceptively play under their true skill level in order to fool opponents into betting against them in a subsequent, higher stakes game.

Now, no question Android is dominating market share, and no doubt this industry going forward is a game of ecosystems, but honestly answer me this, is Apple doing such a bad job serving its current customers that they will, in a material way, jump ship to Android (especially given switching cost)? I think the answer to that at present is no. Besides Apple doing a bad job serving its customers, for Android to materially switch iPhone customers it would have to demonstrate something demonstrable different than the iPhone. I personally don't see that, but you can make up your own minds ( I do see screen size possibly especially for people who use their smart phones to totally replace or supplant a pc and/or tablet). Keep in mind that Premium Android phones sell for similar price to iPhone, so price is not really a materially differentiating factor. iPhone outsold S3. In closing, I do believe Apple will address the screen size and price point issues, but for now there is no compelling reason to rush that. The barriers to exit are high for the apple Eco system and the learning curve remains low. It's sticky. The barriers to exist are low for Android (my opinion) and the learning curve is high ( my opinion). If I'm right, then any time Apple decides it wants more market share then it can go out and get it. For now, the numbers don't suggest they need to panic or react.</Msg><Username>applesupertramp</Username><Timestamp>1359225978328</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 13:46:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359225985521-953</Id><Topic><Title>I want to visit Steves Jobs grave and tell him that APPLE is under a massive Attack from CNBC and Crooks.</Title><Username>one_dogydog</Username><Timestamp>1359223312564</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 13:01:52 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>An absolutely stupid comment.

I was proved wrong on friday when the stock couldn't hold $440. The last 2-3 minutes of trading were very disturbing - it clearly looked like someone or some trading program traded through the best bid/ask and sold a few shares down at 435. Could have been a pushed the wrong button error because the stock was holding in well in the low-mid 440s on good volume. But i suspect it's coming from pressure to take the stock lower near term. On a technical basis the charts look terrible. There is good medium term support at the $420 level with a possible low at $404, the medium range 200 day mvg average. The long term 50day mvg average would have the stock hit $380, but if it went that low it could drive through that and take it down as low as $360 where there is excellent support for the stock. It looks like analysts have now lowered their earnings for this year to a revised consensus $42.50 from $48. At $440 a share, with 939mil shares outstanding, the stock has a forward PE of 10.35. If you factor out the cash of $137bil as of 12/31/12, ie., current market cap at 440 equals $413.16bil minus $137.1bil cash equals $276.06bil and using consensus est. of $42.5, the PE ex cash at 440 is 6.91, a bit lower than MSFT's current PE ex cash. If it dropped to $360, the PE ex cash would then be 5.03. Although the chart would suggest that the downward momentum is such that we must hit 380 and go through it a bit, i do find it hard to believe that the company that as of today is the most profitable on the planet will actually trade down to a PE ex cash of 5, but it could happen. What might stop the slide and help the stock put in a low in say the 420 to 440 range.

Pointing out how MSFT stock hit a peak in the year 2000, then went down, and then despite earnings went up over the next decade, MSFT just stayed about the same for years. THE COMPARISON IS NOT GOOD, misses several things. First, MSFT stock when it hit its peak was a 75 PE Ratio. Its now a 15 PE Ratio. Apple today is a 10 - 11 PE Ratio, already more depressed in valuation than MSFT was at when it was way up and also even now. When Apple stock was at its peak $704 last Fall, it didn't even have a 20 PE, not even close to MSFT's 75 PE at peak. Second thing that article is missing, is MSFT in the early 2000s paid a huge one-time Cash Return of Capital to shareholders, I seem to recall it was something like $30 per share. Apple's been stingy with dividends to shareholders so far. Meantime, Apple's so-called recent "weak quarter" (which was 29% growth in IPHONES sold and 49% in IPADS and was its highest quarterly profit ever), along with its recent stock price plunge, means AAPL stock is very undervalued vs. slower growing MSFT's 15 PE.</Msg><Username>aiwal1</Username><Timestamp>1359227620098</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 14:13:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359227688466-1001</Id><Topic><Title>YHOO goldmine assets</Title><Username>goingbravo</Username><Timestamp>1359167245929</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 21:27:25 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Very smart for MM to hire Ken Goldman as YHOO CFO.

I was sitting at 437 and didn't get filled. The way its done is special routing and must be filled 100% in a single sale. Same with the spikes that were seen jumping the PPS several times to 446. Unfair to the retail investor, the MMs and hedges should be trading open market instead of private transactions. You think retail investors are making this stock move...not a chance and if retails are making money its because they are riding the coattails of the big guys who are making more. And if you think you can guess which way this will head Monday then you have a better crystal ball then mine. I have been making money on the daytrades with tight stops, letting it go up a few dollars then waiting for the dip to buy again. This may be a repeat of the last drop where it will revisit $500 then your guess is as good as mine.</Msg><Username>itsawhiz</Username><Timestamp>1359227801769</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 14:16:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359227829022-1007</Id><Title>FAMOUS SHORT CORTEZ AND CRAMER LONG NOW</Title><Msg>Total manipulation or.

Reasons to do that? 1. They began the Q with ample domestic cash for that even before considering the what, call it $15B+/- of incremental cash flow generation for the quarter. They can always bring cash back from offshore as the deferred tax piece has already been reflected in the financials -- it is a matter of relieving the deferred tax liability account and wiring the funds, not an earnings hit. 2. It would send a message about the new militancy of Cook's willingness to protect employee morale and demonstrate new sophistication on capital management. Incidentally, it would decisively F over the #$%$ saying AAPL is the new dell or msft or RIMM (or any other companies the idiots like Cramer and the gumptards here reference as the reset/no growth aapl). Apparently none of them understand the deltas on extra week, improving margins guided for March vs Dec Q, solid increase in guided revs for march yoy; or that AAPL really shouldn't be viewed as a 5x earnings stock like Cramer, Grundlach and other clowns -- even Misek now -- suggest is coming. 3. The tax noise/advantage of 3% if they had done it last year is over for individuals, but anyone who has been/remianed long for more than 3 months without hedge offsets has unrealized losses to reverse and those will largely evaporate with a solid jolt to the stock down here. I think almost no retail account would object (as if that matters) and EVERY PM I KNOW STILL LONG THE SHARES WOULD APPLAUD THE ACTION. It is not well understood, but the hedge fund and other players benefitting from "carried interest" deferrals are only paying cap gains taxes anyway. 4. Fav press would help staff morale too, be good for the BOD and Tim's reputations, and ensure AAPL never again finds itself subject to such a ridiculous and undefended attack by pot-smoking bond managers or anyone else with fleeting swagger walking into the gelding operations facility.

That's why I mentioned to someone earlier that you don't want to buy until a trend reversal confirmation is had. At the earliest, that will be Tuesday for a trend reversal confirmation. I know people are going to want to buy if AAPL drops 10-15 on Monday morning. I say wait Monday out regardless of what happens. As people who bought at 450 can attest, no confirmation was given on Friday to enter this stock. Basically, you need to see a close above Friday's close on Monday, then watch pre-market Tuesday for an open above Monday's close, then you can buy the open on Tuesday. If on Tuesday, AAPL opens lower than Monday's close, (and Mondays' close is lower than Friday's), you need to wait until Wednesday and watch for the same thing you watched for on Monday. And so on.

If AAPL goes down further below $400 with market weakness, I would look to go long AAPL as that will be an overshoot in short term.

I said the stores were showing slow traffic, there was no innovation and SIRI and Maps were symptomatic of the problem. Whtat I said was there was just too much enthusiasm for the stock. It was just like FB when it went public. When FB starting going down everyone was screaming it was a fad, they can't monetize mobile, the same is now true for Apple. News follow stocks action not the other way around. All the shills on CBBC are now screaming about Apple being a has been, no innovation,samsung eating their lunch. Where were they at 700? So now is the time to leg in. 425 will be the place you want to get long and it will rally hard. I see a new trading range 425 to 500 that should be enough for you dummies to make your money back.</Msg><Username>insttrader2</Username><Timestamp>1359228874206</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 14:34:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359228875649-1041</Id><Topic><Title>What will be the near term low for Apple - my best guess now is anywhere between</Title><Username>ettubrutusad</Username><Timestamp>1359227503760</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 14:11:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The first is that the BOD takes decisive action that is announced early next week to stop the slide. I know they were scheduled to meet soon but i don't know the date. Someone is posting saying it will be on sunday - that would be great if true but who really knows. If they raised the dividend from $10.60 to $20, it seems it could be done easily given the current cash on hand and the cash currently being generated each quarter. A $20 dividend at 440 would provide a yield of 4.54percent. As a comparison, other large company's current yields are as follows: MSFT 3.3%, INTC 4.294%, IBM 1.659%, PG 3.06%, XOM 2.486%. In an instant, AAPL would have a dividend yield higher than every one of those stocks and such action I believe would not only put a floor under the stock but could unleash a sharp rally in the shares . At $500 a share with a $20 dividend, the yield would still be a very high %4, higher than all of those listed except INTC. If a dividend increase was announced along with a significant buyback plan, this could really turn the stock around on a dime and i would hazard a guess that the stock could easily return to the $500 range.

That level would not require any repat if you study what i wrote. And the tax is already reflected in the financials. 2. Players buying/owning the shares will be just fine here over time. Now that many have hurled off the back of the boat, S their pants and are writhing, moaning on the floor, we are near the bottom. I'm talking about scalping the shorts -- not "short term investors." 3. I'm not talking about getting fav press for retail aapl investors, and we agree most of the analyst community is not worth following in any sector except for healthcare/biotech. You may not care about the impact of 100% condemnation in the press, but anyone who has managed a large, multinational organization needs to be entirely concerned about that. AAPL pays Foxconn employees double what the Asian makers pay them -- do you read about that anywhere? AAPL is building both real and lip service assembly and data center sites doemstically for employment and sentiment purposes. 4. It is a disaster for employee morale to be slammed as the stock reels when if the story was being better told by the cfo and IR staff the stock would not have dropped below a 10% or so pullback. Those options shares all the engineers have are like "jelly of the month club" coupons when all of them can leave for more comp elsewhere. Many in SV love to hate AAPL -- always been that way -- but all employers want to hire them and good staff when can. Cook and the BOD if Tim doesn't, need to do something decisive on massive excess cash. A $30 div would do THAT.</Msg><Username>squeezetracker</Username><Timestamp>1359229199970</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 14:39:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359229205965-1049</Id><Topic><Title>AAPL WILL BOUNCE MONDAY THEN GET HAMMERED WITH SELLING</Title><Username>dinkhole_poker</Username><Timestamp>1359226056731</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 13:47:36 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>probably right the first thing is to see how high it bounces</Msg><Username>aaplboost</Username><Timestamp>1359229205965</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 14:40:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359229218340-1050</Id><Topic><Title>Make no mistake, Wall did not come all the way down here to not print 375 and show Cook who owns Apple</Title><Username>tommy_loops</Username><Timestamp>1359228206878</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 14:23:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yeah, like you're high school putz self even has an iPad...you're not here when the markets open which makes you a JEuwputz...that's why no one responds to you queereboy.</Msg><Username>blackmonday1987</Username><Timestamp>1359229218340</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 14:40:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359229231931-1051</Id><Topic><Title>What will be the near term low for Apple - my best guess now is anywhere between</Title><Username>ettubrutusad</Username><Timestamp>1359227503760</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 14:11:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Agree with you.

A $40 upward close is not a confirmation of a buy. It could be a hundred reasons, shorts covering, new investors people thinking its low???? That's exactly correct. If it closes up $40 on Monday, and it closes down $5.00 on Tuesday, that's not a buy confirmation. It could close down 20 on Wednesday, the down $5 bucks Tuesday is a wait for Wednesday signal. On Wednesday, after the $5 dip on Tuesday, you would watch the pre-market on Wednesday, and if AAPL opens lower than Tuesday's close, wait, if AAPL opens lower Wednesday than Tuesday's close set your buy limit order at Tuesday's close and let the market come to you. Don't chase the price below Tuesday's close thinking you're getting a better deal than some folks on Monday or Tuesday did. Here's the thing. The $40 up move Monday, signalled a possible buy for Tuesday.

Such an action, i believe could also put a stop to the selling in the stock such that we might hold a low in the 430 range, but ultimately we would need to see some significant announcement on the dividend and or buyback to get the stock moving higher, in my view. I think the concern of long term value players looking at the company is the sustainability of its earnings flow. AAPL's revenues and earnings have only been at these incredible levels for really less than two years. They would prefer to see a longer track record. Growth investors we are told by those reviewing SEC quarterly filings have been leaving the stock in larger numbers. The funny thing is though, for quite a while now AAPL never reached a growth multiple. Compare its PE to GOOG or AMZN or a host of other seasoned tech stocks and it was never close, and certainly not some of the mid and small cap tech stocks. to be continued</Msg><Username>ettubrutusad</Username><Timestamp>1359229904477</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 14:51:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359229910975-1070</Id><Title>ATT CEO announces that they want to stop I Phone subsidies!!!</Title><Msg>Yesterday--Randall Stephenson made announcement that they want to end "I-Pain" by reducing subsidies.</Msg><Username>juanvaldezvaldez</Username><Timestamp>1359229910975</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 14:51:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359229982130-1071</Id><Topic><Title>AAPL WILL BOUNCE MONDAY THEN GET HAMMERED WITH SELLING</Title><Username>dinkhole_poker</Username><Timestamp>1359226056731</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 13:47:36 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>at some point not too far in the future, it should reverse hard and find a trading range between 450 and 500 (maybe even up to 510-520) there is support in the 430 area--even where it is now there`s support but if it breaks below 430-425 there could be a puke out panic that tests 400 not that I really know, but...</Msg><Username>aaplboost</Username><Timestamp>1359229982130</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 14:53:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359230005565-1072</Id><Topic><Title>AAPL WILL BOUNCE MONDAY THEN GET HAMMERED WITH SELLING</Title><Username>dinkhole_poker</Username><Timestamp>1359226056731</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 13:47:36 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I agree some much damage has been done here,that any opportunity to sell will be massive selling</Msg><Username>A Yahoo!

Please keep your personal non stock views to yourself. Here's some off topic help you may use. BTW I am not practicing the Jewish religion, but you still offend me with your ignorance. Disgusting, sounds like you really have a problem that needs to be resolved. Try concentrating on your own beliefs and making your group stronger. Now, I do not totally disagree that the Jewish people go out of their way to support their own before others. They have been very successful in manipulation of the laws, making their religion stronger and getting people in powerful positions. Is that racist? No Sounds like they are successfully organized. Unlike most other religious groups. For example, if the Catholic church had been as organized to support their practitioners pay for their education, lobby for the powerful positions and ensuring the success of each individuals then perhaps there would be an imbalance tilted towards them. Unfortunately, the church is more concerned with how many people they have and the money that that brings into their coffers. BTW, violence towards a particular religious groups is racist, and will not resolve your issue. If you really want to change the situation, you will need to create something like the group. But make sure the leaders are managers, promoters and lobbyist of their people instead of telling them that the meek shall inherit the earth, Gives us your money.

But I did it anyway. No innovation? Slow store traffic? Those are the comments of one with no information and dead wrong. AAPL has now done a S job articulating a simple point to the analysts: FY street for making us look bad when we are kicking butt on innovation, new product rollouts to new markets, opening up new LTE carriers around the world (study the 36 new carriers opened last week alone), all new product line up and new os, aapl stores packed and setting sales records, and iCloud customers rising from ~150m last year to over 250m this year... Faceplant, Fakebook... call it what you want, has rallied almost 100% from the lows 7 weeks ago despite what is fairly remarkable loss of active users in recent months. Yet now, after collapsing some 60% from the ipo price a few months ago, and on the hopeful promises of "monetizing mobile" by a goofy looking, freckle faced, second rate programmer gifted some gadzillions because of his theft of others ideas, Fakebook is suddenly back in favor (fervor?)? I'm not saying AAPL will rally like that, but it certainly would be fundamentally and quatitatively supported -- just ask Lazlo Biryni. It is also very possible it jumps on the 3 phones coming starting in June news bubbling from the China Times today... they tend not to make up things like that if you have studied their record.</Msg><Username>squeezetracker</Username><Timestamp>1359230424165</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 15:00:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359230441009-1083</Id><Topic><Title>What will be the near term low for Apple - my best guess now is anywhere between</Title><Username>ettubrutusad</Username><Timestamp>1359227503760</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 14:11:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>GS is useless - probably worse as a WS shill.

I would say the concern of long term value investors is whether AAPL can continue to hold market share and retain profitability. iPhones are a huge piece of their current revenues and profit, and a value investor would want to know how lasting that can be. There are many competitors - barriers to entry for smart phones do not seem that high. Can AAPL hold off the competitors with a superior product where they continue to garner the lions share of the profits. That is a big question going forward. From what I had first read a year or so ago, I thought AAPL would have been able to hold them off at least in the US via patent infringement, but that apparently is not happening. continued</Msg><Username>ettubrutusad</Username><Timestamp>1359231447560</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 15:17:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359231506151-1120</Id><Title>Applenanke</Title><Msg>How is the S&amp;P, DOW and Nasdaq pushing all time highs? 1.

Funds were sitting on 100%-700% gains as this touched $700 and they took that money and invested in in companies like Facebook, Rimm, Netflix, Amazon, and all kinds of other companies that don't even deserve to be mentioned in the same breath as Apple. 2.

People are clearly disappointed. Below is a summary of analyst’s estimates and actual results. Category Analysts Estimates Apple Results Revenue 54.74 B 54.51 B EPS 13.45 13.81 iphones 47.6 MM 47.8 MM ipads 24 MM 22.9 MM Why are people disappointed? Apple was a high growth company growing 60-80% a year and suddenly it has slowed down to 15-30% and that has everyone scared and confused. Below I lay out the last 3 years Q1 Year over Year % increase in the 4 most important areas for Apple. You can see the decrease in momentum is alarming. Category 2013 2012 2011 Revenue 18% 73% 71% EPS -0.4% 116% 75% iphones 29% 128% 86% ipads 48% 110% N.A. It’s pretty stark. Apple is decelerating fast. Is Apple still a great company with a bright future? Yes, but it will be a slower growing company with up and down quarters. It is no longer the company that originally attracted me; a company growing 100% a year selling for 13 times earnings. Can Apple accelerate its earnings growth again? Yes, it can. The iTV or China Mobile could reignite Apple. For the time being, Apple is a company with slowing growth. I have devoted 100% of my time following Apple and investing in it. I love this company and I love its products. The company no longer warrants 100% of my time. I will join my wife and begin trading 5-10 stocks like I did before I got involved with Apple. Apple will be on my list so it will get at least 10% of my time. I will not comment on Apple nearly as much because I will not study or research it like I did. I will not keep up the comment section because it obviously takes up so much of my time. I may or may not comment on what I am doing as a more active trader in the future. I said Q1 earnings would give us the truth and it did. I accept it.</Msg><Username>jeanwekillstoxx</Username><Timestamp>1359232255657</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 15:30:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359232357705-1141</Id><Title>Projected Trading Range</Title><Msg>Very infrequent poster/often-amused reader of these Yahoo boards. Coming from a pretty strong and long background of conservative investing, I think the near-term will bring a bounce off of this capitulation back up to something around $500, and then the stock will have to fall again to re-test this low around $440-450. If it breaks that, it could foreseeably get to $425 but I don't suspect it will go much lower. What I DO know, from a Keynesian perspective, is that almost every time you see dire headlines en masse from the media, that's a pretty good time to invest in a strong company.</Msg><Username>A Yahoo!

First off they dont' pay me the what the current market is and they NOT only cheat you that way but they also make you work more houres without extra pay. When you reached your goal they originally set for you they purposely raise the target the following time to the point it's unachievable so you wouldn't get your bonus. I have NOTHING against JEWs but this is a fact. They never even once sent me to training like they originally said they would so that they could save on air fare and hotel costs. The turnover in our office has been ongoing. Most people only stay for about 6 to 8 months due to tightness of management and unnecessary restrictions.

Can they continue to sell phones at the current rates or greater or is the world-wide high end market saturated? Smart phones are still such a young device in terms of public use. What is the life expectancy of a phone - how often will users turn it over for a new one. If AAPl comes out with a lower priced version to compete directly with Samsung's galaxy, one that has a larger screen, who knows, if they can still hang onto the high end. But if eps did fall back to the $20-25 range, that would obviously bring the stock down considerably. But it is far too early to say one way or the other. So much can happen , good or bad, in a year's time in the life a competitive technology company.</Msg><Username>ettubrutusad</Username><Timestamp>1359232598349</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 15:36:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359232619437-1151</Id><Topic><Title>Growth and INNOVATION is what drives stock prices higher.. understand newbie apple shareholders and bagholders</Title><Username>dr_horny_goat_weed</Username><Timestamp>1359232076370</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 15:27:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>if you're smart.. use any rally or dead cat bounce to get out.</Msg><Username>dr_horny_goat_weed</Username><Timestamp>1359232619437</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 15:36:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359232675650-1152</Id><Topic><Title>YHOO finally got a true Internet CEO</Title><Username>goingbravo</Username><Timestamp>1359221239117</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 12:27:19 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I have no doubt whatsoever; she can do it, just basing it to her very knowledgeable responds to those interview questions.

Yahoo already has the search engine foundation for what Apple would need to compete with Google with. Yahoo is still way undervalued , specially when they still own the 23% stake in alibaba, and with yahoo japan.

It appears that AAPL is forming another chart pattern inside the Head &amp; Shoulders. It is the Descending Broadening Wedge shaped like a megaphone tilted down. The top trendline is located at 530 and the bottom is located at 350 at this time. If AAPL should reach 350, my guess is that it will bounce back up . If AAPL then breaks through the top trendline, target is about 1000 to 1050. I also stated there is an open gap at 420. Gaps are filled 95% of time. AAPL also left a $39 gap between 504 and 465. That gap must also be filled. Mr Market does not like open gaps on its charts, and it will not forget that one either. GLTA and please remember to trade with the trend. It will keep you safe.

You're micro focusing too much and things look bad at the moment - short term. The stock price is going to come back. Within a few months, all of this will disappear. There is nothing fundamentally wrong with the company, This is not Enron or a Ponzi scheme where there is some major accounting scandal or company scam. Stocks go up and down, sometimes dramatically. But APPLE is fundamentally sound and for years to come. That's the big picture. The key here is to hold the stock and wait for some catalyst to come along to drive the stock back up. A dead cat bounce / oversold condition will occur soon probably next week, Probable stock buyback &amp; an increase in dividend next, within a few weeks in mid-February after the board meets, then product anticipation, rumors and actual announcements next in the middle of the year. Its easy to get caught up with the short term terrible looking situation. It has every reason to improve and we're beginning the bottoming process now.

Wall Street will get back in around 150 maybe even 200.00. In the mean time it will just slowly fall and fall. Sometime it will go up because there is a Bankster / Fund manager that will set a trap and you will lose some more money. Needless to say I am out. Good luck it you are in AAPL, YOU WILL NEED IT IN A BIG WAY. AAPL will drop another 200 or even 300 points / Bucks before it is over. Then it will be another value Company…. How did I come to this Simple it is Down 85% in Global sales, AAPL has real competition now where 3 years ago they did not have really any anyone with that type of phone. See you guy and gals at 150.00. You do know that Wall Street wants you to buy some they can sell. The Party is over.</Msg><Username>edgibson151</Username><Timestamp>1359234925119</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 16:15:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359234932741-1230</Id><Topic><Title>Third day of not eatting or drinking</Title><Username>kevincurley987</Username><Timestamp>1359223158033</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 12:59:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>AAPL is a great company but in the short term the price will continue downward, that is the trend.

But now the stock and maybe the company is at a crossroad. Innovation in their space going forward may be things that barely move the dial. This is what happens eventually in any given tech space and with any given device or family of devices. So now is it just a battle about market share in the smartphone arena, ability to retain and grow market share and if so at what cost to margins.

AAPL actually beat earnings this quarter and with one less week in the quarter. Also, they would have had 2 billion of additional revenues if it weren't for supply constraints. Do you understand that AAPL only has 17% of the global smart phone market share? Do you understand that AAPL currently trades at 7 times trailing earnings less $145.00 of cash? Do you understand that AAPl will have close to $200.00 a share in cash by the end of this year, which means the market is giving AAPL's entire business an enterprise value of 200 billion? That's slightly over 1 times 2013 revenues. Do you know how ridiculously irrational and stupid that is? You're comparison to MSFT is bush league and clearly displays you last of understanding of the comparison. MSFT at its peak was very close to market saturation, had a monopoly, and traded at a huge p/e relative to growth. AAPL TODAY trades at a 50% discount to MSFT's stock after MSFT's big pull back. So, by your analogy, AAPL should be selling for about 800.00.

It's now selling for a lower price than lost companies who are trapped in the past and thus possess a shakey future (e.g. Microsoft). Apple is the leader in a 'future looks very bright' market -- a market that is responsible for destructing the previous dominant market segment: a.k.a. PC's. Moreover, Wall Street is viewing a lower cost phone as an Apple desperation play. They are missing the point since the idea is to lock-in as many people in the world into Apple's ecosystem as quickly as possible. Software and services is where the long-term and profitable future lies, not in the devices themselves, and creating an effective competitive moat is a means to distance ones self from the competition. Based on these facts I feel quite confident in arguing that Apple is extremely cheap and, based on conservative valuation metrics, deserves at least a PE of 12 (probably fairer at 15) after pulling out their $125 worth of cash. A super conservative 2013 earnings estimate of $40/share puts the stock at $605. I would also argue that investor sentiment is so terribly low that ANY positive news surprise at this point will result in a just-as-rapid turnaround in Apple's stock price. Next week's MacWorld may just be the initial venue for such news so we'll see. If not, the upside surprise will come soon since Apple cannot afford to have their top talent poached by the Google's and Facebook's -- and especially Samsung's, of the world. Lastly, I think it is a huge mistake, and unfair at such an early point, to put Tim Cook out to pasture so quickly.

AAPL has $137 billion in cash and investments, or some $145 a share.</Msg><Username>ericshinisbig</Username><Timestamp>1359236104790</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 16:35:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359236122859-1261</Id><Topic><Title>Samsung was the innovator with the 5“screen, Cook will never copy it.</Title><Username>profiteer</Username><Timestamp>1359235792865</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 16:29:52 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>where are they touting that they will have cheaper iphone for china? although i think it would be great for the stock. i have only seen that they will NOT be doing that.</Msg><Username>kpwoodward</Username><Timestamp>1359236122859</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 16:35:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359236172232-1262</Id><Topic><Title>I have never seen a companie's stock fall from grace so fast...the manipulation by the media is unprecendented...</Title><Username>blackmonday1987</Username><Timestamp>1359236068943</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 16:34:28 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The only manipulation by the media was on the way up...not down.</Msg><Username>jzandmebuddies</Username><Timestamp>1359236172232</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 16:36:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359236214324-1263</Id><Topic><Title>Easy money...... short till $350</Title><Username>uneed2thinkagain</Username><Timestamp>1359235920221</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 16:32:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I've been shorting sice $510........will continue until $370's.

I believe that the TV is coming first. The camera in the iPhone will get better, but it will be a standalone camera that will be the big deal. Putting a better camera in an iPhone would drive incrementally more sales, but a revolutionary standalone camera creates a new market. There are physical limits as to what can be done with a camera module within the size constraints of an iPhone. There needs to be a larger form factor to contain the imaging chips and optics required for the amazing feats that Apple is pulling off. Expect an iOS standalone camera with wi-fi and optional cellular. Most current apps will work with the camer with little change. There will be revolutionary new ways to capture pictures and videos of utmost quality. Apps galore will be made to take advantage of the new camera features. Full iCloud integration. Expect tens of millions of people to opt to pay for larger iCloud storage plans as the easy and safety of not having to manage and/or backup your photos makes the storage cost extremely compelling. New social platform to based upon image sharing. Complete integration with the new TV to make it ultra easy to view/share/manage your images and videos.</Msg><Username>lesspheus</Username><Timestamp>1359236228273</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 16:37:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359236296507-1265</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft crashed from 60.00 down to 20.00 (stuck at 20.00-30.00 for over a decade)</Title><Username>dr_horny_goat_weed</Username><Timestamp>1359233447837</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 15:50:47 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>High five</Msg><Username>wait4itorsell</Username><Timestamp>1359236296507</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 16:38:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359236324417-1266</Id><Topic><Title>Another Horrible Weekend ahead, if you are like me and long.... .

But in the end, lesson learned, take your money when you make 15% or more, wait, see the trend and invest accordingly. I make a ton of money in AAPL and thought I knew what I was doing. How wrong.

That results in software revenues around $300 million per month, and future sales will grow exponentially, just as iTunes media sales have enjoyed compounded growth as its users shop the App Store via recommendations. The "new Apple," Chowdhry notes, "is not about new hardware. it's about software attach rates." Analysts tracking Apple's revenues will need to consider download volumes, the frequency of sales, and in app purchases. "Existing Apple analysts, if they don't come from a software background, will be missing a key ingredient," Chowdhry said. Apple's software revenues appear set to enjoy compounded growth of 30 percent over each of the next five years Chowdhry stated. In the US, iPhone users already spend $80 on average over the life of their phone, a significant addition to the hardware profit Apple earns on the original sale.</Msg><Username>catchawave57</Username><Timestamp>1359236721578</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 16:45:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359236739464-1281</Id><Topic><Title>Now We Verys Depressed.

And it's all about future guidance and growth. It could also be that there was simply nowhere for the price to go from 700 except down, and as hedge funds shed their shares, the selling accelerated. Same thing happens to large companies once they're matured.. Just like microsoft peaked in the late 90's.. Look at Margins again. 2 qtrs back, 44%. Last qtr, 40.5%. This last qtr, down to 38.7%.. The markets are forward looking, aside from being criminal, and their margins are getting squeezed by competitors.. And it certainly didn't help to roll out a new iphone, 5, with a #$%$ Maps App..

Additionally, we're in times where the Fed and our Gov't seem to think that they have to artificially stimulate growth, and what happens when you take out the stimulus..? You have bubbles and crashes, ans stocks go with them... Nothing goes up forever, never did.

Margins falling to 37.5-38.5 and maybe even lower is really going to cut into their EPS. iPad mini pacman eating iPad alive as well. 22.9 million iPads sold last quarter, but how many were the higher priced iPads and not the lower margin iPad minis? I say around 11.7 mil.; that's a drop from 15.4 mil sold from yr ago quarter. Apple bulls better hope the lower margin (30ish%?) iPad minis blow the !@#$ outta the competition, and bring in the big $$$. q-o-q growth: Americas: 15%; Europe: 11%; Greater China: 67%; Japan: 25%; Rest of Asia Pacific: 10%; Retail: 5%.

The company is on its way to making it back this year but its price has quite a long ways to go, though I am in it now. They crash stocks like this based upon future earnings growth estimates, it just happens that most don't think Apple will grow much and without anything interesting coming out this year an Apple missing its forecasted quarterlies for I think the third time in a row (sorry if I am wrong on this) everyone has decided that its spectacular growth is a thing of the past. It may have money but it will likely be needing that money to pull itself up again. People don't seem that excited about its smart tv that is around year away and many don't think its stores are set up to even handle selling tvs. Apple's PE looks very attractive but it looks attractive cause the investors don't think its going to grow that well anymore. It doesn't help that many of its investors have decided to turn away from Apple products after this drop.</Msg><Username>massages_by_adam</Username><Timestamp>1359240163890</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 17:42:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359240221838-1385</Id><Topic><Title>Maybe Im wrong but I like Apples P/E</Title><Username>fron70</Username><Timestamp>1359239984750</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 17:39:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How do you like your P &amp; L?</Msg><Username>vogue1254</Username><Timestamp>1359240221838</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 17:43:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359240235996-1386</Id><Topic><Title>Why should the stock value less than from the same time last year when profit actually went up &amp; more cash in the bank?</Title><Username>cantkeepbookstraight</Username><Timestamp>1359238997545</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 17:23:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>435 was a brick wall on Friday.

That’s so last season! Apple will release three upgraded iPhones by the end of the year — despite launching its latest model just four months ago — tech analysts and Chinese newspapers report.Two of the new models — the iPhone 5S and a first-of-its-kind low-budget iPhone — are due out by June, according to the China Times.The third device, a larger-screened iPhone 6 with a 12-pixel camera, could be available by Christmas, analysts say.The business move may be coming because Apple is feeling demand from folks who can’t afford smartphones, Wall Street tech market analyst Peter Misek told The Post. He also said the Samsung-style look of a big screen is gaining popularity. “A large percent of the population wants bigger screens — so there’s a demand for that and it’s hurting them,” Misek said.Misek — who correctly predicted past iPhone features— said he is “confident” that the iPhone 5s will have an 8-megapixel camera and will hit shops by June. He also said the company’s “affordable” $250 iPhone will be heavier and made of polycarbonate material. The iPhone 6 will likely feature a 4.8 inch screen, he said.The move is unusual for Apple, which has in the past released only one iPhone per year.Natalie Harrison, a spokeswoman for Apple, refused to offer details about any in-the-works products.</Msg><Username>dhmunoz1220</Username><Timestamp>1359240240762</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 17:44:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359240247850-1388</Id><Topic><Title>BOYCOTT CNBC!</Title><Username>sameas55</Username><Timestamp>1359222162530</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 12:42:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Tell me what other company can make a billion dollars in profit per week. that is a lot of money.

That brings the real trailing PE down to around 7.1. That's the PE of slug growth companies such as utilities which traditionaly grow at the yearly GDP. However, XLU is selling with a PE of 14 and large debt to cash. Which is a better buy? AAPL at PE 7.1 (after no debt and cash) and 2.4% dividend yield that has the potential to increase dividends or XLU at PE 14 (with plenty of debt after cash) and 4.14% dividend yield.

Do some math, the impact of a couple million shares being bought back will make a barely noticeable impact on the EPS and, even though tiny, it would be upwards so no reason to drop guidance. Last quarter's 2 billion dollar buyback resulted in a net reduction of 1 million shares (thanks of course to the dilution from employee based stock compensation). But lets say it's 10 million shares, that reduces the share count from around 990 million to 980 million. What would that do to EPS? Impact on last quarters EPS? About 15 cents a share...certainly nothing that is going to materially impact the share price.</Msg><Username>tkell31</Username><Timestamp>1359241193504</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 17:59:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359241229755-1422</Id><Topic><Title>AEA CALLED IT CORRECTLY.

If you followed the AH tape there was a direct correlation to when apple guided revenue and talked about giving a range that was more in line with given parameters of estimates. The market took that to mean apple will no longer be sandbagging so the revenue guidance was more in line with the reality and thus indicted they would be missing next qtr. Growth investors ran for the hills and went to greener pastures which proved to be the right move, ie look at Rimm, Netflix and even Google. Apple is in Limbo as the market is going to stay away until they give a clear sign that growth is coming back. If that is not the case Apple must go to plan B and attract value investors with buybacks and dividend increases. Personally I think they can attract value investors now and growth investors later in the year when new products arrive. Apple may not care to do that and so we suffer in the short term and my calls expire worthless.</Msg><Username>ditzil</Username><Timestamp>1359241554915</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 18:05:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359241578158-1433</Id><Topic><Title>earnings was a reasonable increase over their last year's blow out quarter.</Title><Username>soooooooooosincere</Username><Timestamp>1359239757347</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 17:35:57 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This year's Christmas quarter was amazing, all things considered. Apple sold about 4 million iPhones per week. Add an extra week, like they had last year, and you end up with 52 million iPhones sold. Add in the missed 1-1.5 billion from the lack of the iMac supply and add in another billion or so from the iPad mini supply constraints. Had everything aligned, (extra week like last year and supply met) you'd be looking at about a $15-$16 quarter. Using this knowledge, you know that, in the future, if Apple is able to iron out the supply chain, and add a few carriers, you can anticipate a $15+ quarter next Christmas. Add in a China Mobile deal and a possible iTV, and that number probably closes in on $20.</Msg><Username>scropos21</Username><Timestamp>1359241578158</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 18:06:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359241605364-1434</Id><Topic><Title>BUDDY WHO WORKS ON WS SAYS MARGIN CALLS BECAUSE OF AAPL COLLAPSE ARE STAGGERING</Title><Username>smell_my_boil_puss</Username><Timestamp>1359241232816</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 18:00:32 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This is the most important post I have seen on this board today, and this is just as I had expected.

Read why. Very funny story.</Title><Msg>If you have this weekend's WSJ, check page B1 for the whole story . I can recap the story here. Basically many WS firms sold "Structured Bond linking to AAPL stock" to super conservative bond buyers. The rules are 1. The bond is actually one year note. You paid $700 upfront. In the end of one year, you get your principal $700 back if AAPL stays above $700 at that time. 2. If AAPL drops below $700, you get one share of AAPL instead, no matter what the AAPL share price is. 3. This bond pays 10% annual interest rate by month. The fee is 2% so the effective interest rate is 8%. The pitch to the public is that AAPL is the safest stock. It will stay above $700 so it is almost risk free bond paying high interest. By comparison, one year note (normal one) only pays 1% annual interest. It seems to be too good to be true to get 10% interest so bond buyers piled in to thank these Wall Street firms to let them buy these special structured bonds. According to WSJ, about $800 millions of such instrument were sold when AAPL was peaked at $700 to $705 in September. Now these bond holders accidentally bought AAPL shares at $700 LAST WEEK. LOL. WSJ said these people will be constantly AAPL sellers because of their conservative nature. And there is no way AAPL can get back to $700 in September 2013. These people have been put shares of AAPL last week when AAPL dropped 20%.</Msg><Username>blust35442</Username><Timestamp>1359241628904</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 18:07:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359241709806-1437</Id><Title>iTunes and interest earnings PE IS 20</Title><Msg>If everything dies they have a growing iTunes platform and could get 5 % increase on cash it would be $17 a year EPS.

Apple told you what to expect and they seldom if ever miss their own estimates. It's the analysts who are the problem. Those guys (and gals) are throwing darts. The game is obvious to anyone willing to open their eyes. The analyst's job is to inflate estimates and expectations so that hedge funds can come in and short with impunity. The result is that long term investors are damaged and prospects for the company to attract new investment capital are limited.

It will be a LOT easier for Apple to go from the high end users to the lower end users than it will be for Android/Windows/Samsung to go from the lower end users to the higher end users. Apple has the high end users "locked in" to their ecosystem. In most cases, people have hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars locked into iTunes, Apps, iPods, etc. It would take an absolutely astounding technology for them to leave all of this behind and go start over with no apps, music, etc. Now you might think that a matching music service from Amazon is a threat, but that's not necessarily the case. People have an emotional attachment to money spent, and they tend to stay where their money is invested and familiarity lies. The lower end users? They have virtually nothing invested, and the temptation to hold something they were never able to afford (an iPhone at a lower price) will likely see many defectors. In short, Apple has a far easier road to hoe than Windows/Samsung/Android. You might wonder why I didn't mention RIM. They're simply not worth mentioning.

A 100% hike is dreaming, but they need to do more than the 10-14% or so their plan allows for. 25% would immediately make the stock much more appealing to income investors especially at this level and would provide strong support for the stock. They made their initial announcement in March so my guess is they will announce the increase in March as well. That would make the end of Feb a good time to buy.</Msg><Username>tkell31</Username><Timestamp>1359242266262</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 18:17:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359242289866-1464</Id><Topic><Title>Juews are the most racist pigs on the planet.

You should always invest in the future not the past. So, why the shrinking margins? Here's some food for thought. Last quarter AAPL gave back $4.5 billion in stock repurchases and dividends, with just shy of one billion shares, they gave back $4.5 dollars a share. A year ago that number was zero. With the CFO stating that AAPL will give back $45 billion over the next year, $7.5 billion of repurchases which the company still has authorization to use right now, and $2.5 billion in dividends payable for Q1. These are the things that everyone was screaming about, spend money, I think they should have just done a repurchase, but AAPL is doing what everyone was asking them to do which in doing so shrinks margins. They have increased their inventory by double from last year to about $1.5 billion. Bears will say that is proof that their product isn't in demand. Based on the numbers AAPL released the only product lines shrinking in sales were IMacs, a recent article stated that there is a 2-3 week waiting period for IMacs due to supply constraints. So, that suggests that the one product not included in the increase of inventory is the one that isn't selling very well. There are also more products being produced at once, suggesting that the increase in inventory is due to more production, not less demand. They also increased their quarterly R&amp;D expense by about 33% to over a billion dollars. Everyone should be happy with this, because it spells innovation.

EPS is not going to drop more as a percentage than the margin decrease and that doesnt even factor in the revenue increase. Anyone who thinks EPS will drop 25 to 30% based on the provided guidance cant do basic math. They "gave back" 2.5 billion in Dividends. The 2 billion in share buybacks went to offset the dilution with the share count down a mere 1 million. People counting on the buyback will be disappointed unless they significantly increase the amount they spend on it, but I think that would be better spent on increasing the dividend. I do agree based on what we know now $600 will not be back any time soon if ever. However, with a cheaper iphone rumored, and a growing ecosystem they can potentially monetize I wouldnt count it out.</Msg><Username>tkell31</Username><Timestamp>1359243772197</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 18:42:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359243798437-1515</Id><Topic><Title>AAPL LONGS ARE JUST STUPID KIDS PLAYING OFFICE...</Title><Username>sheepskinner6</Username><Timestamp>1359243200999</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 18:33:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>whether you did or didn't short at 700 *and your credibility is non-existent* is beside the point your post just exudes major stupidity.

If you think you've got it bad, you won't have it as bad as the people that panic-sold and/or sold because of margin calls as day-after-day they have to glance at the TV screen daily and watch the stock tick higher.

That’s a violation… But you do it anyway because the SEC doesn’t understand it,” said Cramer speaking of his strategy of falsely presenting a stock as ‘down.’ Cramer spoke of making use of the media and news establishment to ‘report’ information about companies and encourage the development of stories which may not have hit significant coverage to build favorable reputations for his companies or stocks. Much of Cramer’s technique seems to involve using his exposure and influence in media circles — particularly his operation of the ‘adviser’ show, Mad Money — to create opinions which are complex enough the SEC cannot enforce them as strict fomenting. One of the basic strategies of Cramer’s fomenting, he said, was, that in the situation a hedge fund (such as his own) was holding a short position in a company which reported excellent quarterly news, the fund would call up brokerage houses and either feed them bad news / blatant lies, or order a huge set of short sales — suggesting that investor confidence in the company was falling. The slew of bad news would create a temporary fall long enough for the manager to resolve his short position and conclude a tidy profit. Cramer refused to talk about some of his techniques, saying he was “not going to say it on TV.” Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne, said the CNBC reporters used this technique to spread lies and rumors about his company, combined with a slew of bad / false financial reports and analysis around the Internet and otherwise. Many analysts are suggesting that much of the CNBC enterprise and Jim Cramer’s specifically success came from a strong understanding of how to control the system — control the news, you control the stock. “We had it down to a science in 1992: my wife would pick stocks that technically looked ready to go up, or she would keep track of merchandise to see what was down to tag ends.

Apple invented the smartphone. Google frantically copied it shortly after then Google's CEO, Eric Schmidt, was scared to death when, while attending an Apple Board meeting, quickly realized that Google's entire fat-profit advertising model would eventually be hi-jacked as Apple's iOS enticed the world to use smart phones rather then PC's (talk about a massive breech of fiduciary responsibility by a Board member -a.k.a. 'Spy'!). This is also why Google gave Android away to the world for free. In doing so they, whether intended or not, screwed the U.S. by providing far-behind mega Asian competitors the (stolen) formula to greatly dilute and ultimately stall the Apple invention machine. This is why Apple is relentlessly suing Samsung over IP infringement. If reasonably successful, they will have the court rulings needed to pursue Google next since Android essentially infringes on Apple's IP (i.e. iOS). As I had alluded to previously, Apple's slowly shinking device margins will be more than made up for with their rapidly increasing high margin new services and software/Apps/iTunes/TV/etc., etc. DZ</Msg><Username>denzerini</Username><Timestamp>1359244253571</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 18:50:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359244274788-1531</Id><Topic><Title>Why should the stock value less than from the same time last year when profit actually went up &amp; more cash in the bank?</Title><Username>cantkeepbookstraight</Username><Timestamp>1359238997545</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 17:23:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Some people just dont seem to get it Revenue in the second quarter 2012 grew about 55% from second quarter 2011.

First, Aapl broke out of a year long Head and Shoulders pattern, and once the neckline was broken around 510-520, it was a green light to sell, and sell massively. You'll hear analysts say that their chart is technically destroyed and that's what they're referring to. 2nd, Look at a 5yr chart and the rise to 705 could be referred to as a parabolic burst pattern. These are technically the scariest if you're long the stock. Price action tends to revert to its mean, or where the whole move started, and that was @ 420. In fact, manny PB's end up dropping BELOW the mean to the next support level, which is 390. that's why you keep hearing that number. Check out a 5yr chart of Cien and Jdsu, you'll see what i mean.. 3rd, Gap fills. Gap ups or downs tend to fill over time. When a stock is moving up or down, price tends to move towards previous support and resistance levels. There's a gap to fill down to 420, doesn't mean it's a guarantee to go there just yet, but i think it'll eventually fill... Personally, i think 420 will be the bottom here, strong support there, but u just never know. And don't get excited if you see a big jump in the price soon, it'll just be a short covering rally, that's how all reversal moves start, then buyers follow. But once shorts are done covering and the volume on the buy-side dries up, it'll be another excellent short entry. I'm short and hope for one more down day and will close my puts. I'm not greedy, i don't need to see 420, just want to lock in $'s. I'll then wait for a pop to peter out and take a new short position.. Sorry, but that's the ways of the market, cant. This is no longer a growth stock, more a value play. Long term, the price may get back to 500 but i don't see anything above that... Don't fall in love with stocks, there's 1500 hundred others to research. I think Facebook is a very good long term play.

I commend Tim Cook for not caving, and keeping their cash horde to create future products I can't wait to see! Tim Cook realizes that AAPL is no longer at Wall Street's beckon call; their huge cash position, and overflowing free cash flow, allows them to do what they want no matter what their market capitalization is; market capitalization is just a number, as many investors just learned; yes, Wall Street is now in its whining stage, but that will soon end, as real investors will scoop up greatly depreciated shares. All of this nonsense that Wall Street and its talking head, CNBC, concocted is deplorable, and AAPL will rise from the ashes (LOL) to again take its rightful spot as Americas most valuable company. Great quarter, Tim! Steve would be proud of you! He would be even more proud of you for not caving to Wall Street's shake down, especially with your enviable cash position! Let's see some real investors who want to BUY shares, not option players, come in and take back this company from the clutches of CNBC, NOW!!! Even Buffett might want some shares at this level!

First, 40 is probably the top end of the range. EPS next quarter is dropping from 12.3 to 10.5, do you think 3rd and 4th quarters will avoid similar reductions? Second, with 7% revenue growth next quarter they are looking a lot more like a value investment than a growth investment so a PE of 10 is probably fair given the lower than average dividend. I have yet to see a market add in the cash on a value company. Absent better guidance for the 3rd/4th qtr, a big increase to the dividend, or a new product release $380 is probably a better estimate. Granted that seems low, but after an EPS decrease for the first time in years if guidance for the third qtr is not significantly better there will be more selling. I'm a buyer at 400...and will probably buy before March in the hopes they do announce a big dividend increase, but Apple has a lot of work to do to get back above 500</Msg><Username>tkell31</Username><Timestamp>1359246874656</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 19:34:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359246902814-1596</Id><Topic><Title>I TRULY BELIEVE THAT IF AAPL DROPS $10 MONDAY PEOPLE WILL KILL THEMSELVES</Title><Username>i_eat_ear_wax</Username><Timestamp>1359242128035</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 18:15:28 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Troll post</Msg><Username>troll_prevention_taskforce</Username><Timestamp>1359246902814</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 19:35:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359246921225-1597</Id><Topic><Title>I TRULY BELIEVE THAT IF AAPL DROPS $10 MONDAY PEOPLE WILL KILL THEMSELVES</Title><Username>i_eat_ear_wax</Username><Timestamp>1359242128035</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 18:15:28 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Troll post</Msg><Username>troll_prevention_taskforce</Username><Timestamp>1359246921225</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 19:35:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359246940157-1598</Id><Topic><Title>I TRULY BELIEVE THAT IF AAPL DROPS $10 MONDAY PEOPLE WILL KILL THEMSELVES</Title><Username>i_eat_ear_wax</Username><Timestamp>1359242128035</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 18:15:28 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Troll post</Msg><Username>troll_prevention_taskforce</Username><Timestamp>1359246940157</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 19:35:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359246972758-1599</Id><Topic><Title>Stock Price w/ China Deal?</Title><Username>brock_templeman</Username><Timestamp>1359245815021</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 19:16:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>could be close.

First the iPhone has better margins than the other products. Second it's not like they are going to just build the same phone and charge less. It will be made of cheaper components.

Here’s my math. • revenue between $41 billion and $43 billion • gross margin between 37.5 percent and 38.5 percent • operating expenses between $3.8 billion and $3.9 billion • other income/(expense) of $350 million • tax rate of 26%' So, let’s go with the high side first, $43 billion 43 billion x 38.5% = 16,555,000,000 (higher gross margin) 16,555,000,000 – 3.8 billion = 12,755,000,000 (minus lower operating expense) 12,755,000,000 + 350,000,000 = 13,105,000,000 (add other income) 13,105,000,000 * 74 % = 9,697,700,000 (taxed at 26%) 9,697,700,000 / 939,060,000 = 10.33 High side (divided by shares outstanding) Now let’s go to the low side. 41 billion x 37.5% = 15,375,000,000 (lower gross margin) 15,375,000,000 – 3.9 billion = 11,475,000,000 (minus higher operating expense) 11,475,000,000 +350,000,000 = 11,825,000,000 (add other income) 11,825,000,000 * 74% = 8,750,500,000 (taxed at 26%) 8,750,500,000 / 939,060,000 = 9.3 low side (divided by shares outstanding) So, I was wrong, based on these numbers it will be $9.30-10.33. I am not saying that it won’t be higher, but when a company that missed street estimates three quarters in a row, then says they are setting estimates at more realistic numbers, not conservative like before, I am planning on listening to them.</Msg><Username>wait4itorsell</Username><Timestamp>1359248285004</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 19:58:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359248326992-1649</Id><Title>APPLE EMPLOYEES ABANDONING SHIP</Title><Msg>From the 10-Q The Company’s stock price is subject to volatility.

These calls must be met - that is, the investor must make an adequate deposit of money or marginable securities to satisfy maintenance margin requirements - on the settlement date of the transaction that triggered it, usually three days after the trade date. If the maintenance margin requirement has not been covered by five days after the settlement date, the account can be frozen. The funds can come from a deposit or from cash dividends, earned interest or liquidation of securities in the account.</Msg><Username>pmcsierra</Username><Timestamp>1359248920705</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 20:08:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359248922324-1676</Id><Topic><Title>longs ask yourselves</Title><Username>ny_nyyankee</Username><Timestamp>1359248782565</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 20:06:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You are in denial.

Lets by clear, you could add up the profits of all the other mobility hardware companies in the world over the last 10 years, and they do not surpass APPL. Most mobility hardware companies have been forced to give their products away at cost, in a failed effort to gain a foothold in the market. Almost all have failed miserably. Samsung sells far more devices that APPL, yet makes a small fraction of the profits that APPL makes. This recent sell off aside, AAPL is one of the most amazing companies in the history of the world. They have unquestionably changed the tech sector forever. In the rest of your life, you are unlikely to see this level of sector dominance ever achieved again. I heard an analyst on Thursday say that APPL turned out to be just another hardware company, whose product was easily commoditized. He welcomed APPL to the new reality of RIMM, and set a $50 price target by 2015. As if APPL was ever just RIMM. To that analyst, I would point out that APPL was the company, even during the great recession, that made my generation of disciplined investors economically self sufficient. Every generation has a company, and a stock, that defines it. Mine was APPL. I First bought it in late 2008, for $85 per share, and have long since sold it, and realized my profits. I made a vow to myself to always hold on to a single share, as a reminder to myself of what the PERFECT investment opportunity should look like. With any luck, I may yet find another opportunity as good as APPL in 2008, though I certainly don't count on it. Truly childish and silly!</Msg><Username>gtucker7848</Username><Timestamp>1359249390082</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 20:16:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359249430548-1694</Id><Topic><Title>Apple should buy Yahoo</Title><Username>biggille815</Username><Timestamp>1359248376256</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 19:59:36 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It came out all brown and gooey</Msg><Username>sheepskinner6</Username><Timestamp>1359249430548</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 20:17:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359249470960-1695</Id><Topic><Title>Funny, all the bashers/pumpers here are 70 yrs old, typing in CAPS...</Title><Username>golfrattt2000</Username><Timestamp>1359249133638</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 20:12:13 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Im working the night shift at 7-11 and can only post when I sneak into the bathroom with my iphone.

That’s so last season! Apple will release three upgraded iPhones by the end of the year — despite launching its latest model just four months ago — tech analysts and Chinese newspapers report. Two of the new models — the iPhone 5S and a first-of-its-kind low-budget iPhone — are due out by June, according to the China Times. The third device, a larger-screened iPhone 6 with a 12-pixel camera, could be available by Christmas, analysts say. The business move may be coming because Apple is feeling demand from folks who can’t afford smartphones, Wall Street tech market analyst Peter Misek told The Post. He also said the Samsung-style look of a big screen is gaining popularity. “A large percent of the population wants bigger screens — so there’s a demand for that and it’s hurting them,” Misek said. Misek — who correctly predicted past iPhone features— said he is “confident” that the iPhone 5s will have an 8-megapixel camera and will hit shops by June. He also said the company’s “affordable” $250 iPhone will be heavier and made of polycarbonate material. The iPhone 6 will likely feature a 4.8 inch screen, he said. The move is unusual for Apple, which has in the past released only one iPhone per year. Natalie Harrison, a spokeswoman for Apple, refused to offer details about any in-the-works products.</Msg><Username>supracmdrr</Username><Timestamp>1359251560890</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 20:52:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359251647918-1761</Id><Topic><Title>Big News From China Check it out</Title><Username>marketguru111</Username><Timestamp>1359209343217</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 09:09:03 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sorry Shortie,you had better cover soon,a lot of phones will be sold in China,maybe some margins will be cut but Nokia is finished,AAPL back to $550 soon..</Msg><Username>supracmdrr</Username><Timestamp>1359251647918</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 20:54:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359251668506-1762</Id><Topic><Title>I am up 37% shorting this stock at around 700.00 and I hope the share price goes down again next week.</Title><Username>raystock48079</Username><Timestamp>1359248555683</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 20:02:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You all must be sorry losers.

They have the tradition, the culture and the money to continue innovating. They can afford and retain the most brilliant minds to come up with excellent products. I went to China recently, and everybody I spoke with seemed really interested in Apple products. They asked me how much they cost in America. Because China imposes a value-added tax, Apple products are significantly more expensive there. The obsession with Apple is just getting started in China.

NFLX and AMZN provide fine services, but over the life of their companies have lost significant amounts of money. At their current valuations I have no interest in either. What sets APPL apart (not as a stock, but as a company) is the way that they grew both their top and bottom lines. Let me put it this way. APPL created a product line, and spent five years selling it, in record shattering amounts, completely on it's own terms. During these same five years, practically every other technology hardware company either restructured their business model based on what AAPL did, or simply went out of business. What AAPL did had nothing to do with a broader tech rally, and I'm betting that you know this. APPL was never a momentum stock. AAPL was never a spec play. AAPL never sacrificed the bottom line to grow the top line. AAPL simply invented an amazing product line, and executed a flawless business plan. Maybe it's best days are behind it, maybe the best is still yet to come. The truth is that none of us really know. I just find it a bit sad that some idiots want to act like the last five years never happened. It really happened, and APPL has $137,000,000,000 in cash to prove it.</Msg><Username>gtucker7848</Username><Timestamp>1359252637456</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 21:10:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359252733950-1780</Id><Title>Everyone begged for a buying opportunity</Title><Msg>Now you get one, and people are calling for 300.

If this persist then the downward spiral is not done yet. Samsung now ships more smartphones than Apple and Nokia combined By Brad Reed | BGR News – Fri, Jan 25, 2013 Email Samsung Santa Ad It seems that Santa delivered a lot Samsung (005930) phones over the holiday quarter. According to the latest numbers from Strategy Analytics, Samsung shipped a whopping 63 million smartphones in the fourth quarter of 2012, a 73% increase from the 36.5 million smartphones it shipped in the fourth quarter of 2011. Samsung’s smartphone shipment market share also rose to 29% on the quarter, larger than the combined market shares of Apple’s (AAPL) 22% and Nokia’s (NOK) 3%. Just one year earlier, Samsung’s market share stood at 23.2%, which at the time trailed Apple’s 23.6% share. Samsung reported yet another record-breaking quarter with a $6.6 billion profit on Friday, so it’s not surprising to see its share of the overall smartphone market has significantly increased over the past year.</Msg><Username>eloysalcedo2003</Username><Timestamp>1359254369066</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 21:39:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359254369990-1812</Id><Topic><Title>PE for hardware company with declining EPS should be around 4</Title><Username>musichead2005</Username><Timestamp>1359247626493</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 19:47:06 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What happens if they add a dime to every download?</Msg><Username>cpnbk2003</Username><Timestamp>1359254369990</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 21:39:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359254405254-1813</Id><Topic><Title>Advice needed...</Title><Username>A Yahoo!

Keep in mind that it still has a market cap of 400+ Billion which I think is way too big for a company which ultimately generates most of its revenue by selling phones and tablets (a hardware device). All the current and past earnings will ultimately slow down due to competitors who are coming up with equally better products. The only saviour now is going to be another new product which should cause another buying frenzy. I don't think apple tv is going to do that unless it has something unique along with a content based consistent revenue stream. In short at this point it is a dangerous stock to be invested in for a true long term. Yes it will get occassional bounce but I find it funny when people like Cramer say it is not a trading stock .. it is an investment stock. In fact no technology company is a long term investment stock but must be evaluated at least every 6 months to see how much % of their portfolio should be trimmed or added. These are not the J&amp;J,P&amp;G, Coca Cola or Pepsi kind of companies.</Msg><Username>A Yahoo!

Why? Bc they've given away phones to all the low end consumers many of whom wo'n t fulfill their contracts and end up in collections and none of whom are up sell users. Apple on the other hand makes and extra $80 per phone on avg in apps etc. M, Apple has high end clientelle who pay their bills (better revenue for carriers over time) and have no problem upgrading every couple years. And the stiffer competition of which Samsung speaks looking fwd is not just more low end phones but Apple inking a deal w/China Mobile. Talk about competition!!!

Other companies are encroaching in on what apple has done, binging in products that are not quite as good and sometimes superior for a fraction of the retail price. Apple's five year plan will run out soon. Then, we'll see how well the leaders can handle this company.

Consumers want new innovations every quarter from Apple to keep their appetite going for buying new things. The days of introducing a blockbuster device once a year are over. Consumer buying cycles are much shorter now, consumers are getting bombarded by many competing products, and they really don't want to wait a whole year to buy something cool from Apple. Apple must change with this new consumer. The question is: Can Apple do this? Can Apple innovate at a much faster pace every quarter?

Even if they have to grow them until both growth and value funds will HAVE to by or breach the fiscal responsibility of their investors; which any value fund not invested in Apple right now is doing. AAPL will be back to 600, 700, 800 and yes, it will be the first trillion dollar market cap company. At the rate they are going they will have close to 500 billion in cash in 5-6 years. No reason why they cant to continue to grow at 10-20% for the next five years.

You can make $3400 with no risk by just selling the Oct 450 Call. It seems risky to spend $9500 on buying the call although it should pay off given the expectation that APPLE should be much higher by then. Why did you choose a 350 strike price for the long call? Is that a 'safe" low price? Basically this option strategy has the potential to make a lot more money than the $3400 if the stock price is at $500 or $600 in October right? The long call could go make a great deal money...

Apple is a fantastic company and I own apple products but I think you should agree that as of now the bears are in command and it would be arrogant to label them as 'stupid'. I had always wondered when this stock was at a market cap of 1/2 "trillion" dollars and managed to generate 50 billion dollars every quarter with the stock well above 600 dollars.C' mon this has to stop at some point. As of now it is still fairly valued but I think you will agree that going forward it is going to get more and more difficult unless they come up with some new product which has the potential to become another iphone. The funny thing is that there is a very small short interest in Apple atleast as of dec end so the selling is mainly people just getting out of the stock. I think the huge market cap makes it very very difficult to grow.</Msg><Username>A Yahoo!

In short when you are that big the growth story quickly disappears and the only direction is downwards. That's the reason why small to mid-caps quickly doubles or triples with even the remote signs of growth. Netflix is a prime example , although a huge short interest in NetFlix was one of the main reason for the panic short cover buying spree.</Msg><Username>A Yahoo!

Why not bump it up to $500? Cost would go up to $8300, but the potential gain of $15K would put the return close to 80%. In your example I believe you start losing money at $416 since the cost was 6600 and anything less that 416 would net you less than 6600 so 415 would be a $100 loss and so on. At 405 you could only sell the stock back for 5500, meaning a 1100 loss. I like the concept, but I think the price drops further before it puts in a bottom. Second quarter is shaping up to be a mess with the first EPS decline in years. Absent some good news I could see that adding another small leg down and if guidance doesnt project to be much better than the second quarter I will be really curious to see how the market reacts to that.</Msg><Username>tkell31</Username><Timestamp>1359258343158</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 22:45:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359258472631-1911</Id><Topic><Title>Apple TV Predicted to Have FaceTime Videoconferencing</Title><Username>dhmunoz1220</Username><Timestamp>1359258272384</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 22:44:32 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I already have it on all my devices "skype"</Msg><Username>fair_play_200200</Username><Timestamp>1359258472631</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 22:47:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359258494403-1912</Id><Title>Theoretically...</Title><Msg>how much TV content could AAPL buy with $137bil in cash.

We know how great Apple earnings have grown in the past. For some reason, the current management of this company has done a very poor job at convincing anyone, including themselves, what their FUTURE earnings will look like. And, this is the problem. Do you know for sure what their future earnings will look like? Part of the story is how amazingly fast Samsung has added such a large smart phone market share in the US and worldwide. How could a really good competitor allow this to happen this fast? The other story is that the iPads, though a great and innovative product, are very easy to copy just like the PC was. This new competition is now really gearing up. There is no doubt that Apple can earn a profit, but now that competitors are taking market share in earnest, what future earnings per share can be expected. The scary part is how fast this industry changes. Management needs to communicate, in concrete terms with unit sales, prices, margins and admin. costs, how they can maintain a consistent $50/share in earnings going forward.</Msg><Username>tomymtnmanzeb</Username><Timestamp>1359259341229</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 23:02:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359259353329-1937</Id><Topic><Title>It's Very Encouraging How Stupid The Bears are on Apple</Title><Username>alphashort</Username><Timestamp>1359256010405</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 22:06:50 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Amen</Msg><Username>nitram6481</Username><Timestamp>1359259353329</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 23:02:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359259398787-1938</Id><Topic><Title>215 price target</Title><Username>swingbydetailers</Username><Timestamp>1359259199302</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 22:59:59 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>what if I said 290?</Msg><Username>swingbydetailers</Username><Timestamp>1359259398787</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 23:03:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359259417745-1939</Id><Topic><Title>LOT'S OF DESPERATE SHORTS HOPING THEIR SCARE TACTICS WORK - FUNNY, IN AT 440</Title><Username>newgrad2012</Username><Timestamp>1359256041849</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 22:07:21 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Friday, I jumped the gun, could have had them at 438, oh well, I see a bounce to 520, I'm willing to sell at 500 provided it is quick, It's only 50 shares so it's not like I'm going to move the market, that much.

Certain vested interests are destroying the stock in order to weaken it to the point where "new" power brokers can take the reigns of Apple. These are foreign interests that Jobs kept at bay when alive. The rational mind can't fathom what is taking place. It is irrational and like any coup, appears to be organic when, in fact, it was all planned and executed with precision. You're all watching it happen and see it happening before your very eyes, but your attributions for why it is occurring are rooted in linear logic (fundamentals/technicals/trends). Just think: It is a bit much, yes? Apple sitting on all that money, all the intellectual property, users. It was too tempting for raiders and now that Jobs is gone they can make their move on the company. Think it can't or hasn't happened in the past? Wake up children, this is how the real world works.</Msg><Username>truthiness123</Username><Timestamp>1359259784888</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 23:09:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359259812063-1952</Id><Topic><Title>It's Very Encouraging How Stupid The Bears are on Apple</Title><Username>alphashort</Username><Timestamp>1359256010405</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 22:06:50 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm glad you know the future.

You can bet on Samsung, RIMM, Google if you want, but I will take the team at Apple. Second, when a good company is down 35-40% and people are acting like it is just the beginning of the fall, you gotta flat-out buy on your hands. I mean these posers are getting ridiculous. Take away half Apple's earnings tomorrow and they still have a cheaper PE than google, that does not count cash. I understand panic and I understand shorts trying to stir the pot, and I realize these forces could drive apple a bit lower in the next quarter, but this stock is a buy from this point forward. Ask yourself one question, you are going to get your new girlfriend a phone. are you going to get her a samsung and tell her how much better it is? Or are you going to get her the iphone? I said a new girlfriend. not one who already knows you are a viagra popping loser. Sorry, Samsung has a way to go. This is a once a decade buying opportunity and one should start averaging in now. do not wait for 300 or 250, or whatever other fake number the Nostradamuses on this board are calling for.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) today and its stock would be soaring in the wake of another quarter of record sales and earnings. However, falling short of expectations in the investment world is like steppingout of bounds by only an inch, nullifying an incredible catch in football. While CEO Tim Cook described Apple’s results as “extraordinary” on the company’s conference call late yesterday, the simple fact remains that by several key measures the company grew less than analysts expected. The disappointment is tangible, triggering a sell-off that’s taken the stock to levels not seen in a year. But it is also tempting, given that shares are now down 35% from their all-time high of $705 hit just four months ago. “I think you got to hold your nose and buy here,” says Eric Jackson, founder of Ironfire Capital. “In the past, when Apple has gone on runs, it usually comes when there’s this mass negativity in the air like there is now.” Certainly, not everyone agrees with Jackson, as no less than six different analysts have cut their outlooks or estimates or price targets so far today, bringing the median price target down to $647 from $792 in a matter of months. Jackson says the fear about Apple running up against “the law of large numbers” has been out there for about five years, but he concedes that he is ”just not in that camp” and would be looking to add to his position.</Msg><Username>youamialso</Username><Timestamp>1359260793296</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 23:26:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359260799677-1975</Id><Topic><Title>AAPL trades at 6 PE</Title><Username>racebanner2</Username><Timestamp>1359242104864</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 18:15:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And eps for 2013 will be about 38 so it's really trading at 11.5</Msg><Username>tkell31</Username><Timestamp>1359260799677</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 23:26:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359260856655-1976</Id><Topic><Title>Guess close Monday</Title><Username>colorado_dude4u</Username><Timestamp>1359260713543</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 23:25:13 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think it will go to 455 since I no longer have it.

In other words, you could just buy the long call for $9500 but to offset some of the cost, you're capping your gain ON THE STOCK (not the long call) to obtain more funds to offset the price of the long call. Of course if the short call is managed, you can close the call out on a bottom and just keep the long call and later on put another long call against the stock near the high level then, say at a strike price of $500 when you can get a better premium.. I have a similar question though concerning why you just don't own the stock (which doesn't have a time expiration issue) and just let it appreciate as the stock price goes up and in addition, you get a dividend every 3 months with the stock. You can place a call against the stock out a few months and close it out when the stock price bottoms which it's likely to d a few times over the next few weeks. Overall, I like the idea of a long call out a good distance to (1) give the strategy a chance to work and (2) reduce the amount of time decay. For the short calls, you could do shorter term calls that increase time decay and try to manage them (close them out as bottoms are encountered).</Msg><Username>bobdicks123</Username><Timestamp>1359260873276</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 23:27:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359260883872-1978</Id><Topic><Title>Guess close Monday</Title><Username>colorado_dude4u</Username><Timestamp>1359260713543</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 23:25:13 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Go #$%$ your mother you #$%$ turd gave.</Msg><Username>sheepskinner6</Username><Timestamp>1359260883872</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 23:28:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359260918427-1979</Id><Topic><Title>Samsung sold more smartphone last quarter than Apple and Nokia combine</Title><Username>eloysalcedo2003</Username><Timestamp>1359254369066</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 21:39:29 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Exactly my point.</Msg><Username>A Yahoo!

Imagine all the stops on AAPL that got taken out from 513-460 along with people who were forced to sell on margin calls, thats why AAPL got a beat down.</Msg><Username>chowskee</Username><Timestamp>1359261389077</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 23:36:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359261449312-1999</Id><Topic><Title>Why should the stock value less than from the same time last year when profit actually went up &amp; more cash in the bank?</Title><Username>cantkeepbookstraight</Username><Timestamp>1359238997545</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 17:23:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well, the market is a guessing game of not only fundamentals, but investment sentiment. When a strong positive momentum builds it grows faster than it should because there are so many investors that believe they are so smart that they can ride the wave up and get off near or at the peak. As a result, very serious gamesmanship develops as to when to get out (because selling is akin to musical chairs), which causes a rather severe and sudden decline the minute there are any signs of a peak or decline in fundamentals. Add to this the large amount of money that attempts to earn a profit on any movement in price up, or down (short-selling), and you see the result.</Msg><Username>tomymtnmanzeb</Username><Timestamp>1359261449312</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 23:37:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359261725220-2000</Id><Topic><Title>AAPL will clearly drop to $200 or lower by summer.</Title><Username>wm_gates_iii</Username><Timestamp>1359257606614</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 22:33:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You`re out of your mind.

The reason: the company has plans to buy back billions of dollars worth of its own shares. And currently, "they don't know how many shares they will buy back." In addition to Apple's announcement of changes in how it will report software revenues, Global Equities Research analyst Trip Chowdhry noted a separate change related to Earnings Per Share guidance. While Apple reported $13.81 EPS in the last quarter that beat The Street's consensus of $13.48, it didn't offer an EPS guidance for the coming quarter. The simple reason, notes Chowdhry, is that Apple doesn't know how many shares will be outstanding because "they don't know how many shares they will buy back." In part, that's because the wild fluctuation in Apple's share price is having an unpredictable impact on the number of shares the company can afford to buy with its initial allocation. The company could also decide to take advantage of severely discounted stock prices to accelerate its stock buyback program. Because the number of outstanding shares is subject to unpredictable change, Apple can't confidently report guidance on its Earnings Per Share going forward. Apple originally announced having "authorized a $10 billion share repurchase program commencing in the Company’s fiscal 2013, which begins on September 30, 2012. The repurchase program is expected to be executed over three years." In early October, just after the program was slated to begin, Apple's share price reached above $670. If the company had bought up shares using the first third of its $10 billion buyback fund, it would have been able to buy 4,975,000 shares. If the company waited and spent the same $3.33 billion buying shares after its earnings call, it could have instead afforded to buy over 7,593,000 shares. If the company accelerates its buyback program, it could spend even more of its $10 billion in allocated cash to swoop up shares. For the last quarter, the company stated it had already deducted $2 billion from its from its cash pile for stock buyback, in addition to $2.5 billion allocated for quarterly dividend payments, both of which were separate from its reported cash reserves now totaling $137.1 billion, a $16 billion increase over the previous quarter. In total, Apple generated cash flow of $23.4 billion in the winter quarter. Blowing its entire $10 billion stock buyback allocation early, it could theoretically take almost 22 million shares off the market, out of the company's 939 million outstanding shares. This would have an impact not only on EPS going forward but also on Apple's market cap. While it would subtract $10 billion from the company's calculated market cap right now, once its shares reach back up to previous highs that $10 billion bite would grow along with share prices, essentially requiring the share price to grow higher just to hit the same market valuation.</Msg><Username>longonfargo</Username><Timestamp>1359262206559</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 23:50:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359262249470-2013</Id><Title>MY BROKER SAID TO SELL ALL.
