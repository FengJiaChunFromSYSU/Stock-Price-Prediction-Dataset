This was helped by two factors: Apple's release of the iPhone 4 and their broadened distribution to Verizon (VZ) and Sprint (S), instead of just selling iPhones through AT&amp;T (T). Apple should get another boost in its revenues once the iPhone 5 is released, which is expected to be around the fourth quarter of 2012. A Research by Business Insider shows that tablets are expected to have sales of 2.5 million by 2016, surpassing smartphone sales of 2 million units a year, in a good agreement with: *I Know First system stock forecast system* Good Luck!</Msg><Username>timtomson35</Username><Timestamp>1342240043514</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-07-14 00:27:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>18</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1342240382314-2</Id><Topic><Title>Wow!

Example, you own 605 strike calls and the stock closes at $604.97. After the bell an announcement of big news pushes the stock up to $630. You have a short window of time usually to call your broker and exercise your options in order to realize the $25 in profit you would otherwise not get.</Msg><Username>jsdjason</Username><Timestamp>1342240912433</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-07-14 00:41:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1342245923657-4</Id><Topic><Title>Fundamental research method</Title><Username>bakert82</Username><Timestamp>1340465556000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-06-23 11:32:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Statistics analysis of global "smartphone" vs. "dumbphone" subscribers, indicates that the mobile revolution is still in its early phases, since only around 835 million users are using a smartphone, vs. around 5,600 million "dumbphone" users. Only 12.9% of cell phone users are smartphone users, so there is still a very large market to sell iPhones to. The U.S. is the leader of the pack in terms of conversion to smartphones, since more than 46% of cell phone users in the U.S. have a smartphone, against 41% with "dumbphones." The obvious conclusions are that the new smartphone sales will have to be directed at the rest of the world, and Apple will have to release a new iPhone every year or so to keep U.S. customers upgrading to the newer versions. Cheaper, smaller-featured versions of the iPhone may have to be implemented to reach as many potential customers as possible, as the "dumbphone" conversion cycle is just getting started. Globally, there are still less than 1 billion smartphone users estimated for 2012, while the forecast for 2016 is around 1.5 billion</Msg><Username>jamesgordon99</Username><Timestamp>1342245923657</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-07-14 02:05:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1342250991962-5</Id><Topic><Title>Pure criminal they are trying to kill the 605$ options holders</Title><Username>israelmichel</Username><Timestamp>1342208886751</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-13 15:48:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>it's easy cash if you trade em it 's the buy and hold for exp guys that lose .</Msg><Username>robbierobnj</Username><Timestamp>1342250991962</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-07-14 03:29:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1342254192449-6</Id><Title>Newly released earnings estimate</Title><Msg>After 2 weeks of research I've finaly crunched my numbers, coming up with what I think will be a very accurate EPS number. 3.55m Macs 22.1m iPhones 11.4m Pads 6.3m iPods 7.41B net revenue $7.89 EPS</Msg><Username>rimmbberry</Username><Timestamp>1342254192449</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-07-14 04:23:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1342254279065-7</Id><Topic><Title>Newly released earnings estimate</Title><Username>rimmbberry</Username><Timestamp>1342254192449</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-07-14 04:23:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Any other predictions?</Msg><Username>rimmbberry</Username><Timestamp>1342254279065</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-07-14 04:24:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1342254891143-8</Id><Title>Where's my mini iPad for under $300?</Title><Msg>I'm still waiting for a mini iPad.

There are many ways to do stock replacement. It really depends on your goal and situation. If you simply want to take some profits off your long position, deep-in-the-money long term calls is a good way to do it. You can certainly buy the Jan 14 540 but it is a little too long term for my taste. It is because you can't just buy-and-hold options. You have to trade them. Calls that long are difficult to get out. Just look at the volume and open interest and you will know why.

Current July call OI sits at 600. The MMs would love to sell a few more 605, 610, and 615 calls before tightening the OPEX choke strap. Would be surprised if AAPL closes higher than 610 this week.....that we can agree on. Furthermore, barring any major market pullback, expect a nice pop ($10) the Monday before earnings!!! I will LOAD this Friday prior to close to capitalize on the inevitable manipulation.....closing the trade by noon the day of earnings. Use it to your advantage.....and buy lots of shares for long term holdings....$750 jan 13'.....book it!</Msg><Username>justinschulte072000</Username><Timestamp>1342279642383</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-07-14 11:27:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1342279947320-38</Id><Topic><Title>Nielsen: Google's Android 51.8 percent of American smartphone , .

So I looked at the Jan 13 calls for the strike which has higher volume and open interest and is closest to $130 a share. That's the reason I pick $500. In general, for stock replacement, you want to buy something with at least an 80 to 90 delta so that the call tracks the stock movement closely. 80 delta call should track 80% of the stock movement theoretically. It won't track tick by tick but over a period of time it should be pretty close. You also pay less time values with deeper calls. One thing I want to point out. There is no such thing as the best option strategy. Every option strategy has a different risk/reward profile and different pros and cons. So giving a set of goals, assumptions, and situations, you can pick the trades that offer the most pros with the least cons. But if your goals, assumptions, or situations change, the trade you pick may not be good anymore. There is another side I didn't touch upon - risk management. I couldn't take that into consideration because I didn't know about your account situation, your holding, trading style, etc...

He panders to Radical Environmentalist and other clueless nuts that would grind the economy into the ground with a smile. The American Business Owner has been under attack from Owebama from Day #1 he took office. GET RID OF OWEBAMA IN NOVEMBER! VOTE ROMNEY - a man with business experience to get back to the foundation of Capitalism. In my view, Owebama is more suited to be a Socialist-Dictator of a 3rd World Country. Owebama 2nd Term = Entitlement Society - Dependent on Government handouts; Success and hard work is PUNISHED with high taxes; Government limits YOUR FREEDOM with intrusive regulations throughout society, disjointing the financial markets, etc. etc. Romney = Capitalism - Self-reliance and incentives for "Capital-Creation" such as a low tax burden, few government regulations, USA Energy Independence (using OUR resources, not importing/sending OUR money overseas), etc. The choice is clear. If you hate America and want to see American changed into a European-style Socialist Society, then vote Owebama. If you appreciate the fact that FREEDOM unleashed in America has changed the world for the better through innovation, investment and job creation, then vote Romney. Ronald Reagan gave America hope again after the miserable Carter years. I truly believe that Romney's business experience may SAVE AMERICA from the miserable, stalled-growth economic recovery we are now experiencing. If you use your brain in the voting booth in November, then the choice is clear. American did not become an economic superpower on the backs of a big, beloated debt-spending Federal Government. America became great because of Entrepreneurs like Steve Jobs &amp; Woz forming a business in a garage....taking a risk to do something great!</Msg><Username>white_knight_in_texas</Username><Timestamp>1342298042377</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-07-14 16:34:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1342298057369-82</Id><Topic><Title>ALERT!!

The worries stem from the fact that the company has reportedly seen sales slowdowns of its bestselling iPhone in anticipation of the next generation of the device being launched soon. Mizuho Securities analyst Abhey Lamba said in a research note on Wednesday that the company “had already started experiencing a slowdown due to the impending iPhone 5 launch.” Lamba predicted that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was likely to report revenue in the $36.5 billion to $37.5 billion range for the quarter, below the analyst consensus of $37.6 billion. He also expected profits to come in the $10.25 to $10.50 per share range. Wall Street has predicted profits at $10.35 a share. “Although Apple experienced strong momentum in iPad sales which should benefit from increased distribution of the new iPad, inventory build-up and lack of competition, our checks indicate that the company has started to experience slowdown ahead of the expected launch of the iPhone 5,” he wrote. “We expect the company to ship around 27 million iPhones vs. consensus of ~29-30 million devices.” Lamba also wrote that the company’s guidance for the September quarter will be below consensus. However, he maintained a Buy rating on the stock and a $725 price target. “While the company is unlikely to post upside to June estimates and September quarter forecasts present downside risk, we remain positive about the stock as the iPhone 5 upgrade cycle should move FY13 estimates significantly higher,” he wrote.</Msg><Username>steve_jobs_speaking</Username><Timestamp>1342302532787</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-07-14 17:48:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1342304091608-90</Id><Title>Dollar Tumbles Into Weekend – A Sign of What’s to Come Monday</Title><Msg>Having worked so hard to finally overtake resistance that had capped bullish ambitions for an entire month, you’d think the dollar would have won some respite from the sentiment-based headwinds. That said, Friday ended with a sizable decline for the Dow Jones FXCM Dollar Index (ticker = USDollar) back below that closely-watched 10,190 level. Once again, we are reminded of the critical difference between a breakout and break with follow through. The immediate reversal from the greenback is perhaps a little more surprising given the initial move was supported by a general slide in risk trends. That said, when we are confronted with technical boundaries like the midpoint of the EURUSD’s historical range and the fact that there are few fundamental catalysts to actively drive capital towards safe havens that provide no (or even negative) yield, the lack of follow through becomes a little more comprehensible. Can we jump start a trend for the dollar – whether bullish or bearish? If you were looking for fundamental cues from the fundamental event risk from the final 24 hours of this past week as guidance for where we will go heading forward, you may be disappointed. The Chinese 2Q GDP figures (setting the tone for global growth expectations amongst investors) printed below expected with a 7.6 percent annual pace of expansion – the weakest pace in three years but not enough of a surprise to stir concern. Closer to home, JPMorgan started the ball rolling for the US earnings season with a view into the closely-monitored financial market. A massive $4.4 billion loss via the CIO debacle didn’t seem to materially hamper adjusted earnings. As dubious as corporate earnings are (as a gauge for capital gains and yields for the equities market – the favored investment of retail trader), we cannot ignore it if the market is placated by the figures. The earnings season continues next week with Bank of American, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Apple and Google amongst other notables. Watch it with a mind to how the masses read the numbers. Though it is difficult to see any, individual fundamental event as a potential catalyst to truly drive risk appetite forward; Fed Chairman Bernanke’s monetary policy report will always carry the possibility of an announcement of intentions for further stimulus. To what degree markets are still holding out hope (and thereby possibly be disappointed) remains to be seen.</Msg><Username>steve_jobs_speaking</Username><Timestamp>1342304091608</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-07-14 18:14:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1342304249760-91</Id><Title>Apple may be in talks to buy China's SINA for $8 billion launch TV in China...</Title><Msg>There was a $47 million call option bet for December 2012 $75 Calls on NYSE Symbol SINA at the close on 7/13/2012.
