My Sources also tell me that this isn't a problem because MM intends to keep telling fancy stories and her new CFO will cook the books long enough for Dan Loeb and MM to make a bunch of money and then Dan will sell out and MM will say she is sick and sell all her stock and options and the BOD will vest her restricted shares. My sources are very confident that Jack Rooney will then be named CEO. My sources are never wrong. Trust my sources. Buy all the Yahoo you can, but be ready to sell before the Alibaba IPO.

It seems today and going forward YHOO is moving in the right direction and smartly. I am really impressed of her. She is also getting the market excited of her moves. I hope she gets YHOO back to his old YHOO, trading $90 to $100 per share. It is impossible but possible. I think YHOO BOD will put a pressure on MM to do a shares buyback or even a small cash dividend. But I think she will use most of the money for small acquisitions.</Msg><Username>goingbravo</Username><Timestamp>1353775121041</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-24 11:38:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353775247185-12</Id><Topic><Title>somethin aint right</Title><Username>garybirch55</Username><Timestamp>1353774439108</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-24 11:27:19 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>in gary's noggin...tick-tock!</Msg><Username>gollywogazoo</Username><Timestamp>1353775247185</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-24 11:40:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353775502553-13</Id><Topic><Title>Yahoo buyback will begin when Yahoo gives guidance within the next two weeks</Title><Username>mb525799</Username><Timestamp>1353187142975</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-17 16:19:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>My sources tell me Yahoo will announce guidance this week.</Msg><Username>mb525799</Username><Timestamp>1353775502553</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-24 11:45:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353776150326-14</Id><Topic><Title>Yahoo is due to give guidance next week</Title><Username>cobybeef8at8</Username><Timestamp>1353632575851</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-22 20:02:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I hope in addition to giving guidance, YHOO will give us an update of their 35% stakes in YHOO Japan.
