Kind, Polite, Gracious, and very friendly folks. And their children are some of the most well behaved that I've ever seen, in any situation. Toddlers included. I'm a Mother, and have 2 who are now 18 and older, who grew up with that same level of security and calmness that I see in the Mexican and South American children that I see on the streets I walk. I was probably much more strict than most of my background, being a White Woman, from a American/Alaska. I grew up in a large family, who didn't have much, until I was out on my own. My children learned a thing or two from me: I raised an eyebrow, and all was quiet on the Fussing Front. And our home had many books for all levels of reading, and plenty of interaction with both parents reading to the children. I'll even publicly thank my exes. I read to our babies from day 2 or 3. What else would a person who doesn't watch TV do? Both of my Ex spouses were quick to hold a baby and reading a story; it beat washing a floor, or a bathroom, or cooking a meal, or... They were comfy in their recliner, the baby was safe and being read to, and it worked for at least 30 mins., most evenings. I didn't mind Sports or the Weather Channel or a biz channel being on the TV, when Dad was on duty. No sitcoms, no movies, no crude language, and no violence, no news (due to violence.) Both of my daughters are probably of a higher IQ than I have. May they both take the opportunity to make the most of their own. I'm not quite certain that I have, of mine...</Msg><Username>czarinaofcamelyacht</Username><Timestamp>1354338527855</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-01 00:08:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354339808388-3</Id><Topic><Title>How stupid was Ballmer to have not bought YHOO last March for.....</Title><Username>mewag51</Username><Timestamp>1354313280310</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 17:08:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well, considering you want a $12B premium on nothing and "synergies" I have yet to see you explain once. They would not own any AG as the other 2 partners have right of first refusal. A moot point though with Yahoo cashing in its chips takes that hassle off the table. As for FB, if Yahoo got no money its safe to say there wasn't any to be had in the first place. If you BELIEVE the opposite then you're admitting Yahoo are IDIOTS therefore would be taken advantage of anyway. MSFT owns part of FB so essentially suing itself is what you're saying.lol As for paying "more" on what exactly? Yahoo is converting its assets to CASH and MSFT doesn't need any cash, in the business world it gets ZERO premium. The core is still broken and their AG chips are mostly gone at IPO leaving that final 10%. Explain how the price "went up" and I won't laugh at you mercilessly for making this topic. You don't have to make me a separate topic to whine about putting people on ignore, you don't have to so you can act tough calling me "angry or desperate short" just explain that very laughable post...EASY!

Mexican law, okay here is a brush up. No jury Judgment does not hold to precedent as the judge will evaluate each case and judge in the manner he holds germane to the case. Laws are not common but civil. First to file holds court bias. Litigation is not a desirable method of settling disputes. Lititgation can be very expensive. Note Breach of Promise is considered seperate issue from Breach of Contract as it is seperate Breach of Promise is a precontract that is reguired for any base contract.

Your $12 bil "premium" is still about $14 bil. less than MSFT offered in 2008. The YHOO and MSFT synergies are obvious and too many to list but that is why Ballmer offered $47 bil for YHOO in 2008. Yes MSFT owns a bit of FB, hence the settlement would be easy and make sense and MSFT could get considerations, (and again it comes down to MSFT's size and ability to wait out FB). MSFT would still own 43% of AG and could wait Ma out for IPO (maybe $43 bil., certainly way more than YHOO got for their stake) -first right of refusal means nothing except Ma would have to pay up to match. And yes, YHOO BOD, Bartz, Wang, etc. were idiots, (now replaced) we all admit that and that is why YHOO traded, and still trades, well below its real value.

This is finding out that a house is in an avalanche zone, there may never be an avalanche that hits the house but just the possibility makes the house drop in value. The possibility of a big loss and proof of management’s failure and incompetence is a kick in the gonads. Yahoo, and Yahoo longs, will take that hit and suffer, recuperate and if they lose the appeal take another hit.

In the 60's, 70's, and probably some of the 80's.</Msg><Username>czarinaofcamelyacht</Username><Timestamp>1354408773345</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-01 19:39:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354409282657-103</Id><Topic><Title>Is anyone on this board short Yahoo?</Title><Username>theecoldone</Username><Timestamp>1354395960588</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-01 16:06:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I thought at least hotmodel, dr.gloom, grey or dickbets would have answered.

The stock is in a bubble - forward PE is higher than Google - AOL is even higher on a % basis. Google news as bad as it is is even more adaptable and has more content. And now the Mexican law suit - whatever is merits or lack thereof it reminds the market that Yahoo has issues that are being hidden. SO who needs Yahoo in a byy out? Microsoft maybe because they are making mistake after mistake. Mayer is the next to get pushed out by the board. At the end of 2013 if Yahoo is not making substantially more than in 2012 she will be fired. The market will hit the stock long before then. Right nowo the analysts say that Yahoo's EPS will NOT go up next year - so how can the stock price continue to trade at a premium when there is no benefit to the company. The accumulation/distributiion shows that there are substantial large block sales going on. The % short will move up percent by percent and then the stock will regress to the mean of 14. Statistically this will happen as certainly as Nate Silver proected the election. Question is, what do you do?</Msg><Username>quantum_analyst</Username><Timestamp>1354410743656</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-01 20:12:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354411305725-106</Id><Title>Mayer is already being shown to be a bad hire</Title><Msg>These Surprising Numbers Suggest Yahoo's Board May Have Screwed Up Hiring Marissa Mayer FROM SFGATE roday</Msg><Username>quantum_analyst</Username><Timestamp>1354411305725</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-01 20:21:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354412150980-107</Id><Topic><Title>#$%$?</Title><Username>randybentwick</Username><Timestamp>1354402130261</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-01 17:48:50 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I wind up here all the time too.

Failed resistance. I love shorting stocks at major resistance. Works about 75% of the time and add this one to another one that works. Worst case scenario is if the trade goes bad and the stock pushes through resistance on strong volume you just cover and keep your loss small. No big deal. This is going to be a handsome profit with this major lawsuit! I am salivating at the Monday morning open where I plan on covering and going long. This is going to sell off major but we all this is a #$%$ claim in Mexice but the fact is it will put a major dent in the stock Monday morning. I will monitor the stock after I cover and decide when to go long by looking at the tape. I love this stuff!! Still I see resistance being broken eventually and the stock off to the low to mid 20's in the future.</Msg><Username>dickey_betts44</Username><Timestamp>1354413906474</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-01 21:05:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354414205716-110</Id><Title>Someone shorts knew about this judgement beforehand.

You can post when you cover your $19.15 at $18, $16 or $14 till you are blue in the face. But if the price ever goes above $19.15 the coldone and his minions will still say that you are short $19.15 for as long as Yahoo trades above $19.15. They never sell or post a sale, waiting for their original $28 buying price, and think that nobody ever covers under the short price.</Msg><Username>dr.gloom</Username><Timestamp>1354418648935</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-01 22:24:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354419628811-113</Id><Topic><Title>What is Marissa Mayer's Top Secret Pet Project at Yahoo?</Title><Username>thetoadtimes</Username><Timestamp>1348114590837</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 00:16:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Looks like the first official -# See what I can do #- is a failure.
