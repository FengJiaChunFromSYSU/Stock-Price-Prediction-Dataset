It will run even more powerful then BIDU and has just recently added the richest man in the entire country of CHINA to the RENN board of directors. Chen said after that (the ceo of RENN) he will not be happy till RENN has at least a 100 billion dollar maret cap. You figure out what that would make the share price, but the CBOE has not priced the 2014 RENN calls, they just recently did the april 2013 calls. This is highly suspicious because many that are in RENN are in DANG also. Dang has had 2014 calls available for a long time as has sold many of them. Do not take your eye off either of these stocks for even one day, and when the serious pump and loading starts, get in and keep adding heavy as much as you can afford because these will really take off. RENN should start anytime and be 16-18 by Oct expiration, the calls tell the story! Dang, that will partially depend on if amzn rises or tanks in Oct Renn has 11-29 year olds locked up as they stay glued to renren site and 34% even login by cell phone. 5 Billion more internet users come online in just this age group alone in China and China has been getting slower and slower economy for 3 years, can you imagine if that economy starts to heat up again soon? Renn will be non stop to 100, it has bagholders stuck in it right now till 28 a share. Load and get ready as the richest man in China will run as soon as Chen renn buyback is over or close to it, it looks like it wants to start running up no matter if the rich man and Chen want more time, in that case they will join in and buy like crazy!!!</Msg><Username>namfong43</Username><Timestamp>1347167171145</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 01:06:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347168751551-21</Id><Title>new t/a</Title><Msg>top for aapl 703, top for goog, I cant tell its north of 1k., top for amzn under 290.</Msg><Username>imshortemc</Username><Timestamp>1347168751551</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 01:32:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347169583757-22</Id><Title>Never ending madness!...LOL</Title><Msg>Mitt Romney’s Mormonism: God lives on the planet Kolob "Have you ever read the Mormon’s Book of Abraham? There is an interesting tidbit there about God living on or very nearby to the planet Kolob. What is also very interesting is that astronomers have yet to ever identify where Kolob is…LOL! Isn’t it bad enough voting for a person for President who believes that some guy (i.e., Joseph Smith) born in Sharon, Vermont, in 1805 was divine-like? I say divine-like since there are all of these references to his divinity throughout Mormon literature: we read that Smith had a divine manifestation, a divine revelation, a divine inspiration, a divine mission, a divine calling, even a divine origin? But isn’t it sort of pushing the envelope then to ask folks to vote for a supposedly sane person for President, but who believes (if he is a practicing Mormon, and we know he gave lots of money to that Church, so at least he appears to be practicing with his wallet) that God lives on the planet Kolob?! I mean, isn’t it kind of like asking you to vote for Rod Serling for President? Do you think Rod might live on Kolob now? Please realize that whoever gets to the Oval Office presumably has the power to push that button starting a nuclear war sending us all to Kolob with him. Didn’t you hear Romney rattle the saber on his recent trip to Israel? Pretty scary stuff. Yet another Middle East war, et tu, Brutus?"

There is some inherit problem that's delaying the deal. Apple losing market-share is not simply a case of customers delaying purchases in anticipation of the iPhone 5. It's about the Galaxy III being as big or bigger than the iPhone 4s. I personally know multiple people who switched from and iPhone to Samsung - something which was unheard of since the launch of the iPhone. The gap has closed, and Apple has no way of opening it again. Any hopes of having an iPod like control over the smartphone market are gone and that means margin pressure and constant market-share risk.</Msg><Username>nyk20h</Username><Timestamp>1347180047386</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 04:40:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347181970765-33</Id><Title>BREAKING!

Apple is not XOM who is rightfully valued at 415.07B - with 37 oil refineries in 21 countries constituting a combined daily refining capacity of 6.3 million barrels (1,000,000 m3), Exxon Mobil is the largest refiner in the world). The reason why apple is not XOM is because there is no guarantee that in 5 years from now apple won't become the next RIMM or Nokia or Palm or even MSFT. .. XOM is guaranteed to not be RIMM and that's why they can have such a high valuation.

I wonder if you got really #$%@.ed by one? Although IMHO that would benefit your harsh attitude and persona a great deal since it seems you haven't been #$%@.ed for a long time?! But that's a topic for another time, and so back to the topic at hand... Do you know who Bruce Walker is? Have you read his previous worthless articles? I guess not, and I guess you're grasping at straws and post anything that has a negative connotations towards lawyers, Democrats, Obama and highly educated people in general, and interestingly enough that comes from a self-claimed-educated-you! There are good and bad in every walks of life but seems you're just an opportunist and only pick the ones that feeds your hate-ravaged-mind. I digress... Bruce Walker, the man who's ideas change with the direction of the wind... IS PERRY THE ONE: BRUCE WALKER "The recent comments by Mitt Romney accepting manmade global warming as scientific fact must cause conservatives to cross him off their list of presidential candidates. The mass exodus of staff from Newt's campaign makes him dead in the water. What Republicans need is a candidate who is unabashedly conservative across the board, a savvy campaigner who does not make stupid mistakes, someone with no skeletons anywhere, a proven government executive who would hit the ground running as president, and a candidate who could very quickly and almost bloodlessly win the Republican nomination. Governor Perry is perfect for this mission. Consider the five criteria I listed. Is Perry conservative? He is a social and a fiscal conservative with a very long track record of walking the walk as well as talking the talk. In the fiscal area, think of Mitch Daniels or Chris Christie on steroids. Unlike members of Congress, who have stray votes which could offend conservatives, Rick Perry has no blemishes at all. Moreover, Perry is aggressively conservative. On June 7, Perry called for a special legislative session to abolish sanctuary cities. On June 9, Perry asks fellow governors to join with him for a national day of prayer. His book, Fed Up! Our Fight to Save America from Washington takes on squarely the leftist mania for implementing national policies in areas properly the province of state governments. Rick Perry has never lost an election. He even knocked off leftist icon Jim Hightower in running for Agriculture Commissioner. Moreover, Perry has the psychological advantage that Reagan had: he grew up a Democrat, won election as a Democrat, and Perry was even the State Chairman for Al Gore in 1988. He can get inside the head of Reagan Democrats better than any Republican around. With video clips everywhere in cyberspace, the persuasiveness of a candidate is no longer guesswork. Look at Perry and then compare him to other Republican candidates. He never stumbles. He never says things which come back to haunt him. He knows how to win elections. Perry also has no skeletons. His whole life, from being an Eagle Scout to serving his country honorably in the military to marrying (and staying married) to his childhood sweetheart to working his father's family farm bespeak a life constructed for Hollywood with Perry in the role of the hero and dragon slayer. His wife is a nurse who has been active in promoting wholesome causes in that area. The only attack that can be made on Perry is that he is too conservative and too religious -- great, let the left hang their hat on those "flaws." Governor Perry is the longest serving governor in America from the second largest state in America, and before he was Governor Perry he was Lieutenant Governor Perry (an important job in Texas.) He not only has experience, but Perry has been a successful chief executive. The left will pick on his record — indeed, some have already begun — but those attacks can easily be turned against them. Texas does not spend nearly as much on education as, say, California. So what? Texans learn better than Californians. Americans grasp the horror of our national debt. They want someone who will pinch pennies. Could Governor Perry wrap up the Republican nomination quickly? Yes. The muscle and the mind of the Republican Party today is in bold state governance. Put these images in your mind: Bobby Jindal aggressively protecting his state and attacking Obama for destroying good jobs; Scott Walker defying the public employee unions who acted like thugs; Jan Brewer defending Arizona’s right to enforce immigration laws when Obama won’t; Mitch Daniels showing, dramatically, that the Great Lake States are not dead, just sickened by Democrats; Chris Christie bolding telling union thugs that saving New Jersey is his first and only priority; Rob McDonnell suing Washington to block ObamaCare. Where public employee unions are being pushed back are in Republican-run states. Where the rights of the unborn are being defending in brilliant new ways (like banning fetal pain), Republicans in states are doing it. The governors leading these charges also know that the obstacle to true reform is Obama and his radical leftists using federal power. So Nikki Haley finds that her effort to create jobs in South Carolina by wooing Boeing is being challenged by Obama’s NLRB. Jan Brewer’s state is sued by the Justice Department for upholding those laws which Eric Holder is bound to uphold as well. Bobby Jindal watches productive jobs vanish because of Obama’s dubious ban on offshore drilling. These Republican governors grasp that Washington led by a power-hungry clique of leftists is the problem, and these governors are extremely powerful within the Republican Party. Rick Perry is the Chair of the Republican Governors Association, and he has been chair before. If these governors got behind Governor Perry, the race for the nomination would be over — with no infighting, no expensive primary campaigns, and no hard feelings for most Republicans....."</Msg><Username>didihala_1</Username><Timestamp>1347202961840</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 11:02:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347202971509-106</Id><Title>PUMPERS.....APPLE will soon become the "NEW" DISASTER....like FACEBOOK !....Google then follows !</Title><Msg>Guaranteed......</Msg><Username>zip_i_t_do_da</Username><Timestamp>1347202971509</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 11:02:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347203012099-107</Id><Topic><Title>who was the whiner claiming aapl would get pegged to 680 today?</Title><Username>kibbles_lives</Username><Timestamp>1347036847753</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 12:54:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>As usual, you called it when the others were still wondering what to do.</Msg><Username>obamasuxcockwithnegrolips</Username><Timestamp>1347203012099</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 11:03:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347203125412-108</Id><Topic><Title>PUMPERS.....APPLE will soon become the "NEW" DISASTER....like FACEBOOK !....Google then follows !</Title><Username>zip_i_t_do_da</Username><Timestamp>1347202971509</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 11:02:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ignore User|</Msg><Username>bone412000</Username><Timestamp>1347203125412</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 11:05:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347203197567-109</Id><Topic><Title>690 $ tomorrow ?</Title><Username>barronsfanatic</Username><Timestamp>1347197460600</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 09:31:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks election00 -- Excellent Post !!!!!!!!!!!!!! I agree 100% -- this BREAK OUT HIGHER is gaining faster momentum to the upside....as the technicals &amp; fundamentals (iPhone 5 Launch, etc.) begin to "intersect". Historically, when AAPL makes a clear technical break-out, the Dirty Funds begin activating their dirty friends in the Financial Media to write all kinds of negative-slant krap, e.g. - blatant lie$, rumor$ and mi$leading information. This weekend, that activation began - evidenced by the $hills at Yahoo (now aligned with CNBC-Thugs) posting nonsensical-krap articles (Business Insider, etc.) in their Yahoo Finance Exclusives (at the top of the news). BUT -- none of it sticks -- and these Dirty Funds will have all their short positions SQUEEZED and shares called away -- De Ja Vu. And - it will be VIOLENT TRANSFER to stronger hands - starting THIS WEEK - and very likely TOMORROW (MONDAY) MORNING AT-THE-OPEN. The technicals &amp; fundamentals are ALIGNED PERFECTLY for a MAJOR MOVE HIGHER this coming week. AAPL P&amp;F CHART TARGET = $875.00 The P&amp;F Chart Price Target and my personal Technical Analysis line up almost perfectly. LOAD UP in AAPL – and Enjoy the ride higher… The AAPL pattern is a VERY BULLISH Ascending Triangle (Bull Flag). Here are the details: High = $644.00 Low = $363.32 Length of Move = $280.68 Breakout Level = $580.50 (Own AAPL ahead of NEW LAUNCHES of BOTH the iPhone5 and iPad Mini !!!!!!!!

Paul Ryan, R-Wis., as chair of the House Budget Committee, was part of the team that signed off on the budget deal with the White House, mandating immediate spending cuts, creating a "Super-committee" tasked to finding $1.5 trillion in further deficit rediction, and raising a self-imposed sword of Damocles - $1.2 trillion in cuts to the Pentagon and domestic spending that few in Congress wanted - if the Super-committee failed. Writing at the National Review Online at the time, Ryan said the bill was a "reasonable, responsible effort to cut government spending, avoid a default, and help create a better environment for job creation." But today Mitt Romney said Ryan, the man he picked as his running mate on the Republican presidential ticket, and other House GOP leaders made a "big mistake" in agreeing to that deal, which was part of the summer 2011 negotiations over raising the debt ceiling. Romney said the $1.2 in mandated cuts was "an extraordinary miscalculation in the wrong direction." "Republican leaders agreed to that deal to the extend the debt ceiling," NBC's David Gregory reminded Romney. "And that's a big mistake," Romney said. "I thought it was a mistake on the part of the White House to propose it. I think it was a mistake for Republicans to go along with it." - Jake Tapper The wedge is beginning to work!</Msg><Username>plzplzplayfaster</Username><Timestamp>1347203917018</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 11:18:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347203980606-120</Id><Title>AMAZON PRESS UPDATE.

Apple has 2 problems right now: 1. for the first time since the iPhone release, it is behind Samsung and needs to catch-up (during the past two months, I saw people switching away form the iPhone for the first time). 2. Apple is becoming somewhat hated because people get the sense that it's becoming too big and too powerful. Apple is no longer the underdog and many are waiting for it to fail. I think that it's virtually guaranteed that the iPhone 5 gets trashed in the media and will be portrayed as inferior to the Galaxy III. So maybe Apple does sell 10M iPhone 5s during the first week like some analysts are expecting, but my gut feeling is that it's no longer the only game in town and the iPhone is not a must-have anymore (though I will still get one).</Msg><Username>nyk20h</Username><Timestamp>1347203987597</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 11:19:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347204008131-122</Id><Topic><Title>IDIOT PHONE 5 will be a COMPLETE FAILURE !!! woooooohoooooooooooo!

In the not too distant future --- ALL of the phones using Android Software (Blatant Copies of the APPLE Mobile iOS Software) will likely be removed from the market !!! That is RIGHT – The stolen property will be simply removed from the store shelves !!!!! APPLE WILL GET JUSTICE AGAINST ALL THE THIEVES !!! Steve Jobs declared Thermo-Nuclear War on the thieves !!!

In the past 6 months, APPLE added as clients: Bechtel, Roche, Amgen, Bayer, etc. British Airways is a new client as of Last Quarter....and APPLE Execs. said that the iPad is now being used in "Smart Homes" in Japan !!!!!!!!!! With the RETINA DISPLAY on the iPad -- and access to OVER 225,000 APPS, APPLE is the only TRUSTED BRAND in the tablet market. All the other ones....are just cheap, strain your eyes book-readers.

It refuted the "Law of Large Numbers" myth with regards to APPLE INC. - which had been portrayed earlier in the day on the $hill-Network that he works for. On a side note, investors looking for a good LONG-TERM stock pick can note that EXXON MOBIL (XOM) never suffered the dramatic pullback that the other companies did....after rising to the $500 to $600 Billion Market Cap. Together, XOM and AAPL = Fortress Portfolio for the LONG-TERM. Like EXXON MOBIL, APPLE is very well-managed with strong fundamentals. I firmly believe that APPLE will continue innovating for DECADES to come. Furthermore, the APPLE ECOSYSTEM adds a "stealth value" to an investment in AAPL that is certainly not factored into the low TTM PE ratio. Here's Pi$ani's Blog essay about APPLE versus the "Law of Large Numbers" Myth.... Why Apple Isn't Finished Yet Published: Tuesday, 21 Aug 2012 | 2:38 PM ET I have been listening to debates on our air about Apple all morning, particularly about the fact that it is now has the largest market cap ever. The debate has been: is Apple worth it? Can it keep up the innovation? On the surface, the stock is having a tough day — a rare downgrade has caused a reversal, and the stock has given up almost all of its gains from yesterday on very heavy volume. I rarely editorialize on individual stocks, but since I have been a rabid Apple user for a decade I do have a strong opinion, and the answer is, yes, they can keep going. First, one argument against AAPL is its sheer size. Very few companies have ever had market caps over $500 billion, let alone $600 billion: Exxon Mobil [XOM 89.92 0.93 (+1.05%) ], General Electric [GE 21.59 0.28 (+1.31%) ], Intel [INTC 24.19 -0.905 (-3.61%) ], Microsoft [MSFT 30.95 -0.395 (-1.26%) ] and Cisco [CSCO 19.56 -0.165 (-0.84%) ]. The argument is that these companies (with the exception of XOM) eventually fell dramatically, why shouldn't it happen to AAPL? There are several reasons: 1) Apple is not overpriced. Apple is trading at about 11 times forward earnings, at a time when the S&amp;P 500 is trading at almost 14 times forward earnings. According to Topeka Capital Markets, the three tech companies (INTC, MSFT and CSCO) were trading at an average P/E of over 80 times earnings when they passed the $500 billion level. 2) Apple has plenty of room to increase its share of the products it sells. Here's the stats: Apple share of the market for: PCs 4.7% Mobile phones 6.4% Source: IDC/Topeka Capital Yes, it has 68 percent of the tablet market, but it invented that category and it is now facing stiff competition. Compare that to the share of the market that the other $500 billion market cap tech companies had at their height: Microsoft share of PC operating systems 90% Intel share of PC processor market 80% Cisco share of networking market 70% Get it? These other guys already had thoroughly penetrated their markets when they hit those big market caps. They had nowhere to go but down. That is not the case with AAPL. 3) Apple continuously reinvents its products and is growing into new categories. The iPhone 5 is the gift that keeps on giving; millions of Apple users like myself will reflexively go out and buy it. They are working on an iPad "mini." And they may be on the verge of cracking the TV conundrum. They have tried for years to get a foothold in TV, and have fallen short. But word that they are now working on a set-top box that can deliver a cable feed, rather than a full-scale TV, may be just the right approach. Forget the hardware, create software that is linked to iTunes. The problem: it's not clear they can get buy-in from cable companies. But just wait until the numbers get worse, and cable companies realize they are losing subscribers faster than they thought. This would integrate the iPad, the iPhone and Macs with iTunes...and cable TV content. Watching anything you want on your iPhone?

Regardless of your party affiliation, the facts are the facts. Here are some: FACT: The bulk of our budget deficit was caused by the Bush tax cuts and is still the cause of most of our budget deficit. FACT: Bush, Cheney and their cronies such as Rubin, Greenspan and that buffoon Larry Summers strong-armed Brooksley Born - Head of the CFTC -- from regulating the derivatives market which (CDS's, MBS's were the rocket fuel behind the housing bubble and susequent collapse) could have and should have kept this market under control. Bush's cronies hamstrung Brooksley ( Illegally I might add) long enough for republicans to pass legislation to prohibit the CFTC from doing their job and regulating the market they are supposed to regulate. Brooksley E. Born 7th Chair[1] of Commodity Futures Trading Commission In office 1996–1999 President Bill Clinton Preceded by Mary Schapiro[2] Succeeded by William Rainer Personal details Born Brooksley Elizabeth Born[3] August 27, 1940 (age 72)[3] San Francisco, California Political party Democratic Spouse(s) Alexander E. Bennett, Jacob Landau Children 5 Alma mater Stanford University, B.A. &amp; J.D. Profession Lawyer, Public official Brooksley E. Born (born August 27, 1940) is an American attorney and former public official who, from August 26, 1996, to June 1, 1999, was chairperson of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the federal agency which oversees the futures and commodity options markets. During her tenure on the CFTC, Born lobbied Congress and the President to give the CFTC oversight of off-exchange markets for derivatives in addition to its role with respect to exchange-traded derivatives,[4] but her warnings were opposed by other regulators.[5] Born resigned as chairperson on June 1, 1999, shortly after Congress passed legislation prohibiting her agency from regulating derivatives.[6] Fact: Bush got us into two unnecessary wars that cost taxpayers trillions. Fact: David Walker, Comptroller for the United States of America for four presidents called Bush "the most fiscally irresponsible President in the history of the United States." Fact: Chaney committed treason against America by intentionally leaking the classified identity of Valerie Plame, and undercover CIA operative because her husband, an ambassador was an outspoken critic of the lies Bush and Cheney created out of thin air about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. He should be in jail for his crimes. But, of course, one of his lacky's took the fall for him and did the time. Fact: Halliburton, Cheney's former company, charged the American taxpayer hundreds of millions of dollars for work they never did to clean-up the mess we caused in Iraq. Don't even get me started on Tom Delay and Abramof. So, now refresh me, what was it that the republicans did so well 4 years ago? And I suppose we should just hand the reigns back to them with no specific plans, huh. Wow, it's astonishing how brain dead this country is.

Republicans have such amazing short memories. They rely on religion to govern and they have been a disaster. They oppose foreign religious fanatic governments yet they force Religion down citizen's throats; such hypocrisy! GWB and Reagan are the latest. If not anything, answer this: What ever happened to the Separation of Church and State? It's non existence in Republican party! Refresh your memories and watch below video and see how Reagan's secret government lied to Congress and Senate and sold arms to both Iran (through Israel) &amp; Iraq to fight amongst themselves and then sent the money to the Nicaraguan terrorists. Talk about sleeping with the enemy! Over 1 million kids were killed in Iran as that stupid "religious" government promised school kids that they will go to heaven when walking over the mine fields to clear the way for the soldiers to advance the line. Reagan and both GWB's war mongering policies are the direct consequence of attacks on America. And you think none of these have had any affect on our economy? Chickens always come home to roost!

I'm old enough to have watched both live and televised pro and college tennis from the late 60s through the 70s and even into the 80s and none of the men or women players that I recall back then ever grunted when they hit the ball.

First of all, Ruben is a Republican Wall Streeter. So, to put Clinton and Ruben together as if they had the same political ideals is incorrect. Yes, Clinton did some bad things. Like allowing the republicans who drafted the bill to repeal Glass Steagal to get him to sign the bill. Big, big mistake. The new Dodd Frank legislation is a joke. It does nothing to prevent "to big to fail" and its killing the mid-size and small banks in this country that little to do with the financial crisis. Bush did nothing to try and stop the economy from crashing except putting billions in the pockets of big bankers through dirty back-door deals.

Even if the upgrades ultimately prove to be minor, Apple knows the market's been clamoring for the iPhone 5 in name at least. The Apple iPhone will remain popular, but it will lose its Revolutionary appeal. I foreshadow that the iPhone is destined to settle within an iconic consumer product cycle stage comparable to the Nike (NKE) Air Jordan franchise.

The shift from PC to smartphone has occurred, sounding the dead knell for PC players. Apple was trading for $684 Friday, up 68.73% year to date. A stock's performance is the ultimate truth. Apple's products are single handedly bringing the competition to its proverbial knees. Everyone seems to be one step behind Apple. What's more, Apple has been meticulous and tenacious in defending its King of the Hill position. In recent news, nine jurors provided a far-reaching triumph to Apple in a high-stakes battle against Samsung Electronics Co., awarding the Silicon Valley company $1.05 billion in damages and providing an impetus for further legal attacks on its competitors. Couple this delicious morsel with the fact Apple is heading into several new product launches and you can see why everyone and their brother is jumping on the Apple cart. Furthermore, Apple has a fortress balance sheet and rock solid fundamentals. Apple is still vastly undervalued based on fundamentals. Apple is trading for 15 times free cash flow. Apple's PEG ratio is .74. Apple's quarter over quarter EPS and sales growth rates are 20% and 23% respectively. Apple's net profit margin is 26.97%. Apple's ROE is 44.34% and the company has no debt. Technically, the company is in a well-defined uptrend since the start of the year. The stock has broken out to the upside recently in anticipation of expansive growth on the horizon. The stock is a buy here.</Msg><Username>cchaker</Username><Timestamp>1347237433275</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 20:37:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347237456664-359</Id><Topic><Title>It's easy to see that "knot2hard" is...</Title><Username>lakesideinvestor</Username><Timestamp>1276742386000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2010-06-16 22:39:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Consistency....</Msg><Username>hairtriggerdiarrhea</Username><Timestamp>1347237456664</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 20:37:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347237516379-360</Id><Topic><Title>ARE YOU CRAZY ??

Imagine how undervalued DANG the chinese amazon or 1 of 2 or 3 It ipo'd went to 35 and is now 5, it has done everything right, will go to 20 in 3 or 4 trading days very soon. Even better RENN, the chinese facebook and about 5 other companies, a groupon site, serious videogame and mobile games site and so much more. It ipo's went to 28 and now is under 4, that stock will go to 20 in 4 days, followed by 30 the week after. It will run even more powerful then BIDU and has just recently added the richest man in the entire country of CHINA to the RENN board of directors. Chen said after that (the ceo of RENN) he will not be happy till RENN has at least a 100 billion dollar maret cap. You figure out what that would make the share price, but the CBOE has not priced the 2014 RENN calls, they just recently did the april 2013 calls. This is highly suspicious because many that are in RENN are in DANG also. Dang has had 2014 calls available for a long time as has sold many of them. Do not take your eye off either of these stocks for even one day, and when the serious pump and loading starts, get in and keep adding heavy as much as you can afford because these will really take off. RENN should start anytime and be 16-18 by Oct expiration, the calls tell the story! Dang, that will partially depend on if amzn rises or tanks in Oct Renn has 11-29 year olds locked up as they stay glued to renren site and 34% even login by cell phone. 5 Billion more internet users come online in just this age group alone in China and China has been getting slower and slower economy for 3 years, can you imagine if that economy starts to heat up again soon? Renn will be non stop to 100, it has bagholders stuck in it right now till 28 a share. Load and get ready as the richest man in China will run as soon as Chen renn buyback is over or close to it, it looks like it wants to start running up no matter if the rich man and Chen want more time, in that case they will join in and buy like crazy...</Msg><Username>namfong43</Username><Timestamp>1347241037688</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 21:37:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347241071046-392</Id><Topic><Title>Vote Republican, please!!...LOL</Title><Username>didihala_1</Username><Timestamp>1347222915894</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 16:35:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So we saw the Romney's lies on my first post, now it's Ryan's turn (at the 2012 convention): Google: "RNC 2012 - The Road to Jeb Bush 2016 - Paul Ryan's Convenient Truths" .</Msg><Username>didihala_1</Username><Timestamp>1347241071046</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 21:37:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347241315555-393</Id><Title>Any guesses what the new features will be on the iphone 5?</Title><Msg>I heard about a slightly bigger screen but that's not a game changer and I heard that this iphone will be a game changer.

The CEOs of the PC players seem to be playing their under-promise and over-deliver cards, except they forgot how to over deliver. Don't be fooled, PC stocks are dead money for the foreseeable future. I know some pay dividends; nevertheless, this won't make up for the lost opportunity cost of holding these losing propositions. Even so, the macro environment is favorable for stocks. We are entering a seasonally favorable period for the tech sector in general. The fourth quarter is traditionally bullish for tech stocks. This is the perfect time to start a position in Apple. If you choose to start a position in any stock, I suggest layering in a quarter at a time on a weekly basis at a minimum to reduce risk. You can also set a 5% trailing stop loss order if you wish to minimize losses even further.</Msg><Username>cchaker</Username><Timestamp>1347241718693</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 21:48:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347241962329-406</Id><Topic><Title>Vote Republican, please!!...LOL</Title><Username>didihala_1</Username><Timestamp>1347222915894</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 16:35:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why do you make fun of others' religion?

What’s interesting to note is that the international launch and release dates may also coincide with the U.S. launch of the new iPhone. While historically, developing nations in the Asia Pacific and Europe get product shipments two to three months after their launch, some carriers are already hinting that they may already have the new iPhone coming. According to our sources in the Philippines, local carrier Globe Telecom has been sending SMS xoxoxo to this effect: The latest phone is almost here! Be sure to get it only from Globe, the leader in Postpaid. Interested to get updates? Text iP5 Email Address and send to 2910 for FREE. We can take it to mean that “iP5″ means the iPhone 5, which is what the sixth-generation iPhone is rumored to be branded. Moreover, Globe has an ongoing Weekend Sale, offering significant discounts for the iPhone 3GS (8GB), iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S. Could Globe be finishing off its inventory of current iPhones to give way to the new one? If I were a hardcore punk iPhone fan, I’d be waiting for the release of the new model. But perhaps first-time smartphone buyers or long-time Globe postpaid subscribers who are still on feature-phones might find the weekend sale interesting.</Msg><Username>ametrosixual</Username><Timestamp>1347245145947</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 22:45:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347245450053-439</Id><Topic><Title>Could Apple be doing a simultaneous launch of the iPhone 5 internationally?</Title><Username>ametrosixual</Username><Timestamp>1347245145947</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 22:45:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Assuming there's something to this, could doing a simultaneous launch with Asia mean they will announce a deal with China Mobile on Sept. 12?</Msg><Username>mrgizmo1</Username><Timestamp>1347245450053</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 22:50:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347245540753-440</Id><Topic><Title>It's Finally time to sell apple</Title><Username>apple_millionaire_twice_over</Username><Timestamp>1347240703901</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 21:31:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So long sucker.

My main point is that I'm against Republicans use and/or misuse of religion in order to make policy or to get votes. We have seen it too often in the Bush and Reagan years. They try to strike fear amongst people and say things like this country has to be lead by a Christian and then they say Obama is a Muslim (and obviously they are trying to make a connection between him and the terrorists). Then they come on Fox News and criticize Obama for not mentioning Religion or God in his speech!! Are you kidding me? You see where I'm going with this? What ever happened to separation of Church from State? Didn't Thomas Jefferson say that's the type of government we ought to have? What ever happened to the Secular government we are supposed to have? And even if Obama was a Muslim, what ever happened to the 1st amendment of the Constitution these Republicans keep pounding their chest with? You see the hypocrisy? As for me, I don't have a Bible and I don't believe in any Religion. I don't have a problem with people believing in a religion, I think it's good that they do, and they should be proud of it, but they should NOT whip it out in public and wave it around in other people's faces. Did you watch any of those videos I posted? Any comments? The point of posting these videos is to expose how Republicans operate. And I am not saying Democrats are doing a great job either, but between the two, they are the lessor of the two evils. We do need more than two political parties in this country.</Msg><Username>didihala_1</Username><Timestamp>1347245784866</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 22:56:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347245811493-444</Id><Topic><Title>Could Apple be doing a simultaneous launch of the iPhone 5 internationally?</Title><Username>ametrosixual</Username><Timestamp>1347245145947</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 22:45:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>As the Plot thickens...hmmm</Msg><Username>lord_chatterly</Username><Timestamp>1347245811493</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 22:56:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347246093869-445</Id><Title>Bezos said all the right things on Thursday</Title><Msg>We don't produce gadgets, we create services.

By PAMELA SAMPSON BANGKOK — Asian stock markets were mostly higher in early trading Monday, with investors betting that the Federal Reserve will likely announce new plans to stimulate the U.S. economy in response to a disappointing jobs report. The U.S. government reported Friday that 96,000 jobs were created in the U.S. last month, fewer than economists had forecast. That helped lift stocks since investors now think the Fed might announce another round of bond-buying at its next meeting on Sept. 13 to help lower interest rates and thus boost loan growth. "Risk rallies continued on hopes for further easing from the Fed," analysts from Credit Agricole CIB in Hong Kong said in a market commentary. "With soft U.S. jobs data, we expect that the FOMC will announce a new large-scale asset purchase programme at the meeting." Japan's Nikkei 225 index fell 0.2 percent to 8,855.65. South Korea's Kospi added 0.1 percent to 1,932.19 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng added 0.3 percent to 19,853.54. Benchmarks in Singapore, Taiwan, mainland China and New Zealand also rose. Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 was nearly unchanged at 4.325.40. The Dow Jones industrial average barely rose in light trading Friday following the U.S. jobs report, up 0.1 percent to close at 13,306.64. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index rose 0.4 percent to 1,437.92. The Nasdaq composite index rose less than 1 point to 3,136.42. Benchmark oil for October delivery fell 8 cents to $96.34 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract rose 89 cents to finish at $96.42 per barrel on the Nymex on Friday. In currencies, the euro dipped slightly to $1.2793 from $1.2795 late Friday in New York. The dollar fell to 78.20 yen from 78.29 yen.</Msg><Username>croatkid1</Username><Timestamp>1347246509693</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 23:08:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347246520360-448</Id><Title>Watch the stock tank after introduction of iPhone 5</Title><Msg>almost guaranteed!!</Msg><Username>johnson265d</Username><Timestamp>1347246520360</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 23:08:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347246593431-449</Id><Topic><Title>Watch the stock tank after introduction of iPhone 5</Title><Username>johnson265d</Username><Timestamp>1347246520360</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 23:08:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Blah, blah , blah</Msg><Username>pjcl123</Username><Timestamp>1347246593431</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 23:09:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347247130451-450</Id><Topic><Title>WATCHING [9/11] on FOX...</Title><Username>hornie.cock</Username><Timestamp>1347242562375</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 22:02:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You kidding me?
