This is called "exercise by exception". A broker or holder of such options may request that they not be exercised by exception. The price of the underlying security used to determine the need for exercise by exception is the price of the regular-hours trade reported last to the OCC at or before 4:01:30 pm ET on the day before expiration. This trade will have occurred during normal trading hours, i.e., before 4:00 pm. It can be any size and come from any participating exchange. The OCC reports this price tentatively at 4:15 pm, but, to allow time for exchanges to correct errors the OCC does not make the price official until 5:30 pm.

Please pay close attention to Germany and especial United Kingdom, where US laws came from: Ongoing cases: [edit]Seoul and Tokyo courts In Seoul, Samsung filed its lawsuit in the Central District Court citing five patent infringements, while its complaint in Japan's Tokyo District Court cited two.[18][20] [edit]German courts In August 2011, the Landgericht court in Düsseldorf Germany granted Apple's request for an EU-wide preliminary injunction barring Samsung from selling its Galaxy Tab v10.1 device on the grounds Samsung's product infringed on two of Apple's interface patents. After Samsung's allegations of evidence tampering were heard, the court rescinded the EU-wide injunction and granted Apple a lesser injunction that only applied to the German market.[21][22] In the same time period and in similar cases of related legal strategy, Apple filed contemporaneous suits against Motorola with regard to the Xoom and against German consumer electronics reseller JAY-tech in the same German court, both for design infringement claims seeking preliminary injunctions.[23][24] In March 2012, the Mannheim state court judges dismissed both the Apple and Samsung cases involving ownership of the 'slide-to-unlock' feature used on their respective smartphones.[25] The New York Times reported the German courts were at the center of patent fights among technology company rivals.[26] In July 2012 the Munich Higher Regional Court Oberlandesgericht München affirmed the lower Regional Court's denial of Apple's motion for a preliminary injunction on Apple's allegation that Samsung infringed Apple's 'overscroll bounce' patent; the appellate court's appealable ruling affirmed the lower court's February decision doubting the validity of Apple's patent.[27] [edit]Paris and Milan courts Shortly after the release of the iPhone 4S, Samsung filed motions for injunctions in courts in Paris and Milan to block further Apple iPhone sales in France and Italy, claiming the iPhone infringed on two separate patents of the Wideband Code Division Multiple Access standard.[28][29][30] Samsung reportedly singled out the French and Italian markets as key electronic communications markets in Europe, and by filing suit in a different court, avoided going back to the German court where it had lost a round earlier in its battle with Apple.[31] [edit]Dutch courts In late October 2011, the civil court in The Hague ruled for Apple in rejecting Samsung's infringement arguments and denied Samsung's motion made there; Samsung appealed the decision and in January 2012, the Dutch appeals court overruled the civil court decision, rejecting Apple's claim that Samsung's Galaxy Tab 10.1 infringed its design rights.[32][33] [edit]Australian courts Also in autumn 2011, an Australian federal court granted Apple's request for an injunction against Samsung's Galaxy Tab 10.1. Samsung agreed to an expedited appeal of the Australian decision in the hope that if it won its appeal before Christmas, it might salvage holiday sales that it would otherwise lose.[5] Ultimately, the injunction Apple sought to block the Tab 10.1 was denied by the Australian High Court. In July 2012 an Australian judge started hearing the companies' evidence for a trial anticipated to take three months.[34] [edit]U.K. courts Samsung motioned a U.K. court for a declaration that its Galaxy tablets were not too similar to Apple's products and Apple counterclaimed, but Samsung prevailed in a somewhat Pyrrhic victory after a U.K. judge ruled Samsung's Galaxy tablets were not “cool” enough to be confused with Apple’s iPad.[35] In July 2012, U.K. Judge Birss denied Samsung's motion for an injunction blocking Apple from publicly stating that the Galaxy infringed Apple's design rights, but ordered Apple to publish a disclaimer on Apple's own website and in the media that Samsung did not copy the iPad.[36][37] The judge stayed the publishing order, however, until Apple's appeal is heard in October 2012.[38] [edit]U.S. courts This section documents a current event. Information may change rapidly as the event progresses. (August 2012) In U.S. courts, one 2005 design patent "at the heart of the dispute is Design Patent 504,889"[39], which consists of a one-sentence claim about the ornamental design of an electronic device, accompanied by nine figures depicting a thin rectangular cuboid with rounded corners.[40] The injunction Apple sought in the U.S. to block Samsung smartphones such as the Infuse 4G and the Droid Charge was also denied. Judge Koh ruled that Apple's claims of irreparable harm had little merit because although Apple established a likelihood of success at trial on the merits of its claim that Samsung infringed one of its tablet patents, Apple had not shown that it could overcome Samsung's challenges to the patent's validity.[41][42][43] However, in June 2012, Judge Koh granted Apple's motion for a preliminary injunction as to Samsung’s Galaxy Nexus, and thus enjoined Samsung from making, using, offering to sell, selling, or importing into the U.S. the Nexus and any other of its technology making use of the disputed patent.[44] Simultaneously, Apple was ordered to post a USD$95.6 million dollar bond in the event that Samsung prevailed at trial.[44] A U.S. jury trial was scheduled for July 30, 2012[2] and calendered by the court through September 7, 2012. Both Phil Schiller and Scott Forstall testified on the Apple v. Samsung trial.[45][46] On August 24, 2012 the jury returned a verdict that is largely favorable to Apple. The jury awarded Apple $1.05 billion in damages and Samsung zero damages in its counter suit.[47] [edit]Impact Within the context of these patent wars, Google accused Apple, Oracle and Microsoft of trying to destroy the market for Android devices through patent litigation, rather than by innovating and competing with better products and services.[48] As part of a defensive measure to protect Android, in August 2011 Google started the process of purchasing Motorola Mobility for USD$12.5 billion as Motorola Mobility holds around 17,000 cellular patents.[49] [edit]</Msg><Username>pauly6734</Username><Timestamp>1345871264527</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 01:07:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345871418176-70</Id><Topic><Title>It's a real shame the jury tries to appear unbiased/non-xenophobic.

It took Samsung a meer 3 months to bring the Galaxy phone to the market. Samsung was on the defensive the whole time. Quinn Emmanuel should be ashamed how they handled this case. Wrong strategy was employed. Instead of proving how they are coming up with their phones, they're using their time to cross examine witnesses from Apple. Implications of this verdict. Samsung will appeal. However, good luck with that. Judge Lucy Koh conducts herself very well with this trail. It's almost appeal-proof. It was fair. We will see an exodus of Samsung from the shelves very soon folks. Word on the street is that, Goog, Sony, Motorola, you are next... At the end of the day, it's about fundamental. It's about the right thing. Samsung was wrong. They should have been a key partner of Appl, but instead, they saw a good thing, and they choose to steal it. The ITC ruling, and this trial of the century was what was holding AAPL. Resistance are futile now. Iphone 5, Ipad 7, Injunction... I wish I could make the clock go faster so I can see how we fair on Monday. Regardless, we should expect a 3-5% pop on Appl Stock... Goog will tank big time. They're the man behind the curtain. they're just as guilty as Samsung. Samsung is a pawn for Goog. This war is just started... but APPL just won one major battle.</Msg><Username>luvmeplezz</Username><Timestamp>1345875633210</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 02:20:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345875799047-109</Id><Topic><Title>Any predictions on the Open and Close on Monday?</Title><Username>mrsodall</Username><Timestamp>1345872694777</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 01:31:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I also was long before both the 4S conference and the drop last Feb - May. I think that the momentum now to move higher is much stronger than last Feb - May. That was the first time that AAPL hit 640 after a very fast runup &amp; no product refreshes to look forward to for awhile. Now we have this court ruling coupled with a number of product refreshes/launches just around the corner. Bottom line for me is that there's so much good news surrounding AAPL that even if the iPhone 5 disappoints, which I doubt it will, this puppy has so much momentum going for it that it's going much much higher until the Q22013 results are announced in April. Then it may consolidate, but not for long. AAPL's been a great long term investment, just keep holding and stockpile more on any dips. Only global geopolitical uncertainty could cause this rocket ship to slow down and create even better buying opportunities.</Msg><Username>johndvogel</Username><Timestamp>1345875799047</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 02:23:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345875838560-110</Id><Title>wow, samsung still lost the case with one google engineer as juror</Title><Msg>very interesting. the copy must be very obvious to all of them..</Msg><Username>apple99999</Username><Timestamp>1345875838560</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 02:23:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345875994605-111</Id><Topic><Title>Next week AEA post: "shorted 1400shares Aapl at 722.21....COVERED 720.15 (for myself)"</Title><Username>thecramerflipflop</Username><Timestamp>1345874739951</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 02:05:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He would post short at 665 covered 664.3</Msg><Username>werweng2000</Username><Timestamp>1345875994605</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 02:26:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345876071281-112</Id><Topic><Title>wow, samsung still lost the case with one google engineer as juror</Title><Username>apple99999</Username><Timestamp>1345875838560</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 02:23:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I haven't heard this, do you have a link?

It's that simple guys. I can't believe the Apple bashers, etc that are saying Apple is now the most hated company. First off Samsung knowingly copied so they only have themselves to blame. Apple and Google both asked samsung to stop copying but to no avail. Apple even agreed to license their patents to Samsung because of their strong supplier relationship. Again they ignored the plee's and offers. So I can't understand the negative Apple reaction. Long or short, no one can argue that Samsung didn't copy the iphone/ ipad - the evidence is overwhelming!

Samsung has been copying Apple for so long that people seem to have forgotten this fact (including Samsung). It seems like time distorts reality.

Imagine how rich you'd be if you had any brains at all when it was $15 bucks. Funny thing is, I can hear you morons saying it again at $700 and $800. Don't worry though, at some point, they are going to have to split this thing and maybe it will be at $500 again. But hey, keep trying to predict the top for Apple.

(AAPL) didn’t infringe two patents owned by Google Inc. (GOOG)’s Motorola Mobility unit for wireless technologies used throughout the electronics industry, a U.S. trade agency said yesterday in a decision that reduces the likelihood of an import ban on the iPhone. The U.S. International Trade Commission didn’t completely resolve the companies’ dispute, ordering a trade judge to reconsider Motorola Mobility’s claim that Apple violated another patent. The judge had previously found no violation of that patent, which applies to a sensor used to determine the proximity of a person’s head to the phone so it doesn’t accidentally hang up. The commission could have stopped shipments of the iPhone and iPad at the border had it upheld Judge Thomas Pender’s earlier finding that Apple infringed a patent for 3G technology. That determination had prompted criticism that the agency shouldn’t ban imports of products that infringe patents related to technological standards used by an entire industry.</Msg><Username>seafoodsnacks</Username><Timestamp>1345886961518</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 05:29:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345887661579-180</Id><Topic><Title>I have shorted Aug 665 calls, news came out after 6PM, what happened to these calls???</Title><Username>williamweizhang</Username><Timestamp>1345859444412</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 21:50:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It is the reason you use brokers that don't charge much and close out before the end of market so you don't have to worry about this question.

We chose legal action very reluctantly and only after repeatedly asking Samsung to stop copying our work. For us this lawsuit has always been about something much more important than patents or money. It’s about values. We value originality and innovation and pour our lives into making the best products on earth. And we do this to delight our customers, not for competitors to flagrantly copy. We owe a debt of gratitude to the jury who invested their time in listening to our story. We were thrilled to finally have the opportunity to tell it. The mountain of evidence presented during the trial showed that Samsung’s copying went far deeper than we knew. The jury has now spoken. We applaud them for finding Samsung’s behavior willful and for sending a loud and clear message that stealing isn’t right. I am very proud of the work that each of you do. Today, values have won and I hope the whole world listens.

Samsung screwed up by putting those patents forward to be included in a wireless standard, becuse they now have the fair and reasonable (FRAND) licensing obligation. And this is nothing that a crooked judge in Korea can award to Samsung, this is the wireless standards, and the overseeing authority will just go in and strip Samsung of the patents if they continue to try to hold companies hostage. Now, tha Apple patents, on the other hand, are not included in any wireless standards, thay are usability patents that make Apple phones and tablets the easiest and most wonderful devices in the world to use. Samsung willingly decided to infringe Apple's usability patents that were not included in any wireless standard, so now they are up a creek with no paddle. Because they are not included in any wireless standards, Apple's patents, unlike Samsung's, have no FRAND licensing requirement, and Apple may choose to license than at what you would think are excessive rates, or, choose to not license them at all to any company other than Apple. And don;t play on a high horse with Samsung, they are the dirtiest patent infringer in the world, as shown by their dealings with Interdigtal and Rambus just in this country.</Msg><Username>pumpingceosaintgood</Username><Timestamp>1345897839679</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 08:30:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345898034029-236</Id><Title>Kopykat Samsung must pay big dollars to honest Apple</Title><Msg>billions and billions...

AAPL has more patent suits pending against HTC and Motorola Mobility (owned by Google) and they might also go after Amazon that's involved in Android. At some point, they might even sue Google that developed software platform for Android and benefited from it in terms of search ad revenue. AAPL's 2013 EPS would probably be increased to $60 which means stock price would be in the range of $720-$900 for the next twelve months. 720 is like a new base which will be achieved within the next two weeks.

I was sure Apple was going to bid to get Motorola's patents, they are a cheap company that does not like to pay for anything.. Google now owns the patents for set-top boxes, Lets see who far Apple can get with that. About 17% of Apple's business is in the U.S., Google and Samsung will win in many countries and limit Apple's ability to expand.

People all over the world, including China, have been holding off buying a new Iphone for probably 6 months just so they can buy the new model when it comes out, just so they have the latest and greatest toy. They still stand in lines for many days at Apple stores in China whenever a new Apple device is released, and Apple devices sell at incredibly high premiums on internet reseller sites she a new product comes out because the rest of the world wants them the minute they come out. And Apple products are still viewed as extreme status symbols in China, like new cars.

Samsung lost on all counts, except in the tablet patent battle, but that victory doesn’t count that much and I’ll tell you later why. “The impact on Samsung will be quite limited, as affected models are mostly legacy products and its new products did make some design changes to avoid potential litigation,” said D.J.

I hope the Koreans and Chinese start getting battered by the film industry, record industry, clothing designers, watch manufacturers and others as well. Those who steal technology and profit from that theft are no different that any other type of thief. In this case, if justice prevails on appeal (and absent a settlement which should now be likely) there will be 2-3 years of appeals, this should resolve with Samsung paying a fine to APPL (disgorgement of some level of profits from the theft) and future royalties for continued use. And yes, others who have stolen APPL's intellectual property should start paying a royalty to avoid a similar fate.</Msg><Username>nohype88</Username><Timestamp>1345905672511</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 10:41:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345905696650-390</Id><Topic><Title>Poor Apple bashers/Samsung pumpers seem so very angry this morning.</Title><Username>pumpingceosaintgood</Username><Timestamp>1345903836511</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 10:10:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Merissa Ree fired from CNBC Journalism is now officially dead LOL</Msg><Username>askmeformypicture</Username><Timestamp>1345905696650</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 10:41:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345905701266-391</Id><Topic><Title>Wonder when AAPL will confirm 9/12 as that will be another pop up</Title><Username>mjtls</Username><Timestamp>1345903318905</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 10:01:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Whats 9/12</Msg><Username>aaplretiree</Username><Timestamp>1345905701266</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 10:41:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345905706802-392</Id><Topic><Title>Stupid CNBC verdict coverage (lack of)</Title><Username>tangos88888</Username><Timestamp>1345901111120</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 09:25:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Owned by comcast...... and scared the Apple business model will reduce them to being a dumb pipe!

Seriously. FIrst and foremost - IT IS A WIN Next, Samsung will have to post a very large bond on appeal given the more that $1 Billion award. They will have massive attorneys fees and costs on appeal, They also have to work out some way of continuing to sell the patent infringing products and the only way I know to achieve that is royalty payments to AAPL. Then, there is the immediate benefit to APPL of certainty. They can now approach others who have similarly stolen AAPL technology and play "Let's Make a Deal." This has huge immediate benefits to AAPL that will translate to even greater earnings. Fortunately for AAPL longs, the big fish in the market won't take long to figure out that APPL was undervalued before this verdict and is now significantly undervalued.</Msg><Username>nohype88</Username><Timestamp>1345906270595</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 10:51:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345906309031-410</Id><Topic><Title>This is ONE time I wish AEA/SIG/SONW actually had the money to have shorted AAPL</Title><Username>nohype88</Username><Timestamp>1345905151933</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 10:32:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Guess you did not see the AH action Friday nite.

Apple gave up and there was a settlement in the Nokia vs Apple suit. I don't think Google will have any problem going around any Apple patent with all the prior art at the patent office. Apple should quit while they are ahead of the game in the U.S. A big, popular company like Apple may get a court to side their way at first but don't push it to a point of self destruction. Apple made a game controller that is the same as the Sony controller, next case. Apple wants to get into the set-top box business? Motorola sells more set-top boxes than Cisco, does anyone think Apple could make a set-top box that does not infringe on Motorola and Cisco? good luck. Will Google cross license those Motorola patents that Apple infringe on?, Motorola invented the cell phone, get real. Up to now Apple was able to innovate some great products with support from most in the same business. Apple helped make the smartphone a product every company could take to the bank and grow, if Apple helped make this a 200 Billion dollar business, it would have never happened without the likes of IBM, Microsoft, Sony, Nokia, Samsung, Kodak, Motorola and others.. I bought my first IBM computer in 1979 at a cost after buying all the boards I needed of $3,500, IBM was the backbone for all companies building computers, they did not stop innovation. Bill Gates gave Apple $125 million, they were about to go bankrupt at the time.

And there is still plenty of competition, from multiple companies/countries all over the world. 3. You are allowed to gain a monopoly position, if you have gained it through product differentiation and have committed no anti-trust activities.

Note the word underestimated. I am looking for 60 bucks at least. I am just saying that the market isn't putting anywhere near a premium on Apple nor does it know what a premium is. The 780 figure was just number based on what a premium would look like to the market on Monday. Also note the remark about education at the end of my post. We are not dealing with prople that can multiply or divide thus 600 to 660 looks parabolic to them where as 21 to 24 just looks like just a nice move. If Apple were trading like it should it would be over 1000 Now but we have to deal with the market we have not the one we want.</Msg><Username>docproc1_2000</Username><Timestamp>1345907814688</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 11:16:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345907973290-441</Id><Title>Hey Samsung...</Title><Msg>How do you like them Apples!

Patent Wars: Here’s What Apple’s Landmark Victory Means for Shareholders August 25, 2012 Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock is set for another leg up. The tech giant won more than $1 billion from Samsung after a jury concluded Samsung infringed six of seven patents for Apple’s mobile devices. Although Apple won less than half the damages the company requested, U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh has the power to triple the damages under federal law. Either way, Apple walks away with a nice pile of cash AND a legal moat around their distinctive designs. So, what does this all mean for shareholders? If you own Apple you can now expect markets to apply a premium to the stock as the company’s products will have more distinctive differentiation against competitors. If you own Samsung or other stocks such as Nokia (NYSE:NOK) or Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) which are exposed to hardware markets in which Apple competes, expect more money to be spent on design and a newfound inability to simply copy everything Apple creates. Basically, Apple just got a whole lot more powerful.</Msg><Username>white_knight_in_texas</Username><Timestamp>1345908568733</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 11:29:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345908611084-453</Id><Topic><Title>ALERT!

Our Kevin Kwang in Singapore rounded up the basics via a bevy of reports (Bloomberg, Yonhap, WSJ). The Seoul Central District Court found that Apple's iPhone violated two Samsung patents. Samsung violated one Apple patent. The sales bans don't cover the latest products from Samsung and Apple. Apple reportedly has to stop selling the iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4 and the first and second iPads in South Korea. Samsung needs to stop selling 12 products---Galaxy S, Galaxy S II and Galaxy Tab. Even assuming home court advantage for Samsung, the ruling is notable given the patent battles going on with Apple vs. Samsung in the U.S. and Australia. The big takeaway here is not the ruling as much as it is an avenue to end the patent madness. If both parties suffer somehow it's likely that the patent lawsuits will at least slow down. Both Apple and Samsung are going for the mutually assured patent destruction route. Be careful what you ask for.</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1345911304947</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 12:15:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345911311578-514</Id><Topic><Title>Question for doc, white knight, chuck, or nohype...or other longs</Title><Username>todd0888</Username><Timestamp>1345557968510</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 10:06:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think it is a little early to say there will be declining iPhone sales until we see what Sept 12 brings and a possible China Mobile announcement timing. Usually these new products have huge sales and there have been a lot of delays waiting for this introduction. This introduction also is early in the quarter than many of the early product announcements which will pull in more volume. If a China Mobile announcement then comes it will propel it more depending on timing. Sometimes earnings are not the deciding factor in market response as much as anticipation of the future. I think you will have to be very nimble if you are expecting a sell off the last one lasted one day. I have always said the sell off may come but will it get back to todays price if it is very far off. I don't day trade aapl I hold long term.</Msg><Username>rlbeard6734</Username><Timestamp>1345911311578</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 12:15:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345911414520-515</Id><Topic><Title>Bought 400c Aug24 665 put 30</Title><Username>aea_k9</Username><Timestamp>1345837771932</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 15:49:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>........</Msg><Username>lorhatterly</Username><Timestamp>1345911414520</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 12:16:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345911419921-516</Id><Topic><Title>Does anyone have time frame for Judge Koh to make decision on Awards ????????</Title><Username>rndyjensen</Username><Timestamp>1345910063375</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 11:54:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hey rndyjensen...easy man!

The Jury found WILLFUL INFRINGEMENT. READ THIS............ Enhanced Remedies for Willful Infringement What is Willful Infringement? In a patent infringement lawsuit, willful infringement occurs when an infringer intentionally copies a patented invention or continues copying a patented invention after receiving notification of the patent infringement. If a court finds that the patent infringement was willful, it could award the patent holder up to three times the damages determined in court, in addition to attorney’s fees. Factors sometimes used in determining willful infringement include: 1.Whether the infringer blatantly copied the patent, or if the infringer legitimately attempted to design around the patent, 2.After receiving knowledge of the patent, if the infringer developed a good faith belief that the patent was invalid or not infringed 3.After knowledge of patent rights, if the infringer exercised due care to avoid infringement, 4.Whether the infringer received an attorney’s opinion, and 5.How the infringer acted during the litigation. It is important to note that simply finding that there was no “literal infringement” does not absolve a party from liability for willfulness. Enhanced Remedies In normal patent infringement cases, monetary damages are awarded based on the amount of money a patent owner likely lost due to the patent infringement. In the case of willful infringement, the court can enhance monetary awards by up to three times that amount as a type of punishment for the infringer’s egregious actions. A court is also allowed to award attorney’s fees and costs to reimburse the patent owner for the expenses involved in litigation.</Msg><Username>white_knight_in_texas</Username><Timestamp>1345912413860</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 12:33:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345912420236-547</Id><Title>Market quietly AMZM move from PE 150 to 300 without news headlines, Appleheads pumping everyday, iphone rumor every 5 mins</Title><Msg>gggggggggggggg</Msg><Username>aea_75</Username><Timestamp>1345912420236</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 12:33:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345912420421-548</Id><Topic><Title>If iphone5 and ipad mini are going to be huge why have apple earnings ests for next yr fallen last 30 days?</Title><Username>graytonbythesea</Username><Timestamp>1345690880680</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 23:01:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>the reason those where dropped are due to readjustments to earnings estimates due to the reduced estimate from last quarters reports as they came in several dollars below most analyst estimates.

Samsung infringed on Apple's patent on a wide variety of products. On Apple's "pinch and zoom" '915 patent, the jury found that Samsung infringed on all but three products. For the "double-tap to zoom" '163 patent, the jury found that Samsung infringed on a wide number of products, but not all. The jury found that Samsung took actions that it knew or should have known were infringing across the '381, '915, and '163 patents on most, though not on all, counts. For the '677 patent, covering Apple's trade dress registration of the look of the front of the iPhone, the jury found that Samsung did infringe on most devices, but again, not all. For the D'087 patent, covering Apple's trade dress registration of the look of the back of the iPhone, the jury found that Samsung did infringe on some devices, but not all. For the '305 patent, covering the trade dress registration of the iPhone's home screen, the jury found that Samsung infringed across most devices. For the D'889 patent, covering the trade dress registration of the iPad's appearance, the jury found that Samsung's tablets do not infringe -- one of the first victories for Samsung. --------------------- My note: Only 381, 915, 163 involved functions. 915, 163 involved with zoom. It doesn't say the whole operating system infringes AAPL patents. These can be easily corrected by a firmware update. The others related the looks of devices, including the home screen. These can be easily redesigned in future products.</Msg><Username>mambo237</Username><Timestamp>1345920158835</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 14:42:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345920196858-636</Id><Topic><Title>AMZN PE is 300!!!!!!!!!!!! and continue to go up insane</Title><Username>israelmichel</Username><Timestamp>1345838994408</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 16:09:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>amzn will still be huge in 5 years...will apple...i doubt it</Msg><Username>icky22mb</Username><Timestamp>1345920196858</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 14:43:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345920315779-637</Id><Topic><Title>Can Apple Broker A Deal ...</Title><Username>scropos21</Username><Timestamp>1345918974703</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 14:22:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Don't forget Samsung is Apples biggest supplier of parts for the iphone and ipad...I believe they will come to some agreement on licensing fees..But with Google it's a different story..I say rip there heart out...</Msg><Username>marine_1290</Username><Timestamp>1345920315779</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 14:45:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345920344462-638</Id><Topic><Title>what patents infringed</Title><Username>mambo237</Username><Timestamp>1345920158835</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 14:42:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yeah can be easily corrected by a firmware update that eliminates pinch to zoon and double-tap to zoom and makes the phone useless garbage</Msg><Username>musichead2005</Username><Timestamp>1345920344462</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 14:45:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345920429040-639</Id><Topic><Title>Can Apple Broker A Deal ...</Title><Username>scropos21</Username><Timestamp>1345918974703</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 14:22:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If samsung refuses to sell parts for apple products, they will end up a step away from being out of business.</Msg><Username>musichead2005</Username><Timestamp>1345920429040</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 14:47:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345920513013-640</Id><Topic><Title>anyway caught using an Android phone is going to jail.</Title><Username>rustupidrwhat</Username><Timestamp>1345918207604</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 14:10:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you mean anyone? oops i guess 90% of the world going to jail then gg apple I guess they can have all slaves. dont forget if you jail break you also go to jail. control freak apple will sue you for jail breaks no jail breaks guys/gals you will be breaking apple laws.</Msg><Username>ryugo82</Username><Timestamp>1345920513013</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 14:48:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345920572831-641</Id><Title>APPPLE pulls off a 400% increase in a world-wide pathetic economy….

Apple looks like they're going to be in great shape for years to come. With each product sold their ecosystem only gets stronger. I had 0 Apple products 5 years ago, now I have 5. That just makes me more unlikely to buy another company's cellphone or tablet, etc. The iPhone 5, iPad Mini, TV??, are all huge catalysts and will only make the number of people reliant on Apple only bigger and stronger. If I have a number of songs and movies on my iTunes along with my credit card tied to my account, why am I going to buy another company's product and get it to sync? The snowball and halo effects are enormous. When someone buys an Apple product it's not just the direct money Apple gets that should be accounted for when analyzing them. It's apps, mp3s, movies, and future Apple products. It's an amazing ecosystem they have created that's only getting bigger. The battle for the living room if Apple wins it will be huge. Aside from Apple TV, what about playing video games too? It's incredible that a company this big still has the potential to grow so much.</Msg><Username>chillaxdaily</Username><Timestamp>1345920802273</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 14:53:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345921088601-648</Id><Topic><Title>what patents infringed</Title><Username>mambo237</Username><Timestamp>1345920158835</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 14:42:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>On Apple's "pinch and zoom" '915 patent, the jury found that Samsung infringed on all but three products.

I have stock in HIMX which is forming the classic cup and handle formation and its confirmed sells display driver chips to Samsung who in turn supplies displays for AAPL's iPads. Are HIMX chips in AAPL products? I wish I could get chipworks who does teardowns to find out. HIMX is having a growth rate of over 320% and a p/e of less than 5 (chip sector avg=22).

After reading over various summaries of the testimony and listening to what so-called experts had to say, I figured that both sides would end up losers in some form or fashion. Judge Lucy Koh's own warning to both sides before closing arguments seemed to predict this very outcome. I figured if anyone might be able to read the pulse of the jury, it would be her. So, while it seemed foolhardy of Apple to proceed to a verdict a few days ago, considering that they actually had more to lose than Samsung in a negative verdict, they certainly made the correct decision. Well, in legal terms, at least. More on that score in a bit. The feel I got after my research was that both parties would be found guilty of various patent infringements, but that Samsung would probably suffer a bit more than Apple. Then, Apple would have some of its patents invalidated, which could be potentially very damaging to them in the future. To round things out, Samsung would get hit for trade dress violations, the only obvious violation among all the claims on either side. Despite this, they would only be forced to pay a modest fine, and that would be the end of it. That hypothetical outcome would look like a draw on paper, but really would have been a victory for Samsung. And, if the right Apple patents were struck down, it would be open season on things like scroll bounce-back, slide to unlock, and pinch to zoom or double tap to zoom. Those features may not seem significant when considering current versions of Android in reality, but they certainly are in legal terms. In case you haven't noticed, law isn't reality, as least not as we know it. But that didn't happen. Instead, the jury came back with Samsung's worst nightmare. I don't recall hearing any legal analyst predict this bad of an outcome leading up to the verdict, so I'm pretty sure it came as a surprise to most people. Make no mistake, even though Apple didn't get all the damages they asked for, it doesn't matter. The cash was the least important item on the table. Apple now has a clear jury verdict in its favor, and walked away with all of its patents still intact. This would have been a big win, even if they were found guilty of infringing on a couple of Samsung's counter-claims. Terms in a future cross-licensing deal would have still been heavily in Apple's favor. However, with Apple cleared of all infringement claims, it's really open season on Samsung, now. With a win in hand, Apple will go into court in the Galaxy Nexus case, which has already started, with guns blazing. Samsung will probably be looking to settle, but Apple is probably going to try and leverage their first win into one that affects a much broader target- Stock Android. We've already seen a bit of this effect with the “update” that removed local search capability from the Galaxy Nexus. A temporary injunction and a voluntary device update are small potatoes, however. If Apple gets that one in court, then things could get interesting. Considering that Google/Motorola also lost out on three of their first four claims in their first suit with the ITC to try and get an import ban on Apple (also yesterday), they are starting to run low on ammo. The fourth patent claim has been remanded to a judge for examination which can take up to a year. Google/Motorola filed another suit against Apple with the ITC a week ago with seven additional claims of infringement. If Apple wins the current Samsung case, and avoids import bans in the ITC cases, they will have an almost insurmountable upper hand here in the Unites States. At the end of the day, what does all of this nonsense mean? It's hard to say right now. You have to remember that, because of the glacial pace of judicial proceedings, the OS versions and devices that many of these current suits focus on are either out of production, or are at the end of their shelf lives. Google and its OEMs have already moved on from some of the features and concepts that Apple claims infringe their patents and trade dress. Samsung was Apple's primary target in this round because of the obviousness of the trade dress claims against older phones like the Fascinate. However, one look at the S III will show that they have chosen to head in a much different design direction lately. Samsung's skin, TouchWiz, has also undergone a similar overhaul, and now bears very little resemblance to anything in iOS on the surface. I would argue that these developments are actually a positive outcome of all this patent litigation. Most likely due to legal pressures, Samsung has decided to change parts of both their hardware and software design philosophies, which has lead to more differentiation between their products and Apple's. That's a good thing for the wireless industry. Unfortunately, Samsung just couldn't resist ripping off a little more of Apple's stuff in their latest round of software updates beneath the new look of TouchWiz. S-Voice? Really? Come on Samsung. You could at least try and hide the copying. On that point, Apple won its verdict today, not because they claimed that Samsung copied directly, but because they convinced the jury that there was brand dilution due to Samsung infringing their trade dress. Even if Samsung's latest round of “Apple-inspired” features aren't direct copies, today's verdict proves that they don't have to be to infringe. So, even though Samsung's new hardware is now very different, the software side is likely open to more suits from Apple. You can bet on that.</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1345921261177</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 15:01:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345921278276-656</Id><Topic><Title>this verdict is a 'duhhh'.....</Title><Username>kowskis2</Username><Timestamp>1345850806292</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 19:26:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Uhhh, did you hear the news?

The tech giant won more than $1 billion from Samsung after a jury concluded Samsung infringed six of seven patents for Apple’s mobile devices. Although Apple won less than half the damages the company requested, U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh has the power to triple the damages under federal law. Either way, Apple walks away with a nice pile of cash AND a legal moat around their distinctive designs. So, what does this all mean for shareholders? If you own Apple you can now expect markets to apply a premium to the stock as the company’s products will have more distinctive differentiation against competitors. If you own Samsung or other stocks such as Nokia or Google which are exposed to hardware markets in which Apple competes, expect more money to be spent on design and a newfound inability to simply copy everything Apple creates. Basically, Apple just got a whole lot more powerful.</Msg><Username>cchaker</Username><Timestamp>1345923397237</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 15:36:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345923501598-677</Id><Title>CA jury can't make me buy an iphone</Title><Msg>I will never buy an overpriced Crapple product.</Msg><Username>spx1018</Username><Timestamp>1345923501598</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 15:38:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345923599139-678</Id><Topic><Title>Judge KOH has the power to triple the patent infringments awards...</Title><Username>cchaker</Username><Timestamp>1345923397237</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 15:36:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I hope Judge KOH brings back to our great nation what was actually stolen.

Now tech companies have to think ahead of time before they do anything, because money can be made so easily by fighting on court insteading on the market.</Msg><Username>werweng2000</Username><Timestamp>1345923804737</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 15:43:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345924017116-684</Id><Topic><Title>Jan14 $700 calls looking gold</Title><Username>santacruzmogul</Username><Timestamp>1345923182381</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 15:33:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>did you mean Jan13...?!?</Msg><Username>kokohead1</Username><Timestamp>1345924017116</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 15:46:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345924027946-685</Id><Topic><Title>You know what, I never liked AAPL's features anyway</Title><Username>discountbrains</Username><Timestamp>1345921222000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 15:00:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>my goodness, overreacting there aren't we? interesting you brought up mental institution. is that something you know a lot about? ok, aapl's patents have allowed them to make a lot of money, but how important are they in real advances to anything?</Msg><Username>discountbrains</Username><Timestamp>1345924027946</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 15:47:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345924085237-686</Id><Topic><Title>People hate monoply more than infringement outside of US and US only counts for 17%</Title><Username>werweng2000</Username><Timestamp>1345906216006</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 10:50:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Also, that's why EU countries actually hates Apple..and so do China, Korea and Japan.

You can't see past anything that's already too well known. That's because you really don't know how to evaluate stocks. Some stocks have tremendous value yet you don't even know they're there. There is very low risk here: I have stock in HIMX which is forming the classic cup and handle formation and its confirmed sells display driver chips to Samsung who in turn supplies displays for AAPL's iPads. Are HIMX chips in AAPL products? I wish I could get chipworks who does teardowns to find out. HIMX is having a growth rate of over 320% and a p/e of less than 5 (chip sector avg=22). HIMX will likely double soon or even go to $6. Why is no one paying attention? Why can't I close the deal. LOOK UP HIMX's FINANCIAL DATA AND SEE FOR YOURSELF! Even if you trade aapl options I don't think you can do any better.

Would not be too surprised to see it cross over $700 intraday on Monday. Conceivably, even higher. As we cross over into the 680s, the 720+ area will likely follow shortly thereafter. I think we can see $720-$730 intraday within next week. No doubt, AAPL is headed MUCH higher! Catch the wave! Would appreciate all your inputs on this regarding what you think will be the intraday hi/lo on Monday, August 27th, and also the hi/lo intraday by next Friday, August 31st. Thx!

I look at the product and all the specifications and buy what I like! cell phone is nothing different than a computer. Rounded and rectangle is ones invention and we have pay for that. all my dell monitor rectangle and rounded edge. I go and get ios or android os or microsoft..I dont go and get confused with iphone and samsung. that is very very very useless argument. and I wonder how the verdict happend. This clearly #$%$... make no dam sense ...i guess to all the dumb #$%$. appl investors ,, it make sense . This give the case to HTC, now they can go and sue the shizz of aapl because HTC made first smartphone........... Samsung be on the offensive in terms of defending their tablets with rectangular rounded corners that came out BEFORE Apple even had sketches of rectangular rounded tablets? Why don't they start litigation so they may get the patent which belongs to them and should never have been given to Apple. Or does the patent rightfully belong to Sony? All I know is that Apple products cost a lot more than others which distinguishes them from everyone else. I mean just take a look at their PC costs vs every other manufacturer. That is why I am wondering what all this talk about confusion comes about? This verdict will obviously be overturned by the higher US court made up of intellectuals. There are just too many things wrong with both how this trial was handled and what the verdicts came out to be. This is the reason why jury system's are balanced by allowing for higher courts to review cases such as this one.</Msg><Username>hana_2828</Username><Timestamp>1345942489554</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 20:54:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345942545953-981</Id><Topic><Title>Bring me a shorty.. im a f ing #$%$.</Title><Username>whetpharttter</Username><Timestamp>1345941468026</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 20:37:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why are you so adamant about deflating someone's morale?

INVEST (And - REINVEST DIVIDENDS) in AAPL for the LONG-TERM !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</Msg><Username>white_knight_in_texas</Username><Timestamp>1345944866278</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 21:34:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345944981044-1004</Id><Topic><Title>All CAPS = auto IGNORE! let them talking to them self</Title><Username>aea_35</Username><Timestamp>1345944151518</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 21:22:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>F/UK YOU, YOU JACKA&amp;&amp;</Msg><Username>erhectyle_dysfunction</Username><Timestamp>1345944981044</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 21:36:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345945004931-1005</Id><Title>Buy Apple or Short Google</Title><Msg>which will net more this week?</Msg><Username>dreidel_boy</Username><Timestamp>1345945004931</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 21:36:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345945154826-1006</Id><Topic><Title>Buy Apple or Short Google</Title><Username>dreidel_boy</Username><Timestamp>1345945004931</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 21:36:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>well since good doesnt make any real money on android, it doesnt really affect them that much.

Usually those are in a google search or a youtube video. Mostly search. Again.....iPhone users use google search as much or more than android users do. I cant think of one reason they put android out there except to damage Apple, which they did successfully. Had there been no android, Apple would likely be selling 3x as many iPhones as they are now. Thats my understanding of it anyways. Theres no revenue stream for google from android that doesnt also exist in iphone. They make money on ads placed in google searches.</Msg><Username>musichead2005</Username><Timestamp>1345945621941</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 21:47:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345945708240-1010</Id><Topic><Title>WHAT IF THERE IS A DELAY ON THE IPHONE5</Title><Username>samman14</Username><Timestamp>1345944021778</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 21:20:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you say "i bet...." - what is your basis for this</Msg><Username>kokohead1</Username><Timestamp>1345945708240</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 21:48:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345945737137-1011</Id><Topic><Title>Everything priced in already</Title><Username>erhectyle_dysfunction</Username><Timestamp>1345657290822</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 13:41:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wrong....again.

Now the smartphone manufacturers have two options: they can pay Apple loyalty and continue selling their phones as is, or they have to come up with their own to avoid the Apple IPs. IMO, they would like to choose the 2nd option but they will have tough time to come up with their own. So they are likely choose the first option, paying loyalty to Apple. As Apple is setting to announce another design wins through iPhone5, Apple will put all smartphone manufacturers behind a long curve to catch it. It's not only Samsung but all Android smartphone manufacturers would have a big obstacles to move forward. As a result, Apple's forward earnings prospects looks great. The best is yet to come for Apple.

Right now, with the verdict being a catalyst and also offering a "moat of protection" around the APPLE ECOSYSTEM, I believe that AAPL will be "revalued" (rerated) and awarded a higher PE multiple by Wall Street.

The problem is they still don't get the message out of this verdict - don't copy someone else's that are protected by law. It's that simple. If they think it was so simple, why couldn't they come up with it before Apple? In fact, Apple was not a phone vendor until its iPhone debut in 2007. So what did they do when they had opportunity to come up with such simple design and methods? It's just another Columbus Egg scenario. I bet, Samsung and all other Android smartphone manufacturers will never come up with a better design and functions than Apple's iPhone going forward, simply because they have not yet realized what mistakes they made... Whether Samsung appeals the verdict or not, the conclusion would be the same. Apple will win again.

I guess stealing is okay as long as it is from a big company, is that right? What if Samsung had stolen the product from a small start up company that hoped to make it big and two guys lost their whole life savings and went bankrupt? Would that be okay too?</Msg><Username>moody.brent16</Username><Timestamp>1345952439613</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 23:40:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345952513980-1113</Id><Topic><Title>I love Joos they are so hot and manly</Title><Username>whetpharttter</Username><Timestamp>1345941859203</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 20:44:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You would love to shove your dik up a guys a&amp;&amp;.

It's all about investor perception -- and keeping the price low and affordable to a young teen working part-time -- is important in my view. After all, there are a LOT of the younger generation that love APPLE's products who would also love to purchase one or more shares of AAPL stock. I think APPLE Management will likely split the shares....following a major move higher after the iPhone 5 and iPad Mini launches. I believe a 10 for 1 split at $1,000.00 per share would be prudent. Within one (1) year, I sincerely believe that AAPL will be trading above $1,000.00 per share. INVEST in AAPL for the LONG-TERM !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</Msg><Username>white_knight_in_texas</Username><Timestamp>1345952632526</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 23:43:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345952665492-1116</Id><Topic><Title>iphone 5 delayed</Title><Username>jcampo3</Username><Timestamp>1345950777047</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 23:12:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Perhaps a redesign to make the screen larger.</Msg><Username>stem_osir</Username><Timestamp>1345952665492</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 23:44:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345952790780-1117</Id><Topic><Title>Apple cleared for takeoff-$720 in sight</Title><Username>santacruzmogul</Username><Timestamp>1345943601886</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 21:13:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I will wipe my #$%$ with you when Apple opens Monday-long 1500 shares #$%$wipe.</Msg><Username>santacruzmogul</Username><Timestamp>1345952790780</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 23:46:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345953089037-1118</Id><Topic><Title>THIS RULING WILL BE OVER TURN BY HIGHER COURT: THIS IS #$%$</Title><Username>hana_2828</Username><Timestamp>1345942489554</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 20:54:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I can't wait to read the U.S. Court of Appeals opinion.
