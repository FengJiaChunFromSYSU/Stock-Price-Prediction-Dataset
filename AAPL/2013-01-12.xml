Vendors will move 142 million units of this device in 2013 and up to 402 million by 2015, project analysts at Barclays. That’s more than three times the number of iPhones sold in 2012. And, oh yeah, Apple doesn’t make one of these. It’s called a phablet. As in, an extra-large phone that’s almost as big as a tablet, combining aspects of both. Phablet is the terrible name granted to this class of 5-inch and larger phones by a derisive press corps, which mocked one of the earliest and most visible examples of this trend, Samsung’s 5.3-inch Galaxy Note. Then, surprising everyone but Samsung, the Note turned out to be a hit, selling 10 million units as of last summer. An explosion of phablets Samsung recently rolled out the Galaxy Note II, which is a hair larger than the Galaxy Note and looks to be an even bigger hit, selling 5 million units in just the first three months since launch. Subsequently, dozens of phone makers have announced their own phablets, including the consumer electronics giants of mainland China, ZTE and Huawei; Taiwan’s HTC and Lenovo; Sony; American manufacturer Vizio; South Korea’s LG; and even one Shenzhen, China, manufacturer called Zopo that is making phablets its primary focus. Not to mention a stream of cheap knock-offs from vendors with no brand at all. So what’s going on here? When analysts declare that “we expect 2013 to be the Year of the Phablet,” have they lost their minds? Are phablets the netbooks of 2013, doomed to be produced in mass quantities but yielding a user experience so unsatisfying that the category eventually dies? Quite the opposite, I’d argue. In fact, I’m willing to bet that Phablets are going to be the PCs of this decade. They will become the default computing device of most of the developing world, and a surprising proportion of those who live in rich countries will eventually sign on, as well. The reasons are pretty simple. In emerging markets, consumers need a single device that can do absolutely everything We thought that device would be the phone, but given the popularity of tablets, it turns out that bigger really is better. For example phablets are taking over in India. “Earlier I was using a smartphone and also had a tablet but later realised that a phablet was better as you can make calls and use it as a tablet as well,” one student told the Times of India. That pretty much sums it up: If your budget is limited, why deal with two different upgrade cycles and two different devices, when you can put all of your money into a single device? And now that device, which is probably your primary computer, has wireless data connectivity wherever you go. Low-end phablets are going for as little as 6,000 rupees ($110) in India. Consumers in rich countries don’t need phones anymore, and they’re demanding bigger screens US journalists love to hold phablets up to their heads in order to prove how ridiculous they are as phones, but that misses the point: the fraction of time we spend using these devices for phone conversations continues to shrink. In surveys, time spent on calls comes in fourth after web browsing, social media, music and gaming, and on average may represent as little as 10% of the two hours a day we spend on our “phones.” The latest phablets exemplify this trend. Sharp has created a ridiculously high-resolution touchscreen with a 5-inch diagonal that has the same resolution as high-end HD televisions with 64 times as much surface area. For reference, these have a resolution of 440 pixels per inch, compared to the much-ballyhooed “retina” display in the iPhone 5, which has 326 pixels per inch. That’s a resolution so high that the average user probably can’t even tell the difference. And yet these screens have made it into so many of the latest high-end phablets that Sharp can barely keep up with demand. High-end phablets are starting to include processors and storage capacity that put them on par with low-end laptops. They can be full media centers capable of driving giant televisions and high-end sound systems. There is also some indication that screen size has become aspirational, as users seek to differentiate their devices from the endless litany of regular smartphones. Having a single connected device is a good way to reduce the cost of bandwidth Users do not require any more convincing that tablets are great; in 2013, they’re going to buy more of them than laptop computers. The problem is that the carrier-centric nature of much wireless connectivity in rich countries locks users into high monthly fees for the privilege of accessing the cell network. That’s probably one reason why phablets are taking off in Asia and other emerging markets, where pay-as-you-go plans and devices that accommodate multiple sim cards (to allow users to use more than one carrier) are more common. In either case, wireless bandwidth is still relatively expensive, so using a single device for most lightweight computing and connectivity makes sense. The idea that a phablet is less portable is a red herring Sure, many phablets are so large that they can’t fit in your pocket, but that’s a very male tech writer view of smartphones. Stashed in a purse or a bag, a phablet is no less portable than an e-reader or a small tablet, and users don’t seem to have a problem toting those just about everywhere. Clearly, for millions of people, a phablet that eliminates the need for owning and carrying two separate devices—a phone and a tablet—is a better solution. Apple could be forced to follow suit At least one analyst, Topeka Capital Markets’s Brian White, insists that Apple could come out with an iPhone with a bigger screen by this summer. That would fit the pattern set by the iPad Mini, in which other manufacturers produced what looked like a viable product category—the 7-inch tablet—and Apple decided it was a market opportunity worth pursuing. Unlike netbooks, a faddish category which Apple famously ignored, phablets tend to be high-end devices that fit with Apple’s pattern of making best in class hardware that allows the company to maintain its high margins. Apple’s strength has always been taking others’ good ideas and improving on them, anyway. It may sound absurd, but there’s one way Apple could instantly dominate the market by creating the biggest phablet ever: upgrade the cellular radio in the iPad Mini LTE so that it can make calls.</Msg><Username>ametrosixual</Username><Timestamp>1357987476916</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 05:44:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357988017143-30</Id><Topic><Title>pattern</Title><Username>rc3eagles</Username><Timestamp>1357972018673</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 01:26:58 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You're incorrect on every count.

With over forty years of investing experience in my belt I am certain that the bull market will last at least four years inspite of the lies, negativity and propaganda one gets to see on CNBC etc. day in day out . One investor column which constantly discourged investing in the stock market in 2012 recently ran an article by the same correspondent and it ran somewhat like this "OPPS 2012 was a good year after all with some great returns for people who remained invested in the stock market". While this same correspondent was suggesting to take money out of the market and put it in the likes of CDs , Bonds and other safe investments. I believe the GDP will rise year in year out . I believe the December'2012 quarterly results will be outstanding. I believe the next bunch of power giants "Brazil, China, India and Russia" will grow well over 8.9% year in year out. Add to that a bunch of at least 50 others countries with great growth such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Philliphine, Taiwan, Sri Lanka, Singapore, Australia, South Africa, Israel, Egypt, Qatar, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, UAE, Brazil, Mexico, Canada, Argentina, Czech, Poland, Ukraine, Germany, France, Britain, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Finland etc. etc. Even Greece, Italy and Spain will grow (just ignore the U.S. press propaganda). etc. etc. I also believe unemployment will go down to 4.5% in the next four years and the housing market and the manufacturing base will rebound sharply. But you have people like Gerri, Peter, Nurul, Lee, Rich etc. etc. who will always give you a negative spin . The shorts are really the fools who will pay the price (just like I did when I was "BRIEFLY SHORTING" so many years ago). Lost 3 times of what I gained. So let's get up monday morning and be more optimistic about our GREAT COUNTRY and a GREAT FUTURE.</Msg><Username>ziggy_thefiggy</Username><Timestamp>1357991483141</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 06:51:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357991808232-34</Id><Title>BUY LNKD/AMZN/NFLX/AAPL</Title><Msg>SDFSDFSDS</Msg><Username>bachrachjeff</Username><Timestamp>1357991808232</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 06:56:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357992038881-35</Id><Title>For All the talk of Shorts on this board...the total short interest for Apple</Title><Msg>is 1.9%....that is very low...compare that to rim 25%..ciena 20%...</Msg><Username>cantbeatbeta</Username><Timestamp>1357992038881</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 07:00:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357993197439-36</Id><Topic><Title>HOT LONGS GOING UP</Title><Username>cfuvframs2872</Username><Timestamp>1317331959000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2011-09-29 17:32:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Promised Profit</Msg><Username>j.ivans</Username><Timestamp>1357993197439</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 07:19:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357993924252-37</Id><Title>Look ar FEB call spread</Title><Msg>the FEB $500 and $505 is only $3..should be much higher.

No its totally different, shorting every peak pays off and off and off, so its the proper strategy at the moment, but shorting needs more and more concentration the last trading days and you better cover fast. So to me it looks like at the moment noone is really sure, if he you bet to the upside or the downside.

I have done it and there are only certain countries their 5 days guarantee applies. Why would someone have to buy an unlocked Lumia from US? Because you could not buy an Unlocked lumia or under $700-$900. anywhere. Most did not even have a display. After some of my workers visited a Microsoft office overseas they were clueless. We had to have the us email them. So you cannot sell what is not available. Notice is say (UNLOCKED). There are a tremendous amount of people overseas that buy the phone outright and then pop in a prepaid sim card in the back. There are Nokia phone overseas like the 800 and down however most have the previous version of Windows not W8. At first my workers honestly did not want lumia's with w8. It changed drastically when they saw the live tiles, voice activated GPS, that you can put your FB tile on the front and the live email notifications. The demand will be there once Microsoft ramps up the ADS OVERSEAS. US adv is great, there are many international customers that do not know there is a new W8 phone yet. There also needs to be a lower cost UNLOCKED Lumia. I asked people what carrier they used and they did not even know what a carrier was. Like I say they are used to buying prepaid sims. So currently the only chance those customers have of using a Lumia is to buy one on Amazon or Ebay unlocked. That will change this year and also the international places that are accustomed to plans will be integrated this year. It is nice that Nokia guided down for this quarter. Now the same thing will happen next earnings. China/India and now all they have to do is come up with a lower priced Unlocked lumia that can run win8. The $200.00 range seems to be what an international customer will spend on an unlocked phone. So in all fairness the International overseas picture is just beginning right now. All the articles and analyst are writing articles saying the numbers were not that great only this and only that. That is because it is just getting started. It has not even begun yet overseas. How about giving a new thing 6 months - 12 months and then right your bash stories. Right now commenting on international low sales mean that you did not do your research and only know half the story. If you here news of a lower cost unlocked Lumia for W8 the numbers will be blow out.</Msg><Username>lianadidio</Username><Timestamp>1357995812735</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 08:03:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357996574430-51</Id><Title>INVEST but learn to eliminate RISK</Title><Msg>i gave a few ideas this morning.

NOK-Long-friends: If you read a dozen posts here tonight, let this be at least one of them... it will be time worth spent. Disclaimer: I've no inside knowledge as to what is going on near Helsinki or Redmond currently. The following is my pure speculation, based on my analysis, logic and extrapolation of historical events. Please do your thorough DD of course. Today NOK pps/vol action issued a generational-bottom range- breakout signal in my models and gave the ultimate-go-ahead to the potential- would-be-acquirer, that their deal would be immediately accretive to their bottom line. 500%-volume rise does not happen by mere chance or by one PR event. The dynamics for a superb rise ahead were well entrenched in the past six month's fundamentals. Now its all clear, green-signal for MSFT to make a move and spread their connectivity-ambitions and empire worldwide. In my recent Europe and Asia visits, what I found out on the ground-floor is so important, yet no one mentions it much in the US: The market for the cheaper and MSFT-related smartphones and familiar Nokia brand over there, is generally estimated to be 2-times the present volume, in the next of couple years. That number is too low and off by at-least 75% IMHO: head-of-the household keeps (and can afford) only 1 super-costly IPhone around, but many nokias linger around the rest of the family members. The ratio is 1 to 4 in reality and is only going to increase as the middle-class mushrooms and the prosperity level rises in China and India. With the AAPL's closed-OS (and App- Store) model, they would prefer open MSFT- NOK model any day, especially when the functionality-delta is decreasing and nokias' are so cheap. W.r.t. buyout: Note what a premium MSFT gave to Skype. Do you think that with the prospect of 3B humanity connection in the next 5 years with NOK, MSFT would let them be independent merely for 20B chump-change? No way in the world IMHO. Now, all the big-boys will load-up first, and when the pps is around 5.50 they'll upgrade it. MSFT boys know this, that longer they wait now, more they'll have to fish-out to sweeten the offer for all shareholders. Hence, it's in their best interests to make a quick move. See this happen much sooner than any of us can imagine. Today was the first signal. Enjoy the beautiful ramp-up ahead! Please give your thumbs-up if you agree with the above sentiments.

Samsung, the world's top maker of phones using the Android operating system, appears to be the early winner in this hybrid category due to its display component strength, he wrote in the note. Moreover, Gai said, the hybrid category will trigger a new product cycle and bring more orders in the first half of 2013 for laggards in the mobile market such as HTC and LG Electronics. He forecast that smartphones over 5 inches will account for 15% of total smartphone sales in 2013 and 20% in 2015, compared with 5% currently. Samsung is expected to ship 97 million units of over-5-inch smartphones in 2013 and remain the top maker in this category, accounting for 68% of the overall market of 142.6 million units, Barclays said. LG is likely to rank second with 11.5 million units, or an 8.1% market share, followed by HTC's 10.8 million units and 7.6% share, the bank said. Taoyuan-based HTC, which had a rough year in 2012 with falling revenues and sliding market share, has seen its HTC J Butterfly flagship model enjoy brisk sales since its launch in Japan Dec. 10, according to local reports. Known as the world's first smartphone with a 5-inch full-HD display, the HTC J Butterfly replaced Apple Inc.'s iPhone 5 as the top seller on the sales rankings of Japanese operator KDDI for the week ending Dec. 16, the reports said. Market analysts said the high-end model is part of HTC's efforts to regain its footing in a market increasingly dominated by Apple and Samsung."</Msg><Username>ametrosixual</Username><Timestamp>1357999458443</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 09:04:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357999726796-71</Id><Title>Doesn't matter if aapl misses, it's still way undervalued.</Title><Msg>Buy and hold for the long term.

That means the total sales is probably around 47mil, which is about the average analyst estimate(i think). Either way, I think it's going to be close to the estimates.

If my analysis and Diedu's are correct (and they beat guidance by the coincidental 35% or more), then it will clearly illustrates Cook has his team refocused on substantial UPOD framework. THAT will be very good for the stock in many ways, not the least of which is restoring the buyside and sellside's confidence that someone leading AAPL understands that you simply cannot torpedo sellside analysts by changing historical practice (massive 35-50% beat on guidance) without protecting them (i.e., advising the new approach to guidance will be actual tight to guidance vs the historical massive sandbagging). Every analyst research director and portfolio manager is watching... and we know more than just our group has shared these thoughts in various forums. You can all do your own thinking, but mine (and comforting to see Horace's --regardless of wet finger Nansen and Zaky approaches) triangulates to similar outcomes based on affirming data points and quant/data centric analysis.</Msg><Username>squeezetracker</Username><Timestamp>1358004061408</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 10:21:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358004085399-107</Id><Topic><Title>SAMSUNG had Apple copy team (400 staffs) and they spent US$4B as estimate within a year to copy whatever they can from apple !!!</Title><Username>stallone4676</Username><Timestamp>1358004032776</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 10:20:32 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wow we jews are so powerful thank you for realizing that and how unimportant you are as a nonjew</Msg><Username>tendulrocks</Username><Timestamp>1358004085399</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 10:21:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358004127567-108</Id><Topic><Title>Do Korean analysts bash Samsung like American analysts trash Apple?

Through app development and devices that you have not seen yet, Apple will have some say in your everyday life. A simple example: Remember LoJack? Is it conceivable to have an Idevice in your car that monitors location, current status and other variables all through the use of an app and your phone, or other device. Think of how many more applications there are that would be able to be monetized. It's not about downloading music and movies anymore. Steve Jobs knew this, and you can go back and search on the 1980 or so personal assistant that he envisioned. 20 or so years ago IBM was a hardware company selling mainframes, and their quarterly numbers were based on how many mainframe they sold per quarter. Today IBM is a services company.

With the % of traders short in Apple being VERY LOW it leads me to believe that the people here bashing either hate Apple because they are the king of business in the US, are being paid to bash Apple, or simply get their "kicks" from any reaction they receive to their posts. On the other hand, if you are out and about youll notice the vast majority of American people support Apple through the purchase of their many excellent products. Unfortunately what the anti-American analysts and the small amount of bashers here want to do is change the mindset of the masses. Being short on a stock is one thing, but making up lies all day about a company in your own country is nothing short of slander. When Apple posts record earnings on January 23, it will be the best medicine to shut these people up!

You apparently "derived" your 35% based on, um, astral projection or a wet finger in the air? The ratio is the result, not a determinant factor. Here's a quick challenge for you to consider. Calculate the proportion of aggregate Taiwan's iphone sales in the 2011 December quarter to total U.S. sales, and then compare that ratio to this year's number for just the first three days of sales using the 2.2m number for aggregate iphone 5 sales in Taiwan opening weekend (December 14, 25 and 16). LOL... a few light years apart from flat to down, huh? Show us some rigor in your thinking and document your work for those who merely throw out numbers like anyone needs wild guesses when rigor drives meaningful perspective. btw, Did I mention that Deidu has now shared his data based modeling of 55.5m iphones in the quarter? He's more rigorous than anyone publishing estimates... and if you study his analysis, that 55.5m is likely cushioned for uncertainty. Quick now, similar rigor at the ready, extend the 9 months YTD trends for iPads, music/services and then come back to let us know how that derivation compares to last year's December Q results on those key revenue line items vs the rev guidance of $52B and the paranoid (don't dare be high a third Q in a row) analyst consensus of $54B and $13.40 EPS. LOL Tim already gave the overarching answer: "Don't bet against AAPLE"... but your post is a great example of the lazy thinking behind decisions being made with retirement and college fund assets on Main Street and Wall Street these days.</Msg><Username>squeezetracker</Username><Timestamp>1358005703150</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 10:48:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358005924259-132</Id><Topic><Title>The Riccaro Quotient maintains a avoid rating on the shares on AAPL.</Title><Username>rbg5r</Username><Timestamp>1358004919849</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 10:35:19 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's right until its wrong.

The boys on CNBC are "fast money" traders and have joined in the shorts crusade to beat the stock down to support their short positions...to me that should run afoul of some SEC rule, but it does not...there's nothing in the law that would cause such behavior to be illegal. As to whether these are anti-American comments, i would agree tto support that view except if the analyst in question is a true believer that AAPL is overpriced. They are certainly allowed their opinion and are protected by the 1st amendments guarantee of freedom of speech and the press, so I wouldn't get too upset over their views. The best result is for AAPL to defend itself and the stock price, and their earnings report should give the stock and the company's management an opportunity to "exhume the body" so let's see what the geniuses at AAPL can do for us long time share holders in two weeks time.

The other news is that Apple met with Mobile China that we reported in December that Apple has been secretly working with them for four years now. The problem, as we reported, concerned China Mobile's upgrade to 4G networks. The transition to the new standard may now have been achieved as it appears that a formal deal may have been formalized between Apple and China Mobile. Taiwan News is reporting today that China Mobile released a statement saying that chairman Xi Guohua and Apple's CEO Tim Cook discussed "bilateral cooperation," and that the "release of other details was barred by a confidentiality agreement between the companies." Their framing of that statement indicates that a deal was struck. That's also likely why Cook said that China would become Apple's largest market on this same business trip. Securing a deal with Mobile China would definitely make China their number one market over the next year or two. Our December report showed that Mobile China would have a third of their market on 4G in the coming year which works out to a potential target of 233 million subscribers that Apple would be able to sell into. That's a market that's double the current US smartphone subscriber base.</Msg><Username>bretbecken</Username><Timestamp>1358007497640</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 11:18:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358007497851-165</Id><Topic><Title>The Riccaro Quotient maintains a avoid rating on the shares on AAPL.</Title><Username>rbg5r</Username><Timestamp>1358004919849</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 10:35:19 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I always find it amusing that once someone invests their hard earned money, anyone that disagrees with that position becomes a victim of ridicule.

That Swisher is wrong in using a whole years change when Jackson prefers using one months change. That Jacksons opinion that a November to December 2-4% improvement ofsetts and nullifies any 20-30% decline year over year. I think we will see Swisher doing less Yahoo bashing now that Eric Jackson has shown Swisher's unfairness in reporting. Yahoo's true numbers only go back one month. Eric Jackson is tired of Swisher's deceiving reporting. Yahoo's true numbers only go back one month. Swisher better be careful in the future. No one is buying her lies. Yahoo's true numbers only go back one month. Good to see Swisher get called out for twisting the facts against Yahoo. Yahoo's true numbers only go back one month. -#I believe the key difference here in the interpretations between Swisher and Post appear to be that Post is noticing an improvement on a month-to-month basis for Yahoo from November to December. He appears to be focused on that shift. Swisher is focusing more on the November 2012 to November 2011 comparisons.#- Eric Jackson.</Msg><Username>dr.gloom</Username><Timestamp>1358008933771</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 11:42:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358008968214-183</Id><Title>Hit short-term bottom=$550 next week</Title><Msg>sit back and relax...</Msg><Username>jamesvn02</Username><Timestamp>1358008968214</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 11:42:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358008973499-184</Id><Topic><Title>Kara Swisher Exposed As a Yahoo Basher With Ulterior Motives</Title><Username>neo1278alpha</Username><Timestamp>1357921132320</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 11:18:52 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Swisher was walking a fine line but now she has crossed over that line.

Furthermore, the announcement of the long-awaited deal with China Mobile now seems just around the corner. If AAPL is making pornographic profits, the stock will blow past 600 faster than Nancy Pelosi running for a Botox injection. I reiterate my call of two days ago: AAPL made its 2013 (and 2014) low at 12:57 pm on Jan 10 at $515.52. If I'm wrong, I will post the mother of all mea culpas. Contrary opinions and wagers accepted but play nice, boys and girls.</Msg><Username>orpheusredux</Username><Timestamp>1358009636873</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 11:53:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358009724567-201</Id><Title>THE FAKE TENDULROCKS IS A #$%$</Title><Msg>He now wont know what i am say as he put me on his ignor elist. now i can bash him without repercussions. he is a poison to mankind</Msg><Username>tendulrocks</Username><Timestamp>1358009724567</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 11:55:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358009752456-202</Id><Topic><Title>Put 20K in at this 520 level and you will have 22M in 15 years.</Title><Username>ram9751</Username><Timestamp>1358008492099</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 11:34:52 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>With splits and re-invested dividends the number drops to 1,900% not out of the question.

Institutional investors are the ones selling the most options and if you check the option fence setup for the monthly ones you can just bet that they will not let it go over 520, as than they would incur a massive loss.Also, most technical indicators feed the belief that AAPL wants to test it's support level at 497 (if it breaks it can basically go to 460). From the 21st it's all on your own prediction of the earnings, i believe they will beat expecations as there is a bear-sentiment that overrules any upward potential at the moment. Furthermore, after multiple releases before the holidays and Apple's recent expansion drift, i see them beating. If so, the stock will most likely surge upwards from the 21st, releaving itself from the option fence.</Msg><Username>sebastiaan.debruin</Username><Timestamp>1358009774372</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 11:56:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358009783916-204</Id><Title>I AM THE REAL TENDULROCKS..

Which stock is a better investment long-term? MSFT is growing sales about 7% per year, and its net earnings did not go up in recent years. MSFT is losing market share in the enterprise to Apple, as big corporations are more often buying IPADs and MACs even. Apple's growth has slowed from torrid 50 % in 2011 and start of 2012, to only 25% last quarter and expected 20 % for 2013. But its still 3X MSFT's sluggish growth. Apple is trading at a PEG (PE to Growth ratio of 0.5. MSFT at 1.0 PEG ratio. If Apple was valued same as sluggish growth MSFT, Apple stock would have to be double or about $1050.</Msg><Username>aiwal1</Username><Timestamp>1358013340261</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 12:55:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358013432699-275</Id><Topic><Title>Any chance in hell this might hit 700 before Apr 20?</Title><Username>gaingreen800</Username><Timestamp>1358010669347</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 12:11:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Any investor worth his salt will tell you those will more than likely expire at zero.

Samsung aim to obtain as much market share as it wants so they produce a lot of different level of product and this company is lack of focus and it is fatal to the company because it may rsik of wasting a lot of resouces on those products that may not be popular to market. That's why you see even though samsung sell a lot of product but does not have a nice product margin as apple did. Samsung's business model will eventually fails and company will go downward. However, aapl is always focus on the best quality of product as apple VP said their goal is not to grab the market shares and therefore, it can use its resouces efficently.</Msg><Username>kekekakah</Username><Timestamp>1358013520928</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 12:58:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358013521808-279</Id><Topic><Title>No matter what Appl does it won't be able to sell and compete Samsung and LG in Asia and Europe</Title><Username>kkwon</Username><Timestamp>1358011150444</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 12:19:10 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You say "no matter what AAPL does it won't be able...to compete (with) Samsung"?

The question really is where are the extra 15m phones above the analyst projections. Certainly carriers had to build inventory, aft re draining down the 4 and 4s. Channel inventory was low at the end of last quarter. Just one week is 4m phones. Because Hon Hai and Pegatron were accelerating production throughout December (already reported) we must presume that inventories are low still throughout the channel. So if Apple doesn't have them , they are in the hands of the carriers or the customers and we will see a big quarter. The report on Friday of Deceber revenues at Foxconn solved the mystery. You can stay negative and short, but you will have to hope that guidance is low. Given the December acceleration at Foxconn this is less likely. The pattern looks very similar to last year. Foxconn last year reported 320m in December revenues and then 237m in February about 30 percent. This seems to be in line with the Wall Street projections is year. The pattern seems very similar.</Msg><Username>johnnov22</Username><Timestamp>1358014768558</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 13:19:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358014785728-316</Id><Title>Phone Cum Tablet Galaxy Note= PIZZA BOX on face</Title><Msg>Lol...Have your Girl , wife or any other women try it see if they like it.</Msg><Username>castcore</Username><Timestamp>1358014785728</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 13:19:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358014863621-317</Id><Title>APPLE DROPPING OVERNIGHT DOWN BIG</Title><Msg>Stocks to tank monday and apple will be down 70 this week and next. at 450 before earnings apple is still too expensive. if we can get it down to 363 or lower it might be a good speculative play</Msg><Username>tendulrocks</Username><Timestamp>1358014863621</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 13:21:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358014888604-318</Id><Topic><Title>What will be the issues with the iphone 6 this time?</Title><Username>alvin555</Username><Timestamp>1358014696242</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 13:18:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>b and f this time.

Even with a wonderful earnings report, I just don't see apple running 80 dollars up. There is too much fear in the future, that if earnings came in great it wouldn't matter. The fear is that earnings now, no matter how good, will not translate to high earnings in 2 years. I would imagine a run of 40 to 80 dollars following a great earning report, and on a neutral earning report I would imagine a fall in stock price. The big catalysts are 1) returning cash to share holders, 2) stock split, 3) new product that indicates future revenue. Right now if I had money I'd go with selling puts below 480 or 490, because i don't think it will fall too far on making its earnings or even missing its earnings, and then I'd use that money to fuel a bull call spread running from something like 540 to 600.</Msg><Username>mershaw2001</Username><Timestamp>1358018398123</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 14:19:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358018487529-376</Id><Topic><Title>breaking news!!!

These devices combine the capabilities of a smartphone and mini tablet — and occasionally incorporate a stylus. A phablet is larger than most smartphones, but not as large as a tablet or mini-tablet.[2] Phablet is a portmanteau of the words phone and tablet.[3] The first phablet was the Dell Streak released on 4 June 2010. Other notable examples include the Droid DNA, Samsung Galaxy Note and Note II, the LG Optimus Vu and Intuition, and the Micromax canvas2 A110[4] and Micromax A101.</Msg><Username>ametrosixual</Username><Timestamp>1358018541459</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 14:22:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358018682325-379</Id><Topic><Title>Apple suppliers have reported their numbers.

Apple is 45 percent of Foxconns sales and produces the vast majority of iphones and ipads - and the sales were up 39 percent. Foxconn's non apple revenues were down so Apple shipments were up about 100 percent on tablets and phones vs the previous quarter. That translates to about 54m phones and 28m iPads more or less with a few assumptions. the Hon Hai results - Foxconn was an upside surprise.

If you were here in the past you would know that Apple low balls EVERY SINGLE Q. The only question is how much will they beat there own estimates. This is actually one of the closest gaps between Apple and the street because Apple has missed the last 2 Q Street estimates. Can Apple beat the street you ask? Well that same street thinks Apple will increase Iphone sales by 35% and Ipad sales by 50-75% YOY. Knowing that Apple made 13.87 in Q1 2012 what does that say to you? Now I know margins may take a hit 44.7% last year and maybe 39-40% this year but will that really mean Apple will have a 35% increase in Revs yet a decrease in net profit?

By buying those 650 calls, you only make money when AAPL trades above that strike price. The Jan options expire on the 18th, so your hoping for a $130 (25%) move in 5 trading days, just to break even LOL. Good luck with that. Im long with March 650 calls.

This is a given. 2) IPODs= This will be DOWN, but considering that this is NOT a big part of their income/revenue, it is not a big deal. 3) Macs= This will likely be down also, but only about $200-300 million. In other words, items 1-3 should be a wash. 4) Ipads are much more difficult to calculate. They clearly sold a minimum of 8 million minis and possibly up to 10 million based on supply constraints. This will gross around $2.4 bilion while netting around $800-950 million. However, the regular ipad is the BIG question mark. How much did the mini cannibalize the larger iPad? With newer versions and a broader roll out, I believe that this number will be similar to a year ago. Once again, the lowest analyst estimate that I have read is 8 million minis and 13 million regular iPads which would be more profitable than last year 5) The BIGGEST number is in the form of the iPhones which generates over 50% of the income. The range of ALL analysts is 43 million to 66 million which is far greater than 37 million a year ago. If they come in at the low end (43 million), this equates to $3.5 billion in revenue and $2.25 billion in profits. If we are being fair, they also had an extra week in the quarter last year which helped boost numbers. It is impossible to determine net profits since no one know operational costs, but margins will DEFINITELY be lower due to new product introductions. Still, these MINIMUM numbers (in my opinion) equates to over $2.00 eps. With an eps of $13.87 last year, AAPL is looking at a new eps of around $15.87 MINIMUM. It would be fair to note that profit margins were at 44% last year and are expected to come in around 39-41 % which could hurt numbers. I have already challenged ANY shorts to question my numbers, but they have yet to respond intelligently. Personally, I can only see Ipod profits dropping these numbers (approx. $1 billion) and iPads since no one really knows the profits per item on the mini (should be around $95 profit per mini) and no one knows the extent of the cannibalization (if any).</Msg><Username>docnaka12</Username><Timestamp>1358026633395</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 16:37:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358026639555-501</Id><Topic><Title>CHUCK THE #$%$ NAGEL WILL NEVER GET APPROVED HE IS A LOSER</Title><Username>tendulrocks</Username><Timestamp>1358026530228</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 16:35:30 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Monkey punk, period.End of story.</Msg><Username>daisaamyuan</Username><Timestamp>1358026639555</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 16:37:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358026679900-502</Id><Topic><Title>We have sen the next earning report but can't let anyone know what it was</Title><Username>raystock48079</Username><Timestamp>1358026581302</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 16:36:21 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In this post is my code telling if earning will be up or down.

Revenue estimates were a little over $40 billion but actual was $46.33 billion. Gross margins were expected to be around 38%, but came in at 44.5%. I don't expect a similar blowout, but they absolutely crushed this quarter. IF iPhone sales come in over 49 million units, this will be another BLOW OUT quarter. We are talking $5 billion more in revenue and a couple billion in likely profits. Imagine if the numbers came in at 55 million which is NOT completely out of the question, (but not my expectation), Apple would likely pocket $17-18 billion in a single quarter. Remember, Samsung's recently released "record" quarter profited them $8.3 billion.</Msg><Username>investing10101010</Username><Timestamp>1358027578172</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 16:52:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358027584976-505</Id><Topic><Title>We have sen the next earning report but can't let anyone know what it was</Title><Username>raystock48079</Username><Timestamp>1358026581302</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 16:36:21 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>wikll= weekly/will probably 21st haha</Msg><Username>sebastiaan.debruin</Username><Timestamp>1358027584976</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 16:53:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358027862714-506</Id><Topic><Title>Any rumors about China Moble announcement - nada on Stocktwits.</Title><Username>jenifer_prescott</Username><Timestamp>1358025661010</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 16:21:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Nada on Stocktwits" - That's a better positive indicator than any mention of it on Stocktwits.</Msg><Username>guardrabbit</Username><Timestamp>1358027862714</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 16:57:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358027909789-507</Id><Title>Apple would trade at $6000/shr with FaceBook fundamentals...</Title><Msg>Think about it.</Msg><Username>binnybeoris</Username><Timestamp>1358027909789</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 16:58:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358028136348-508</Id><Title>Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd sales rose 14 percent from a year earlier = apple earning miss ???</Title><Msg>only 14pct...</Msg><Username>stallone4676</Username><Timestamp>1358028136348</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 17:02:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358028149948-509</Id><Title>Very strange with all the negative about Apple</Title><Msg>AEA had 6 news letters but not one say short Apple for this earning ?</Msg><Username>aea_derivativex</Username><Timestamp>1358028149948</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 17:02:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358028503414-510</Id><Topic><Title>Phone Cum Tablet Galaxy Note= PIZZA BOX on face</Title><Username>castcore</Username><Timestamp>1358014785728</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 13:19:45 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>None</Msg><Username>castcore</Username><Timestamp>1358028503414</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 17:08:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358028762326-511</Id><Topic><Title>Very strange with all the negative about Apple</Title><Username>aea_derivativex</Username><Timestamp>1358028149948</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 17:02:29 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That is because only the truly 'brainless' would short a stock near its 52 week low with 30+% growth, $170 Billion in cash, no debt and, an 8:1 forward PE.

Apple fell to $499 in premarket trading Monday before rebounding to close the day up 1.7 percent at $518.83. From a closing peak of $702.10 on Sept. 19, Apple has seen shares drop just over 26 percent. The company's Asian suppliers have been reporting cuts in orders, which raises questions about the iPhone 5's strength, Citigroup said in a note. The bank reduced Apple to neutral from buy and cut its price target to $575 from $675. Apple's shares are heading toward their third monthly drop as the company faces competition from Samsung Electronics and Nokia.</Msg><Username>ametrosixual</Username><Timestamp>1358032693991</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 18:18:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358032701268-545</Id><Topic><Title>Hey guys, Im just trying to get an idea what quantities youre purchasing in?</Title><Username>cueb1969</Username><Timestamp>1358031701999</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 18:01:41 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>50 shares.</Msg><Username>tommy_loops</Username><Timestamp>1358032701268</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 18:18:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358032711430-546</Id><Topic><Title>Phone Cum Tablet Galaxy Note= PIZZA BOX on face</Title><Username>castcore</Username><Timestamp>1358014785728</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 13:19:45 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nobody</Msg><Username>castcore</Username><Timestamp>1358032711430</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 18:18:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358032776951-547</Id><Topic><Title>all signs point to 3rd straight terrible earnings for apple</Title><Username>musichead2005</Username><Timestamp>1358032304203</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 18:11:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You do know that Samsung sold or gave away only 15 million S3s right?

Let's say they make a net income of 13.4 per share, which is the consensus. With 940 million shares, they have just netted after taxes 12.5 billion. So this company now has 12.5 billion in cash to add to the 29 billion they already have. That is now they have $44 in cash just making interest for each share. Shares are priced at $520. So that means the company is valued at $476 per share based on earnings. At $40/year earning per share, that is only a 12 years of sales. Compares to other large company's and AAPL is a great value. Plus, they are buying shares back.</Msg><Username>tukkersmom2</Username><Timestamp>1358033322379</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 18:28:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358033603106-554</Id><Title>Isn't It Interesting That AAPL Competitors Don't Report Unit Sales</Title><Msg>AMZN = No kindle numbers Samsung = No Smart Phone Numbers One would think if they were doing so good they would want the world to know their numbers.

If you look at analyst estimates for last quarters they were up to $6 or more different. One analyst says high, one says low, and the average is consensus. So one bad estimate is all it takes to skew. Looks like you are the dumb #$%$ who relies on what analysts tell you.

Within the report, there is a study of sales mix of iPhones in October v. August and April. If we make two key assumptions; 1) Apple made 60% gross margin on iPhone 4 and 4S before they started discounting it with the launch of the iPhone 5 and 2) the U.S. mix and pricing is similar OUS as suggested in this report for the U.S., we can analyze to draw some general conclusions. First, it would appear that, despite the discounts on the iPhone 4 and 4S that gross margin should still be about 51% in q1 on these products. Second, if we assume the cost of an iPhone 5 is $50 more than a 4 or 4S (another uncertain assumption, but seems reasonable), then, based on its pricing and mix it's gross margin should be about 58%. Third, the average price on the mix of products in October is about $20 higher than in previous months due to the higher mix of 32GB and 64GB iPhone 5s, despite lower prices on the 4 and 4S. Finally, based on the mix provided, this would suggest gross margins for iPhones in q1 2013 should be about 56%. All this said, I suspect mix and pricing may be a bit less favorable OUS. As such, I have plugged 54% into my model for iPhone gross margin in the period. For others running their own models, hopefully you find this interesting. My model currently shows Apple delivering revenue of $57B with gross margins of 39.4% and EPS of $14.53. It includes 52M iPhones and 25M iPads and $12B in sales otherwise. I have gross margins of 54% for iPhones and 20% for iPads and other products, $4B in expenses and a 26% tax rate.

Foxconn, the China based manufacturer best known for assembling the Apple iPhone and Apple iPad as well as other smartphones and electronic products, reported record monthly revenues for the second consecutive month.The sequential monthly growth rate for the company was 2.62% and year-over-year the figure was 13.88%. Non-consolidated revenue for December was NT$360.944 billion (US$12.38 billion USD). Foxconn explained that strong shipments of consumer electronics and communications products were behind the gains in monthly revenue. The strong shipments also led to record quarterly non-consolidated revenue in the fourth quarter of NT$988.379 billion ($33.9 billion USD). And for the entire year, Foxconn set yet another record with 2012 non-consolidated revenue tipping the scale at NT$3.22 trillion ($110 billion USD). That is a 16.09% increase over 2011.</Msg><Username>rideyourlifeaway</Username><Timestamp>1358040253099</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 20:24:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358040440872-603</Id><Title>AAPL nasdaq real time quote 540.35 Data as of 1/10/2013</Title><Msg>whats going on</Msg><Username>stallone4676</Username><Timestamp>1358040440872</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 20:27:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358040532155-604</Id><Topic><Title>Foxconn Miss Estimates: Cofirms Last Months Citi Analyst Reports Of Dreadful iPhone 5 Production</Title><Username>ametrosixual</Username><Timestamp>1358032693991</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 18:18:13 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>More lies from you guys.

AMZN people have been saying that for years now, yet the EPS continues to drop, and the PE continues to rise. You are currently paying 15 years into the future for AMZN stock. But most people don't understand valuation. The whole EPS and PE don't mean anything is a bunch of garbage, and it will screw a lot of people in the end. Fundamentals always matter. Its not like AMZN is a start up company. Apple is just the opposite. Incredible growth in EPS for YEARS yet no PE expansion. Maybe in your dream world this doesn't matter; however, I have continued to make a ton of money on Apple by being patient and letting the market finally realize its undervalued at times like these.
