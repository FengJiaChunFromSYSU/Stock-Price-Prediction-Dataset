Don't forget, the iPads finally went on sale in China started in July, so we will also see a big bump on iPad sales as well for the Sept. Q here is a copy of an article: Apple's latest iPad offering finally hit China's store shelves on Friday (7/20/12), months after its worldwide launch in March, but the delay is unlikely to dampen sales because of the Chinese passion for all things Apple, analysts say. "Sales are going to be very strong. Everybody in China loves Apple products," Shaun Rein, Managing Director at Shanghai-based China Market Research Group told CNBC. "You've seen they've grown about 600 percent in the last two years in terms of sales."

Answer: YES! Apple is completely revamping its entire line here. Not only was there a new iPhone 5, but new iTouch and iPods as well. And we still have a mini-iPad coming and Apple TV may still hit before the end of the year. Also, Tim Cook may not have the Steve Jobs panache but he does have a great handle on their supply cycle and inventory. Some of the biggest problems in the past had nothing to do with selling enough iPhones... it was Apple's ability to build them as fast as needed. Cook is an operations guy and this won't be a problem with these new iPhone products. He also understands the global impact here. I would bet my first born that Apple is going to blow the doors off bigger and wider than ever before. I actually think you could see Apple nearer $1000 next year than the $700 we want now. Take all of this along with the current legal win with Samsung and OMG... there is nothing stopping Apple right now.</Msg><Username>wcooperiv</Username><Timestamp>1347776224537</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 02:17:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347777087041-20</Id><Topic><Title>Split coming!</Title><Username>kingcuffs</Username><Timestamp>1347774191549</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 01:43:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Fool that does not understand!</Msg><Username>obadidos1</Username><Timestamp>1347777087041</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 02:31:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347779739222-21</Id><Topic><Title>Question for "Valley legend Vinod Khosla"</Title><Username>notaverygoodideaatall</Username><Timestamp>1347727451090</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 12:44:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That was not a answer to any of my questions.....There are so many Indians in majority of tech companies (aapl, microsoft, intel, IBM; you name it)......Should they all be fired?......I was wondering what happens if all Indians leave the country.....We don't have skilled workers here.........We need to have more people completing college degree here specially in STEM (science, technology, engineering and math).........</Msg><Username>tendulrocks</Username><Timestamp>1347779739222</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 03:15:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347781944309-22</Id><Topic><Title>Apple will be $800 by Jan 2013</Title><Username>aea_k2</Username><Timestamp>1347771303761</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 00:55:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If they miss Q4, we buy.

But I would question the veracity of the information. Five million units in one hour in the middle of the night implies two hard to believe things: sales rate about 100 times higher than iPhone 4S, and a manufacturing ramp of 12 - 15 million iPhones prelaunch. Both seem overly optimistic, and furthermore not necessary for success. Our hype might hurt if we are not careful.

So, being deterred by aapl's share price is an amateur investing mistake, and one that leads to missing out on a great return.</Msg><Username>todd0888</Username><Timestamp>1347797845541</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 08:17:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347798235816-40</Id><Topic><Title>WHY APPLE STOCK WILL SPLIT</Title><Username>jimbomcguinness</Username><Timestamp>1347793960436</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 07:12:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Not people like you, which is why we do NOT want it to split</Msg><Username>lawno</Username><Timestamp>1347798235816</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 08:23:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347798345659-41</Id><Topic><Title>Apple ...

It seems as though Apple massively under estimated just how large the demand for this new phone would be with only customers placing orders within one hour of pre sales beginning being guaranteed a release date delivery. There is a glimmer of hope however for some of the people disappointed by the delayed shipments. It seems as though Apple had not actually sold out of the phones as soon as they thought they had and this has led to some consumers receiving e mails informing them that their phones will arrive on the 21st and not the later date that they were originally told.</Msg><Username>aea_k2</Username><Timestamp>1347805769998</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 10:29:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347807023014-73</Id><Topic><Title>Apple ...

I hear the same thing from several people. But here is the problem. Get used to the term "ecosystem" for electronics. Apple has built a superior ecosystem.....communication, music, video, entertainment, social networking etc... ecosystem is the right word. Apple understands how people want to live. So building a better a gadget (phone) or in this case, a "competitive" piece of electronic (Samsung) is no where near enough to compete with Apple. It was 15 years a go (ie PC versus Mac) but it is not any longer. And so you have dominance built on that ecosystem.

As always, Apple didn't announce clock speeds, CPU microarchitecture, memory bandwidth or GPU details. It did however give us an indication of expected CPU performance: Prior to the announcement we speculated the iPhone 5's SoC would simply be a higher clocked version of the 32nm A5r2 used in the iPad 2,4. After all, Apple seems to like saving major architecture shifts for the iPad. However, just prior to the announcement I received some information pointing to a move away from the ARM Cortex A9 used in the A5. Given Apple's reliance on fully licensed ARM cores in the past, the expected performance gains and unpublishable information that started all of this I concluded Apple's A6 SoC likely featured two ARM Cortex A15 cores. It turns out I was wrong. But pleasantly surprised. The A6 is the first Apple SoC to use its own ARMv7 based processor design. The CPU core(s) aren't based on a vanilla A9 or A15 design from ARM IP, but instead are something of Apple's own creation. Hints in Xcode 4.5 The iPhone 5 will ship with and only run iOS 6.0. To coincide with the launch of iOS 6.0, Apple has seeded developers with a newer version of its development tools. Xcode 4.5 makes two major changes: it drops support for the ARMv6 ISA (used by the ARM11 core in the iPhone 2G and iPhone 3G), keeps support for ARMv7 (used by modern ARM cores) and it adds support for a new architecture target designed to support the new A6 SoC: armv7s. What's the main difference between the armv7 and armv7s architecture targets for the LLVM C compiler? The presence of VFPv4 support. The armv7s target supports it, the v7 target doesn't. Why does this matter? Only the Cortex A5, A7 and A15 support the VFPv4 extensions to the ARMv7-A ISA. The Cortex A8 and A9 top out at VFPv3. If you want to get really specific, the Cortex A5 and A7 implement a 16 register VFPv4 FPU, while the A15 features a 32 register implementation. The point is, if your architecture supports VFPv4 then it isn't a Cortex A8 or A9. It's pretty easy to dismiss the A5 and A7 as neither of those architectures is significantly faster than the Cortex A9 used in Apple's A5. The obvious conclusion then is Apple implemented a pair of A15s in its A6 SoC. For unpublishable reasons, I knew the A6 SoC wasn't based on ARM's Cortex A9, but I immediately assumed that the only other option was the Cortex A15. I foolishly cast aside the other major possibility: an Apple developed ARMv7 processor core. Balancing Battery Life and Performance There are two types of ARM licensees: those who license a specific processor core (e.g. Cortex A8, A9, A15), and those who license an ARM instruction set architecture for custom implementation (e.g. ARMv7 ISA). For a long time it's been known that Apple has both types of licenses. Qualcomm is in a similar situation; it licenses individual ARM cores for use in some SoCs (e.g. the MSM8x25/Snapdragon S4 Play uses ARM Cortex A5s) as well as licenses the ARM instruction set for use by its own processors (e.g. Scorpion/Krait implement in the ARMv7 ISA). For a while now I'd heard that Apple was working on its own ARM based CPU core, but last I heard Apple was having issues making it work. I assumed that it was too early for Apple's own design to be ready. It turns out that it's not. Based on a lot of digging over the past couple of days, and conversations with the right people, I've confirmed that Apple's A6 SoC is based on Apple's own ARM based CPU core and not the Cortex A15. Implementing VFPv4 tells us that this isn't simply another Cortex A9 design targeted at higher clocks. If I had to guess, I would assume Apple did something similar to Qualcomm this generation: go wider without going substantially deeper. Remember Qualcomm moved from a dual-issue mostly in-order architecture to a three-wide out-of-order machine with Krait. ARM went from two-wide OoO to three-wide OoO but in the process also heavily pursued clock speed by dramatically increasing the depth of the machine. The deeper machine plus much wider front end and execution engines drives both power and performance up. Rumor has it that the original design goal for ARM's Cortex A15 was servers, and it's only through big.LITTLE (or other clever techniques) that the A15 would be suitable for smartphones. Given Apple's intense focus on power consumption, skipping the A15 would make sense but performance still had to improve. Why not just run the Cortex A9 cores from Apple's A5 at higher frequencies? It's tempting, after all that's what many others have done in the space, but sub-optimal from a design perspective. As we learned during the Pentium 4 days, simply relying on frequency scaling to deliver generational performance improvements results in reduced power efficiency over the long run. To push frequency you have to push voltage, which has an exponential impact on power consumption. Running your cores as close as possible to their minimum voltage is ideal for battery life. The right approach to scaling CPU performance is a combination of increasing architectural efficiency (instructions executed per clock goes up), multithreading and conservative frequency scaling. Remember that in 2005 Intel hit 3.73GHz with the Pentium Extreme Edition. Seven years later Intel's fastest client CPU only runs at 3.5GHz (3.9GHz with turbo) but has four times the cores and up to 3x the single threaded performance. Architecture, not just frequency, must improve over time. At its keynote, Apple promised longer battery life and 2x better CPU performance. It's clear that the A6 moved to 32nm but it's impossible to extract 2x better performance from the same CPU architecture while improving battery life over only a single process node shrink. Despite all of this, had it not been for some external confirmation, I would've probably settled on a pair of higher clocked A9s as the likely option for the A6. In fact, higher clocked A9s was what we originally claimed would be in the iPhone 5 in our NFC post. I should probably give Apple's CPU team more credit in the future. The bad news is I have no details on the design of Apple's custom core. Despite Apple's willingness to spend on die area, I believe an A15/Krait class CPU core is a likely target. Slightly wider front end, more execution resources, more flexible OoO execution engine, deeper buffers, bigger windows, etc... Support for VFPv4 guarantees a bigger core size than the Cortex A9, it only makes sense that Apple would push the envelope everywhere else as well. I'm particularly interested in frequency targets and whether there's any clever dynamic clock work happening. Someone needs to run Geekbench on an iPhone 5 pronto. I also have no indication how many cores there are. I am assuming two but Apple was careful not to report core count (as it has in the past). We'll get more details as we get our hands on devices in a week. I'm really interested to see what happens once Chipworks and UBM go to town on the A6.</Msg><Username>faribachicagomed</Username><Timestamp>1347814126751</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 12:48:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347814450320-116</Id><Topic><Title>aapl news/thoughts here and there</Title><Username>faribachicagomed</Username><Timestamp>1347813609454</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 12:40:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>TSCM Ready to Invest 10 Billion USD to Secure Apple Has a Main Customer By linathael. Original by Lionel - 11/09/2012 00:00:00 CEST - Category: Apple - Source: Fudzilla Couple of month ago TSMC refused to give Apple priority on its production lanes, arguing it wanted to retain its freedom. Today the company is reported to have announced to chips production equipment manufacturer its goal to invest 10 billion USD in 2013. The goal of such investment would be to have production capacity able to respond to any demand at any time. We can easily imagine that TSMC would be interested in producing Ax chips for Apple, today manufactured by Samsung. Such strategy could come from Apple as the company does not want to depend on Samsung to produce its products (computers, iPhone, iPad, etc...) TSMC is today the only company able to give the production volume requires by Apple; if we consider that Intel will never do it as it directly competes with Apple on some products. The only problem TSMC is facing today, is the ability to produce in large volume at 28 nm, and have some positive perspective for producing with thinner engraving process in the coming years. The recent delay for AMD and NVidia GPUs are an example of the problems faced by TSMC to produce in volume at 28 nm.</Msg><Username>faribachicagomed</Username><Timestamp>1347814450320</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 12:54:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347814614637-117</Id><Topic><Title>aapl news/thoughts here and there</Title><Username>faribachicagomed</Username><Timestamp>1347813609454</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 12:40:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Used iPhones flood the market anticipating the iPhone 5 With rumors spreading that the new smartphone will be long and sleek, with 4G LTE and a smaller dock, iPhone owners work to get rid of their old devices to be ready for the upgrade. by Dara Kerr September 10, 2012 9:40 PM PDT With hours ticking down before Apple is said to unveil the new iPhone 5, old iPhones are flooding the market. eBay and Craigslist are full of them, and companies that specialize in buying back used mobile devices are reportedly busier than ever. According to USA Today, NextWorth, which buys back used phones and gives quotes on their worth, had a record number of iPhone quote requests the past three weeks. From August 17 to September 6, requests for quotes increased by 610 percent over the same period before the launch of the iPhone 4S. This may be because many iPhone owners didn't upgrade from the 4 to the 4S since the device didn't appear to be much different. However, with rumors of the iPhone 5 having a completely different body shape, dock connector, and displays, people may be ready for a change. Currently on eBay, there are more than 6,000 used iPhone 4 for sale, while there are around 4,000 used iPhone 4S. According to USA Today, half of NextWorth's quotes are for the 4 model, while just 20 percent are for the 4S. CNET's Marguerite Reardon offered readers advice on when they should sell their used iPhone if they plan to shell out for the upgrade. Her recommendation was based on advice from NextWorth, which said that as the rumor mill churns prior to the launch of a new iPhone trade-in prices start declining and that it's best to sell used iPhones as soon as possible. Although the new iPhone is sure to wow many users, there are still people that believe the older versions will continue to suffice since progress on smartphones has slowed. So, not to worry -- unlike a few years ago, last year's model won't look like an outdated relic.</Msg><Username>faribachicagomed</Username><Timestamp>1347814614637</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 12:56:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347814627704-118</Id><Topic><Title>IMO the Samsung Galaxy III S is a better phone...</Title><Username>hairybozo</Username><Timestamp>1347810271527</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 11:44:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Fair enough, but do you honestly (not emotionally) see aapl stock tanking in the next 12 - 24 months?

Cross speaks with Tom Keene, Sara Eisen and Scarlet Fu on Bloomberg Television's "Surveillance."

Vodafone may make some “adjustments” to its pricing strategy, including “specific tactics in some markets” as the new iPhone starts selling, Francisco Roman, chairman of Vodafone Spain, said in an interview. As Apple unveils a new version of the iPhone today, carriers want to avoid that mistake from five years ago. Vodafone and peers including Telefonica SA (TEF), having started moving away from subsidizing smartphones this year in markets such as Spain and the U.K., may be compelled back to compete on prices. The handset will meet such pent-up demand that some carriers will be tempted to offer it at a reduced price to win market share. That threatens to force others out of their savings tactics, pushing the industry back into a margin- battering discount war. Subsidies cost European carriers 12 percent to 14 percent of their wireless revenue, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Industries. “Subsidies are not just an old-fashioned practice, they’re also a key lever for smartphone adoption,” said Vincent Brunet, director of mobile at Orange, a unit of France Telecom SA. (FTE) “You can expect some increase in subsidies for a quarter or two.” Since the iPhone’s introduction in 2007, European wireless carriers spent billions of euros to put more smartphones into consumers’ hands, part of a bid to get them to browse the Web, send e-mail and watch videos on their handsets. Customer Defections Forgoing subsidies for the new iPhone, set to be unveiled at 10 a.m. local time at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts Theater in downtown San Francisco, would mean missing out on most of the customers for grabs. The new iPhone may sell 10 million units this month alone, according to Gene Munster, an analyst at Piper Jaffray Cos. One out of every five smartphones sold in Europe is an iPhone, according to JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. The new model will be Apple’s first change to the device’s hardware design since 2010, raising anticipation among consumers who have been holding off on buying a new handset. In Spain, Telefonica started asking new customers to pay a full price for handsets in March. Vodafone followed suit the next month. The companies had been giving the iPhone 4S away for free to lock in customers for fixed contracts. The smartphone fetches about 600 euros ($770) in Apple’s stores when bought without a carrier contract. Contactless Payments In June, Madrid-based Telefonica lost more than 200,000 mobile-phone lines in Spain, while Orange won about 30,260 lines, according to data from local telecommunications regulator CMT. Telefonica has a 38 percent market share, compared with Vodafone’s 28 percent and Orange’s 21 percent. Orange’s Brunet said the company will continue to push subsidies because that’s necessary for attracting consumers to trying out new services such as contactless payments. “When there is a big phone release, whether the iPhone or the Galaxy or another, it boosts competition,” he said. To win back customers, Telefonica will have to soften its stance on subsidies, said Andres Bolumburu, a Banco de Sabadell analyst in Madrid. If the carrier decides not to give the new iPhone away, it will have to come up with a promotional strategy to attract consumers such as Jose Vicente Curiel. “It would be great to get the new iPhone or even the Samsung Galaxy but I won’t pay for it,” said Curiel, a 21-year- old butcher and an Orange customer. “That’s why I don’t see myself migrating to Telefonica or Vodafone.” Retaining Customers Telefonica won’t give the new iPhone away for free in its home market, said a person with knowledge of the company’s plans. The Madrid-based carrier is trying to keep high-quality customers who spend more, and hasn’t stopped providing subsidies for such users, Jose Maria Alvarez-Pallete, head of Telefonica Europe, said in an interview. “We are stepping up our efforts to retain existing customers and one way to achieve that is through handsets,” he said. “If our customers want the iPhone 5, the Samsung Galaxy, a BlackBerry or another handset, when they wish to renew their handset, we will have them ready for them.” Vodafone, based in Newbury, England, may make some “adjustments” to its pricing strategy, including “specific tactics in some markets” as the new iPhone starts selling, Francisco Roman, chairman of Vodafone Spain, said in an interview. Doing away with subsidies is still the company’s aim, he added. French Discounts Vodafone fell 1.4 percent to 174.10 pence at 2:58 p.m. in London. Telefonica gained 2.2 percent to 11.48 euros in Madrid and France Telecom added 1.8 percent to 10.74 euros in Paris. Apple, the world’s most valuable company, added 0.1 percent to $661.19 in New York trading. In France, new market entrant Iliad has gained some early success by offering inexpensive calling plans and not subsidizing handsets, selling them at full price. The carrier, which operates under the Free brand, gained 3.6 million mobile subscribers, or 5.4 percent of the market, in its first six months of business, thanks to plans starting at 2 euros a month. That prompted France Telecom, Vivendi SA (VIV) unit SFR and Bouygues SA (EN) to start separate discount brands to rival Iliad. Still, some of the country’s phone executives, including France Telecom CEO Stephane Richard, have said that phone packages with subsidized handsets will continue to make up the bulk of the market. In a similar analysis, the CEO of Stockholm- based TeliaSonera AB (TLSN), Lars Nyberg, said in July that subsidies were here to stay. Apple Wins In the long run, carriers faced with declining margins and regulatory pressure will look to reduce subsidy costs, Brunet said. That won’t stop them from boosting subsidies short-term. “In these economically difficult times, operators that don’t subsidize smartphones are poised to keep losing market share,” said Peter Braendle, who helps manage about $55 billion at Zurich-based Swisscanto Asset Management. The concern, he said, is that a subsidy war would hurt carriers’ profitability. While carriers’ subsidy strategies differ, the party that’s sure to benefit is the manufacturer of a hit phone. Apple, which has boosted iPhone sales with every edition of the device, became the most valuable U.S. company ever last month on expectation the Cupertino, California-based firm’s next iPhone and new versions of its iPad will win more customers. “Apple is for sure the most likely winner whatever carriers do,” Swisscanto’s Braendle said. “It’s in a very strong position, no doubt.”</Msg><Username>faribachicagomed</Username><Timestamp>1347814816582</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 13:00:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347814867573-121</Id><Topic><Title>New iPhone orders push back date</Title><Username>jzoh9</Username><Timestamp>1347802186909</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 09:29:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>presages that are ordered are sales as you have to pay for them when ordered.</Msg><Username>rlbeard6734</Username><Timestamp>1347814867573</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 13:01:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347814878970-122</Id><Topic><Title>Galaxy S4 coming out february</Title><Username>musichead2005</Username><Timestamp>1347813775214</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 12:42:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>the S3 is arguably still better than the iPhone 5......imagine the S4.....</Msg><Username>musichead2005</Username><Timestamp>1347814878970</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 13:01:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347814994316-123</Id><Topic><Title>aapl news/thoughts here and there</Title><Username>faribachicagomed</Username><Timestamp>1347813609454</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 12:40:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Apple Wants to Build Its Own Pandora. Why? SEPTEMBER 6, 2012 AT 7:07 PM PT Apple is talking to the music labels about a streaming music service along the lines of Pandora, says The Wall Street Journal. Industry sources I’ve talked to say that’s correct. And unlike Apple’s long-running but unsuccessful negotiations with the TV Industrial Complex, this one is easy to imagine getting off the ground. The gist: Apple could launch a Pandora clone tomorrow without the labels’ permission, because if it wanted to do a straightforward “Web radio” service, it could use the same compulsory licenses that Pandora and other Web radio services use. Apple will want more flexibility than those licenses provide, so it will need the labels’ permission for that. That’s not a slam dunk, but it’s quite doable, because the music industry has become a lot more flexible in the past few years. That’s what happens to an industry after a decade-plus of staggering decline. And in any case, the labels are happy to cut deals with Apple. Label chiefs used to blame Apple and its iTunes store for part of their decline, but they’ve gotten over that. And they like generating additional revenue streams. The bigger question is why Apple would want to launch a streaming music service — particularly an ad-supported one like the Journal describes. That’s because ad-supported streaming music is a pretty lousy business. It costs a lot of money, and there doesn’t seem to be a whole lot of upside in it. Pandora, the market leader, struggles to make a profit, and it has been at it for years. The big problem for streaming services is that, unlike other Internet businesses, scale only gets you so far here: Every time Pandora or any other streaming service plays a song, it has to write the labels and other copyright holders a check, and there’s no way off that treadmill. Last quarter, Pandora shoveled nearly 60 percent of its revenue out the door to content holders. Meanwhile, Apple is supposedly asking for more permissive licenses than the ones Pandora gets — ones that would let you play the same song multiple times, for instance — and those should cost more than the ones Pandora has. Follow that logic, and you have to conclude that Apple executives have two ideas, which aren’t mutually exclusive: We can do a much better job at selling ads than Pandora – we have iAd! Even if we can’t make money, it’s worth having our own streaming service. The first one is hard to imagine: Again, Pandora has been at this for a while, tackling the messy — and very local — audio ad market with a lot of feet on the street. Not very Apple-like. And even Tim Cook can’t argue that Apple has put a lot of resources into iAd since it acquired mobile ad start-up Quattro in 2010. People familiar with the company say one big problem the iAd unit has had internally is explaining how they can become a meaningful business — as in, a billion dollars a year — and I don’t see how Web radio ads solves that for them. The second argument makes a bit more sense: Perhaps an Apple-branded streaming service is enough to keep an iPhone or iPad user from jumping ship to rivals like Samsung, Google or Amazon. And if Apple thought it could help sell hardware, it could certainly afford to throw money at the project. Pandora’s expenses are tracking at a $400 million run rate. Definitely doable for a company that has a Walter White-style cash hoard. Hard to imagine Apple taking on a side project, but maybe this an exception. Then again, it could simply shell out a couple billion and buy Pandora itself.</Msg><Username>faribachicagomed</Username><Timestamp>1347814994316</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 13:03:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347815023743-124</Id><Topic><Title>IPhone 5 is a Flop.

In which case, buy Apple, Google, Microsoft, Nokia and Samsung. Maybe the market is telling you this as all the stocks seem to going higher. The mobile revolution is here to stay, there are many more years of a growing pie and everyones piece can grow. Message boards are always filled with posts that claim some one wins and someone loses. It does not have to be that way in a market with a massively growing pie. All the new phones coming out are pretty darn cool, iPhone 5, Lumia 920, Galaxy S3 and Google/Motorola Razer series. Alot of people are still using flip phones and will be transtioning to smart phones, and a lot of the emerging world is just entering the cell phone age.

Instead you would say, "well considering how the EURO has jumped since the time of AAPL Frankfurt ATH of 548, it`s no mystery that Frankfurt hasn`t blown right through that 52wk like we have here." I`m not sure you understand how the price is calculated for Frankfurt trading. the US price it the bench mark. you have to take the price of the EURUSD into consideration for the Frankfurt price. theoretically, if the EURO kept going up and up, the price would never get back to 548 no matter how high the USD price were to go--but the values would still be the same (and no, that won`t happen) (not to mention that a whole day of Frankfurt volume is covered in about the first 0.10 to1min of regular hours US trading--no exaggeration, but that has no bearing on this topic). had the EURO continued to go down (instead of up, like it has) from 1.25 to 1.20, for example, the price in Frankfurt on Friday when the US price was 686.3 would have been = 571.92. If the EURO had gone up even higher than it has, say 1.40, 686.3 would have been = 490.21!!!

Sales look great, but are largely priced in. Apple has had a great and deserved run, but greed gets most investors, coupled with mania/herd mentality. Here it is actually very simple. Upside looks limited as big moves already in, while downside looks possible. In any case, the upside case, no matter how you view it, becomes harder and harder, as the Cap expands. I am not sure why anyone would now buy that has not already, or have they been in a fog bank??? Smart people do not try and squeeze out the last bit of action, they take some off the table, and look for new potential. I see many situations out there now where growth and stock prices in percentage terms with respect to upside potential far exceed Apple at this point.IMO Particularly with a focus on the future in Biotech. I suspect the next huge winners are coming from that sector. Apple will move towards being like Microsoft. Big, great, but with its best action behind it. Move on to some extent, is my view. Not taking at least some profits is just plain dumb.IMO</Msg><Username>eric6n</Username><Timestamp>1347820226998</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 14:30:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347820242847-153</Id><Topic><Title>How can Galaxy III S be better than iPhone........</Title><Username>bigbizluvr</Username><Timestamp>1347813267905</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 12:34:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>i don't post about my portfolio and my gain. only fools talk about their money. you are no scientist. a scientist is full of curiosity and wants to try all products before formulating thoughts about them. you are also either an old fool or very young to need to tell anyone on a message board how much you have made. now, as fa s giving tips. everyone need to do their own HOMEWORK. believe me i do mine. if i were a betting person( and i am not) , i would say you are very young. i hope you make a ton of money and have a great life. someday you may even become a scientist. but not today</Msg><Username>faribachicagomed</Username><Timestamp>1347820242847</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 14:30:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347820937334-154</Id><Topic><Title>selling 7million shares at 698</Title><Username>ddeboy</Username><Timestamp>1347630664072</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 09:51:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>unless you're bill gates or buffet...quit trying to boost your insecurities with lies on message boards....first of all...and people correct me if I am wrong but what numnut who is cashing out $5.58 billion dollars in a day going to go and brag about it on a cheesy yahoo message board...bless your heart!</Msg><Username>jd_bozeman</Username><Timestamp>1347820937334</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 14:42:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347821169189-155</Id><Topic><Title>selling 7million shares at 698</Title><Username>ddeboy</Username><Timestamp>1347630664072</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 09:51:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>sure you are....enjoy the paper profit</Msg><Username>lrcourtney56</Username><Timestamp>1347821169189</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 14:46:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347821179588-156</Id><Title>RIMM bringing back the torqouise Princess rotary phone.

Maybe I'll do that. Here's the question: When did you buy those shares at $80.? I'd have to look that up, but that's got to be few years ago. Figure up the % gain per yr that would be. I'll bet its not very impressive. THAT'S THE POINT. HIMX has more than doubled since last Nov. when I bought it and its just now accelerating that gain. My purpose was to interest others in HIMX not brag about what I made. I could go on praising HIMX, but please do research and see for yourself. Yes, I would like for more people to own it (someone even said they think they have chips in the iphone5-well maybe). It really doesn't matter; they have a lot of customers and they have some stuff that could be REAL GAMECHANGERS. My final question was because I certainly assume very,very few here would have that much faith to be holding that long and 80% probably bought at above $500. which means not that much gain. What people are doing here is simply gambling; they have no idea where appl's going except by faith. Interestingly, I have my own scientific methods to tell me where my stocks are going-little guesswork involved. To the other one: are you from chicago (i'm thinking that has got to be a real stupid place)? Clearly you're not qualified to tell me I'm not a scientist. And, bizwiz, if I were you I'd put a sell stop limit (not sellstop) at a comfortable place under your shares and move it up periodically if it keeps going up.</Msg><Username>discountbrains</Username><Timestamp>1347822544453</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 15:09:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347822596391-171</Id><Topic><Title>Apple to announce number of pre phone orders...have fun shorts....</Title><Username>donkey_carts_can_be_fun</Username><Timestamp>1347821501456</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 14:51:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>5.5-6 million. and the 1 week number at over 10 million. SEP 13, ’12 11:20 AM AUTHOR Horace Dediu CATEGORIES Market The iPhone 4S sold about 4 million units in the first three days of availability last year. The iPhone 4 sold about 1.7 million and iPhone 3GS about 1 million. The main driver to growth for the initial weekend is usually upgrades for existing customers. There might be first time buyers, but the dedication required to ensure being first to have it usually means buyers are keen on the brand and are repeat customers. The other factor is the number of countries where the phone is available. The 4 was initially available in 5 countries. The 4S in seven and now the 5 will be in nine countries. I made a list of the differences in launch countries for the 4S and the 5 below: (the countries listed does not post..google to see it) I’ve also listed the second week launch countries for completeness and shown which countries have changed.[1] The performance of the 5 in the first weekend should be better on a volume basis simply because there are more existing customers who wish to upgrade and because there are more initial and significant launch countries. The 4S launched with an average of 1.3 million units per day but 191k units/day/country. The 4 launched with 113k units/day/country. If we assume that the 5 can capture 220k units/day/country we reach 2 million units/day for this launch footprint and a total of about 6 million units for the launch weekend. These estimates are shown below relative the the other iPhone and the iPad launches. (the graph does not post...google this article) The additional shipments to fulfill orders for the second week may see the iPhone 5 sell over 10 million units before the quarter is over. — Notes: Hong Kong and Singapore are noteworthy initial launch additions, Poland a noteworthy second week addition and Mexico a noteworthy second week omission.</Msg><Username>faribachicagomed</Username><Timestamp>1347822596391</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 15:09:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347822724158-172</Id><Topic><Title>Apple to announce number of pre phone orders...have fun shorts....</Title><Username>donkey_carts_can_be_fun</Username><Timestamp>1347821501456</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 14:51:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Pre-orders for the first 24 hours are expected to be 1.3 - 1.5 million iPhone 5s.

I expect the presales not to be much better than last year's, but I expect results post launch weekend to be incrementally better (tempered by supply).

Each successive iPhone launch gets frothier (still) than the previous one. Sales of the iPhone 4S were 1M in the first day, compared to Apple’s then most successful launch of the iPhone 4 which sold 1.7M in the first weekend. Pre-orders for the iPhone 4 were ten times greater than those for the iPhone 3GS, and pre-orders for the iPhone 4S exceeded 1M in the first 24 hours. Within an hour, pre-order inventory for the iPhone 5 on Apple’s website was sold out and by early Friday, delays for shipments of the new iPhone 5 were 1-2 weeks. Currently on the Apple website, iPhone 5s pre-ordered today will be available for shipment in 2-3 weeks, and this is before the product is even available in the stores. Pent-up demand effect on sales is becoming more pronounced. The pattern for pent-up demand on iPhone releases has intensified over time. As I have written previously, for the past three product upgrades, iPhone unit sales have increased 41%, 66% and 117% over the quarter previous to the product release. What is even more interesting is that each successive product introduction is more popular that the previous one. The unit iPhone sales increased 91% in the quarter that the iPhone 4 was released over the quarter when the iPhone 3GS was released. That was pretty impressive yet it paled compared to the iPhone 4S release. Unit iPhone sales increased 163% in the first full quarter of the iPhone 4S release over the quarter when the iPhone 4 released. Potential sales in the US alone are significant. On top of this typical pattern, it is estimated that 30M AT&amp;T and Verizon customers’ contracts will expire in the fourth quarter qualifying them for subsidies on the iPhone 5 purchase. Given the shipment delays due to pre-order demand, most of these upgrades will take place in the CYQ4, or Apple’s Q1FY13. To date, the largest quarter for iPhones sales was the December 2011 quarter, encompassing the iPhone 4S upgrade, and Apple sold 37M iPhones in that quarter.</Msg><Username>ceinternational1</Username><Timestamp>1347828146086</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 16:42:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347828349750-209</Id><Title>Apple iPhone 5 with 1 Gb of RAM....yippie....</Title><Msg>Nice upgrade....</Msg><Username>donkey_carts_can_be_fun</Username><Timestamp>1347828349750</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 16:45:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347828473861-210</Id><Topic><Title>Potential Good News: i5 Blowout Sales, Stock Split, Added to the DOW, &amp; Earning &amp; Holiday Blowout sales!!!</Title><Username>ceinternational1</Username><Timestamp>1347770221896</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 00:37:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Multi-country rollout is more aggressive than expected. The iPhone 5 will be available in US, Canada, UK, France, Germany, Australia, Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore on September 21, with 22 more countries in the following week and to 100 countries by December. The rollout is more aggressive than many had previously considered given announcements earlier in the year of component shortages from Qualcomm and others. It is likely that the supply constraints affected other manufacturers rather than Apple and Apple had its supply agreements in place prior to product announcements. China to launch in December. Both China Telecom and China Unicom have told Chinese press that they expect to see the iPhone 5 in China in December, and the earlier in December these products can be released, the stronger effect it will have on earnings. Demand for Apple products is exuberant in China. It is Apple’s fastest growing and second largest market. To highlight the impact of China on Apple: In this past quarter, sales in China were $7.9B, up three-fold over the period a year prior. And the demand for the iPhones is almost ravenous. Lines formed overnight outside of stores before the iPhone 4S. The largest e-commerce retailers in China have been taking pre-orders for the not-yet-released iPhone 5 since July.</Msg><Username>ceinternational1</Username><Timestamp>1347828473861</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 16:47:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347828551782-211</Id><Title>If Apple went to $760 its current PE would be 17.8....not bad.....what was Amazon....310....</Title><Msg>If it was $830 its current PE would be 19.4.....Apple has some room to move up.</Msg><Username>donkey_carts_can_be_fun</Username><Timestamp>1347828551782</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 16:49:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347828788510-212</Id><Topic><Title>Guess The Weekend Sales Number.</Title><Username>scropos21</Username><Timestamp>1347821519534</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 14:51:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>My estimate refers to the entire weekend.

Apple’s December quarter is lining up to be enormous, and should close in on the amount Apple earned for all of FY 11 ($27.68). Apple should see earnings close to $25 in Q1FY13, based upon strong iPhone and iPod demand, not to mention strong uptake of Macs. Apple sold 37M iPhones in December quarter 2011 with the introduction of the iPhone 4s. While the iPhone 4S was very popular, it left many waiting for a new and improved form factor and faster network speeds, both highlighted in the iPhone 5. Given the pent-up demand for the iPhone 5 and the historical pattern of successive successful product introductions, it is conceivable that Apple could sell close to 55-60M iPhones in the December quarter and lift iPods 10-20% above the 19K sold and $176 ASPs n the previous upgrade cycle. These estimates are not including an iPad Mini or Apple TV (of sorts) that may still be a possibility for the holiday season. If they are introduced, the iPad Mini in particular, these estimates will be conservative. One last note for investors: It is becoming increasingly clear that investments in Apple, like many companies in this sector, should be considered on an annual, not quarterly basis. The ebb and flow of product introductions by these companies and their competitors can dramatically affect quarter-to-quarter swings, while annual comparisons show trends. As we have seen with Apple, consumers are becoming much more savvy about product upgrades and the associated timing, and purchasing behavior is affected. In Apple’s case so far, product introductions have served to dramatically lift sales in the quarter they are readily available (and Apple is timing them for the holiday quarter) but have also served to dampen demand in the quarter preceding. The more successful Apple is to generate excitement around a pending new product announcement, the more that previous quarter is affected. Yes, annual earnings continue to trend up from $9.08 in FY 09 to $15.15 in FY10 to $27.68 in FY 11 to $35.49 so far in FY12. Investors should take this into account and take advantage of those quarter “misses” (and stock declines) when these misses may foreshadow a monster quarter.</Msg><Username>ceinternational1</Username><Timestamp>1347829413872</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 17:03:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347829875035-220</Id><Title>New York Times Story - Earnings Outlook in U.S. Dims as Global Economy Slows</Title><Msg>Check New York Times Cover Page</Msg><Username>pricelinelong</Username><Timestamp>1347829875035</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 17:11:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347830370946-221</Id><Title>Geekbench reports iPhone 5 faster than ANY Android phone...</Title><Msg>The total Geekbench 2 score comes in at 1601.

Ron Paul (R-Texas) could create a "nightmare scenario" for the central bank.</Title><Msg>See the article from "The Hill" titled .......Bernanke warns Ron Paul's Fed audit bill could cause 'nightmare scenario' Here is an excerpt: Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke warned Wednesday that an audit bill pushed by Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas) could create a "nightmare scenario" for the central bank. Testifying before the House Financial Services Committee, Bernanke pushed back against efforts to subject the Fed to full audits by the Government Accountability Office (GAO), cautioning that doing so would subject the politically independent institution to the whims of lawmakers and render the Fed ineffective. "The nightmare scenario that I have is one in which some future Fed chairman would decide to say, raise the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, and somebody in this room would say, 'I don’t like this decision and I want the [Government Accountability Office] to go in ... and give us an independent opinion of whether or not that would be the right decision," he said. Establishing a system in which the Fed's monetary policy moves could be immediately called into question by lawmakers would have a "chilling effect" on the institution and generally reduce its ability to help steer the economy, he warned. "There's a lot of evidence that an independent central bank ... will deliver lower inflation and better economic results," he said. Bernanke found himself fielding questions from multiple Republicans on the matter as legislation that would allow Congress to direct the GAO to review all Fed operations is making its way through the House. Paul's bill, which has garnered 271 co-sponsors, was approved by voice vote by the House Oversight Committee in June, and GOP leadership has committed to a floor vote on the measure sometime this month. Bernanke said he was largely supportive of the measure in general, but maintained it was "absolutely critical" to exempt Fed policy decisions from immediate oversight. He detailed the number of ways the Fed is already accountable to Congress and emphasized that the Fed is committed to that goal. "I agree absolutely with Dr. Paul that the Federal Reserve needs to be transparent and it needs to be accountable," he said. "I would argue at this point we are quite transparent and accountability." He went on to indicate that Paul's bill is not being accurately sold to the public, contending that the Fed is already being audited under common understanding. "I think the term 'audit the Fed' is deceptive. The public thinks auditing means checking the books ... making sure you're not doing special deals," he said. "All of those things are completely open." Paul, who likely was facing Bernanke for the final time before he retires this fall, was unconvinced.

At what price? See the article from Huliq titled....."Apple's Foxconn electronics manufacturer blamed for Chinese child slave labor" Here is an excerpt... PORTLAND, Ore. - High tech manufacturing companies here in the Portland region would love to be the source for Apple’s 37 million iPhones that sold in just the last three months of 2011, but that honor goes to China’s Foxconn. On Jan. 24, Apple announced “revenue of more than $46 billion” for the quarter ending December 31. Just try to imagine 37 million iPhones: that’s how many Apple sold in just the last three months of 2011 thanks for Apple’s manufacturer in China called ‘Foxconn,’” explained a Jan. 29 report on CBC News “Sunday Morning.” This report also pointed to “The dark side of shiny Apple products” in a lead story headline that detailed massive child “slave labor” and “regular suicides” by those Foxconn employees – including young children -- “who make each and every iPhone by hand,” for what amounts to, state experts, “as slave wages.” At the same time, high tech and cutting edge micro-electronics manufacturing used to be a huge part of the Made in America brand here in Portland’s version of Silicon Valley, but now China’s “Foxconn” is producing the most advanced technology for Apple’s iPhone, iPad and other American high-tech companies are following suit by sending most of their business to Foxconn. Portland can’t compete with China’s low wages Portland doesn’t have all the glitz of the Chinese manufacturing company “Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd (trading as Foxconn), nor does it have Apple’s electronics manufacturing business, but unemployed workers here in Portland “wish it did." "Yea, I wish Apple and other successful American companies would do the right thing and practice ‘Made in America,’ but how can you beat the low wages that are paid over in China,” explains Portland local Erik Perlman during a Jan. 29 Huliq interview near to the city’s popular “White Stag sign” landmark that used to mean Portland was “high tech” due, part, to the sign once being an early version of a neon sign. Today, lament Perlman and other out-of-work people – who once depended upon Portland’s high tech industries as a source of employment – who now blame Apple and other U.S. technology manufactures for “making a deal with China, and shipping all the jobs overseas.” In turn, "Occupy Portland" protesters have urged citizens to not buy Foxconn products, stating: "It helps feed corporations who spend money to get their political henchmen elected." And, states the Occupy movement, purchasing a product made in a Chinese sweatshop hurts America, and American workers." Thus, such sad stories are not uncommon in America today; while Perlman notes “we are still in a recession ‘cause there are no jobs.” China's Foxconn gets all the jobs In turn, Foxconn’s clients include American, European and Japanese companies. Notable products which the company manufactures include Apple’s iPad, iPhone, the Amazon Kindle, PlayStation 3, Wii and even the Xbox 360. In turn, Foxconn is the “largest exporter in Greater China” of technology goods sold in America. Also, computer components manufacturer Intel is the Portland area’s largest employer, providing jobs for more than 15,000 people, according to a State of Oregon economics report for 2011 that also notes how “many manufacturing jobs have gone to China; thus leaving Portland’s metro area – that’s home to more than 1,200 technology companies – wanting for just a small piece of the pie that China’s Foxconn now controls. Portland local Erik Perlman and other laid-off technology manufacturing workers, point to the city’s old nickname as “Silicon Forest,” that they say used to describe the Portland area because of the abundance of trees in the Portland region and that it “once was as promising for tech manufacturing as the Silicon Valley region down the West Coast in the San Francisco Bay region. “Today, we only wish we were the Silicon Forest again,” added Perlman with a deep sense of chagrin. Apple justifies Chinese slave labor for children Tim Cook, the man who replaced the late Steve Jobs as CEO of Apple, told Wall Street analysts the company couldn't keep up with global demand for the new iPhone 4S. "We didn't bet high enough," he said in a Jan. 29 CBS News Sunday Morning report. In turn, this Jan. 29 Sunday Morning news reported opened with an alarming story about how “the world is in love with everything Apple, but here's a question: Have you ever wondered where all that stuff gets made?” It’s alarming because of child “slave labor and worker suicides.” "I had never thought ever, in a dedicated way, about how they were made," said performer Mike Daisey, an admitted geek. That is the centerpiece of his monologue, "The Agony and the Ecstasy of Steve Jobs." “The show is an on-stage expose of working conditions at a factory in Shenzhen, China, owned by a company called Foxconn, which manufactures electronics under contract for practically every major brand you can name, including Apple. It is, as Daisey says in his performance piece, ‘the biggest company you've never heard of. Foxconn makes over 50 percent of all electronics in the world.’ The Foxconn plant in Shenzhen employs more than 400,000 people.” The dark side of shiny Apple products In turn, CBS News showed images of Foxconn companies -- that make each and every iPhone and iPad by hand – erecting massive circus-sized netting around the bottom of its building where Apple products are made. The netting is to catch those Chinese child workers – with many thousands under the age of 14 – leaping to their deaths due to the high-stress and long working hours (with many reported working in 12-14 hour shifts to meet Apple’s demand for more iPhone and iPad products worldwide). In fact, one Foxconn worker named “Sun Dayong,” reportedly committed suicide after reporting the loss of an iPhone4 prototype in his possession. In reaction to a rash of worker suicides at Foxconn – with the company admitting that “14 died of suicide in 2010” by leaping off the building where Apple products are made – an investigative report was investigated by “20 Chinese universities” that described Foxconn “as labor camps and detailed widespread worker abuse and illegal overtime.” Meanwhile, leading world news agency’s pointed to a protest earlier this month at Wuhan, China, where “150 workers threatened to commit mass suicide because of worsening work conditions. The employees had asked for a raise but were told they could either quit with compensation or keep their jobs with no raise. The employees quit, but did not receive their compensation.” Also, in response to the Foxconn suicides, CBS News and other media reported how “Foxconn installed suicide-prevention netting at some facilities.” "If you've never been to the economic engines of China, these giant buildings stacked up with people, they're just staggering," said Daisey in the CBS News report Jan. 29. "It almost takes your breath away." Kids 12 and 13 making Apple products Daisey went to Shenzhen and said Foxconn wouldn't let him in, so he stood outside the main gate with his translator, talking to workers at shift change. "In my first two hours of my first day at that gate, I met workers who are 14 years old," Daisey said. "I met workers who were 13 years old. I met workers who were 12. Do you really think Apple doesn't know?" But what was news were the suicides, asked CBS News during this lead story on its “Sunday Morning” program Jan. 29. "While I was there, in May and June 2010, that's really at the peak of when the suicides were happening with kind of terrible regularity," he said, "where week after week, workers would go up onto the roofs of these buildings and throw themselves off the buildings." "When you were there, were there nets around the building to prevent further suicides?" asked the CBS News reporter. "There was," he said. "They look a lot like the nets you would put out to catch fish." Apple iPhones for you, suicide for Chinese workers "From the spike of suicides at Foxconn, we began to question maybe the harsh management methods drive the workers to commit suicide," said Debby Chan, a project manager for SACOM - Students and Scholars Against Corporate Misbehavior, a labor watchdog group based in Hong Kong. SACOM reported at least 18 Foxconn workers committed suicide in 2010, and more tried. "We began to interview the workers, and then many of them told us they have work pressure - if they make some mistake they would be punished."</Msg><Username>stem_cur</Username><Timestamp>1347838960015</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 19:42:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347838961515-320</Id><Topic><Title>Brian White from Topeka Capital expects pre-orders for iPhone 5 to come in at 1.3 - 1.5 million.

I came to the realization that the iphone is made for women or homosexuals, or males with girly hands.</Msg><Username>rimmbberry</Username><Timestamp>1347851403249</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 23:10:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347851506223-477</Id><Topic><Title>I was in an ATT store over the weekend</Title><Username>rimmbberry</Username><Timestamp>1347851403249</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 23:10:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Your right, iPhone is the smaller sports car.....Galaxy is the minivan of phones.....good analogy.</Msg><Username>lrcourtney56</Username><Timestamp>1347851506223</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 23:11:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347851558938-478</Id><Topic><Title>I think Apple will settle down around $500 by year end..</Title><Username>better_to_short_it</Username><Timestamp>1347846635126</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 21:50:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What a #$%$</Msg><Username>nscvials</Username><Timestamp>1347851558938</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 23:12:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347851586816-479</Id><Topic><Title>........China, Japan heading towards war, says US Defence Secretary Leon Panetta</Title><Username>stem_cur</Username><Timestamp>1347841497539</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 20:24:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>See BBC article titled.....

I think Apple will trade with the market at this point. Some profit taking could taake us to 680 near-term. Not a bad time to hedge with some puts. I don't own underlying so covered calls not an option. My spreads go to 670 going to OCT22 and some naked calls to Jan14.
