You never cease…” – t.bfine Then why did you conveniently leave off my next sentence which specified that it was not made up? Here is your exact quote: “We wouldn’t know. We did not send our two to public schools because they were already a disaster…” Anyone reading that would understand that you are saying you would have sent them to public schools if they were good, “but because they were already a disaster” you chose not to. (Incidentally, I don’t disagree with your assessment of many inner-city schools, particularly back then, nor your decision not to send your kids there.) It’s a shame, however, that you need to try to blame the public schools, and then not surprisingly, the Democrats for your quandary. The fact is, you knew what the schools were like going in, and said, essentially, “I don’t care about the public schools, because as a good Catholic, I’m sending my kids to Parochial school regardless.” Of course, if you truly wanted public schools, you could have moved to a district that was acceptable to you. Or you could have gotten involved with the public schools through any number of avenues available to you to help improve them, such as PTO, PTA, Boosters, committees, monitors, volunteers, etc. Again, I have no problem with your assessment of the schools, or your decision. It’s a shame you can’t simply say, “Hey, we wanted to live in the city, and I was going to send my kids to Catholic school anyhow, so what difference does it make?” Instead, rather than take responsibility for your own decision, you lament, “Guess which party has ruled the city for decades?” Well, I think that would be the party that the electorate of the city wants in power and voted for, no? Again, I’m pretty sure that with having a Democratic Mayor since 1949, you also knew that going in, didn’t you? “As long as we continue to sugar coat everything we won't fix our problems.” – t.bfine And we won’t fix them with gated communities, eminent domain or abandoning public education for the masses in favor of advanced education for only those who can afford it. People don’t choose where or to whom they are born. How would you feel if your two kids lived in the school district you chose to live in, without your fortunate ability to send them to private school?</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1370000325589</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-31 07:38:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370001151257-4</Id><Topic><Title>Land of the free</Title><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1369948675101</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 17:17:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>...“Home schools are usually faith based.” Swell.

We did not send our two to public schools because they were already a disaster…” Not a complaint, but a statement of fact which you now seem to concede. And yes, the city elects it's leaders and in doing so deserves their legacy. It is interesting that you note St. Louis has enjoyed democrat leadership since 1949. Do you find it the least bit interesting that the population of the City of St. Louis in 1950 was 857,000 and as of 2010 stands at 319,000? That tends to equate to a dying city in my view. Drive around St. Louis today and you will see blocks upon blocks of bulldozed homes resulting in vacant city blocks sprouting nothing but weeds. The last truly outstanding Democrat mayor St. Louis had was Alfonso Cervantes during the late 60's, early 70's. The man had a vision for St. Louis. He worked like a mad man to revitalize the Central West End, Laclede's Landing, Gas Light Square and the river front in general. He embraced business leaders with a keen understanding of the jobs they create and support along with the contribution business makes to the tax base. He was a one man Chamber of Commerce and city ambassador. He was everywhere selling the city working like a banshee to get folks to live in the city. That noted, he was unfortunately a dying breed. Actually old ricky, in an earlier post offers a pretty fair generic summary of the demise of many major cities. I don't agree with all the underlying reasons he notes, but I don't find him off by much. As ricky noted, the city experienced a mass exodus and the talent as well as money that goes with it. If you don't think political beliefs played a role, so be it. Other factors played a role to be sure, but I believe success or failure starts at the top. I will say that perhaps, just perhaps the same would have happened to St. Louis if Republicans had been in control. I have my view, you have yours. I'll leave it at that.</Msg><Username>t.bfine</Username><Timestamp>1370006315776</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-31 09:18:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370007131434-9</Id><Title>I've got it!</Title><Msg>Thanks real echo for the clue.

It means the supply of housing exceeded the demand for housing so the price went down. That's it. If you have 1,000 people, all of high income, living in 1,000 houses, what do you think happens when 500 of them decide to sell and no one wants to move into the neighborhood? The price of housing declines. It declines instantly due to lack of demand and for the long term due to neglect and blight. This occurs even if the remaining 500 people have a high income. That is what happenned in our cities. Property taxes have absolutely nothing to do with welfare or even really income. They have to do with the value of property. In fact, section 8 housing can be very valuable because you're guarenteed to get the rent every month.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1370013274068</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-31 11:14:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370013757763-23</Id><Topic><Title>Way to go FOX News</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1369912936115</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 07:22:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That is true, fake ricky.

Money in the bank doesn't do that.</Msg><Username>richguyintraining</Username><Timestamp>1370017811930</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-31 12:30:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370018166959-34</Id><Topic><Title>Land of the free</Title><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1369948675101</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 17:17:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You can't argue with logic like that! :)</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1370018166959</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-31 12:36:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370018206235-35</Id><Title>Every day it drops 10 - 15 - 20 cents...</Title><Msg>Drip drip drip - doesn't seem like much but it is slowly killing this stock - that's a dollar a week or more - not good!

The Obama's had an option not to attend public schools because they came from families with money. You and the Obama's want to force public education on everyone but exclude yourself. Home school just another option to public schools something you and the Obama's and the 1 percents never had to deal with because you had enough money to buy your way out. Again, these kids are involved in sports, band, social clubs home schooling does not mean they never step outside the confines to their homes.

I play baseball and basketball with my 14 and 10-year-old grandsons and their coaches thank me for the extra work I do with them that has helped make them excellent players is multiple sports.

I invested the max allowed in my company’s 401K plan, the retirement programs, and outside investments in real estate and other stock accounts for over twenty years. I do watch Fox on occasion, I also watch MSNBC, network news, and when really bored to tears I watch CNN. I read the local newspaper on a daily basis; I read several periodicals and selected articles from the WSJ and NY Times on line. I vote in every election.

At home, a friend, abroad, an introduction, in solitude a solace and in society an ornament. It chastens vice, it guides virtue, it gives at once grace and government to genius. Without it, what is man? A splendid slave, a reasoning savage.” - Joseph Addison "A new international poll finds the least popular country in the world is Iran. After hearing this, North Korea said, 'What do we have to do’?” - Conan O'Brien “Science may set limits to knowledge, but should not set limits to imagination.” - Bertrand Russell “There are three things you can do in a baseball game. You can win, or you can lose, or it can rain.” – Casey Stengel "President Obama is in a lot of hot water lately. Despite the scandals, 53 percent of Americans say they approve of the job he's doing. The other 47 percent are being audited." - Conan O'Brien “A graduation ceremony is an event where the commencement speaker tells thousands of students dressed in identical caps and gowns that ‘individuality’ is the key to success.” – Robert Orben “Let us not look back in anger, nor forward in fear, but around in awareness.” – James Thurber "During a Senate hearing yesterday, Senator John McCain said it was too hard to always have to update apps on his iPhone. No one has the heart to tell him the device he was holding was a garage door opener." - Conan O'Brien “The scale, properly speaking, does not permit the measure of the intelligence, because intellectual qualities are not superposable, and therefore cannot be measured as linear surfaces are measured.” – Alfred Binet</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1370053468095</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-31 22:24:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370053489103-85</Id><Title>AHQ (cont.)...</Title><Msg>...“Do what you can, with what you have, where you are.” - anonymous “There are those who will always confuse courtesy with cowardess, &amp; politeness for weakness.” – Martin Lear "It's coming out that in high school, President Obama signed a girl's yearbook by calling her sweet and foxy. Of course, now he calls her Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano." - Conan O'Brien “Don't think of organ donations as giving up part of yourself to keep a total stranger alive. It's really a total stranger giving up almost all of themselves to keep part of you alive.” - anonymous “Well done is better than well said.” – Benjamin Franklin "Pope Francis made an extremely controversial statement. He says he believes anyone can go to heaven if you do good deeds, even atheists. Some Catholics were upset by his comments because it means we wasted a lot of Sundays going to church." - Jimmy Kimmel “To invent, you need a good imagination and a pile of junk.” – Thomas Edison “Even if there is only one possible unified theory, it is just a set of rules and equations. What is it that breathes fire into the equations and makes a universe for them to describe? The usual approach of science of constructing a mathematical model cannot answer the questions of why there should be a universe for the model to describe. Why does the universe go to all the bother of existing?” – Stephen P. Hawking "Everything's going bad for President Obama with Benghazi and other controversies. But Obama's trying to turn things around. He's sending in SEAL Team 6 to bring back Justin Bieber's monkey…And if SEAL Team 6 doesn't work, he's sending in Dennis Rodman." - David Letterman “In about the same degree as you are helpful, you will be happy.” - Karl Reiland</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1370053489103</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-31 22:24:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370053510702-86</Id><Title>AHQ (3)...</Title><Msg>...“Music is the pleasure the human soul experiences from counting without being aware that it is counting.” - Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz “The typical gambler might not really understand the probabilistic nuances of the wheel or the dice, but such things seem a bit more tractable than, say, trying to raise a child in this lunatic society of ours.” – Arthur S. Reber "The Obama administration is experiencing multiple scandals, and the Republicans are having multiple orgasms. Three scandals at once? Rush Limbaugh today said, 'I feel like I'm on Oxycontin again’.” - Bill Maher “Wheresoever you go, go with all your heart.” – Kongzi “To go straight to the deepest depth, I went for Hegel; what unclear thoughtless flow of words I was to find there! My unlucky star led me from Hegel to Schopenhauer ... Even in Kant there were many things that I could grasp so little that given his general acuity of mind I almost suspected that he was pulling the reader's leg or was even an imposter.” – D. Flamm, 1983 "Time magazine just released a picture of a 17-year-old President Obama with his prom date. They would've published a picture of Joe Biden with his prom date, but his mom didn't want to be photographed." - Jimmy Fallon “Globalization, as defined by rich people like us, is a very nice thing... you are talking about the Internet, you are talking about cell phones, you are talking about computers. This doesn't affect two-thirds of the people of the world.” – Jimmy Carter “You’re a woman who’s been getting nothing but dirty breaks. Well, we can clean and tighten your brakes, but you’ll have to stay in the garage all night.” - Groucho Marx "According to a new survey, white Americans are more likely to see President Obama as angry than black Americans. After hearing about it, Obama got really angry – according to white Americans." - Conan O'Brien “A pre-emptive war in 'defense' of freedom would surely destroy freedom, because one simply cannot engage in barbarous action without becoming a barbarian, because one cannot defend human values by calculated and unprovoked violence without doing mortal damage to the values one is trying to defend.” – J.
