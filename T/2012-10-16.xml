By any metrics, T is the market leader and best in class. How? Take a look a look at their last partnership with IBM to provide the world's most secure network. The case of S very much reminds me of AMD versus INTC. If AMD gets funded with unlimited number of dollars, can it cath up with INTC? Absolutely positively not for the simple reason that INTC is the market leader whether you go by techonological innovation, installed base, marketing and on and on. #$%$&amp;P correctly stated, the recent announcement by S to have access to pool of funds is no more than a minor negative. Next week, the earnings number should be in pretty good shape and next month, look for the dividend to go up.</Msg><Username>madam_hillary_o8</Username><Timestamp>1350384652591</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 06:50:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350388307279-3</Id><Topic><Title>Hillary flees country admits responsibility for Libya attack</Title><Username>art_bell51</Username><Timestamp>1350356742512</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 23:05:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Clinton- "The decisions about security are made by security professionals."

Her Republican opponent is going to win out even after making a few bad statements that the Liberal Media has pounded him for. It's no longer possible to trust the Liberal Media. It's the American people who will suffer from this.” – sdmiller4747 The opponent, Todd Akin, like you, is a misogynistic doofus so far removed from reality that it is absolutely mind-boggling that ANY political party would suggest he is fit to serve in ANY political capacity. Suggesting that his “few bad statements” were somehow related to the “Liberal Media” is preposterous to all but you chauvinistic, nutballs of the evangelical lunatic fringe. Here are the first of his ‘few bad statements” responding to women’s rights to abortion after being raped. “Well you know, people always want to try to make that as one of those things, well how do you, how do you slice this particularly tough sort of ethical question. First of all, from what I understand from doctors, that’s really rare. If it’s a legitimate rape the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down. But let’s assume that maybe that didn’t work or something. I think there should be some punishment, but the punishment ought to be on the rapist and not attacking the child.” There it is, unaltered by the MSM…your guy telling you that if your wife or daughter is raped (legitimately, whatever the hell that means), that you can be the proud papa, caregiver and father in absentia for life to some pervert’s offspring. Are you really that sick? Of course, the GOP wanted him to step down. He wouldn’t, and unbelievably, “The National Republican Senatorial Committee now supports his candidacy and has reopened the door to spending on his behalf.” So, Akin then continued revealing his appallingly archaic views on women when, after debating Senator McCaskill, he accused her of being “unladylike and aggressive.” Oh, my!!...how unlike the accepted norms for the Stepford Wives of the GOP who are expected to be docile and submissive (although, I’m pretty sure in the real world they can now also fly F-16 combat aircraft, become astronauts, and, by golly, even be a U.S. Senator!). Imagine that…”the wife” in combat. Who’d have thunk it? As the poster-boy for the Republican’s War on Women, Akin (and by default, the GOP who caved into him) have clearly established their position on women’s rights which are, in fact, reflected in the GOP party platform for this election. You folks can keep pushing your radical views to extremes like the Personhood Amendment, but you are alienating women, and most reasonably sane people, to such an extent, that it leaves your “good ‘ol boy” club as an underwhelming minority in this country dying out like the philosophical dinosaurs that you are.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1350390344121</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 08:25:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350393265946-7</Id><Topic><Title>Hillary flees country admits responsibility for Libya attack</Title><Username>art_bell51</Username><Timestamp>1350356742512</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 23:05:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well, since the cat is out of the bag, this President needed someone in his administration to take responsibility before today's debate.</Msg><Username>t.bfine</Username><Timestamp>1350393265946</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 09:14:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350393867119-8</Id><Topic><Title>Obama-funded Battery Plant laying off Workers</Title><Username>ricky1820l</Username><Timestamp>1350261619978</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 20:40:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nice, did any out there have info that you are a sexual deviant, and a possible commy. lets use fact not heresay.</Msg><Username>minnflier</Username><Timestamp>1350393867119</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 09:24:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350393875372-9</Id><Topic><Title>T versus S</Title><Username>madam_hillary_o8</Username><Timestamp>1350384652591</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 06:50:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I agree, here is a piece out of a Reuter's report today: "Softbank Corp's (9984.T) pricey $20 billion bid to buy control of No. 3 U.S. telecoms company Sprint Nextel Corp (S.N) marks a bold move by billionaire CEO Masayoshi Son beyond his flagging home market. Some analysts say it hands the U.S. company much-needed firepower to buy peers and build out high-speed networks. But if Son succeeds, Sprint will still struggle to win customers in a market dominated by the twin towers of the U.S. mobile landscape - Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) and AT&amp;T Inc (T.N) - while T-Mobile and MetroPCS Communications Inc (PCS.N) move to team up. That market dynamic will persist, analysts say." Furthermore, this deal will likely take a year to work through the regulatory approval process. The current T/VZ share price hit is much to do about nothing.</Msg><Username>t.bfine</Username><Timestamp>1350393875372</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 09:24:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350393898320-10</Id><Topic><Title>Crazy T Rumors!</Title><Username>vanessablanchard368</Username><Timestamp>1350389466506</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 08:11:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Finally!

The two attacks were conflated in reports. No one was lying to you. It was a confusing situation. The administration launched an investigation which turned up the very things you are discussing now. If you are upset about security being slashed at embassies, you should look at the fact that Republicans have repeatedly slashed the State Department's security budget over the last several years. You want stuff, like embassy security, you pay for it. If you don't want to pay for it, then don't complain when things go bad.

The Saga of Early Voting in Ohio In August, Secretary of State, Jon Husted and the Republicans attempt to eliminate early voting on the last weekend before the election. (They simultaneously attempt to keep that voting option for members of the Armed Forces, while denying it to everyone else.) The Democratic National Committee files suit to block the law. The GOP bogusly attempts to turn that legitimate attempt to keep early voting available to EVERYONE, into an unpatriotic attempt on the part of Democrats to take away the voting rights of servicemen and women. Nothing could be further from the truth and they knew it. The Dems simply wanted to keep early voting available to everyone as it had been. Doug Priesse, chairman of the Republican Party in Franklin County, says, "I guess I really actually feel we shouldn't contort the voting process to accommodate the urban - read African-American - voter-turnout machine.” Ohio DNC Chairman Chris Redfern calls those remarks “patently racist” and an admission that the Ohio Republican Party sought to use limited early-voting hours “to disenfranchise African-American voters.” Matt Borges, Ex. Dir. of the Ohio Republican Party counters with, (Priesse) “…thought his comments…were off the record.” (as though that matters? There seems to be a pattern amongst the Republicans about what you can say with impunity behind closed doors and trying to disavow it when caught – i.e. Mitt’s 47% comments.) Priesse’s rebuttal to the Columbus Dispatch calls claims of unfairness by Redfern, #$%$ Quote Me!” A Federal Appeals Court re-instates early voting across the board. Husted appeals to The Supreme Court. A short time ago, the US Supreme Court turned down Secretary of State Jon Husted's last minute appeal to eliminate the final three days of early voting prior to Election Day. John Kasich, Jon Husted, and the Republican legislature started this fight to limit poll access nearly a year and a half ago. Today, The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed that there is nothing more Un-American than trying to limit participation in the election process. This underscores the importance of Ohio in this election, and the desperation of those trying to limit your access to the voting booth by resurrecting Jim Crow laws.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1350414173572</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 15:02:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350414272874-44</Id><Topic><Title>Tea Party sez</Title><Username>hawrcreek10</Username><Timestamp>1350409820294</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 13:50:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Are you OK, you are babbling and not making any sense please explain what you are talking about, you seem incoherent if you need help please dail 911.</Msg><Username>lkglhklkh</Username><Timestamp>1350414272874</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 15:04:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350415295438-45</Id><Topic><Title>Recent Info in T</Title><Username>xiomarapfcg221749</Username><Timestamp>1350396945285</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 10:15:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I hope it contains great info.

When demand increases manufactures increase production to meet that demand (Econ 101). In most cases this results in additional employees being hired. These newly hired employees generally use the income that they receive to buy things that they need or want thereby increasing demand for those items. This cycle repeats itself again and again thereby creating more demand and more jobs until the cycle is finally broken. This cycle was broken in 2009 when the banking crisis developed, the stock market crashed, the housing market collapsed, and hundreds of thousands of individuals lost their jobs. So the question becomes what can our country do to increase demand. Here are a few suggestions for your consideration. 1.Reduce taxes on that segment of our population that will spend the increased income that is available to them. 2. Provide additional monetary stimulus to our economy by investing in our countries infrastructure. education, research and development and in new industries that will have a long term benefit to our society. 3. Provide tax incentives to companies bringing jobs back to the United States. If you have other suggestion lets hear them.</Msg><Username>dwb360</Username><Timestamp>1350422187552</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 17:16:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350422877286-54</Id><Topic><Title>Can we all agree that it is DEMAND that creates jobs?</Title><Username>dwb360</Username><Timestamp>1350422187552</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 17:16:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Let the Bush tax cuts on those making AGI over 250K expire as they were supposed to.
