Morgan when asked about the market years ago said; "It will fluctuate." That goes for "T" as well. Some of the movement is rigged by those that make money from those fluctations. Unless you are very sharp you will not beat them. Use a DRIP plan and take advantage of DCA. Use it for at least 5 years. "T" was at $300 in 1929. It hit $70 in 1937. But, it still paid the same $9 dividend. First, I would not have paid $300 for it nor panicked and sold after "Black Friday". Had you hung on and reinvested those dividends you would have been in a great position by the time of WW2.</Msg><Username>lewcor</Username><Timestamp>1369498831203</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-25 12:20:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369499259224-12</Id><Topic><Title>No To Worry (gun hating LIBS)</Title><Username>echo.2l65</Username><Timestamp>1369264163101</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 19:09:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If conservatives don't like guns, they just don't buy one.
