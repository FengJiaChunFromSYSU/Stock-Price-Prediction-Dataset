Senate White house tours defeated 54-45 A measure that would have funded public tours at the White House and visitor services at national, parks both suspended because of the sequester. Democrats 2014 budget passed 50-49 A budget that would levy $975B in new taxes over 10 years. It would lead to an annual deficit of $566B after 10 years. Republicans 2014 budget defeated 53-46 A GOP bid to replace the Democratic budget with a measure similar to the one approved by the House. It would reach balance in four years while repealing much the Affordable Care Act, slashing domestic spending raising military spending and privatizing Medicare after 10 years. Tax rates, jobless rates defeated 54-45 A GOP amendment to prohibit any tax increase from taking effect until the unemployment rate falls below 5.5%. House Republicans 2014 budget approved 221-207 A GOP budget that would be balanced by fiscal 2023 through changes to Medicare and Medicaid and numerous cuts. It would also open the door to Social Security changes. Democrats 2014 budget defeated 253-165 A plan that would not have changed Medicare and Medicaid and would take decades to become balanced. It would have also included tax hikes and more stimulus spending. And Ricky says the Republicans don’t want to do anything about entitlement spending and the Democrats want to work to reduce spending. Not much effort shown here.</Msg><Username>usganut</Username><Timestamp>1364221189595</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 10:19:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364221366155-6</Id><Title>Food For Thought</Title><Msg>By Junius P.

It would lead to an annual deficit of $566B after 10 years." The Democratic budget closed tax loopholes that would raise about $1 trillion AND cut spending by about $1 trillion AND leaves about $566 billion deficit in ten years--which is about the same as Rand Paul's Tea Party budget proposed. The Democratic budget cuts tax loopholes--tax expenitures that mostly favor the wealthy. Rand Paul's budget cuts infrastructure and safety net spending but preserves old age entitlements and tax loopholes. Paul Ryan's budget cuts infrastructure and safety net spending and cuts old age entitlements (in the future) but preserves tax loopholes for the wealthy. The Democratic budget is by far the best deal for the American people and the future of this country. It includes the spending cuts and closed tax loopholes most Americans want. If you're old and miserly and unconcerned about your country or your grandchildren you favor Rand Paul's budget. Poor Paul Ryan. I think he actually believes the Republican talking points. But it does achieve zero deficit entirely by spending cuts, leaving all of the tax loopholes in place.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1364224209552</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 11:10:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364224403103-13</Id><Title>USGANUT and Wilkes thanks</Title><Msg>Clearly the Dems and Repubs are not getting anything done and the fool that is to lead has no idea which may significantly have negative economic impacts next year. The fool campaigned on a $4 trillion dollar offered reduction in spending over the next decade, yet he and the dems proposed a $1 trillion dollar increase (rounded from 980 million). The repubs at least kept to their mantra though personally I do not agree with their position. Keep in mind that spinning ricky referred to the $4 trillion reduction often when the idiot reposts what ever his lobbyists website posts. Obama care per the CBO will result in a 10% to 15% increase on average to medical care in 2014. Firms actuaries see the increase around 20% to 25% on average with some major increases to individuals and small firms. Overall, the failure of the fool and his followers and the repubs may significantly remove monies from the economy which would be spent as consumer stimulus which in turn may negatively impact "t's" performance. Any bets on how spinning ricky will spin the facts? Net this is not good for investors or as importantly those looking for medical coverage. If you are young, you will pay significantly due to Obama doesn't care!!!!!!</Msg><Username>dan2003hr</Username><Timestamp>1364224403103</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 11:13:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364225284914-14</Id><Topic><Title>USGANUT and Wilkes thanks</Title><Username>dan2003hr</Username><Timestamp>1364224403103</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 11:13:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Dan, the Senate budget included about $1 trillion in spending cuts over the next ten years.

Republicans and Democrats both claim to want to do something about entitlement spending--sometime in the future. The budgets, including Rand Paul's budget, reflect that. ALL of the budgets cut infrastructure and decrease the old age benefits younger people can expect to protect high payments for current and near-term retirees (boomers). The only advantage the Democratic budget has is that it also asks boomers to contribute a little bit over the next ten years to pay for their benefits. Rand Paul's idea to convert Medicare &amp; Soc. Security to safety net programs are worth looking at but it does change the fundamental nature and purpose of those programs. I do prefer Obama's plan to implement chained CPI immediately-- even though that will affect me a heck of alot more than it will affect you. But believe me, I would do alot more to claw back some of the money boomers have stolen from their children and grandchildren. Increased capital gains/dividend/interest tax. Estate tax. Consumption taxes. Maybe even reduced benefits. But all designed to take money from your bloated retirement and pension funds. Your kids and grandkids should not pay your debt, your overspending, your undercontributing.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1364226256140</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 11:44:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364226842354-17</Id><Topic><Title>USGANUT and Wilkes thanks</Title><Username>dan2003hr</Username><Timestamp>1364224403103</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 11:13:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Don't you listen to him Dan; he's a devil not a man".
