Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., exhorted Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke to stimulate the economy before November through some form of quantitative easing or other monetary policy, which Bernanke said could create jobs. “Despite two false starts, we’re having a much rougher time than we ever imagined getting unemployment down,” Schumer told the Senate Banking Committee. “So get to work, Mr. Chairman.”" "So get to work" means print more money regardless of not having it.</Msg><Username>t.bfine</Username><Timestamp>1343563021000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-29 07:57:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343563302000-3</Id><Title>AHQ (final)...</Title><Msg>... “In true budo there is no enemy or opponent. True budo is to become one with the universe, not train to become powerful or to throw down some opponent. Rather we train in hopes of being of some use, however small our role may be, in the task of bringing peace to mankind around the world.” – Morihei Uesheba “This is really a lovely horse, and I speak from experience, since I once mounted her mother.” – Ted Walsh, equestrian commentator “To dope the racer is as criminal, as sacrilegious, as trying to imitate God; it is stealing from God the privilege of the spark.” - Roland Barthes “Performing enhancing drugs are banned in the Olympics. Okay, we can swing with that. But performance debilitating drugs should not be banned. Smoke a joint and win the hundred meters, fair play to you. That's pretty d#mn good.

I will drink a lot of champagne." - Christian Olsson of Sweden after winning the men's triple jump. "At the Beijing Olympics in 2008, they handed out 100,000 condoms. This year it's 150,000.

If slo-mo doesn't work and you are that adamant about it, go the complaint route or change providers. There's plenty of competition for program services. If the complaint doesn't satisfy you, drop UV and get directv with DVR like I have and you can do slo-mo all you want. I use it from time to time, but it ain't that big a deal. I understand the user guide sez it is there and you expect it, but if it won't work, take your business elsewhere. Nobody's going to fix it for you here. They already told you it isn't available, so deal with it. Maybe the proof reader was supposed to edit it out and didn't. Whatever the reason, you have alternatives. Other than no slo-mo, are you satisfied with UV?</Msg><Username>dm74575</Username><Timestamp>1343576890000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-29 11:48:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343578357000-7</Id><Title>T just went to strong buy on the money flow indicator.</Title><Msg>Try to buy in at 36.25.
