Had other things on the table. I was going to give you the long version as to why teachers unions are not in the best interests of the tax payers, but I won't because it's too lengthy. Here's what I will say though. Teachers are trained to teach. Parents are supposed to then take what their children have been TAUGHT in elementary schools and help them LEARN life's lessons. Once in high school, the children then begin the LEARNING process based on what they are being taught pretty much on their own. Assuming they go to college, then they have to cope with liberal professors foisting their values on young adult minds through teaching. My conclusion. Yes, teaching is important, but no one puts guns too the heads of a potential teacher. They know going in it is not a high paying job for grades K-12. People become teachers for the love of the job below the college/university level. So if the love of the job is the reason, why should taxpayers pay their lifetime retirement benefits? Let them SAVE as I did and prepare for life after teaching without being dependent on Taxpayers. That's a stiff price for taxpayers to pay for teaching a kid(s) for 10 months. Then, there is the matter of the funds that teachers unions collect going straight to a singular political party...after skimming the usual take.

Any minority, from anywhere, if it wants to live in Russia, to work and eat in Russia, should speak Russian, and should respect the Russian laws. If they prefer Sharia Law, then we advise them to go to those places where that's the state law. Russia does not need minorities. Minorities need Russia, and we will not grant them special privileges, or try to change our laws to fit their desires, no matter how loud they yell 'discrimination'. We better learn from the suicides of America,England, Holland and France, if we are to survive as a nation. The Russian customs and traditions are not compatible with the lack of culture or the primitive ways of most minorities. When this honorable legislative body thinks of creating new laws, it should have in mind the national interest first, observing that the minorities are not Russians. The politicians in the Duma gave Putin a standing ovation for five minutes.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1367345100856</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 14:05:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367345420753-46</Id><Title>To quote John D.

That should make you proud. My "tirate" (sic) was simple. I wrote it for a simple minded Troll like you. I'll spell it out again for you. My entitlements were bought and paid for by me numb nut. I socked away contributions to a 401K every week and added supplemental non-matched funds. That's hardly an entitlement. I also put in the maximum allowable annual IRA contribution into my self-managed private IRA. That's not an entitlement either jerk-off. Do you want to make a case for Social Security that I paid into as being an entitlement? You probably would. To me, it's another form of investment. You put in and when the time comes, you take out. Not an entitlement as you see it. I am damn proud to have saved and invested to acquire a respectable estate that my children and grand-children will ultimately receive. So Mr. Troller, if you think I have leached ANYTHING, you're full of it. And if there are young people "busting their butts trying to make it", perhaps they didn't have parents helping and providing the guidance as I did every step of the way for our children. All have attained successful careers and most are unionized on police, county and nursing unions. No one but my wife and myself contributed to their development. No one. One thing for sure. If you have kids, I feel sorry for them in a way. I doubt you do anything to help them on the road to becoming productive citizens except troll your time away on a public message board.

Oliver Wyman consultants estimate that single adults aged 21-29 will endure a rate hike of 46 percent, even after premium assistance from tax credits. In addition, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that Obamacare will cause 3 million people to lose their insurance completely in 2014. And it expects that 6 million will have to pay the individual-mandate tax penalty in 2016, because they don't want or can’t afford coverage. In total, it appears that there will be 30 million to 40 million people damaged in some fashion by the Affordable Care Act</Msg><Username>ricky1820l</Username><Timestamp>1367360269152</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 18:17:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>18</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367360957053-63</Id><Topic><Title>Hey Mr. EE Hubcap...man of Peace...answer up.</Title><Username>davemartin74575</Username><Timestamp>1366991835062</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 11:57:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Not only do you have a mental disorder Mr. Peace, you have a reading and comprehension one as well. If making a success of oneself without assistance isn't a conservative value, I don't know what is. It's nice to know your kids excel without your involvement. Says a lot about you. They probably know that going to Clark Griswold Hubcap for guidance is a lost cause. I'd love to be your boss for a day and watch you screw up the projects I assign you. I doubt you even know Ohm's Law. The rest of your juvenile BS is just that. Geared to your Peace Out crowd. Peace huh? Seems to me killing defenseless aniimals goes against Peace just a bit, wouldn't you say? Gunning down unarmed animals. Great past time. Or is your hunting weapon of choice a cross-bow to kill the Peaceful animals you probably don't eat? Nice way to end Peaceful animals lives in agony with a freakin spear in their Peaceful bodies. Did I use Peace enough for you? How did you ever get anyone to marry you? If anyone should be required to have a license to reproduce. It's you. One thing for sure. That run-on mess of a paragraph would make your English teachers proud. I hope the accelerated classes your kids take teaches them better written compositional skills.</Msg><Username>davemartin74575</Username><Timestamp>1367360957053</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 18:29:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367361462414-64</Id><Topic><Title>So far, three downgrades and counting</Title><Username>convergent_series</Username><Timestamp>1367223667252</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 04:21:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yahoo's list is incomplete.

We harvest deer, hogs, turkey, quail, and dove. Trap #$%$, kill coyotes and armadillos as those are endorsed as negative predators by the wild turkey foundation, and make beer tracks at my camp. Btw my wife called them beer tracks as me and my friends were smashing beer cans around the fire. Had been showing her and the kids the different kinds of tracks on my 121 acres which I OWN and she made a funny that those circular indentations looked like "beer tracks" we all got a good laugh. I planted 80,000 pine trees 9 years ago and in 8 years we will make a pant load on pulp after the thinning and then the pole trees will be ready in 8 to 10 more. I invite disadvantaged childern with their parents to expose them to the woods and that life. Very satisfying to see one catch their 1st fish out of my lake or stand at the skinning rack with their game. Your tree hugging bs hit a nerve... You have no nerve you have a synapse problem me thinks... We hunt bow, black powder and general gun. We follow all the rules and enjoy every minute when not working and avoiding cry babies. I hated english and art. Math and science was my deal. Good luck with your outstanding success. Expect to see you in the journal soon. Peace The Capper. Yawn glad cramer is off.

I prefer Fox Biz. I'm impressed with your acreage Capper. Sounds like a National Park. Too bad It's a killing field for wild life. I'm far from a tree hugger pal, but I will say this. Hunters and Gatherers have long since left society. Your wonton animal killing brings to mind an image. An idiot like you with the heads of your trophies proudly displayed in your den to re-enact and re-live the kill. You probably get tingles up your cowardly legs like your hero Chris Matthews experienced about 5 years ago when you look at your kills. Yeah Capper, I understand you a lot better now. Too bad you weren't around during the colonization of America. I bet you would have been in ecstasy by blasting anything that moved in the woods. If your hunting skills are anything like your terrible writing attempts, you probably would have drilled your wife by mistake with your Flintlock. I can see you hated English in school. Your hackneyed krap speaks for itself.
