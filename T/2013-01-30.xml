Then it was the 'fiscal cliff' that was the issue de jure and when it didn't charge forward as promised, it became the issue of the debt ceiling and now it is Sandy's fault. Truth be known, it is deteriorating because of past actions of the same group in this circular firing squad that claims they have the knowledge and fiscal understanding to reconcile the problems. Even the government accounting professionals tell them that anything and everything they can plan will not solve our debt and/or spending problems.

So using your logic, because the gun laws of Illinois, Iowa, Wisconsin, Missori, and Indiana are not as restrictive as the gun laws of Chicago, then that is the reason that the death by gun rate in Chicago is so high. Further if these other jurisdictions would make their gun laws as restrictive as the Chicago gun laws, then the death by gun rate in Chigago would go down. Honestly, is that your logic? Not trying to pass judgement. Just trying to understand your logic. "In your heart you know he is right."

Some fool posted T to $50 which may happen in the future, yet fails to provide support or recognize what is required to achieve such a goal. This will be a very good investing year. As Obama has designed with his anti-business positions, firms have laid off workers, reducing expenses and reducing revenues with a net result of stalled growth with increased profitability. The so called "rich" are moving, and unions are just starting to recognize impacts from ObamaCare in the very short term foreseeable future. Soon union constituents will understand the definition of "cadillac benefits" and the impacts on the common workers. Oh, and don't forget, trickle down expenditure economics - Obama will not increase taxes, that would be unpopular, so revenues will come from the middle class from pass ons and from fees. Psst, don't dare call those fees taxes now. Folks are starting to see just what holes there are in Obama supporters arguments. Plan properly with your investments and you will profit. Obama policies are hampering world and domestic economic growth. That is ok though. Wealth transfer is well underway and those that were dependedent are remaing dependent and bringing a host of formerly middle class people with them to become dependent. In the East, some are becoming dependent as a result of Sandy . The Debt Celing, in my opinion, does not have to come down now. Just recognize that these silly Obama citations of taxing the rich will have virtually no impact on the debt ceiling and Obama's ability to write checks.

Oh yeah, the numbers were good last quarter. That means last quarter's estimate was a lie, right? But this one is bad, so it's God's honest truth, eh? You are as predictable as you are worthless. "we all await the economic wisdom that will soon be shared by Ricky and Sir Echo" My economic wisdom is provided by the BEA: "The decrease in real GDP in the fourth quarter primarily reflected negative contributions from private inventory investment, federal government spending, and exports that were partly offset by positive contributions from personal consumption expenditures (PCE), nonresidential fixed investment, and residential fixed investment. Imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, decreased." In particular, durable goods orders were strong. What does that mean? The decrease in private inventory investment will likely turn around as consumer spending picks up and people build more houses. Stores are going to have to replace all of those washers and dryers they sold in Q3. You'll note the markets were stable today. But beyond that, this is one slight downtick in an advance estimate of one indicator in what has been a good year. If you want to find something negative somewhere in the world, you can find it. And that is what you do. Scour the wires for the one piece of negative news, and call the positive news lies.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1359579327376</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 15:55:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359579844411-25</Id><Topic><Title>Another sad story from Chicago</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1359563646065</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 11:34:06 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Not at all Froggie.

Do restrictive gun laws cause violence in Chicago? No. Violence in Chicago has caused Chicago to adapt restrictive gun laws. Likewise, cities with low crime rates are unlikely to bother adopting restrictive gun laws. You could make the same argument with, say, hiring police officers. Cities with high crime rates are likely to hire more police officers, but that does not mean more police officers cause crime and fewer police officers reduces crime. Restrictive gun laws are a strategy to reduce already high crime. You probably don't need them in a rural Nebraska county, just like you don't need 100 cops in a rural Nebraska county. But as long as people from high crime areas can go to low crime areas to buy guns, the strategy of restrictive gun laws in high crime areas will likely be ineffective in keeping guns out of the community.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1359582054456</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 16:40:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359582309965-28</Id><Topic><Title>Another sad story from Chicago</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1359563646065</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 11:34:06 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama's a gun-running socialist?

If they are going to work, we need national restrictions." OK, OK, I think I am almost there. So by your logic if we get "national restrictions" that are as restrictive as the city of Chicago, then the death by gun rate in Chicago would go down. Is that it? As far as your statement: "Let me try your logic: Send more AR-15s to Chicago and the death by gun rate will go down. Is that what you think?" No, that is not my logic, but it is the logic of the current Attorney General in the "fast and furious" scheme used by the justice department that resulted in the death of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry. Further, I think you would be hard pressed to find within last year's 500 death by gun cases in the city of Chicago where they found an AR-15 was used. Just trying to understand. "In your heart you know he is right."

I saw New York City Police Commissioner Ray Kelly confirm that just a few nights ago on MSNBC. From, “The Last Word” “…Kelly said that at least two aspects of President Obama’s new 23-point gun control plan might stem the tide of gun violence in New York City: requiring universal background checks and tougher gun trafficking laws. He said that universal background checks could have some effect on the prevalence of concealed handguns, which he called ‘the biggest problem facing urban policing.’ Obama also proposed a federal gun trafficking measure Wednesday, which Kelly called ‘a move in the right direction,’ saying that 90% of the guns confiscated by police in New York come from out of state. ‘We need a federal plan. Otherwise, we’re still going to be plagued with guns coming from all over. They come up what we call the iron pipeline, 95, Highway 95, coming up from the southern states. These are guns that are landing on our doorstep and they’re killing New Yorkers,’ Kelly said.” Keep in mind, Ray Kelly is hardly a liberal. And he specifically mentioned Virginia. And jon’s here braggin’ about working gun shows? And then we have froggie with his bogus somber tone about the recent killing in Chicago, sarcastically suggesting, “Maybe the senate will be able to shed some light on this question.” Apparently the gremlin suggests that because a girl was shot in Chicago while gun control legislation is being debated, then it’s useless…we should do nothing? Or was he suggesting, as many would agree with, let’s go after handguns, as well, and really address violence in this country. But mention that, and all these Tea Party cowboys would go apoplectic and have a self-inflicted accidental discharge ala Plaxico Burress.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1359583549992</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 17:05:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359585024045-33</Id><Topic><Title>Another sad story from Chicago</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1359563646065</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 11:34:06 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The bad guys in Chicago do not have any problem obtaining guns.

"Chicago's McCarthy said the city's high murder rate, up 18 percent over last year as of Dec. 16, was due to gang violence. Eighty percent of the homicides were gang-related and 80 percent of the victims were African-Americans, he said." 80% of Chicago's record killing level were gang-related!!!

The only thing that was missing was a good quarterback. He had scouted all the colleges and even the Canadian and European Leagues, but he couldn't find a ringer who could ensure a Super Bowl win. Then one night while watching CNN he saw a war-zone scene in Afghanistan . In one corner of the background, he spotted a young Afghan Muslim soldier with a truly incredible arm. He threw a hand-grenade straight into a 15th story window 100 yards away. KABOOM! He threw another hand-grenade 75 yards away, right into a chimney. KA-BLOOEY! Then he threw another at a passing car going 90 mph. BULLS-EYE! "I've got to get this guy!" Coach said to himself. "He has the perfect arm!" So, he brings him to the States and teaches him the great game of football. And the Bears go on to win the Super Bowl. The young Afghan is hailed as the great hero of football, and when the coach asks him what he wants, all the young man wants is to call his mother. "Mom," he says into the phone, "I just won the Super Bowl!" "I don't want to talk to you, the old Muslim woman says."You are not my son!" "I don't think you understand, Mother," the young man pleads. "I've won the greatest sporting event in the world. I'm here among thousands of my adoring fans." "No! Let me tell you!" his mother retorts. "At this very moment, there are gunshots all around us. The neighborhood is a pile of rubble. Your two brothers were beaten within an inch of their lives last week, and I have to keep your sister in the house so she doesn't get raped!" The old lady pauses, and then tearfully says, "I will never forgive you for making us move to Chicago !!!!</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1359597536186</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 20:58:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359597615312-39</Id><Topic><Title>Union Vote</Title><Username>dynnyd</Username><Timestamp>1359593067464</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 19:44:27 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It had absolutely no effect on it.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1359597615312</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 21:00:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359598501924-40</Id><Topic><Title>what a news!</Title><Username>ronbadger80</Username><Timestamp>1359033714046</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 08:21:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks, a real POS!</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1359598501924</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 21:15:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359608309465-41</Id><Topic><Title>How sad what Florida has become</Title><Username>lavendarsen</Username><Timestamp>1359423608733</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 20:40:08 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Like I said there are still some nice places in Florida, most are predominantly White areas though. And there will always be some nice places, just as there are in third world countries. The roads in Florida are excellent which might givie it the appearance of a more prosperous state than it is to visitors heading to a specifice tourist destination, or those who don`t travel much outside their 'nice' pleasant areas. It appears to me to be a state in decline though. The White folks who at one time dominated this state sold White Floridians out imo. I think the future for ordinary working and middle class Whites in Florida is very bleak. It will not be a pleasant place for most of them, imo.</Msg><Username>lavendarsen</Username><Timestamp>1359608309465</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 23:58:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
