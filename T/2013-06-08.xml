" Sebelius", contrary to your distortion, is trying to help this particular child get priority for a lung. Beyond ridiculous Although the words death panel are not used specifically in Obamacare it does exist and as pointed out previously in this string Sibelius is in charge of it and in this case acted as head executioner by not signing the waiver to save this little girl. She gets to choose life or death by deciding who gets care and who doesn't and decided death for this girl. It took a judge to overide her decision. If anyone is distoring the facts it is you. If anyone doesn't believe there is a death panel just read the info available from the various news outlets about this case, it demonstrates what is in store for you under Obamacare. If Sibelius can make a chioce not to save a little girls life just think of what is in store for you. A federal judge on Wednesday ordered HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to allow 10-year-old Sarah Murnaghan to be moved to the adult lung transplant list, giving her a better chance of receiving a potentially life-saving transplant. My prayers are with you Sarah Murnaghan</Msg><Username>ricky1820l</Username><Timestamp>1370735883823</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-08 19:58:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>11</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370736406822-12</Id><Topic><Title>If you</Title><Username>eluminatlng69</Username><Timestamp>1370568007864</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 21:20:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That's a lie.</Msg><Username>eluminatlng69</Username><Timestamp>1370736406822</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-08 20:06:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370737241401-13</Id><Title>Good Luck Colorado !!</Title><Msg>Northern Colorado is looking to break off from the rest of their "Liberal State Gov't" and re-form as the 51st State in the Union - " North Colorado" sounds fine by me ..(freedom from Liberalism &amp; gun control- and the right to pump oil from private land) A side note = Only 6 more of these situations and Obama will finally be Prez. of 57 States he claimed (2008) .</Msg><Username>echo.2l65</Username><Timestamp>1370737241401</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-08 20:20:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>13</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370745659861-14</Id><Topic><Title>Good Luck Colorado !!</Title><Username>echo.2l65</Username><Timestamp>1370737241401</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-08 20:20:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Asinine fatuity.
