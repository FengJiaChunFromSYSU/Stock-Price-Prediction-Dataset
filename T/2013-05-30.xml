A federal jury reached the verdict in the case against real estate developer and once powerful lobbyist Harvey Whittemore. The jury returned unanimous guilty verdicts on all charges in this case where Harry Reid knowingly accepted excessive campaign contributions. Whittemore made contributions to Reid in the name of others causing a false statement to be made to the Federal Election Commission. Prosecutors said Whittemore said he gave large sums of money to family members and employees to make contributions to Reid to skirt campaign finance laws. Whittemore gave large checks to family members and as gifts or bonuses to 29 employees and their spouses, who then each wrote checks to the Senate majority leader's campaign fund, Friends of Harry Reid. Reid said he did not have any problems with the money he received. Reid told the Las Vegas Sun "I received $25 million I had money coming in from many places." Whittemore acknowledged contributions to Reid. One of the prosecution's key pieces of evidence is a document pulled from Whittemore's files detailing the contributions he bundled and had shipped off to Reid in March 2007. Whittemore used his power and well-connected friends to carry out his schemes where money talks and who your friends are matters.</Msg><Username>ricky1820l</Username><Timestamp>1369890212185</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 01:03:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369890687721-6</Id><Topic><Title>IF I Had A Son !!</Title><Username>echo.2l65</Username><Timestamp>1369403088396</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-24 09:44:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A father compassionate to the parents of a slain thug, thinking it could have been his son trying to kill someone and being slain as a result.</Msg><Username>geoff_holt_2001</Username><Timestamp>1369890687721</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 01:11:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369895007626-7</Id><Topic><Title>dont give up theres hope!</Title><Username>princeghara</Username><Timestamp>1369866771349</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 18:32:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>there legit i looked them up</Msg><Username>million.trader</Username><Timestamp>1369895007626</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 02:23:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369904449233-8</Id><Topic><Title>Oh, no...Michele Bachman quitting...</Title><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1369836525228</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 10:08:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Who do you think killed Paul Wellstone and Why?

The U.S. economy expanded at a 2.4 percent annual rate during the period, down a tenth of a point from an initial estimate, according to revised figures from the Commerce Department released on Thursday. Analysts had forecast a 2.5 percent gain. A drop in government spending dragged more on the U.S. economy than initially thought in the first three months of the year, a sign of increasing pain from Washington's austerity drive. The U.S. economy expanded at a 2.4 percent annual rate during the period, down a tenth of a point from an initial estimate, according to revised figures from the Commerce Department released on Thursday. Analysts had forecast a 2.5 percent gain. In other economic news, the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly rose last week, but not enough to suggest a shift in the recent pattern of modest job gains. Growth was held back as government spending fell across all levels of government and as businesses outside the farm sector stocked their shelves at a slower pace. Washington has been tightening its belt for several years but ramped up austerity measures in 2013, hiking taxes in January and slashing the federal budget in March. Still, economic growth has been surprisingly resilient, supported by the Federal Reserve's low interest rate policies. Most economists expect growth will slow mid-year as budget cuts come into effect. Government spending fell even more sharply in the fourth quarter, and economists speculate that government agencies pulled back in anticipation of budget cuts initially due to begin in January but which took effect in March. In the first quarter, government spending dropped at a 4.9 percent annual rate, faster than the 4.1 percent rate initially estimated. Spending fell at federal, state and local government offices, though the majority of the downward revision in Thursday' report came at the county and city level. The drag from government and inventories was partially offset by an upward revision to consumer spending, which rose at a 3.4 percent annual rate, up two tenths of a point from the government's previous estimate. However, a cloud hung over that category, as most of the upward revision was due to higher sales of gasoline. Higher prices at the pump are a burden on consumers, leaving them less money to spend on other things. Consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. After-tax corporate profits fell at a 1.9 percent annual rate in the quarter, the first decline in a year. Total imports grew at a slower pace in the first quarter than initially estimated, moderating the drag on growth from net trade. Excluding the volatile inventories component, GDP rose at an upwardly revised 1.8 percent rate, slightly higher than analysts had forecast. Jobless Claims Rise Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 354,000, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Claims for the prior week were revised to show 4,000 more applications received than previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had expected first-time applications to hold steady at 340,000 last week. A Labor Department analyst said claims for five states, including Virginia, Minnesota and Oregon, were estimated since state offices had less time to prepare data because of the national holiday on Monday. This could have the distorted the readings, making last week's claims a less useful gauge of labor market trends. The four-week moving average for new claims, which irons out week-to-week volatility, edged up 6,750 to 347,250. Despite the rise last week, claims remained in the middle of their range for this year and below levels economists normally associate with modest job gains. There is still no sign of layoffs related to belt-tightening in Washington, particularly the $85 billion in across-the-board government spending cuts which has slowed factory production. Steady improvement in labor market conditions and rising house prices are helping to sustain consumer spending, limiting the impact of the drag from fiscal policy on the economy. The economy's unexpected show of resilience has fueled speculation the Federal Reserve could start scaling back its monetary stimulus by the end of the year, pushing up government bond yields. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said last week a decision to start tapering the $85 billion in bonds the U.S. central bank is buying each month could come at one of its "next few meetings" if the economy appeared set to maintain momentum. The claims report showed the number of people still receiving benefits under regular state programs after an initial week of aid rose 63,000 to 2.99 million in the week ended May 18. The so-called continuing claims covered the week of the government's household employment survey from which the unemployment rate is calculated. Continuing claims have dropped 21,000 between the April and May household survey week, which could see the jobless rate holding at an almost 4-1/2 year low of 7.5 percent.</Msg><Username>helping_you_out_99</Username><Timestamp>1369918911318</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 09:01:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369920698137-14</Id><Topic><Title>Angry protests in England and riots in Sweden</Title><Username>lavendarsen</Username><Timestamp>1369733717231</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 05:35:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>...“No, my documents were legal. A local worker decided to hold my legal documents in his desk drawer until he was paid a bribe to dig them out. They had been issued in Mexico City, sent to the local staff to pass on to me. He refused and said he couldn't find them until he was paid and they suddenly appeared.” – winholder, yesterday So you’re saying they were, indeed, issued, but the “local staff” confiscated them until you bribed them? Well, in February, you said, “my work permit was not issued” (on time). On time is irrelevant if it hasn’t yet been issued to you until you paid four times the going rate to get it. The fact is, you couldn’t get your work permit unless you illegally bribed an official. Spin that anyway you want, but the facts speak for themselves. “On several occasions my work permit was not ‘issued’ on time but after a small envelope of American dollars was ‘left’ on a border official’s desk, it suddenly appeared to have been found where it had been misplaced. The work permit was about $50 for a four-month period and each finder’s fee was about $150. – winholder, Feb. 15, 2013 Not to mention your admission of flagrant violations of smuggling illegal contraband, no doubt contributing to industrial pollution in Mexico: “We had several chemicals we had used in the plant for years suddenly appear on the ‘contraband’ list. We had to pay an additional $50 per barrel to get then into the country.” – winholder yesterday What do you mean “suddenly appear” on the contraband list? That’s a typical explanation from you. Do you know how rapidly chemicals were being added to various OSHA and EPA Hazardous Chemical lists over the past several decades, as chronic effects of exposure studies revealed their harm to workers? Mexico was no different, and much worse with folks like you admitting that, while they were now banned, you continued to make illegal payments to smuggle them into the country. Would you like to tell us the name of the company who obtained an illegal work permit for you so that you could illegally continue to smuggle toxic chemicals into your manufacturing plant, which in all likelihood then polluted the rivers of Mexico? My guess would be probably not. “I did nothing illegal, that fault lies with the actions of the local 'officials'…you need to shut up and stop embarrassing yourself.” – winholder That’s sage advice that you should heed, winbag…and I might add, if what you say is true (although your posting history would suggest otherwise) you need to stop incriminating yourself, as well.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1369920698137</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 09:31:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369921299305-15</Id><Topic><Title>Way to go FOX News</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1369912936115</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 07:22:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes, we know.

By then the boomers had all graduated and the government was turning its eyes to maximizing their disposable income through low taxes and deficit spending on defense and welfare. America's great infrastructure, including its public schools, was just beginning to crumble under boomer neglect. Couple that with the great white flight to the suburbs, which is the single most enduring legacy of the boomers and, as we are all well aware, schools in cities declined rapidly. I would imagine your kids had the advantage of private schools, funded by a job which your education at public schools qualified you for. Am I wrong?

Well I'll be darn, it's right in the heart of St. Louis proper, a few blocks south of I-44, 3 miles from downtown. You'll find it to be an area where, to this day, people are trying to restore Victorian homes while the rest of the city decays around them thanks to pitiful political leadership. Guess which party has ruled the city for decades. If you think St. Louis proper is so great, check out the population decline over the last 40 yrs. from 622K to 319K. It is a pitiful/painful example of a city in decline with little to no future because it is run by clueless politicians. Sad indeed, because it is my hometown. By the way, knock off the lawsuit BS.

First, schools are generally funded by local property taxes. When a large proportion of the population leaves an area demand for housing declines and prices decline, leading to reduced tax revenues for schools. (Property prices weren't helped by the habit of transportation planners in those days either, who seemed to think it was a good idea to put massive highways straight through the center of cities). 2nd, immediately following segregation black people simply didn't have much money or skills. So businesses left, following the customers and skilled workers, which further depressed property values along with employment and income and the opportunity to collect local sales taxes or other sources of revenue for schools. 3rd, most of the most experienced administrators, including teachers, school administrators and elected officials, immediately following segregation were white. They left for the counties leaving few people with skills to take over. That's the short list, and these problems are very self-perpetuating. In every major city in America you see what tbfine describes. Swaths of beautiful, old Victorian homes basically abandoned and falling to ruin. Why? Housing prices plummeted and the only people remaining to buy them, although they could afford to buy them were too poor to maintain them, or they were rented out and neglected. And the people left to govern the city, as tbfine points out, did not have the skills to run a normal city, much less one devastated by having the wealthy, educated portion of the population up and leave. It's taken cities 40+ years to *begin* to recover. It required a new generation of young white people willing to move back into cities and a new generation of black people with the skills and experience to administer a city. It has nothing to do with political party or race. It has everything to do with money and skills and a history of using race to divide those things up.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1369936834984</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 14:00:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369937749927-49</Id><Topic><Title>Way to go FOX News</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1369912936115</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 07:22:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>...“Look up 3066 Hawthorne…” – t.bfine I’ll pass, tb.

Suggesting that you want to live in an area with typical inner-city schools of the 80’s, and then complaining that you HAVE to send your kids to a private school as a result of where you chose to reside, is bogus. (His statement was that he did not send his kids to public school BECAUSE they were a disaster…) Most people have little problem with simply saying “I prefer Parochial schools” or whatever. Blaming the school district that you choose to live in is hypocritical…but then again, the whole discussion was aimed at making a political point about public education. BTW, neither all cities are alike, nor are all suburbs. I live near a rust belt city, but have a mailing address of a beautiful small town, although I’m actually in the next county which has one of the largest Amish populations in the nation…certainly not the strip mall and feeder roads that you suggest exist everywhere outside of cities. Not far away is an observatory for astronomy fans…try stargazing through the streetlights of cities…good luck with that. Water falls, rivers, National Parks, horse country, hiking trails, art galleries, few crowds, little traffic, no pollution…city dwellers miss a lot. I’ve lived many different places, urban and otherwise, and I have nothing against people living in cities. I encourage the redevelopment of urban communities, just as has happened in my nearest Metro area. I do, however, have a problem with those on the far right who continue to belittle public education and suggest doing away with the Dept. of Education and privatizing schools for the benefit of only those who can afford them. That certainly isn’t going to help St. Louis or any other city make a comeback.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1369945000958</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 16:16:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369945856624-64</Id><Topic><Title>AT&amp;T</Title><Username>vger44</Username><Timestamp>1369923308094</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 10:15:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>On second thought, I should have known to just "stay the course".

He lived there, he paid taxes (which paid for schools his kids didn't use), he hired workers, he patronized businesses, he kept a portion of the city from going to blight. Everything else is #$%$. He may not talk the talk but in this instance he walked the walk. Besides, he was probably right. My difference with tb here is in the causes and solutions, not the definition of the problem. And one of those solutions, IMO, is seeing people with good incomes live and work in cities again. I do live in the South. Our suburbs are a little different than the network of small towns of more northern climes, which are very nice.

I have little interest in which side ended up with the wealth and power and thus is able to self-righteously laud their privilege over the the side that drew the short straw. Unless you are working to solve the problem you are all the same to me. The crimes of the one side are not absolved by the crimes (real or imagined) of the other. Which means you are responsible for what you do as an individual no matter what. I am well aware that you are one of the racists that are part of the problem.

I have to agree with wilkes71. You don't want to try to catch a "falling knife" right now. It's best to wait for the technical to improve, then buy. When will that be? That's anybody's guess. When it is time to buy again, you will see the signs. The volume will suddenly increase, and the price will stop falling. The technicals will begin to move in the positive direction again, and at that time, you can buy with confidence. If you are willing to wait a bit longer, you will do just fine in the long-term. Also, keep in mind that the fund managers always need good quality stocks for their growth &amp; income funds, and "T" will continue to be there for many more years.</Msg><Username>bshipleyinsuranceservices</Username><Timestamp>1369961456186</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 20:50:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369961630245-89</Id><Topic><Title>Way to go FOX News</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1369912936115</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 07:22:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Suggesting that you want to live in an area with typical inner-city schools of the 80’s, and then complaining that you HAVE to send your kids to a private school as a result of where you chose to reside, is bogus" Made up yet again. You never cease. I didn't complain about sending the kids to a private school. I admit I was happy to have a choice because sending them to city public schools would have only held them back. If calling public schools of that day a disaster offends you, too bad. I admit to being politically incorrect. As long as we continue to sugar coat everything we won't fix our problems.</Msg><Username>t.bfine</Username><Timestamp>1369961630245</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 20:53:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369961752735-90</Id><Topic><Title>Way to go FOX News</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1369912936115</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 07:22:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Don't worry Froggie, I don't lump you in with all old people.

The perfect place to learn not to accept others. Maybe that's why some on the right are for it. Strangely they accuse public schools of doing that, when they aren't. Home schooling to me is helping your children with their homework the trained experienced teacher gives them, and being a parent who understands the importance of living in society. If you want good multiple choice test takers, dedicated parents probably can push their kids to do that. The comparison to national scores is faulty, many student have no option except public school, and don't get any help at home. A parent home schooling is the kind of parent who is involved. A proper comparison would have to be made between like minded parental groups. Any teacher will tell you it is the parents at home who make the difference. About 3% of kids are home schooled, not much. Home schooling to me is spoiling your kids, letting them avoid the rigors of interaction with peers in a classroom. Not letting them be challenged by differing views on a personal level in a class, not good. I know a few home schooled adults, it shows, they're a bit strange. It's not just about learning facts and techniques shown in the books.</Msg><Username>peppeek</Username><Timestamp>1369966178025</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 22:09:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369967428071-95</Id><Topic><Title>Way to go FOX News</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1369912936115</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 07:22:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>rico WHAT a BUNCH of #$%$ for A response !!! If there is no property tax to support the schools in cities it must mean....WHAT ?...my guess would be that the people living in the city are on the DOLE and are living in rent/mortgage free housing paid by tax payers don't you just wish that people "WOULD JUST START PAYING FOR THEIR OWN STUFF " to quote a dreamer that sucks his thumb and speaks of a perfect world ..Pull your socks up sport and quit trying to drive your sorry snapshot of life on us ...if nothing else be consistent ...you scream of " PAYING FOR YOUR OWN STUFF " unless it would cancel welfare and then you and the likes of you go nuts .
