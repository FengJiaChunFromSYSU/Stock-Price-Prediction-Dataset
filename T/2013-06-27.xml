Honesty was once the best policy. Now it will get you fired and put in jail. In the old system there were few laws but they were followed and enforced. Now there are so many laws that the only way you can do anything is to break a law but it is OK because illegal is accepted as OK.</Msg><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1372341859543</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-27 10:04:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372342074975-7</Id><Topic><Title>ATT service is nonexistent</Title><Username>dickdigby</Username><Timestamp>1372256444178</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 10:20:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Considering the source, that can be viewed as a compliment.

Do you want a wife or a servant, froggie? With an attitude like that, you better start training your dog. I just don't see Ann Coulter or Michelle Malkin icing your beer and baiting your hook for you.
