How many times did Mitt Witt lie about the 716 Billion dollar cut in Medicare? That's right, too many. After Biden knocks out Lyin "Eddie Munster" Ryan, the party's over. Most of this country is waking up to the lies and distortions of these two empty suit's. It's funny how the Bishop now loves 100% of the people. This guy is pathetic.</Msg><Username>lv66vette</Username><Timestamp>1349502219259</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 01:43:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349502885989-2</Id><Topic><Title>Fox News Board Here</Title><Username>pcaphodge</Username><Timestamp>1349478954190</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 19:15:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Stocks are at a all time high, and who is President?

They don't have a problem with that, why should you? Stop trying to put out fires. You don't have enough water and you can't read fast enough. This country is not happy with BO because he is doing an unsatisfactory job. He will be voted out. The majority of this country will decide and there is nothing you can do about that because it is a fact. The man has us 16 TRILLION in debt, this country has to borrow .40 out of every 1.00 just to keep going. He has botched all foreign policies taking out those dictators who are friendly towards the US, and replaced them with the Muslim Brotherhood, and the Middle East is on fire, all directly Obama's doing. He's lied and covered up just about everything he's attempted, including our Libyian ambassador's death. He does not know what he's doing. You are a committed, baptized democrat. You will defend ANY democrat regardless of the candidate. There is nothing that can be said to you. You will never understand the truth because you are simply too committed to the democratic party to make any rational decisions.</Msg><Username>slidebackredoak</Username><Timestamp>1349539025844</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 11:57:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349542172448-11</Id><Topic><Title>i work here, read this pls. all fellow workers</Title><Username>flashywildwest</Username><Timestamp>1349532492068</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 10:08:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Keep voting democrat and you'll be out of work!</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1349542172448</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 12:49:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349542495639-12</Id><Topic><Title>What i discovered about whistle blowing at ATT</Title><Username>cencoastsurfer</Username><Timestamp>1349407895184</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 23:31:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Should have used that 1-800 number thru HR, or contact asset protection.</Msg><Username>bob.beachin</Username><Timestamp>1349542495639</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 12:54:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349547521910-13</Id><Topic><Title>T Is Looking Good!</Title><Username>buchanan_f</Username><Timestamp>1349523846621</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 07:44:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yea right.

Further we are told by the administration and their concubines in the MSM that it is totally impossible for these numbers to be manipulated for political purposes. So there you have it, those that disagree with the administration are nuts, cooks and conspiracy theorist and those that don't are brilliant. A very successful politician once said that if you are going to tell a lie to the masses make it a big one, because a majority will be believe that it would be implausible for you to tell such a whopper. He further stated how important it was to continue telling the lie, because eventually the people will believe it to be true. After saying this, I would like to send my condolences to those honest BLS employees that were forced to stand behind and support this excrement sandwich.
