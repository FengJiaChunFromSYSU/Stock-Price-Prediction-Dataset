AT&amp;T is a proxy for the bond market. A 10 Year Treasury Bond yields 1.58%. AT&amp;T's 4.7% dividend yield beats the 10 Year Bond by 312 basis points. If revenue growth is the engine for future profits, then AT&amp;T's earnings growth appears to be backed by share buybacks versus organic revenue growth. In the 2nd quarter, AT&amp;T bought back $2.5 billion in stock buybacks. These reduced 75.8 million AT&amp;T shares from the total outstanding shares. A company without revenue growth will eventually decline. Margin expansion, earnings per share, and shareholders will be rewarded if revenue growth creates an increase in earnings per share. Reviewing the SEC 10Q filings, the revenues and earnings growth do not support purchasing AT&amp;T shares for a 4.7% dividend yield. Revenue growth is the bread and butter to future earnings per share growth. AT&amp;T legacy business lines and current business model are generating a flat revenue growth trajectory. http://seekingalpha.com/article/760771-avoid-at-t-s-4-7-dividend?source=yahoo</Msg><Username>insider117</Username><Timestamp>1343657737000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 10:15:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343657860000-6</Id><Topic><Title>Big buy back</Title><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1343655486000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 09:38:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>At church of course.

That is the 4.7% dividend is very likely to get back to the 6% when T increases their dividend. The dividend could be raised to sixty cents without hurting cash flow because AT&amp;T earnings are 66 cents and increasing. At $40 a share, a 60 cent dividend would be a 6% return. Right now AT&amp;T is using their cash to buy back shares. When thy change that policy, they can easily increase the dividend because there will be fewer shares.</Msg><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1343659181000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 10:39:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343659427000-9</Id><Topic><Title>Big buy back</Title><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1343655486000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 09:38:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In the case of AT&amp;T that is true.

With a book value of $17.79 per share a buy back at this price range will dilute the book value. Of course only we old fogies care about book value so it should only help the stock price. You kids will never learn." Given the historic slide in rates every going concern in the world is trying to refi and lower future period interest rate expense. Take a firm like IBM that just borrowed 10 year money at 1.875% to set a new modern corporate benchmark. It pays $3.40 per year which is close to 1.8%. The key metric for buyback justification is Operating Cash Flow per share -- for a going concern that's the current yield on buyback market price to consider -- in the case of T it is highly probable that total Operating Cash Flow will grow. And you can't forget the divi yield at around 4.7% in T's case. Besides doing refi's as debt comes due, going concerns with financial strength are going to take advantage of this interest rate environment or fall behind other strong equities. My only concern is buying back the wire line value of T stock. But the strategy seems to be to keep wire line. You have to play the hand the market deals.</Msg><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1343661362000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 11:16:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343661779000-13</Id><Topic><Title>Jeremiah Wright, J.Jackson, A.Sharpton, NAACP</Title><Username>kit3taylor</Username><Timestamp>1343435224000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 20:27:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Did you have your Bible with you when you posted this....I/D/I/O/T/</Msg><Username>hrod57</Username><Timestamp>1343661779000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 11:22:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343664441000-14</Id><Topic><Title>Big buy back</Title><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1343655486000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 09:38:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It will also help them "boost" the dividend while keeping the total payout flat and thus not affecting the payout ratio. If you payout the same total but to a small share count, their payout per share will increase, but they won't have to return more total cash to shareholders. Makes the shares more attractive without any increased charges to the balance sheet/cash flow.</Msg><Username>vwdiesel10</Username><Timestamp>1343664441000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 12:07:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343664722000-15</Id><Title>technical analysis basics</Title><Msg>I've been watching the market closely now that I'm retired and I now understand how difficult it is to predict, even at the broad ETF level, especially at this particular point in time.
