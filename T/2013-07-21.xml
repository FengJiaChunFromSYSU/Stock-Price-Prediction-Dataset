You don’t like the Democrats. You don’t like the Republicans. You don’t like the Justice Department. You don’t like the media. You compare the duly elected President of the United States to the North Korean dictator. You repeat the tired campaign slogan of the biggest loser in Presidential history, Barry Goldwater. And while you hate everybody else, your contribution to society is belittling everyone from the anonymity of multiple aliases on a stock message board. You must be a really fun guy to be around! Your family must be very proud of everything you are doing for mankind. What a great citizen you are…have you ever contemplated moving to Somalia? In our hearts, we know you are a pompous clown.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1374411397342</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-21 08:56:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374412567517-3</Id><Title>July 23, 2013 ... 4:00 PM</Title><Msg>Today, AT&amp;T came out with its earnings report ... it beat the streets estimate by $ .07 pennies ...

Lady Claims Stand Your Ground .. Sentenced To 20 Years - (in Fla.) - Well you can't have an 'arguement' with a boyfriend, at his residence, in front of his children , and discharge a firearm with children in the premises. So Jessie Jackson comes to her aid &amp; defense .. trying to stir another "race-baited" attack ?? NOW a few FACTS of ... 'the rest of the story' !! ... This lady, in the course of the arguement, had retreated from the boyfriend's (and children's) premises ... she returns a few minutes later with a "concealed firearm" .. then pursues the previous arguement, exposes and discharges that firearm, endangering everyone in the home .. ... (just thought the 'race-baiters' would want to know this before they started yapping &amp; acting stupid) ... . BTW, per the mapping of Zimm's community (Wikipedia), the rows of residences backed up to each other. The positions of the entry gates of this GATED Community, in relation to the location of the 'incident', shows that T.M's shortest route home was to walk in front of the residences ..
