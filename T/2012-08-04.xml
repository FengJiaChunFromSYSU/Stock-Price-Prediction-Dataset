The slope of the rise is quite steep and probably not sustainable. Also note the outperformance relative to the S&amp;P 500. http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=T&amp;t=6m&amp;l=on&amp;z=l&amp;q=l&amp;c=^GSPC Possible factors could be the recent article in Barron's, along with the popularity of large cap stocks and high dividend paying stocks. What about the Telecom ETFs? If money is coming into those funds, they have to buy AT&amp;T at whatever price is offered. I guess the question is whether Telecom continues to outperform or whether traders rotate to other sectors in the market.</Msg><Username>KAWill</Username><Timestamp>1344103340000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 14:02:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344103897000-6</Id><Topic><Title>Chart Pattern - Acceleration from $35 to $38 per share</Title><Username>KAWill</Username><Timestamp>1344103340000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 14:02:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Here is a link that should work showing performance relative to the S&amp;P 500 Index. http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?t=6m&amp;s=T&amp;l=on&amp;z=l&amp;q=l&amp;c=VFINX%2C+&amp;ql=1 This chart compares AT&amp;T to the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 Index Fund.</Msg><Username>KAWill</Username><Timestamp>1344103897000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 14:11:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344114057000-7</Id><Topic><Title>I REMEMBER BACK IN THE 90'S WHEN ATT</Title><Username>gay_blew</Username><Timestamp>1343948781000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 19:06:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And then at&amp;t proceeded to claim medical costs were soaring out of control.

It can't be lost on you that medical costs indeed are soaring. Surely you can't believe it is primarily a result of covering same sex marriage. Medicaid and Medicare are killing the American taxpayer and reeking havoc on the federal budget (if one existed) and deficit. The difference between the Feds and T is that T has the will to do something about it. Cities are going down in part because they provide "free" health care to city employees along with other lavish benefits. A growing number of states are also headed for trouble. Now private sector taxpayers are saying enough is enough. Simply put, the "free" health care model doesn't work and it is going down everywhere because nothing is free. The good ol' days are over.</Msg><Username>t.bfine</Username><Timestamp>1344117347000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 17:55:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344120505000-9</Id><Topic><Title>I REMEMBER BACK IN THE 90'S WHEN ATT</Title><Username>gay_blew</Username><Timestamp>1343948781000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 19:06:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>GB, I think you are trying to make orange juice with out oranges. Does not matter if spouse or partner, same coverage. And, if you buy a child or have one the old fashion way, same covrage. T like the Big 3, is having issues with "legacy" cost. Once appon a time, retirees did not live to 75-80 years of age. Go back over the last 10 years and see how muchnthe UAW have "gave back". Basically, retirees paying for health care. Throw in how many T employees are old with knee, hip, and back problems...And in the Big CA how many are FLMA kings and queens. Ya ya ya, migrains and stress. Being gay with a same sex partner is not one of T big issues.
