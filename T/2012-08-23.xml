They’re till denying global warming and its causes. This can no longer be attributed simply to ignorance – these are outright lies and intentionally deceptive propaganda. “You don't suppose that changes in nature like past ice ages and the reverse that have occurred throughout history of this planet have nothing do with the changes?” - ssdependent “so that helped blow the myth of enviromentalist.” - jon “But the data is incomplete. Remember, you can't use global warming any longer. Too much negativity among the electorate. This is of course, after those climate scientists were caught manipulating the data.” – Rob Well. Let’s revisit a post from last September, with the same invitation for any of you lunatics to show us some scientific data to support your primitive and naïve view on the subject. Or jon could just do some more name calling and wink a lot. Governor Perry Blows Hot Air on Global Warming At the first Republican Debate, Rick Perry made the following statements: "The science is not settled on this (global warming). The idea that we would put Americans' economy at jeopardy based on scientific theory that's not settled yet, to me, is just, is nonsense…" …perhaps the real reason that Governor Perry, and like-minded laissez-faire proponents, deny global warming and contend that government regulations hold back business and plea for smaller government and self-regulation is this; Texas, the center of America’s oil and gas industry, also is the number one emitter of the major green house gas – carbon dioxide – in this country today. Is it any wonder, then, why he disavows the findings of the National Academy of Sciences, as well as the overwhelmingly accepted consensus of 18 scientific organizations, whose statement to The Senate concluded: “Observations throughout the world make it clear that climate change is occurring, and rigorous scientific research demonstrates that the greenhouse gases emitted by human activities are the primary driver.” * Let us not let political hot air blow away scientific fact for the sake of short term profit at the expense of long term civilization. Yes, business and the economy are important, but not at the expense of our children and future generations. echo2165 * Letter to the Senate, October 29, 2009 from The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and U.S. Global Change Research Program, American Association for the Advancement of Science, American Chemical Society, American Geophysical Union, American Institute of Biological Sciences, American Meteorological Society, American Society of Agronomy, American Society of Plant Biologists, American Statistical Association, Association of Ecosystem Research Centers, Botanical Society of America, Crop Science Society of America, Ecological Society of America, Natural Science Collections Alliance, Organization of Biological Field Stations, Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, Society of Systematic Biologists, Soil Science Society of America, University Corporation for Atmospheric Research. (BTW, there are even more International Organizations that acknowledge this conclusion, as well. Of course, this is critically and peer-reviewed science, not unsubstantiated propaganda from individuals funded by special interests. I encourage and invite opposing views with accompanying sources, not the usual "there's just as many people who say global warming is marlarkey" - if there are, please show us. If you can't, please stop lying to your fellow citizens for your own gain.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1345724037000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 08:13:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345724816000-3</Id><Topic><Title>Dividends exceed earnings</Title><Username>taxcpatx</Username><Timestamp>1345561796000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 11:09:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"AT&amp;T Dividends exceed earnings. Payout is over twice the 2011 earnings per share. Maybe 2011 was a bad year. Same situation for Verizon." Seeking Alpha 8/23/2012 "Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller's 5 New Dividend Picks Stanley Druckenmiller is one of the world's most renowned hedge fund managers. While at the helm of Duquesne Capital, a macro hedge fund, he generated returns averaging 30% per year between 1986 and 2010. After closing his investment company, Druckenmiller opened a family office to manage some of his wealth. AT&amp;T is another U.S. communications giant and another new holding in Druckenmiller's fund. The position was also valued at $28 million at the end of the second quarter. The company has a market capitalization of $211 billion. AT&amp;T is a dividend aristocrat that has increased dividends for 28 years in a row. It pays the highest dividend yield among Dow Jones 30 index constituents. AT&amp;T's dividend yield is 4.7% and its payout ratio is 72% of free cash flow. The company boosted dividends at an average rate of 4.6% per year over the past five years. Its peer Verizon Communications pays a dividend yield of 4.5%, while Sprint Nextel does not pay dividends. AT&amp;T has a free cash flow yield of 2.6%, ROE of 4.1%, and ROIC of 2.8%. The company's forward P/E is slightly below those of the telecommunications industry and the key competitor Verizon. The stock is up 31% over the past year. Adage Capital has nearly $290 million invested in the company. In a recent article, we took a closer look at AT&amp;T and Verizon Communications as dividend plays." By the way, per the same piece, he also bought VZ. What a poor investor he must be. I was wondering if Stanley bought your shares?</Msg><Username>t.bfine</Username><Timestamp>1345724816000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 08:26:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345725714000-4</Id><Topic><Title>Where are the jobs?</Title><Username>av8lover</Username><Timestamp>1345646301000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 10:38:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No president can make laws, they can only sign them into law.</Msg><Username>jdanielman</Username><Timestamp>1345725714000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 08:41:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345726427000-5</Id><Topic><Title>Where are the jobs?</Title><Username>av8lover</Username><Timestamp>1345646301000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 10:38:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Depends on who one is supportive.

You didn't know that they all officially declared the recession to be over during Obama's administration and that officially it began during the G.W. Bush administration? I never said anything about the unions and I never said that the loss of teacher's jobs had anything to do with the Federal government. I was just pointing out that when the total number of job gains or losses are determined, those teacher jobs are included. Also when teachers, etc. lose their jobs it could have a negative effect on the economy because those unemployed teachers etc. don't have money to spend and so non-government companies are affected in a negative way.</Msg><Username>eseyfried</Username><Timestamp>1345737727000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 12:02:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345737895000-22</Id><Topic><Title>re: could have prevented it...</Title><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1345671596000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 17:39:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"modern agricultural advances like irrigation, botanical engineering, crop science," This isn't nature, it is farming and ranching.

The unemployment rate is determined by how many people are looking for a job and can't get one. The reason why the unemployment rate is so high is because every year more people graduate high school or college and start looking for jobs. In addition more people look for jobs when they think they have some chance of finding one. I personally know people who could not find a job during that Great Recession but fortunately are now employed.

I dropped $140 at our Target last night. The store was very busy, possibly more than usual because of kids getting ready for school. However, this store is always busy. I think the reason we had so many days on the downside was because of investors cashing out from recent gains. With Canada coming on stream next year, I think it should make for higher prices - unless the whole ecnomy goes over the cliff after the next election. In summary, I don't concern myself with this company - not yet anyway. I hold 2,500 Target shares in a joint account and 500 shares in a Roth account. There may come a time to reassess everything. I did pick up 1000 shares of Silver Wheaton, SLW, recently as a hedge against future problems. Now if we could just get a decent bunch in government to represent us, we would have it made. I have an analyst acquaintance in one of the federal reserve banks and he said there is so much damage done to our economy that it wouldn't matter who wins the election. That is not a good sign if he is right. He is pretty astute so he probably is.</Msg><Username>willking</Username><Timestamp>1345750855000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 15:40:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345752321000-61</Id><Topic><Title>Answered my own ?</Title><Username>mikerego19</Username><Timestamp>1345747296000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 14:41:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Seeking Alpha 8/23/2012: "Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller's 5 New Dividend Picks" One was T.

Here are a few definitions from the dictionary for you winholder. Nature: Humankind’s original condition. A creative and controlling force in the universe. An inner force or the sum of such forces in an individual. The external world in its entirety. You can call things whatever you want to call them, as you do here daily. If agriculture and medicine are not a part of nature in your book, that wouldn’t surprise me in the slightest. You consistently expose your fundamental misunderstanding of the universe and the nature of reality. Man and everything he does is a part of Nature. There is no longer any scientific debate” “The earth is warming and human activity is the PRIMARY cause.” – Union of Concerned Scientists Nevertheless, you state, “Pay attention. I said, mankind does have an impact on climate change but we are not the sole cause of climate change…There are many things over which we have absolutely zero control.” People like you are just pimping for folks who have a vested interest in keeping their constituents ignorant. They state either that global warming doesn’t exist, or man isn’t the main cause, or, as you just did because you were challenged to supply data on those positions, admit it’s possible, but there’s nothing we can do about it. There’s plenty we can do about it. First is to expose people like you who deny scientific fact, belittle teachers and education in general, and participate in intentional deceit to perpetuate the status quo for the privileged few. You defining nature???? Impossible - you have a severe case of Avidyā.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1345754707000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 16:45:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345755106000-65</Id><Topic><Title>question for those who workt at AT&amp;T</Title><Username>investor952</Username><Timestamp>1345695908000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 00:25:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hope you are right.

You also have a unique talent for spreading horsespit around as if you actually knew what you were saying. I have not stated there is no climate change, simply (evidently to simply for you) that there are some forces in nature that nature will not allow us the opportunity of altering and that not all changes in our climate are man caused. Geez, are you really that dense? Quit trying to read between the lines and just read the words. I didn't say there is nothing we could do about climate change, just that there are some things we can't control. Can you or any of your liberal friends make it rain on command, or not rain when it needs to stop? Do you have control over the wind? What is your argument about nature doing some things we cannot control regardless of how hard we try. Quit trying to show off and make it appear you are intelligent because in the process you are countermanding your goal. As I clearly stated, there are some things in which mankind can participate to try to make our world a better place and contribute to our mutual success versus our common failure. There are also some things that 'just happen' and there isn't a thing you or anyone else can do about it.
