Trade arms to an arch-enemy to avoid Congress and fund an illegal war in Central America? Break into the GOP headquarters resulting in his own resignation and the indictment of 43 members of his own administration?

The program actually began in February, 2001-- a month after Bush/Cheney took office and 7 months before 9/11. It was first revealed in 2006. Many, like me, had hoped it had died with the Bush presidency but there was no way of knowing. Now it appears it hasn't. I was very upset about the program then and I am very upset about it now. Few of you seem to recall that Bush/Cheney pushed a program called Total Information Awareness, which was supposed to collect all available "business" records, including credit card, internet activity, etc. When this became public knowledge, the program was defunded by Congress and supposedly split into several unrelated, secret projects. The last vestiges of Bush era of thinking needs to go. This includes secret courts, secret prisons, torture, the concept of enemy combatants and the idea that the government should be collecting massive amounts of data on the US population.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1370611826021</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 09:30:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370612047048-14</Id><Topic><Title>US Is Secretly Collecting Records of Verizon Calls</Title><Username>low_mac</Username><Timestamp>1370519562294</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 07:52:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"this administration found ways to greatly expand its application." No, they did not. This program has been in place since 2001. What was revealed was a reauthorization of an ongoing program that was first revealed in 2006. Many of us had hoped that Obama had ended it, but since it is a secret program there was no way of knowing. If you want to address this, you need to understand that it is much broader than "I don't like Obama".</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1370612047048</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 09:34:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370612162022-15</Id><Topic><Title>US Is Secretly Collecting Records of Verizon Calls</Title><Username>low_mac</Username><Timestamp>1370519562294</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 07:52:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Whatever you think it was designed for, it has been used since its inception to justify all sorts of data collection and warrantless searches.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1370612162022</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 09:36:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370613413316-16</Id><Title>You T shareholders</Title><Msg>Really should buy WIN.</Msg><Username>eluminatlng69</Username><Timestamp>1370613413316</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 09:56:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370613456075-17</Id><Title>T</Title><Msg>Is just about a waste of time, buy WIN.</Msg><Username>eluminatlng69</Username><Timestamp>1370613456075</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 09:57:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370613822566-18</Id><Topic><Title>US Is Secretly Collecting Records of Verizon Calls</Title><Username>low_mac</Username><Timestamp>1370519562294</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 07:52:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"This program has been in place since 2001" Really!

That investment would have returned $581.57 in dividends alone over a ten year period. Had you sold T at yesterday's closing price ($35.81), you would have earned an additional $400.14 on your investment for a total return of $981.70 or 99% over ten years (slightly under 10% return annually for very little risk). If you had reinvested your dividends, of course, those returns would be considerably better. T is not a rockstar stock pick but it has a justifiable place in many portfolios. I appreciate your enthusiasm for WIN but you may want to consider the "if you" scenario for WIN since its IPO. You will quickly see that the stock has lost close to half of its value and the dividend hasn't increased in over 6 years. Historically speaking, WIN has not been better.</Msg><Username>themightyslug</Username><Timestamp>1370619856614</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 11:44:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>13</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370619867302-47</Id><Topic><Title>US Is Secretly Collecting Records of Verizon Calls</Title><Username>low_mac</Username><Timestamp>1370519562294</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 07:52:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No, lavendar, they have both used the program in the same manner.

Trust in this government is waning and will continue to do so until they begin acting like public servants and treat the American people with some honesty.</Msg><Username>usganut</Username><Timestamp>1370630404307</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 14:40:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370630628785-71</Id><Topic><Title>WOW!!!</Title><Username>ossobucco20l2</Username><Timestamp>1370618999847</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 11:29:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>so you should go long . slightly higher earnings? so what? - it goes down every day - good day or bad day - always down - who cares about dividend when stock is a lead balloon? so go long wilkies! you can help some sap like beau get out with his pants at least.</Msg><Username>ossobucco20l2</Username><Timestamp>1370630628785</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 14:43:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370630937081-72</Id><Topic><Title>WOW!!!</Title><Username>ossobucco20l2</Username><Timestamp>1370618999847</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 11:29:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>My understanding ... although interest rates can and will effect defensive type &amp; utility stocks - T &amp; VZ are top tier, solid, and well run companies - but still can be influenced by unneccessary non-related outside forces known as knee-jerk reactions &amp; current political revelations.
