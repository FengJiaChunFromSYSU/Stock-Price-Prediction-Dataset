If someone gave you $61,320 per year with no federal, state, or Social Security taxes taken out, could your family live on that amount? Most likely nearly every family in America could if they chose a modest lifestyle. I know my family could, especially if I didn’t have to pay taxes on any of it. Not only would you get $61, 320 per year tax free, but you wouldn’t have to work for it. You could stay at home and engage in a hobby of your choice. If you lived simply, you could do some traveling and even save money for retirement. We keep hearing about how the rich aren’t paying their “fair share” of taxes to “protect benefits that American families rely on,” as Democrat Rep. Keith Ellison tells us. This per diem poverty payout statistic is positive proof that the charge is baseless. Most money that’s collected for taxes is absorbed by the State. I understand that not all the money that’s designated for payout to poverty-stricken families gets to them. The money has to go through our nation’s vast bureaucracy that is bloated and expensive. Government workers are paid very well. The bureaucratic agencies are designed to be the conduit for payments. These perpetual government workers almost always vote for Democrats. Their jobs are assured as long as there are payments to be made to poor people who also almost always vote for Santa Claus. The numbers on this issue are startling: “According to the Republican side of the Senate Budget Committee, welfare spending per day per household in poverty is $168, which is higher than the $137 median income per day. When broken down per hour, welfare spending per hour per household in poverty is $30.60, which is higher than the $25.03 median income per hour.” We would be better off just writing a check for $4343.50 each month and sending it directly to each poor family in America and save 15 percent in the process. Remember, this is tax-free money. The government’s definition of poverty is based on total income received. The poverty level for 2012 was set at $23,050 (total yearly income) for a family of four. A direct payment of $4343.50 each month is almost twice what the poverty rate is for a family of four. The so-called “War on Poverty” has turned out to be a war on the taxpayer and the poor. And like any war, there are profiteers. Who are they? The elected officials that vote for these programs. They and the bureaucrats that oversee the poverty industry know that as long as there is poverty in America, they have a job.</Msg><Username>pinhighshot</Username><Timestamp>1355171867748</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 15:37:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355172032045-13</Id><Title>Yet another dumb liberal idea!</Title><Msg>There's little news in finding a politician acting hypocritically, but sometimes their hypocrisy can be so breath-taking it just has to be noticed. Such is the case with DEMOCRAT State Rep. José Menéndez. While he and his party oppose voter ID, he filed legislation mandating that stores examine photo IDs when you shop with a credit card! Interestingly, his ID mandate doesn't include people who use the "Lone Star Card" -- the modern version of food stamps in which welfare recipients use a debit card to make purchases. As Dustin Matocha put it this week, "If Rep. Menéndez got his way, you’d be required to prove your identity to spend your own money, but not if you’re spending someone else’s money. And showing an ID once or twice a year at a polling place is too much to ask?"</Msg><Username>pinhighshot</Username><Timestamp>1355172032045</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 15:40:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355172262651-14</Id><Topic><Title>Is it time we Punish Single Women?</Title><Username>robfisk</Username><Timestamp>1354844143546</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 20:35:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Oh, like all of these fear-mongering email forwards some of it is true. But you should question its significance. If you want to find a Republican in some county or state legislator who said just about anything, I'm sure you can. And then you have the complete #$%$: "Republicans want to cut nearly a billion dollars of food and other aid to low-income pregnant women, mothers, babies, and kids." --#$%$, just complete spin. "Maryland Republicans ended all county money for a low-income kids' preschool program. Why? No need, they said. Women should really be home with the kids, not out working." The real quotes: "I know everybody isn’t able to survive doing that, but clearly, as we can strengthen marriage we can decrease the children that we have to reach." &amp; "I mean, education of your kids starts at home, okay? I never relied on anyone else to guarantee the education of my kids." That is a far cry from saying women should be at home. At best it says *someone* should be at home and is a strong argument for FMLA. The moveon take is unnecessarily inflammatory and probably flat out wrong, if the speakers were asked to clarify their statements. I could go on, but I think you get my drift. There is plenty out there to make women worry about Republican rule. There is no reason to imply budget priorities are targeted solely at "pregnant women, mothers, babies and kids" or to intentionally misconstrue the comments of some county official in the worst possible way. I am a firm believer that the best thing to counter lies and mistruths is honesty and integrity--not more lies and mistruths.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1355172262651</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 15:44:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355177650237-15</Id><Topic><Title>Yet another dumb liberal idea!</Title><Username>pinhighshot</Username><Timestamp>1355172032045</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 15:40:32 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Now that Obama has been fraud-elected, showing picture ID is no longer burdensome.

I did not research each and every claim, but I also believe that some of your issues were not so much with the validity of the points made, but with the editorial presentation. We all, everyone on this board, take some poetic license at times, including you and me. Your point about, “Maryland Republicans ended all county money for a low-income kids' preschool program…” – I am under the impression this is true. “ Why? No need, they said. Women should really be home with the kids, not out working." I’m quite certain no one actually used those words. I would assume that is the opinion of the writer, and it was not quoted as coming from the legislators. But, if they cut the funds, I’d certainly be interested in what their logic actually was, however. Because, quite frankly, as I often mention and did in that very post, a party platform that assumes all women are “the Stepford Wives” and deems legislating transvaginal ultrasounds or defining “legitimate” rape or suggests that God intended life through rape, is not beyond cutting funding to programs to keep women subdued. The point of the entire post was more in line with comparing the far right of our peoples being similar to that of our enemies. One place that posted this, gave sources at the bottom. I have not read them yet, but, be my guest. Again, I think the MoveOn portion of my post was fairly accurate. That you took offense to the writer’s presentation doesn’t necessarily mean the gist of the piece was invalid. I’m sure that when I compare the Tea Party to Sharia Law, others feel that it’s an unfair comparison, as well. Search for SaddleBrooke Democratic club.
