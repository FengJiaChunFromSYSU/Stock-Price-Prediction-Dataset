A black man didn't start the war in Iraq. You only have to watch what these nutjobs post for 2-3 days to realize that they are all cryptoracists (who aren't very good at the "crypto" part) sucking on a city, county, state, or federal sugar tit retirement. None of them are intelligent enough to have survived in the private sector for more than fifteen minutes and now they are biting the hand that feeds them, has always fed them, because they are terrified that someone coming up beneath them might in some way deprive them of some portion of their "benefits"... if you want to see the Depends awhirl, have empty tins of Ensure thrown at your head and be in danger of being run down by a "hoveround" (thanks jon for that; at 42 y/o, I had never heard of a "hoeveround" but getting one sounds like a goal for you) call them "entitlements". That's always fun on Thu night when they've just gotten back from dominoes and what little is left of their testosterone is boiling from absorbing yet another loss in a life that is a seemingly endless string of defeats.</Msg><Username>hotdoggitwiggie</Username><Timestamp>1368504651755</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 00:10:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368504904968-2</Id><Topic><Title>Finally we find out "What difference...does it make?"</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1368234064090</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 21:01:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You're ill and should seek help.</Msg><Username>hotdoggitwiggie</Username><Timestamp>1368504904968</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 00:15:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368505339336-3</Id><Topic><Title>Finally we find out "What difference...does it make?"</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1368234064090</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 21:01:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Speak for yourself.

The IRS, at least initially, was independent actions by some low lever staffers. The Justice Department, with Fast and Furious and the not so subtle spying on the AP but that the President didn't know about any of these actions. It is appearing more and more that there is no one in charge in this administration. Staffs running off breaking laws, getting people killed, spying on the media and no one in power knew any of this was going on? Maybe if he was trying to LEAD his administration and this country instead of continuing to campaign for an election he won, he might have a clue what is going on. This LEADER has a supreme lack of leadership and understanding of what that term means. Holder and the head of the IRS need to resign or be fired.

It requires hiring investigators which requires an allocation of funds which isn't something certain people are willing to do. It is very hard to get people to pay attention to this because not catching people for fraud is an intangible cost. Fraud prevented (as opposed to caught) due to enforcement is theoretical and difficult to measure at best. When it comes to tax fraud, some people are opposed to preventing it. The Heritage Foundation has been known to list increased revenues due to fraud enforcement as a tax increase, something that should be opposed by the Norquist group.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1368558097347</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 15:01:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368558262577-29</Id><Topic><Title>Start a charity at your home</Title><Username>peppeek</Username><Timestamp>1368460456077</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 11:54:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This type of profiling should not be tolerated for obvious reasons.

Words have consequences. Is there a difference between “act of terror” and “act of terrorism”?' Again, you have got to be kidding me. The level of parsing you are doing here, in all of these various things, is nonsensical. The President and Susan Rice were clearly very careful not to conclude that this was an act of terrorism or that Al-Queada was involved prematurely. As they should be. (I seem to remember that you wanted us to invade Syria last week). But they also clearly stated that extremist elements were involved and they were waiting before making any final decisions. What on earth is wrong with that? Absolutely nothing is wrong with that. In fact, it is what most Americans hope their government will do. It is what the Obama administration has always done. It is clear that your only complaint is that he did this just prior to an election and you think that this event, if portrayed as a terrorist act immediately, would have somehow swayed the election. I hope you keep thinking that because it is outlandish and wrong. I hope you keep barking up this tree because it will ensure that you people never hold a major national office again. You lost the election because states which were previously "purple" are now consistently "blue" in Senate and Electoral votes, because Romney was a poor candidate, and because your policies appeal to a dying constituency of mostly elderly, white, rural and affluent people--four groups which are shrinking in this country. So either adjust or get over it. I don't really care.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1368562358172</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 16:12:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368563176952-36</Id><Title>HHS branch of Obama SS shakes down insurance companies</Title><Msg>Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius is shaking down companies her agency might regulate, to help sign up uninsured Americans for ObamaCare.

Simpson won a small victory on Tuesday when he returned to court for Day 2 of his attempt to win a new trial in his robbery case: A judge said he could have one hand unshackled to drink water and take notes. Simpson managed a smile and a waist-high wave with his shackled hand as he entered the courtroom and found friends and family members in the audience. With his free hand, he then donned a glove, struggling to get it on, then, in deference to either Johnnie Cochran or Michael Jackson, he moon-walked across the front of the courtroom, before stabbing the court reporter and the bailiff and escaping in a waiting Ford Bronco, driven by Al Cowlings, who has been unemployed since June of 1994. They were last seen at a Jack-in-the-Box restaurant being confronted by a group of hooded vigilantes, with O.J. pleading that he just wanted his stuff back.

IRS scandal, Benghazi, Justice Department...again, and now they caught a spy. Funny how all the top level folks keep insisting that they knew nothing about what was going on. Then who does? As for those complaining that the Benghazi ARB has reviewed thousands of documents, that is the excuse the justice is using in the reverse...they claim they viewed tens of thousands of documents and still didn't have the answers they wanted, so they tap the phone records.
