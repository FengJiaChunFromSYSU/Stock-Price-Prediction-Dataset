You have no idea what you really believe. Here you claim too much policy comes from lobbyists. A few days ago you criticized independent policy research by the Justice Dept. as embarrassing. Which is it? A few weeks ago you lauded Rand Paul for sending some portion of his staff budget back to the Treasury. What do you think that budget is for? It is for policy research. You continuously attack independent research from the CBO, the BLS, the NBER, the BEA and any other non-partisan source. You attack the media. You even attack Academic Journals when I cite them. What do you believe in? The Conservative blogosphere, which is the domain of political "PR" firms? You repeat whatever you find there, so I assume so. You have no idea what you are talking about. You just whine, complain and criticize no matter what is done. You have no true beliefs. You don't have enough knowledge to form a real opinion. Your opinion is bought and sold on a daily basis.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1362061225213</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 09:20:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362062329120-7</Id><Topic><Title>Based on the email I got from the "Organizing for Action" group ricky must be right</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1361994002020</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 14:40:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Woodward printed part of the email: "You're focusing on a few specific trees that give a very wrong impression of the forest. But perhaps we will just not see eye to eye here. ... I think you will regret staking out that claim." He probably will. It is a poor interpretation of events. These were cuts demanded by the Tea Brains in Congress. "what that really means is let us raise taxes now and we will talk about spending cuts later" And what you really mean by demanding "spending cuts now" is cuts to investments in our economy, our infrastructure, our children and our future. Your goal is to protect old age entitlements, which account for the largest chunk of the budget and budget growth. I am all for spending cuts, but they must be centered on Soc. Sec., Medicare and PAYING down the debt with revenue or they're pointless. We will not gut our future to pay for the past.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1362062329120</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 09:38:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362062924784-8</Id><Title>AT&amp;T above $36.

Mostly because these are not non-partisan organizations. They are organizations that are paid and funded by the Federal government and they are directed by the Federal government. When you are hired, paid and owe your existence to an organization, you cannot be completely independent. Even many of the liberals that voted for the health care bill they never bothered to read have admitted most of the language was written by health care, drug, and other medical related lobbyists. Even within the walls of Congress there isn't the talent to write such a confusing, deceitful document and they are highly paid professionals in writing such documents. Nice try but when ‘professional’, unbiased government organization issue statements and reports and continually revise them, they lose some of their credibility.</Msg><Username>winholder</Username><Timestamp>1362066067599</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 10:41:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362066389120-20</Id><Title>5% div, get it while you can</Title><Msg>at $36 it's 5%, not much of that around that you can count on</Msg><Username>tiglet2l</Username><Timestamp>1362066389120</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 10:46:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362066411273-21</Id><Topic><Title>Based on the email I got from the "Organizing for Action" group ricky must be right</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1361994002020</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 14:40:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Some may not know that "Organizing for Action" is an e-mail direct from the POTUS. It is sent to all the Presidents supporters to poison their minds in favor of the Presidents position. Note the reference to "the budget" when there is no budget. Note the placing of blame on the Republicans. It fails to mention that, even after the 85 billion cut, spending in 2013 will exceed 2012. As long as Republicans are being blamed they might as well do their job and say "no more increases in the debt limit". The Republicans should submit a budget that makes all the cuts that need to be made to make spending less than income. That would include the elimination of the DHS which is swiftly becoming the "private army reporting directly to the President" that Obama promised in 2007 when first running for President. Also eliminate the DOE and return their functions to the states. Discontinue all foreign aid and all subsidies to Agriculture. Right now nearly half of the Federal government spending is on credit so half of the spending has to STOP; obviously not overnight but certainly by 2016.</Msg><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1362066411273</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 10:46:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362066933967-22</Id><Topic><Title>Will the American people care when they find out the truth about sequestration?</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1361930514108</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 21:01:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>When was your last trip through an airport? Did you happen to notice that most of the TSA folks were standing around with their hands in the pockets doing NOTHING! I stood in line for nearly twenty minutes while two TSA employees tried to get everyone through a very long line, while four other stood off to the side texting, playing games on their cell phones and shoot the bull the entire time. They never moved more than two feet from their original stance. And no, they were not working. Truly we could stand to lose a few of those. As for losing teachers, I would hate to see that happen, even the poor ones bring some value, but almost every school in the country could stand to lose some of their administrative staff. I had to pick up my grandson to take him to a dentist appointment, there were nine people, mostly doing nothing but sitting idly at a desk in the office. This school has about 300 kids enrolled. There are a lot of folks that might, might lose their jobs as a result of this governmental cluster f%$#, and some of them need to be off the payroll. But that would just give Dear Leader yet another excuse for his high unemployment rate.

Puzzling at least. As for fair, I am reminded of an old Johnny Carson quote, 'If life was fair, Elvis would be alive, and all the impersonators would be dead'.

He does this all the time. He was offered an out against indiscriminate cuts by the Republicans to stick with the cut levels, but allow the government to be selective about where the cuts were made. He refused. He will not and never has compromised with anyone on his ideas. He thinks he is a God. Now the fun is starting with the release of the illegal immigrants from prison. At first it was stated that the President didn't order this and neither did Big Janet. Some low level administrator wanting to look good ordered it. Now it is coming out in the NY Times that a release was ordered by ICE over a week ago and that is was to release 26% of their prison population. This is a much higher percentage than their budget cuts and there were not at capacity before the releases, so they should have had funds sufficient to not require the release of anyone. This is taking on flavors of Benghazi...the right hand apparently doesn't know what the left is doing or at least which lies the other is telling.

Ignoring them for third world immigrants, both legal and illegal, and using them against White immigrants of European ancestry. We are hated and being eliminated.

Always. The goal, which is almost realized, is to first disarm all White people, then make them a vulnerable tiny minority, sitting ducks easily eliminated both by the government and other race who hate them and want to take possession of the country. I agree with this guy, if tens of millions of illegal third world immigrants are not legalized how far will Massa Bongo Bongo go in retaliation and in his effort to eliminate our majority: "The latest threat of terrorism is coming from the White House and Obama policies, not Iraq or Afghanistan," said William Gheen. "How low will Obama go if he does not get more money or agenda concessions? Will he start opening up the federal prisons next or disable our nuclear deterrent capabilities? How long will Congress and American citizens put up with these threats from the White House?" Also from that same article on the release of illegal alien prisoners: 'The fact that US Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham just emerged smiling from a closed door meeting with Obama regarding immigration reform amnesty on the backdrop of these threats shows an agenda in motion. McCain and Graham are thumbing their noses at a new Reuters poll showing 70% of Republicans, and a majority of all Americans, want illegal immigrants deported instead of being allowed to stay in America.'</Msg><Username>lavendarsen</Username><Timestamp>1362110467686</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 23:01:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362112759036-56</Id><Title>Catholics wil probably be blessed with a new BLACK POPE.</Title><Msg>Many believe it is likely the next Pope will be Black. I think it is likely also. History indicates it would be the natural progression of current racial demographics. There has been a White genocide in progress for decades and Whites are now only 7% of the world population with a projection of 1% of the population by 2100. Catholic demography probably show a similar trend. When a race, or in this a group of races, dominate numerically, THEY decide who their leaders and rulers are. If they want a colored leader, they get a colored leader. Get used to it Whites. You are being eliminated. Your elimination was carefully planned, it was intended that you be a tiny vulnerable subservient minority. In fact, this is already what you are in the U.S.. A colored illegal immigrant President rules and dictates to you, with an emerging non White majority, both legal and illgal, that also already rules and dictates what you are allowed to do or not do. Just look around and open your eyes if you do not believe me. If you are one of the fortunate few to live in a predominantly White area, then travel around the country. You will be amazed at how outnumbered you are in most major metropolitan areas. You will also probably be shocked, and then completely frightened by what has been done to you and your culture.</Msg><Username>lavendarsen</Username><Timestamp>1362112759036</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 23:39:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
