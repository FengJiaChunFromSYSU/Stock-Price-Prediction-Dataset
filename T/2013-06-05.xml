I imagine because they don't want the asylum process to be flooded with immigrants who have suddenly decided it would be a great idea to home school their children.

No they're not. US Immigration and Customs Enforcement appealed the decision. It's part of their job function. Judge grants guy asylum. ICE thinks this guy is gaming the system ICE appeals. Why would you think this is somehow special? "Is it a fear of setting a precedent?" I imagine it is. Fear that it will open a giant loophole in immigration laws. "The family would have been better off to have chosen Italy or Ireland" Yes, they would have. Or neighboring Austria, Poland, France, or any country in the European Union that has legal homeschooling. That is because they are members of the EU and the couple were free to relocate anywhere on the continent without applying for immigration or asylum. That is a big deal in the legal case. Why they tried to apply for asylum in the US instead of just hiring a moving truck and legally scooting across the German border is beyond me. "home schooling is a Constitutional Right rather than America where it is but we ignore the Constitution." How ridiculous. Homeschooling is legal in all 50 states with few restrictions. There is no serious interest in ending homeschooling in any state in the US that I can find anywhere. It is complete and utter BS. A figment of your imagination placed into the empty vessel you call a head by the conservative media.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1370447648470</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-05 11:54:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370448259066-21</Id><Topic><Title>Way to go FOX News</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1369912936115</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 07:22:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"the Tea Party could have turned you into an absolute zealot."

However the cost of the cars, decoy planes and helicopters and the cost of the advance team to investigate travel sites are not costs that would have been realized had the President of his wife been traveling to make a fund raising speech.

The 35 puts I bought yesterday barely made a profit when I sold them today ($10). The 35.5s did much better ($90). I bought some 35.5 calls for 16 cents near the close and they went even lower to 14 cents. Looking for a little run up tomorrow.</Msg><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1370468076000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-05 17:34:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370469032904-35</Id><Topic><Title>5 million shares traded at the open today</Title><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1370355064531</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 10:11:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks for your input on KO, I am going to wait until the nest Fed meeting before I pull the trigger, unless the price gets to the range that I mentioned, good luck ;-)</Msg><Username>bshipleyinsurance</Username><Timestamp>1370469032904</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-05 17:50:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370471131500-36</Id><Topic><Title>biggest mover for june--CPOW-- MONSTER MOVE</Title><Username>calgirlies</Username><Timestamp>1370461125292</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-05 15:38:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yeah right, good luck with that, go away</Msg><Username>bshipleyinsurance</Username><Timestamp>1370471131500</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-05 18:25:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370471548497-37</Id><Topic><Title>dont give up theres hope!</Title><Username>princeghara</Username><Timestamp>1369866771349</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 18:32:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>i signed up to, thanks tho</Msg><Username>victoremoneyman</Username><Timestamp>1370471548497</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-05 18:32:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370477117589-38</Id><Topic><Title>Land of the free</Title><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1369948675101</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 17:17:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>...“I think they need to change the rules about how political party's pay for their Presidents campaign costs”…that, and or how supposed non-political lobbying groups obtain non-profit, non-tax paying status when legitimate, self-acknowledged lobbyists don’t…oh, wait, there really aren’t any of those…K Street in Washington is like Magsaysay Drive in Olongapo, Subic Bay…any and everything’s available, to the highest bidder…Olongapo made Tijuana look like Disneyland… “I shall return”, “Remember the Maine”, “Dude, our jitney driver just ran over a monkey meat shisk-a-bob vendor!!!!”… and “Man, that Ismelda’s got some shoes”.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1370477117589</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-05 20:05:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
