First, I am 30 years too young for them to be relevant. Second, I am not terrified by your cross dressing the way your mother was. Did mama walk in on you when you were 13, jacking in front of the mirror wearing sissy's poodle skirt? It's okay, Jon, you can tell us. Unlike every other aspect of your life, you're loved and respected here... So, poodle skirt has no impact on me, you only expose your own terror of your cross dressing.

With the exception of the word 'embraced' it is the same quote. And the key is that the surveillance has been 'expanded' under the Obama administration. Again, Bush may have started it, wrongly, but since then apparently it has been 'expanded' and Bush didn't have anything to do with this expansion. Obama accomplished that on his own, one of the few things he has really accomplished and he got it wrong.</Msg><Username>pinhighshot</Username><Timestamp>1370867998643</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-10 08:39:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370868059852-7</Id><Topic><Title>What's Up With AT&amp;T?</Title><Username>timetraveler2u</Username><Timestamp>1370638345809</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 16:52:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I agree ..heads should roll on that huge mistake</Msg><Username>vietnamvet5</Username><Timestamp>1370868059852</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-10 08:40:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370870841191-8</Id><Title>News drives T up 1%</Title><Msg>"MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., June 10, 2013 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ -- Based on its recent analysis of the video conferencing hosted and managed services market, Frost &amp; Sullivan recognizes AT&amp;T with the 2013 North American Frost &amp; Sullivan Award for Market Share Leadership.

They have very strict rules for allocating organs and a very formal process for changing those rules. Ultimately the Board of Directors, made up mostly of physicians, sets policy for allocating organs after public input. UNOS has been in place since Reagan created it in 1984. If UNOS is a death panel, it's Reagan's death panel, not Obama's. Kathleen Sebelius is not on the Board of Directors. She cannot arbitrarily change the rules about who gets organs. But let us be perfectly clear about this. The parents of this girl are asking that an exception to the UNOS rules be made to prioritize their daughter for a lung transplant that is less likely to work for her than for someone else. If they get an exception that means someone else higher up on the list under the current policies will not get a transplant and will die. You are asking Kathleen Sebelius to to ignore established rules made democratically. You are asking her to unilaterally decide that this girl will have a chance to live, a decision that would automatically result in the death of another person. You are asking her to be a death panel. She is refusing. The other person who will die if you get your way is nameless and faceless. It is easy to root for a little girl whose name and face you can see. But it is sickening to watch people like you literally play politics with peoples lives. You are willing to kill people for some cheap political points.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1370879996895</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-10 11:59:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370881672953-17</Id><Topic><Title>And this just in...</Title><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1370644373522</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 18:32:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>All is well here, jon.

Signing the waiver would have allowed the little girl to get on the recipient list it would not move her to the top of the list she is in line with everyone else and does not get priority over anyone above her on the list. Sibelius by not signing the waiver denied the little girl any chance at this life saving procedure. She is in charge of your healthcare under Obamacare.

This 15-member board is tasked under the law with determining which patients ought to receive which treatments.

She is not in charge of your healthcare. There is no death panel. The Independent Payment Advisory Board is a Board that makes recommendations to Congress about which treatments (e.g., acupuncture, or a brand name drug when a generic is available) should be covered by Medicare &amp; Medicaid. Congress makes the ultimate decision. The Board is currently called the Medicare Payment Advisory Committee--it is already in place--but will have a new name and some slightly expanded functions soon. It absolutely does not determine "which patients ought to receive treatments" or make individual treatment decisions. Fake ricky is liar. He and the Tea Party are playing politics with peoples lives.

We can only hope that we are never in a situation where whether or not we receive life saving health care is in the hands people like liberal ricky and sibelius. Liberal ricky if it were up to you would you sign the waiver to save this little girl? The death panel-The Independent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB, is a fifteen-member United States Government agency created in 2010 by sections 3403 and 10320 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that grants IPAB the authority to make changes to the Medicare program. The board's cost-cutting mandate will inevitably bring about a reduction in care and gives the IPAB unprecedented, dangerous authority to cut Medicare pay rates and strangle access to care. The sole function of the IPAB is to cut spending with little guarantee of maintaining quality, access, and scientifically proven care. There may be no physician representation on the board either.</Msg><Username>ricky1820l</Username><Timestamp>1370905848732</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-10 19:10:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370907064405-38</Id><Title>Mr. Zimmerman ...</Title><Msg>(police) ..

There must be a formal research proposal as well. Kathleen Sibelius cannot issue a variance or a waiver or anything else. I know exactly what the IPAB is, fake Ricky. It exists, like MedPAC, ensure taxpayers don't overpay for health care. One might think you Tea Brains would like that. But you are what you are. You'd steal from your own children, I'm sure. But keep up your Death Panel claims. From Fox News to the Convention floor. I'm all for it.

He roamed upper class neighborhoods at 2 and 3 AM in the morning with dreadlocks. Cops stopped him numerous times to check him out. He eventually tried suing them for "Didcrimination". It was probably his plan all along. I've been stopped several times years ago in the evening while walking to my car. I simply identified myself and why I was there. No prob. As long as cops are polite when they approach you I've no grievence. Zimmerman never approached this turd and simply followed him until told not to. He then turned and walked back to his vehicle. He then was accosted from behind and assaulted (two witnesses will testify to this) The only reason this is in court is because "liberal racists" want to use it to provoke violence.</Msg><Username>lewcor</Username><Timestamp>1370912000517</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-10 20:53:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>16</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370912359916-42</Id><Topic><Title>US Is Secretly Collecting Records of Verizon Calls</Title><Username>low_mac</Username><Timestamp>1370519562294</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 07:52:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He was at Harvard?
