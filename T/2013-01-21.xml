The gun makes you feel safer, but that's about it. If you're scared, get an alarm system or a dog. Either will be far more effective than getting into a shootout in your living room.

The Supreme Court of the United States has ruled, time after time, that rights can be regulated. Yelling "fire" in a crowded theater or threatening to kill someone, for instance, are not protected by freedom of speech. Likewise the right to bear arms is regulated and always has been. This is clearly the case to anyone with any sense. Civilians may not legally possess surface to air missiles. You cannot bear any firearms or sharp instruments on an airplane. These are "ifs, ands, or buts". If you think your right to bear arms is absolute you are mistaken.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1358784545234</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 11:09:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358784783688-15</Id><Topic><Title>Danny Glover teaches constitutional law at Texas A &amp; M University</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1358679621880</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-20 06:00:21 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Danny owes his students the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. To mention two minor reasons and ignore the major reason for the second amendment is a fabrication apparently intended to focus on slavery which was a very minor problem at the time the second amendment was passed (unless you were a slave). Many of the early settlers came to America as indentured servants who served as a slave for 7 years to pay for their passage and board and room. My great, great , great, grandfather was one of them. He came from France in 1740 and did not serve his full seven years because he married the masters daughter. He did not fight in the Revolutionary War because his father in law and his wife were Torres so he was also a Torrey even though he was from France.</Msg><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1358784783688</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 11:13:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358785085472-16</Id><Topic><Title>Danny Glover teaches constitutional law at Texas A &amp; M University</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1358679621880</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-20 06:00:21 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"there was no national army and each colony was responsible for its' own defense." The main threats were Indians and slave revolts, and revolts from non-slave tenant farmers. There was also quite a bit of ethnic conflict in those days (Scottish v/s Irish, for instance, or German v/s English). It wasn't the British. American landowners were disgruntled at the British for not allowing them to defend themselves from these domestic threats while the British Army was weak in the colonies. They were afraid a weak Federal government might do the same.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1358785085472</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 11:18:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358785675737-17</Id><Topic><Title>Top 5 causes of accidental death in the US</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1358687253589</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-20 08:07:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Not theory, meaning of the words, something you lose sight of during your playground rants.

Explosives used in murder cases: Noting that this data does not include acts of terrorism, use of explosives as a murder weapon averagely takes the lives of10 individual yearly. This, as one would expect, is low in number, since murderers rarely create a chaos and uproar around their crime scene. 9. Drowning victims: Collected stats from 2008 shows 10 known cases of individuals who were murdered by forced drowning. 8. Narcotics used for murder: A total of 33 people were murdered using narcotics in 2008. 7. Fire induced killings:. Fire has been one of the favorite methods amongst murderers to commit acts atrocity, where usually minimum evidence is left for investigation. In the US alone between 80 to 100 people die from arson induced fire as one of the most common murder weapons 6. Strangulation to death: Strangulation or stranglingis literally the closing of a person’s windpipe by forceful compression, which leads to unconsciousness and subsequently death. The oxygen flow is cut off and the person’s brain is the first organ to die after a few minutes. Strangulation has taken the lives of 88 Americans in 2008. 5. Asphyxiation to death: Asphyxiation is somewhat of different than strangulation in a sense that loss of consciousness is caused by impairing normal breathing using hazardous gases like carbon monoxide and sulphur. This common method has taken the lives of 89 in the US during 2008. 4. Use of blunt objects: Let’s not be vague, these objects include anything from hammers, clubs, and baseball bats to bottles and tree branches, annually taking the lives of nearly 600 people in the States alone. 3. Personal body weapons: The third most common murder weapons are body parts such hands, feet, fists and head. Throwing a punch, a head-butt or a kick against another person’s head usually has fatal consequences and unfortunately many people have been murdered as such. In 2008 it is reported that 861 lost their lives by fatal body blows in the US. 2. Knives and cutting instruments: Cold arms usually in the form of sharp objects – mostly knives – have caused the death of 1897 people in 2008. There’s no way to regulate or stop people from obtaining sharp object and it is unfortunate that they are used in murders. 1. Firearms (misleading) Nearly 75% of the cases involving firearms are actually gang related and another fraction of it are justifiable cases in self-defense. As stated in the opening paragraph, many lives are actually saved by those have them and use them for protection; hundreds of thousands of women use guns in the US to protect themselves against rapists and criminals. It is historically and socially proven that the more right to arms are taken away from the regular citizenry the more crime brews thereafter and more innocent lives are lost. Not only that, total freedom means freedom to protect one’s self without complete reliance on government, which in a majority of cases does not respond in time and is itself a threat when corrupted; the founding fathers understood this common sense. Moreover, the states with the most strict gun control laws like Illinois and New York have the worst gun crimes simply because criminals can easily do what they want, whereas southern states like Texas with the least gun control have some of the lowest gun crimes since individuals can protect themselves against criminals. Ask this intellectual questions… WHY? 4. Blunt objects + 3. Body weapons + 2. Knives result in MUCH larger crime numbers than 1. Firearms Also note that: Use of knives, bats, personal body weapons and blunt objects (as highlighted in red) are the tools, which the criminals use to take far more lives that guns. Criminals will always get their their weapons, no matter what. That is a FACT!</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1358785731101</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 11:28:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358785941585-19</Id><Topic><Title>Top 5 causes of accidental death in the US</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1358687253589</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-20 08:07:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>31347 Chicago residents killed by out of control thugs with stolen weapons</Msg><Username>ricky1820l</Username><Timestamp>1358785941585</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 11:32:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358786451245-20</Id><Topic><Title>Top 5 causes of accidental death in the US</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1358687253589</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-20 08:07:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What do you consider a assault gun?

The police are not everywhere, they cannot be everywhere. In the few short minutes it takes for them to respond, you're dead or injured. I find it so hard to believe that liberals don't understand that the criminals will not give up their guns regardless of any new gun laws, those that choose to kill someone will still have guns or simply find another way. Guns are not the problem, simply a tool used by mentally unbalanced people that have either the lack of temper control or they have the desire to do someone else harm. People are the problem, not the weapon of choice. This is political theatre that will cost more lives of innocent people going forward and those involved in the theatre should be ashamed of their actions.</Msg><Username>texlec</Username><Timestamp>1358796985261</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 14:36:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358797529133-24</Id><Topic><Title>Danny Glover teaches constitutional law at Texas A &amp; M University</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1358679621880</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-20 06:00:21 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Danny Glover, according to all the bio's I can find on him, says he attended college.

I stay away from downtown, I learned my lesson. Hit and run is a frequent news item in Florida too. Riding a bicycle and walking across a busy street in Florida requires real bravery. In Los Angeles though, hit and run is epidemic according to The Los Angeles Weekly: There is no LAPD task force or organized city effort to address the problem, yet the numbers are mind-boggling. About 20,000 hit-and-run crashes, from fender benders to multiple fatalities, are recorded by the Los Angeles Police Department each year. That’s huge, even in a city of 3.8 million people. In the United States, 11 percent of vehicle collisions are hit-and-runs. But in Los Angeles, L.A. Weekly has learned, an incredible 48 percent of crashes were hit-and-runs in 2009, the most recent year for which complete statistics are available. According to data collected by the state, some 4,000 hit-and-run crashes a year inside L.A. city limits, including cases handled by LAPD, California Highway Patrol and the L.A. County Sheriff, resulted in injury and/or death. Of those, according to a federal study, about 100 pedestrians died; the number of motorists and bicyclists who die would push that toll even higher.</Msg><Username>lavendarsen</Username><Timestamp>1358803165958</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 16:19:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358808488801-30</Id><Title>Danny Glover</Title><Msg>Frog and others have stated that Danny Glover is a profesor of constitutional law at A&amp;M.

Hint #1: they don't belong to the NRA. Ft Hood~~~ Registered Democrat ~ Muslim Columbine ~~~ Too young to vote; both families were registered Democrats and progressive liberals Virginia Tech ~~~ Wrote hate mail to President Bush and to his staff ~ Registered Democrat Colorado Theater ~~~ Registered Democrat; staff worker on the Obama campaign; Occupy Wall Street participant; progressive liberal Connecticut School Shooter- ~~~ Registered Democrat; hated Christians. Common thread is that all of these shooters were progressive liberal Democrats. Also, of the worst killings in the last several decades, only one was a female, all the rest were boys, barely men, and none of them had a strong male father or role model in the household. Their role models were rappers, action movies, comics and viloent video games. Our problem isn't weapons, it's boys without boundaries. Who live in 'progressive' households.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1358810541390</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 18:22:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358810601735-33</Id><Topic><Title>Danny Glover teaches constitutional law at Texas A &amp; M University</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1358679621880</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-20 06:00:21 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"They are "both" criminal acts ...

The patriots of 1776 did not fight to replace the tyranny of a king with the privileges of a few or the rule of a mob. They gave to us a Republic, a government of, and by, and for the people, entrusting each generation to keep safe our founding creed. . .

Medicare and Medicaid were poor ideas instituted to buy votes. You can't reduce medical cost by adding bureaucracy cost." Except that Medicare and Medicaid are the most efficient insurance entities in the country. Medicare spends about 5-6% on administrative costs. The average for private health insurance companies is about 12%, with ranges from 7% to 30% depending on the market. Worldwide single-payer systems are far, far more efficient than what we have in America and achieve similar outcomes. Healthcare is a unique market. It's not like you have a heart attack and think "now which physician produces bypass surgeries most efficiently". You want the best no matter the cost and if you can't afford it you think its morally wrong that you should die while someone who sold his soul to Goldman Sachs should live.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1358825681800</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 22:34:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
