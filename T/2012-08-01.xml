Do you mean where to roll your 401k over to? I use Etrade and have rolled over all my 401ks to my own IRAs in there. However, I have been on the same job the last three years and currently have $100,000 sitting in my current companie's 401k. When I leave this contract, which should be in the next few months, I will roll that money over also, but probably not to Etrade. I prefer to keep somewhat separate accounts. At the moment, I am considering Schwab or Scottrade. Schwab has some international features that appeal to me since I spend time overseas. Both got decent consumer review ratings. Since I do need a brick and mortar bank, I also have a Wells Fargo account. I may put the 401k roll over into there, just to establish a larger presence. They don't charge any maintenance fee if over $50,000. I don't like their trading and transaction fees. But, just to avoid having all my monies in one istitution, I have not dismissed Wells yet.</Msg><Username>gsk10002000</Username><Timestamp>1343860780000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-01 18:39:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343864884000-21</Id><Topic><Title>Trolls</Title><Username>farmhand2021</Username><Timestamp>1343830818000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-01 10:20:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Freedom of speach</Msg><Username>josieinib</Username><Timestamp>1343864884000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-01 19:48:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343865279000-22</Id><Topic><Title>I thought this was a AT&amp;T stock message board</Title><Username>kmoa_tv24_new1st</Username><Timestamp>1252756736000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2009-09-12 07:58:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Retiree's get good money when they leave.
