Well! Well!...our ‘dear leader’ is consistent in his support of the Muslim Brotherhood…” And so, the frog boy continues to blather nonsense about the President with more attempts to discredit him by editing the stories he reads. Hey, gremlin…is there a reason you left this part of that story out?… “President Barack Obama ‘condemned the ongoing violence across Egypt and expressed concern over the continued political polarization,’ according to a statement issued yesterday by the White House. ‘He reiterated that the United States is not aligned with, and does not support any particular Egyptian political party or group.’ Secretary of State John Kerry said in a separate statement yesterday that ‘we firmly reject the unfounded and false claims by some in Egypt that the United States supports the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood or any specific Egyptian political party or movement’.” What part of that statement don’t you understand, froggie? You are an intentional liar fooling absolutely no one. You pathetic people are so obviously desperate that you can do nothing but lie to people. How sad. Nice life you lead. In your heart you know you really need to be more honest with people, Gremlin.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1373202719858</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-07 09:11:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373207272645-2</Id><Topic><Title>What have we learned today from our MSM?</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1372450034388</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-28 16:07:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Just curious, why do they only shows photos of Martin when he was 12 years old instead of the thug he presently was?</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1373207272645</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-07 10:27:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>12</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373208808631-3</Id><Topic><Title>What have we learned today from our MSM?</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1372450034388</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-28 16:07:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Which kids?

It makes no difference what the pictures show, or how he is portrayed good or bad, he isn't the one on trial for murder. The only thug of the two is zimmerman. Tugs carry concealed loaded weapons, not candy.

Point 1 - Bacrac spoke "public U,S. sentiment", not sentiment of his own, because the world tide is against him for the Brotherhood. Same as in Chicago when he always voted "present" so as not to publicly disclose his 'left-wing liberal' leanings/learnings !! Point 2 - I do believe the Nobel Awards panel now realizes they made a "gosh awful mistake" by awarding him (prematurely) with the A Nobel Peace Prize ... based on those campaign "words" .. the words that he fooled America (and the World) with ... just like Morsi !! Lets go for that 3rd. point now - From your 'John Kerry quote' - he is (again) distancing Obama from another Obama 'lie' - just another quick-shot of teflon to keep his (Obama's) own dung from clinging to him !! In your (empty) heart, you know where you keep your 'nose' parked !! ..

Not referring to any specific religion, or lack thereof of course, it is indeed very beautiful to hear on a quiet evening. If Obama did actually say that in 2008, how true, as always he is. Of course you only think it means he is a Muslim, which is completely a distortion of what he was saying. Besides, even though Obama is a Christian, and a fine example of one, being Muslim is allowed in America, says so in the Constitution. I thought the tea party was for the Constitution.</Msg><Username>peppeek</Username><Timestamp>1373217031350</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-07 13:10:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373220294475-8</Id><Topic><Title>What have we learned today from our MSM?</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1372450034388</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-28 16:07:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>President Obama was referring to his role as a father, what it must feel like to lose a child, nothing more. It was honest, heart felt, empathy, something you seem to lack. You can make up further stories about Obama, it isn't changing the truth. Martin was 5'11", 3 " higher than Z, and lighter in weight. Hardly a large man, just an average adolescent, thin, boy. If it were your son lying face down dead in the grass with a guy walking around with barely any injuries, insignificant ones, you would be talking different.</Msg><Username>peppeek</Username><Timestamp>1373220294475</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-07 14:04:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373224291125-9</Id><Topic><Title>What have we learned today from our MSM?</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1372450034388</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-28 16:07:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Naaa peekapoo ... Obama's role as a father (ya gotta be kidding) .. he was playing to his ethnic racist base .. J. Jackson Sr. Al Sharpton .. Black Panthers and every other "racist group" that popped out from the woodwork !! Also your (public education) MATH is a little off .. Tray was 5' 11" - Zimm was 5' 7" .. that would be .. '4 inches taller' than Zimmerman . As most of us that may have had a 16/17 Y/O son .. some will start testing their "testosterone" at about that age !! Also Zimm's voter I.D. card stated his race as "Hispanic", and a Registered Democrat. So it appears he doesn't quite seem to fit the "creepy #$%$ cracker" profile that you guys are reporting !! OH ... and the weight diff. between the two = (oh heck ??) I think it was reported Zimm was 185 and Tray was 160 ... (I was trying to find a "no-spin" article) One page said (a) Travon Martin was 6' 3" .. but in the name of impartiality &amp; fairness I opted for a further search ..

Z's story is as bogus as his try to lie to the court about bail. No, Obama was talking as a father, you think so or not. Obama has not a racist bone in his body, nor a mean one. He is as impartial to race as a man could be, and his actions prove it. Racism isn't noticing a difference, it is degrading the person as inferior. That's why the phrase Martin's only crime was "walking while Black" is so true. Calling someone a white a.. cracker is like calling them a sob. No one is putting down the white man as inferior, or following a white 17 year old child saying he is up to no good because he is white. McVeigh, Lanza and many others, don't see you calling out all the white kids as crazies. You know each white kid is different. It's that way for others too. It's a shame how you think about Obama, really. Martin too.</Msg><Username>peppeek</Username><Timestamp>1373233744145</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-07 17:49:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373237045655-13</Id><Topic><Title>What have we learned today from our MSM?</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1372450034388</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-28 16:07:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sorry peekapoo .. cite where you get your facts - Martin still had a 4 inch advantage over Zimm - unless you're using Obama Math - because 5'11" minus 5' 7" = 4 inches - FACT You and Obama may have the same problem .. neither of you would know the truth if it were tattooed on your foreheads !!
