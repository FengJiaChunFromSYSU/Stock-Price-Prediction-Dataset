Is that because Chicago's stringent gun control measures are working so well?!!! Today, Chicago is the a killing field of America. You would think he would find, assuming he can, a better place the preach the virtues of gun control. It is interesting to note that Chicago, and Illinois for that matter, have been run by Decmocrats since anyone can remember. They can't blame their mess on Republicans.

You must promise never to look in it." In all their 30 years of marriage, Hillary never looked. On the afternoon of their 30th anniversary, curiosity got the best of her and she lifted the lid and peeked inside. In the box were 3 empty beer cans and $81,874.25 in cash. She closed the box and put it back under the bed. Now that she knew what was in the box, she was doubly curious as to why there even was such a box with such contents. That evening, they were out for a special anniversary dinner. After dinner, Hillary could no longer contain her curiosity and she confessed, saying, "I am so sorry, Bill. For all these years, I kept my promise and never looked into the box under our bed. However, today the temptation was too much and I gave in. But now I need to know, why do you keep the 3 beer cans in the box?" Bill thought for a while and said, "I guess after all these years you deserve to know the truth. Whenever I was unfaithful to you, I put an empty beer can in the box under the bed to remind myself not to do it again." Hillary was shocked, but said, "Hmmm, Jennifer, Paula and Monica. I am very disappointed and saddened by your behavior. However, since you are addicted to sex I guess it does happen and I guess 3 times is not that bad considering your problem." Bill thanked her for being so understanding. They hugged and made their peace. A little while later Hillary asked Bill, "So why do you have all that money in the box?" Bill answered: "Well, whenever the box filled up with empty cans, I took them to the recycling center and redeemed them for cash."</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1361022231222</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-16 08:43:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361024556323-17</Id><Topic><Title>Busted</Title><Username>t.bfine</Username><Timestamp>1361016149006</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-16 07:02:29 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>... “Today, Chicago is the a (sic) killing field of America…It is interesting to note that Chicago, and Illinois for that matter, have been run by Democrats since anyone can remember.

Do you people ever attempt to actually do any research about anything you say? If you need to try to make a political point that all murderers are motivated by political affiliation, so be it.

Let's agree to put violators away for a very, very long time. That may be one of the few remedies that might work simply because we will be taking the clowns off the street. My guess is the Left won't like that. It's too harsh, don't ya know. Better yet, let's treat them like we do here in Texas because if they murder someone like Hadiya here in cold blood, there is a good chance it will be their last murder. Get my meaning?

I am also facinated by the inability of the National media (i.e., ABC, CBS, NBC,, CNN, etc.) to report any news regarding this city's inability to govern and control crime. Remember last month Chicago had the equivalent of two Sandy Hook shooting events whithin the city limits. What did we hear from the National media? crickets How many news conferences has our "dear leader" given where the National media has asked about what his recommendations are for reducing murders in the city of his home. I know you like truth and facts, I do too, but I also like to investigate and point out hypocricy when I find it, because we all know that if the National media finds news that places our "dear leader" in a less than positive light, then the media will spike the story, or pretend that the events never occurred. Can you imagine if the home city of George W. Bush had the reputation that Chicago has? The drum beat for off with his head would be deafening." Well you could have knocked me over with a feather when I read the following: "Speaking in Chicago Friday, President Barack Obama pointed out the high number of murders in that city last year included 65 persons under the age of 18, which is "the equivalent of a Newtown every four months." Remember the problems our little friends had with the word "equivalent". I wonder if now they will magically find that this word is the most appropriate use of the King's english.

Our Mayor, (sometimes referred to as the dumbest Mayor in America), Stephanie Rawling Blake, says she is speechless after shooting. She is also clueless. This un-named Instructor pulled his serivce weapon, in the heat of the moment, during training, and shot the Officer in the forehead, at point blank range. The 40 year old, new to Police work, is in serious condition. No live weapons were to be used in the exercise. Many common sense rules were violated. A previous class, also said he had pointed a loaded gun at them? Will this guy be promoted to Police Chief? Or possibly take Eric Holder's job should he step down.</Msg><Username>robfisk</Username><Timestamp>1361065864211</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-16 20:51:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361071610458-29</Id><Topic><Title>Baltimore City Police Academy Shut Down</Title><Username>robfisk</Username><Timestamp>1361065864211</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-16 20:51:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Another useless comment from jon2retard aka robfisk.</Msg><Username>lv66vette</Username><Timestamp>1361071610458</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-16 22:26:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
