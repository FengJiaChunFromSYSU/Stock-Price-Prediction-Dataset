My guess it is a result of purchases for the purpose of getting the dividend and then selling until the next dividend. Looking at the chart for the past year: http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=T#symbol=t;range=1y;compare=;indicator=dividend+bollinger+sma%28200%29+ema+volume+stochasticslow+rsi;charttype=candlestick;crosshair=on;ohlcvalues=1;logscale=off;source=undefined; note that there is a slight run up before each dividend and then a turn down after the dividend date. Yesterday I sold 34.5 calls for 98 cents and today I can buy them back for 15 cents but no need to do so because they will probably expire worthless on Friday (they are weekly options). It isn't all profit because I have to pay $.45 cents per share to cover the dividend, but 50 cents a share profit ain't bad for such a low risk investment that I didn't put any money into.</Msg><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1357662643665</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 11:30:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357663127559-11</Id><Topic><Title>45 cent dividend; 65 cent drop</Title><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1357662643665</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 11:30:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>can this hit 35 by this friday</Msg><Username>babar_reh</Username><Timestamp>1357663127559</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 11:38:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357663152900-12</Id><Topic><Title>AT&amp;T Dividend &amp; Stock Price</Title><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1357315022309</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 10:57:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Dividends paid in cash do not reduce the cost basis.</Msg><Username>candirectly</Username><Timestamp>1357663152900</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 11:39:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357664118553-13</Id><Topic><Title>AT&amp;T Dividend &amp; Stock Price</Title><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1357315022309</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 10:57:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>will it hit 35 by friday.. i dont y i bought the calls this morning.. just being greedy</Msg><Username>babar_reh</Username><Timestamp>1357664118553</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 11:55:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357665204209-14</Id><Topic><Title>45 cent dividend; 65 cent drop</Title><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1357662643665</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 11:30:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It could and I would have to buy my options back and make no profit.

I don't post often, but I did respond to your comments about the Bollinger Band. I wrote about remembering him from the 80's as a part-timer on the old FNN Network with Griffeth and Herrera. Maybe you read it, maybe not. I find things like Bollinger's Band's, Elliot's Wave's McClellan Oscillator's, et al interesting. I'm sure they all translate to something meaningful. I like your little strategy, but it needs a catchy title like Wilke's Dividend Phenomenon. You can market it with a monthly newsletter. If those other guys can market their names to a means of potentially making money, why not you? Anyway, thanx for the info. Sounds like you know what you're doing.

"Not I," said the cow. "Not I," said the duck. "Not I," said the pig. "Not I," said the goose. "Then I will do it by myself." She planted her crop and the wheat grew and ripened. "Who will help me reap my wheat?" asked the little red hen. "Not I," said the duck. "Out of my classification," said the pig. "I'd lose my seniority," said the cow. "I'd lose my unemployment compensation," said the goose. "Then I will do it by myself," said the little red hen, and so she did. "Who will help me bake the bread?" asked the little red hen. "That would be overtime for me," said the cow. "I'd lose my welfare benefits," said the duck. "I'm a dropout and never learned how," said the pig. "If I'm to be the only helper, that's discrimination," said the goose. "Then I will do it by myself," said the little red hen. She baked five loaves and held them up for all of her neighbors to see. They wanted some and, in fact, demanded a share but the little red hen said, "No, I shall eat all five loaves." "Excess profits!" cried the cow.. (Nancy Pelosi) "Capitalist leech!" screamed the duck. (Barbara Boxer) "I demand equal rights!" yelled the goose. (Jesse Jackson) The pig just grunted in disdain.. (Harry Reid) And they all painted 'Unfair!' picket signs and marched around and around the little red hen, shouting obscenities. When the farmer (Obama) came he said to the little red hen, "You must not be so greedy." "But I earned the bread," said the little red hen. "Exactly," said Barack the farmer. "That is what makes our free enterprise system so wonderful. Anyone in the barnyard can earn as much as he wants. But under our modern government regulations, the productive workers must divide the fruits of their labor with those who are lazy and idle." And they all lived happily ever after, including the little red hen, who smiled and clucked, "I am grateful, for now I truly understand." But her neighbors became quite disappointed in her. She never again baked bread because she joined the 'party' and got her bread free. And all the Democrats smiled. 'Fairness' had been established. Individual initiative had died but nobody noticed; perhaps no one cared so long as there was free bread that 'the rich' were paying for. And perhaps....this is the end................... And the next week, there was no bread, or anything else to eat. So, they all starved equally. EPILOGUE Bill Clinton is getting $12 million for his memoirs. Hillary got $8 million for hers.

Many computer programs use that as a sell signal. So far this year trading has been above the 200 dma until today when it dropped below $34.79 (current 200 DMA). The 50 DMA is at $34.12 and we may drop below that tomorrow.</Msg><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1357688866819</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 18:47:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357697709964-34</Id><Topic><Title>A Georgia mom hides her kids and shoots an intruder 5 times</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1357517052024</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-06 19:04:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Skittles, they should be banned.
