I haven't paid any particular attention to your hundreds of posts over the last couple of weeks, nor will I, but from a random sampling you don't seem to be suggesting any practical alternatives. You are apparently someone with too much time on its hands that enjoys nattering and trying to get attention. Well, you have walked into a room of experts in that field! So, can I ask what exactly the purpose of your posts is? If you post to tell the very, very limited audience of ATT owners who are the uneducated, retired teabaggers incessantly posting their absurd political views on this board that they are idiots, you have my full support - but not because they own ATT. If you think you are trying to manipulate the stock price, you are even more profoundly stupid than the retired teabaggers on this board who happen to have a few shares of ATT. And to be more stupid than those folks, my friend, takes some serious doing. Realistically, if everyone who posts on this board sold, it would be about as noticeable as a mosquito's fart from a half mile away.

Flat tax is assessed on income at the same rate for all. The cash register has nothing to do with it. It has nothing to do with how many jets you buy. The problem with the flat tax is that it still requires everyone to file an income tax return. The Fair Tax does away with the expense of the IRS and piggybacks the collection of tax on the sales tax system that most states already have.</Msg><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1371825248165</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-21 10:34:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371826132162-7</Id><Topic><Title>Oh well - just think of all the extra</Title><Username>ossobucco20l2</Username><Timestamp>1371652678760</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 10:37:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>WOW!!!

I pay $32 per month for my "landline" phone and I get unlimited calling 24/7. Please tell me about a cell service that offers that kind of service for that price and I'll dump my "landline." And who's fault is it that you do not receive or make calls on your "landline?" Is it also ATT's fault that you're an idiot as well? "Now, I hear that ATT has so much money they want to buy the Spanish phone company." I thought you said that ATT doesn't have enough money to operate. "Question: If ATT loses money operating the Spanish phone company, will they raise my rates to pay for those losses?" ATT has maintained or increased its dividend for the past 25+ years. They're no where close to losing money even if they do decide to invest in a "Spanish" phone company.

Keep it up. I was just funning you. AT&amp;T has been around in one form or another since 1875 when the telephone was invented. It was "Western Electric" at that time. Alex Bell made a crude talking machine when he was in high school in Scotland. Encouraged by his father to do so. The telephone was an accidental result of Bell's effort to transmit multiple messages over telegraph wires simultaneously. His understudy, Watson, probably had much more to do with it than he is given credit for but it was Bell's genius.</Msg><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1371829633356</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-21 11:47:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371830381630-16</Id><Topic><Title>Why i hate ATT?</Title><Username>no_need_no_stinkin_badges</Username><Timestamp>1371671779857</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 15:56:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Switch to Verizon.

The end of May report shows a lot had been covered, but there were still 74 million shares short, could have been some covering involved, at any rate it was a nice trade for someone. Short traders also know there will come a time when even in a time of rising interest rates, some stocks will be protected at the right percentage of yield. This one bumped along in 2009 and 2010 paying 6%, at around $25 per share. $30 per shares achieves 6% this time, so time will tell I suppose. Not saying it holds $30, just putting out the history of what has happened in the past.</Msg><Username>catch83sails</Username><Timestamp>1371862159934</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-21 20:49:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
