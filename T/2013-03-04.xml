No, I do not know that wilkes. Federal spending will continue to grow, mainly to finance Medicare, Social Security and other old age benefits. What we are trying to figure out is how to pay for the boomer retirement. Will it be by cuts to those programs? By gutting everything else? By increasing taxes on boomers themselves (high income earners and retirees drawing down 401ks and pensions)? Or by increasing taxes on working people? Or some combination? This is a fight between the old and the young, and the old boomers are quickly losing the voting power they had previously. That is why they have resorted to the tactics we see from the Tea Brains.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1362417906536</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 12:25:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362417980343-38</Id><Topic><Title>T may well skyrocket tomorrow!

He won’t even stay in town to meet with the members of Congress for more than an hour and then asks them to approve his programs and offers no other solutions. The Republicans in the house have submitted three alternatives to sequester to the Senate for consideration and Harry won't allow them to come up for a vote; just like he won't allow a budget to come up for a vote. The Republicans say not to the same programs the Democrats bring forward because the new ideas are simply the old ideas restated. Obama approved sequester and now wants to change the game rules. He doesn't have the words compromise or negotiate in the vocabulary.

Increasing America's debt weakens us domestically and internationally. Leadership means that, 'the buck stops here.' Instead, Washington is shifting the burden of bad choices today onto the backs of our children and grandchildren. America has a debt problem and a failure of leadership.

I don't know what else to tell you. Go to the Office of Management and Budget page on the White House website and you'll find extensive information on his 2013 budget proposal. I'm sure reality isn't what you're interested in, but there it is. The budget process has been preempted by the crisis politics of the Tea Brains. Contrary to your statement, Republicans do not control Congress. They hold a slim majority in the House of Representatives, and that is all. Congress has not passed a budget. Normally, this would lead to some cooperation, in hopes of recapturing the center in American politics and possibly future electoral success. See Newt, 1990s. This House has passed empty political statements so hacks like you can make posts like this. But their goal continues to be obstruction. They should be working with the Senate to pass a budget--not passing their own political statements. See Newt, 1990s. But they have not done so. Because they're controlled by Grover Norquist and a bunch of stubborn old morons shouting about things they don't understand. Like budgeting.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1362431217302</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 16:06:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362431305977-74</Id><Topic><Title>Another funny from "Organizing For Action"</Title><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1362167016841</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 14:43:36 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>When you say "No one wants to cut spending 50%" you are ignoring the entire T-Party.

Because those people don't make up a significant part the Federal budget. They are largely a figment of your imagination. Even the programs you think you are referring to don't make up a significant part of the Federal budget, and they are not growing nearly as fast a old age benefits. You are simply not going to balance the budget on these programs. Despite what you've been told there is simply not that kind of money spent on these programs. Nevertheless, you are doing exactly what I described above. You want to cut those programs that benefit working and young people to pay for old age benefits, and to pay for tax cuts that generally favor retirees and people earning the highest incomes of their lives. If you want to cut those things, cut them to pay for payroll tax cuts or infrastructure spending. That I can talk about. But by no means should you expect working people and younger generations to see their futures gutted to pay for the mistakes of the past.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1362432230725</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 16:23:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362434177642-76</Id><Topic><Title>On the third day of sequester Obama gave to me:</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1362344262150</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-03 15:57:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Please stop referring to "the Federal budget".
