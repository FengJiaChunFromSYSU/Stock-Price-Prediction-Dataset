(While you’re at it, show us the loans to Chavez.) What newspapers are YOU now talking about? Win’s original point was that a liberal newspaper, The Washington Post, carried this article by Matt Patterson. That was the whole point of that fallacious email – that times are so bad for the President, that his own allies are turning on him. Not one word of that is true – and you know it. You can either apologize for being stupid and posting a bogus email, or you can continue to keep trying to lie your way out of it. Either way, you have no credibility, because as you have proven time and again, you have no integrity. How pathetic that you have nothing left but lies. “As the Washington Post ombudsman, Patrick Pexton represents readers who have concerns or complaints on topics including accuracy, fairness, ethics and the newsgathering process”... “The other (thing that bothers him) is a parcel of e-mails wondering if someone named Matt Patterson works at The Washington Post, and asking if he wrote an anti-Obama satirical screed for The Post that is making the rounds of the Internet. The answer is, no, he doesn’t and he didn’t. This is not the first time I’ve received a round of e-mails about some anti-Obama rant allegedly written by someone from The Post. The mysterious Matt Patterson might be the Matt Patterson who contributes to the Examiner newspaper here in D.C. and who works for the CONSERVATIVE Capital Research Center. His work has appeared in The Post, but not THIS work. (This particular) article starts with the old saw, ‘Historians will look back in awe at…’ In this case they’ll wonder if the election of Obama was ‘a baffling breed of mass hysteria akin perhaps to the witch craze of the Middle Ages.’ I always thought the witch craze was in Salem, Mass. Never mind.” How about it, jon? You said you could offer proof!

(Incidentally, there’s only one “t” in twit) Jon, why do you seem to take such great pleasure in embarrassing and making such a fool out of yourself? So much so, that you have nothing but lame responses, non-answers, goofy emoticons and third grade banter filled with misspelled lies. Some advice from the pros: When someone catches you telling what he/she knows is an untruth, it can be embarrassing as well as uncomfortable. It is in that moment that you (as the liar) should find the most appropriate way to deal with your misstep. So what do you do when your fib has been blatantly exposed for the world to see? Try some of this friendly advice: Fess up - Admit right away that you have lied. Even if the truth is plainly visible in ‘black and white,’ the person to whom you have fibbed will appreciate the acknowledgment. In fact, most people will be more offended because they feel that their intelligence has been insulted, if you continue on in your charade. Explain yourself - After you've been found out, the next best thing to do is offer a little explanation Apologize - The acknowledgment of a fib is certainly necessary. But expressing sincere regret for the attempt to fool someone is even better. DO NOT continue to lie - The worst thing you can do when your dishonesty has been discovered, is to continue lying. Getting to the root of the need to fib will help you to address any personal issues that you may be unaware of. And some personal advice, as well. Why don’t you seriously find some other line of work” Message board provocateur is not something you excel at. Find something that requires no thinking, spelling, punctuation, truth or intelligence. I understand that Todd Akin is looking for a new campaign manager. You’d fit right in.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1349195237002</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 12:27:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349196052728-15</Id><Title>Doctors overwhelmingly support Romney</Title><Msg>Doctors are highly motivated this year to have their voice heard, particularly after passage of the Affordable Care Act. No doubt, the health care law has stirred many passions in the medical community. Physicians say they want a President who will address their concerns about their ability to practice medicine. They want a leader who engages doctors in finding a solution to healthcare reform rather than Obamacare which was forced on Americans by the democrat party only with little input from medical professionals and which views healthcare delivery from a cost effective accoutant like prespective that destroys the doctor patient relationship and encourages inferior care to protect the bottom line. Doctors reported they were switching their votes from Obama in 2008 to Romney in 2012. Among the top reasons why physicians said they were switching their votes: • The Affordable Care Act drew the most responses. • Leadership style. • Lack of follow-through on campaign promises. • The economy/unemployment/not better off A new survey of physicians shows that if the Presidential election were held today, 55 percent would vote for Mitt Romney and 36 percent would support President Obama, according to a survey conducted byJackson &amp; Coker, a division of Jackson Healthcare, the third largest healthcare staffing company in the US. The late September survey included 3,660 doctors nationwide in 50 states. Doctors more likely to support President Obama were addiction medicine physicians.</Msg><Username>ricky1820l</Username><Timestamp>1349196052728</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 12:40:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349196868630-16</Id><Topic><Title>Washington Post article - another email sham...</Title><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1349180003352</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 08:13:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The fact remains that the contents of the article are worth reading.

In a letter to Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, Chairman Darrell Issa and Rep. Jason Chaffetz said their information came from "individuals with direct knowledge of events in Libya." Referring to the Sept. 11 attacks, the letter said, "It was clearly never, as administration officials once insisted, the result of a popular protest." The committee letter listed a dozen incidents prior to Sept. 11 that Issa and Chaffetz said were indications of deteriorating security. The incidents included: —Just weeks before the attacks, the unarmed Libyan guards at the consulate, employed by British contractor Blue Mountain Group, were warned by family members to quit their jobs because there were rumors of an impending attack. —In April, a gun battle erupted about two miles from the consulate between an unidentified armed group and forces loyal to the transitional government. Also in April, two Libyans fired from a contractor providing security at the consulate threw a small explosive device over the consulate fence. There were no casualties. —In June, a posting on a Facebook page mentioned Stevens' early morning runs around Tripoli along with members of his security detail. The page contained a threat against Stevens and a stock photo of him. Stevens stopped the runs for about a week, but then resumed. —Also in June, assailants placed an explosive device on a gate of the U.S. consulate, which blew a hole in the security perimeter. That month, there was a daylight attack on a two-car convoy carrying the British ambassador to Libya. The State Department has declined to answer questions about whether extra security was sought by officials in Benghazi ahead of the Sept. 11 attack.</Msg><Username>ricky1820l</Username><Timestamp>1349197300876</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 13:01:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349197572551-19</Id><Topic><Title>Obama admin denied requests for more Benghazi consulate security</Title><Username>ricky1820l</Username><Timestamp>1349197300876</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 13:01:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I am sure that beforehand, Obama had no direct knowledge of these requests.

It was passed by democrats in Congress, signed into law by President Barack Obama, and now ruled constitutional by the Supreme Court. That means ObamaCare — or the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as it's officially known — is a reality you're stuck with, even if you never wanted it in the first place. ObamaCare will affect every American, yet few Americans understand what these 2,700 pages of legal mumbo-jumbo mean. How will ObamaCare really affect your life, your wallet, and your health? Robbing Peter to Pay Paul ObamaCare essentially 'robs Peter to pay Paul'. How? Well, if you're a senior, you'll be fleeced by the $716 billion in Medicare cuts designed to substantially fund the ObamaCare plan over the next decade. As you'll read in the ObamaCare Survival Guide, the biggest Medicare spending cuts will come in two key areas you need to know about in order to protect yourself. Insurance Companies Free to Pass On Increased Costs Under the new ObamaCare mandates, insurance companies will have free rein to pass on their increased costs to you in the form of: Higher premiums Higher co-pays Higher deductibles There are no specific price controls to keep the insurance industry in check. Even AARP, the powerful lobby representing American seniors, has already increased the health insurance premiums of its employees from 8 to 13%. Widespread Doctor Shortage Expected While many Americans are unhappy with ObamaCare, doctors have been particularly angry. The earning potential of doctors is expected to dwindle due to lowered payment rates for Medicare, among other things. Up to 40% of physicians could retire or seek a non-clinical or even a non-medical job. And with 30 million more Americans on healthcare insurance plans, not only could there be a medical 'brain drain', but also long drives and long waits to see a doctor. Delayed Implementation and Hundreds of Unwritten Rules Shockingly, many of the rules and regulations needed to make the new healthcare system function correctly haven't even been written yet. And as costs inevitably balloon higher than expected, benefits for consumers are likely to degrade significantly, particularly for seniors, the highest users of healthcare services. Unelected Government Officials Will Have Total Control to Make Decisions about Your Healthcare "Healthcare commissars" who don't have to worry about being elected by the American people will have undemocratic, totalitarian powers to cut Medicare spending and make decisions on your behalf as a so-called Independent Payment Advisory Board. And this is just the tip of the iceberg . . .</Msg><Username>ricky1820l</Username><Timestamp>1349197844556</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 13:10:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349198433438-21</Id><Topic><Title>Obama admin denied requests for more Benghazi consulate security</Title><Username>ricky1820l</Username><Timestamp>1349197300876</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 13:01:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama is directly responsible.

Or, you could just watch D’ Souza’s ridiculous movie, 2016, based on another of his hate books, which they developed because most of the people that believe this birther nonsense, can’t actually read a book. About the movie, The Washington Post said, “Fear mongering of the worst kind…” Imagine that, winny, something real from the Post. According to winholder (who doesn’t know why he posted a bogus email this morning, but rather than accepting responsibility and apologize, can only respond with multiple aliases suggesting the whole premise of his lame story doesn’t matter) the book “provide(s) an excellent analysis of why Muslims dislike America, particularly liberal attitudes that frighten them beyond belief.” Really, win? So you’re suggesting that the Muslims who dislike America are afraid of the Liberals? Interesting! So, apparently they like conservative philosophies that treat women as second class citizens, claim that their religion is the only “right” one, stifle free thinking, promote intolerance, discourage education, spread malicious propaganda and are willing to start wars and attack anyone who doesn’t agree with them? Well, I’ll be…sounds pretty much like most of what you preach. Is there a comparable group over there…The Maghreb Tea Party, perhaps? It’s really a shame you two groups couldn’t just fight this out on your own in some desolate wasteland and let intelligent people peacefully co-exist. Everything that you represent is a precise metaphor for what this coming election is all about, and why you are in such dire straits. Using tactics like Nixon’s Committee to Re-elect the President (CREEP – an apt name for you both) shows why this country wants the change that is happening…the one that frightens you so much.

'The most eye-opening civics lesson I ever had was while teaching 3rd grade. The last Presidential election was heating up and some of the children showed an interest. I decided we would have an election for a class president. We would choose our nominees. They would make a campaign speech and the class would vote. To simplify the process, candidates were nominated by other class members. We discussed what kinds of characteristics these students should have. We got many nominations and from those, Jamie and Olivia were picked to run for the top spot. The class had done a great job in their selections. Both candidates were good kids. I thought Jamie might have an advantage because he got lots of parental support. I had never seen Olivia's mother. The day arrived when they were to make their speeches. Jamie went first. He had specific ideas about how to make our class a better place. He ended by promising to do his very best. Everyone applauded and he sat down. Now it was Olivia's turn to speak. Her speech was concise. She said, "If you will vote for me, I will give you ice cream." She sat down. The class went wild. "Yes! Yes! We want ice cream." She surely would say more. She did not have to. A discussion followed. How did she plan to pay for the ice cream? She wasn't sure. But no one pursued that question. They took her at her word. Would her parents buy it or would the class pay for it...She didn't know. The class really didn't care. All they were thinking about was ice cream... Jamie was forgotten. Olivia won by a landslide. Every time Barack Obama opened his mouth he offered ice cream and 51.4 % of the people reacted like nine year old's. They want ice cream. The other 48.6% percent know they're going to have to feed the cow and clean up the mess." This is the ice cream Obama promised us! Remember, the government cannot give anything to anyone that they have not first taken away from someone else. Did you vote for the ice cream? THAT MY FRIEND, IS HOW OBAMA GOT ELECTED...
