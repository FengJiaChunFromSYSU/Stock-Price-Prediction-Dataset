The cuts are directed at discretionary spending. The bulk of the budget--payments from Medicare, Social Security &amp; interest on the debt--are excluded from the cuts. That means the 2.3% cuts will go directly to the activities of government--the FAA, border patrol, head start, civilian defense workers. Year over year discretionary spending is down, even as the overall spending is up due to Medicare, Social Security, and interest on the debt. So their effect on Federal jobs and work hours is much higher than the 2.3% suggests. The Bipartisan Policy Center estimates that the sequester will result in 1 million fewer jobs in 2013 than otherwise--plus the furloughs, reduction in work hours, etc. These aren't all Federal jobs, as the effects of lower pay and fewer workers will ripple through the economy. Many economists consider these estimates baseline estimates. The results could be worse if the cuts lead to service problems as well, which is likely. These policies--the payroll tax increase, the sequester and the continued fiscal uncertainty--are insane in the middle of a lackluster, jobless recovery. Whoever you think is responsible for them, it is insane policy-wise.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1362151893075</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 10:31:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362152128229-15</Id><Topic><Title>Will the American people care when they find out the truth about sequestration?</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1361930514108</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 21:01:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Another racist.

Maybe we should think about buying some "Happy Sequester Day Poles" for the newly unemployed who lost their jobs. Then in celebration the democrats among them could gather around the "Happy Sequester Day Poles", light candles, and have the "Airing of Grievances" about Republicans and of course George Bush. After that, everyone could sit down for the traditional "Happy Sequester Day Dinner" where a union boss will pray for our "dear leader" and for all Republicans to get food poisoning. And finally after the "Happy Sequester Day Dinner", where the Republicans were forced to eat the traditional "Fetid Food for Republicans", there would be the "Happy Sequester Day Feats of Strength" where the democrats would berate and chastise the sick Republicans for being Republicans and for eating the "Fetid Food for Republicans". All in all, I think this kind of celebration could really catch on with all of those people who have lost their jobs, and are forced to live on food stamps because the Republicans didn't realize that the President and his party were only kidding when they came up with the idea of sequestration in the first place. I can see it now, with little Bob Woodward, barely able to stand under the "Happy Sequester Day Pole", while leaning on his crutch (because the Republicans kept him from getting proper medical care) and saying these words: "In your heart you know he is right."

When you make an offer, which they haven't, then refuse anything the other side suggests, it smacks heavily of evil planning to then say the other side won't compromise. A compromise means both side give a little to gain a lot. Obama and Harry won't budge on anything including performing their jobs. Obama didn't accept the offer to mitigate the spending cuts to places where Obama thought they were better accomplished because then any changes would have his name on them and he could be blamed for those decisions if they didn't work.

Add your name to the call for a balanced approach to the budget:" They are playing the Sequester thing for more than it is worth. "Organizing For Action" is Obama's propaganda e-mail. The last thing Obama wants is a balanced budget and the Republicans would vote for it in mass if it was presented to them. So here is Obama calling for a "balanced approach to the budget" when he has never had any kind of a budget; not even an unbalanced one.</Msg><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1362167016841</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 14:43:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362167978160-32</Id><Topic><Title>Top Analyst UPGRADES AT&amp;T</Title><Username>whitlockjohn510</Username><Timestamp>1361876686315</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 06:04:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I subscribed</Msg><Username>manuel.tiedeman</Username><Timestamp>1362167978160</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 14:59:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362168294247-33</Id><Topic><Title>Another funny from "Organizing For Action"</Title><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1362167016841</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 14:43:36 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obummer's (aka Obozo's) Accomplishments 1. All-time record annual average gas price: In 2012, the average cost of a gallon of gas eclipsed previous record by nine cents, bringing the annual average to $3.60. 2. All-time record food stamp participation: As of [November 2012], for the first time in American history, 47,710,324 individuals, about one out of seven people living in United States-now receive food stamps. 3. All-time high youth unemployment: In the last four years, average youth unemployment eclipsed the previous record rising to 17.5%-the highest ever in recorded U.S. history. 4. All-time high number of Americans no longer in the labor force: Never before in U.S. history have so many been sidelined from the workforce. Today, a record 88,921,000 Americans are no longer a part of the U.S. labor force. 8.5 million fewer jobs in the workforce than when he took over 5. All-time record number of Americans collecting disability: Medical advancements &amp; technological innovations have increased life expectancy and made workplaces safer. Still, the number of Americans collecting Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) has skyrocketed in the last four years. Currently, a record 8,827,795 individuals collect a disability check averaging $1,130.34 a month. 6.

Bravo, Obummer, bravo indeed! PS. The penalty for destroying an egg of the American eagle is $250,000 + time in jail. The government pays for you to destroy the egg of a human being with our tax money.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1362168294247</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 15:04:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>11</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362168487757-34</Id><Topic><Title>AT&amp;T Insiders SELLING?!
