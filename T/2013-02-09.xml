You know all the answers and that makes evidence irrelevant and arguments a waste of time. You tend to govern by assertion and attacks.” – Bill Clinton, 2006 Man did he nail Obama exactly or what!

Is it underlying cost of production, superior products, brand loyalty, extreme demand or all of the above? Bottom line is, Apple consistently pulls it off. To top it off, T and other carriers help pay for some of Apple's sales, marketing and advertising expense by promoting the iPhone. It sure is a great country if you are Apple.</Msg><Username>t.bfine</Username><Timestamp>1360422746927</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-09 10:12:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360424250694-6</Id><Topic><Title>Mr. Frogg and Mr. Rat have dinner</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1360350244047</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 14:04:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ah yes my dear friend Little Sir Echo, you are correct, around 51% of the voters did vote for the precious one, and his benign, utopian form of government through executive orders and government regulations.

If I had wanted to provide an example, I couldn't have done a better job than the one you provided within your post. You are truely an outstanding example of the 51%, and you should be proud. The one thing about old fools is that they have seen many things in their long lived lives, and I know you won't believe me, but there is nothing new about you or your comrades. Many of us have seen your type before, and know that your form of governance never works. But I do know that the kool aid is still fresh on your lips, and anything an old fool says is like spitting into the wind. So when all of the wheels finally fall off your collective wagons, I will always remember that you meant well. "In your heart you know he is right."
