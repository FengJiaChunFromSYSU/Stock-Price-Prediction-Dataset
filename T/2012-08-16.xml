I could safely say the same thing and I am a member in good standing of the 99%, not the 1% club that Romney belongs to. One handicap I have is that I don't have a horse I can write off, nor a cayman island account, nor a Switzerland account. Also interesting to note that Obama has been the best president for the stock market in our since most of us were born, a statistic you won't here from CNBC or Fox Business News. Democratic presidents in general have been better for markets than Republicans.

She got a warning, a heads up being a hospital employee. It becomes effective October 1. This will definitely destroy the finances of many elderly in their final days. Say your Mom is admitted to the hospital for congestive heart failure, gets better, and is released. The next time she is brought in for the same problem, medicare will not cover it. The reasoning is, you aren't doing enough to prevent reoccuring problems with your health. Therefore Obama punishes you. This will cause some seniors to just stay home and suffer silently, passing at home. More likely in pain. How does Barry, Nancy Pelosi, and the crafters of this legislation sleep at night.
