I can't speak for winholder or anyone else, but I think a spouse can be and has been called a lot worse than 'the wife'. And you know what, that doesn't mean we don't respect them or love them. You don't think they have names for us that you might not consider acceptable in your tilted world?

No, they just stated that it was unacceptable and if the Republicans won't move all the countries financial problems will be their fault. An excellent example of an open and honest, willing to negotiate administration. He won the election a immediately rammed home his health care plan, little of anything else including budgets, but he did accomplish that. Now he assumes that because he won, he can do the same with the tax laws, it is his way or the highway and we all just need to get the he&amp;&amp; out of the way. Sorry, but that’s not leadership, this is dictatorship.</Msg><Username>winholder</Username><Timestamp>1354647799266</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 14:03:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354648048278-8</Id><Topic><Title>Will The MEDIA Grow "Kahuna's" ??</Title><Username>jon3retired</Username><Timestamp>1354567946217</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 15:52:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That's because so many of the them are not working and getting extended UE benefits, food stamps, free cell phones, etc. They are paying little if any taxes and don't want to work for anything less than they previously were paid, if they have ever worked at all. It may not be 47%, but the percentage is too much higher than it should be or that we can afford.

The Republicans have come back with ANOTHER demand for closing loopholes and spending cuts, without actually naming the loopholes they want closed and the spending cuts they want. At some point, they have to name the loopholes and the spending they want cut. They have never done this, even when they were in control of Congress and the Presidency for six years.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1354653948172</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 15:45:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354654132577-12</Id><Topic><Title>Norquist Popular With Lib.

Reason? If they say that they will raise capital gains up to 30% on short termers after 2012, the market would crash. If they say that since they couldn't come to any agreement, and all the the Bush tax cuts expire, it shouldn't surprise anyone. The burden would be shared by all. These guys and gals need to "man up" and just say that they are holding us hostage, and apologize for a job not well done. You've got to be kidding me when they say that either side has our brst interest at heart.
