Displaying unity in a national security arena, even if you disagree with the action, is not necessarily a bad thing. That is the reason most Democrats give for authorizing action in Iraq, that and they did not expect Bush to use it. But when it comes to starting a war of choice, yes, they should have filibustered it and they share some blame for allowing the war to happen. That is one of the reasons I voted for Obama over Hilary in the primaries in 2008--Hilary voted for authorization. But if you think that means what Republicans did was ok, you're nuts, or what they're doing today around Benghazi is ok, you're also nuts. It was a Republican administration that decided to go to war and who lied to the American people about the reasons, and Republicans in general (including Issa) who supported those efforts and blocked Democratic efforts to expose the lies. It is sinful for people like Issa and winholder to now pretend Benghazi is some horror story. And yes, Bush made a liar out of Powell.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1368798064691</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 09:41:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368799760674-9</Id><Title>Even the stock charts are lying</Title><Msg>When the blue Stochastic (slow) crosses above the red Stochastic (fast) the stock price is suppose to move up.

THIS excellent President however, is a smart man, and looks at history. He thinks before acting. Already the rwnj's criticize him for syria and the red line. Let them go first. The red line is mainly a threat, but the rwnj, macho behind their gun culture, they want to fight. That's how they view winning. Nothing will change bad decisions from before. Thank God for President Obama, if McCain were in there wiith #$%$, we would already be in another war we can't afford. We can't even afford the vet costs of vietnam and all the others since then. I hope people don't forget about China's role in vietnam. We lost over 58,000.

Traditional Medicare Part A &amp; B premiums are set by law. Medicare Advantage plans are private plans that Seniors can opt into instead of traditional Medicare. They used to receive a subsidy of about 17% more than was spent per beneficiary in traditional Medicare--designed to subsidize the startup of these plans. The health care law removed these subsidies. Medicare Advantage was Republican idea--implemented in 1997--to add private insurance to the Medicare arena. Republicans tended to support the subsidies and oppose removing the subsidies in 2008. The decline in Medicare Advantage Premiums was accompanied by an increase in enrollments, providing evidence of the success of government regulated health insurance purchased on government regulated exchanges. This market-based system is an alternative to the single-payer system of traditional Medicare.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1368800262627</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 10:17:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368800323103-14</Id><Topic><Title>OH RICKY</Title><Username>ltcolhen</Username><Timestamp>1368719953703</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 11:59:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I am assuming that your father was a brave man.

The share statics about how many traffic accidents are alcohol related. What they don't share or do a comparison of the number of accidents related to cell phones, eating, trying to discipline rowdy kids, putting on makeup, etc. I personally have been driven into the median strip twice by women trying to apply their make up on the way to work. Neither of them even were aware of what they had done and moved on at their 70 mph pace. Limiting the alcohol level is great, but they need to work as hard on the other distractions. Statics also show that most accidents, at least locally attributed to alcohol are committed by serial drinkers, people that aren't anywhere near the .08 level, but typically two or three times that level and have had previous DIU tickets.
