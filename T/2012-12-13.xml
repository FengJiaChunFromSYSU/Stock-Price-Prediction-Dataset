Google it. Exactly the same. Then keep looking. It goes on. And really the only thing I can find out there about the national average is that 87% of eighth graders can't read at an acceptable level. Just for the sake of conversation, lets say I was your employer and I really wanted to cut your pay. You have been here a long time, and you know those yearly raises have added up. You and a bunch of your coworkers are approaching retirement and I have to fund that too. So I come up with a test to see if you know how to do your job. That has happened before....now just for kicks, what if the tests these kids are taking are made for failure? I would like to take the test....I would like you to take it. It might be an eye opening experience.</Msg><Username>otdr_wave</Username><Timestamp>1355377971263</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 00:52:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355378653448-5</Id><Title>Need a little help here</Title><Msg>I'm trying to figure out which 10 person service of sterling silver flatware to buy for my wife for Christmas.

That is all that needs to be said.” – winny, confirming once again, that he has absolutely no idea what he is talking about, while declaring in Orwellian fashion, “I have ruled…case closed.” What are “His” TV shows? Please enlighten us. You do know the difference between radio and television, do you not? While he’s been the subject of American Masters and HBO’s First Look, as well as being the voice of Walt Whitman in Glen Burns, “The Civil War” and other similar appearances, I know of no Garrison Keillor TV program, per se…Apparently you are confusing Garrison Keillor, someone you’ve never seen or heard, with your favorite, Max Baer, Jr. playing Jethro Bodine on The Beverly Hillbillies. Closing in on 40 years of brilliance (with a brief 2 year hiatus), A Prarie Home Companion is heard by 4 million listeners each week on more than 600 public radio stations, Syrius, and around the world on America One and Armed Forces Radio, as well as on The BBC, and in Australia. You, winholder, are heard by a total of about 12 people here, nine of them your own other aliases. He IS quite liberal and a genius. Your politics are the opposite and you are an ignorant doofus. Garrison Keillor introduced a new generation to an old radio format of comedy, satire, intellectual mystique, mixed with some of the best music anywhere, all the time relying on the listeners own imaginations to conjure up the visual images of their own liking, rather than the relentless browbeating thrown at them by television. The timing was exquisite, as he played to the broad base of down home sentimentality of the mid-west and south, while simultaneously capturing the interest of the pioneers of the bohemian hipster movement who were longing for simpler times. The music was, and still is, incredible with the house band (Guy’s All-Star Shoe Band – note; when the horn section is added, they’re the “shoe horns”) having some of the best talent anywhere, with big-names sitting in with them regularly. Garrison also showcases local musicians when the show takes to the road, as it often does. The writing is absolutely brilliant. He does his monologues with no script and hosts a live two-hour show, WEEKLY! Garrison Keillor is nothing short of genius. In your eyes, he’s only a liberal. How very sad it must be to be you. Then again, suggesting that nobody watched “his programs on TV” reveals your ignorance. I suggest that some Saturday evening at 6:00 (Eastern), pour yourself a beverage, get comfortable next to the fireplace and some great speakers for your local PBS station, or stream it. We do it regularly, and I recommend it to all. Winholder, it won’t kill you to tear yourself away from wrestling or Fox News for one night.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1355406419742</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 08:46:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355411148968-9</Id><Topic><Title>Garrison Keillor</Title><Username>lavendersin</Username><Timestamp>1355341410071</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-12 14:43:30 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That's some good stuff: "You, winholder, are heard by a total of about 12 people here, nine of them your own other aliases.

One of the "Chosen Ones". He also handled a talk show. He continually went on about how terrible "White Flight" was. I called him one day and asked which area he lived in. He said Rancho Santa Fe. I asked how many Blacks lived there. He wouldn't answer me. There were NONE at that time. In typical "liberal" two facedness he put down others that didn't want to live in a cesspool but he himself lived in a super rich gated community. Who are you an ardent supporter of? Good old Joe Stalin? or Mao? How about Fidel?</Msg><Username>lewcor</Username><Timestamp>1355412243611</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 10:24:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355414169801-11</Id><Topic><Title>Obama steps on his tounge again.</Title><Username>pinhighshot</Username><Timestamp>1355251416026</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 13:43:36 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Kenyan's "57 states".
