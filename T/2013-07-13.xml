She feels empowered no doubt but does she realize if her prediction comes true she will owe her and her hispanic pals` empowerment to some of the same old White men she seems to be sneering at? It was and is White men and women in government who have been handing this country over to colored immigrants. I doubt though the coloreds will thank them or even recognize those Whites for their efforts on their behalf after they take over. They will rewrite history and make themselves fearless warriors who defeated the evil White man(stupid evil White men and women). per csn news A panel was discussing the recent filibuster of an abortion bill by Texas State Senator Wendy Davis. Host Bonnie Erbé said, “I was shocked quite frankly by all the – speaking of Texans -- those hundreds if not thousands of Texans who were in the state capitol all up and down the stairs cheering her on. I didn’t think that there was that many Democrats left in Texas.” A panel was discussing the recent filibuster of an abortion bill by Texas State Senator Wendy Davis.

Ref: your quote "I didn't think there were that many Democrats left in Texas" !! I'd give odds those (your quote) "hundreds of thousands" were not all Texans ... perhaps having alot of help from the 'left-wing Traveling BUS Brigade' from other States as well. I thought that video footage was entirely too 'over the top', too spectacular and slanted .. making it rather suspicious !! It appeared to have a strong, well planned, TOP professional 'tactical' element to it ... more-so than her state level ability.</Msg><Username>echo.2l65</Username><Timestamp>1373725440115</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 10:24:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373732881832-4</Id><Topic><Title>Eleanor Holmes Norton sees the end for old White men in TX</Title><Username>lavendarsen</Username><Timestamp>1373693159849</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 01:25:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>All one has to do is look at Mexico and Zimbabwe to see what Mexican or Black rule produces. Interesting how Mexicans run from their own country and then try to turn this into a copy of it. Of course the real reason this government is allowing this is to put us into their three nation government and destroy this nation. Know what "Sedition" is? Zimbabwe is another example. Under Whites it fed it's own people and exported food to all of Africa. Robert "The Beast" Mugabe has turned it into a slave state that can't even feed it's own people. Yep, Whites have a lot of faults but all you have to do is look at the colored nations to realize that we are angels compared to the others. Blacks are free to migrate back to many African nations. Funny, there aren't any lines waiting for passports.</Msg><Username>lewcor</Username><Timestamp>1373732881832</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 12:28:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373735185755-5</Id><Topic><Title>Eleanor Holmes Norton sees the end for old White men in TX</Title><Username>lavendarsen</Username><Timestamp>1373693159849</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 01:25:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>the white man was so gung ho for freedom that he forgot about morality.....pre marital sex led to today 47 million people on food stamps most in single family households....abortion led to 52 million dead babies since 1973...gay marriage results not in yet but wont be good....we had a good 200 plus yr run....but its over</Msg><Username>sha1017906</Username><Timestamp>1373735185755</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 13:06:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373743748205-6</Id><Topic><Title>Eleanor Holmes Norton sees the end for old White men in TX</Title><Username>lavendarsen</Username><Timestamp>1373693159849</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 01:25:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>One BIG item overlooked!

And the folks who are paying for the free stuff want the free stuff to stop. And the folks who are getting the free stuff want even more free stuff on top of the free stuff they are already getting! Now... the people who are forcing the people who pay for the free stuff have told the people who are RECEIVING the free stuff that the people who are PAYING for the free stuff are being mean, prejudiced, and racist. So... the people who are GETTING the free stuff have been convinced they need to hate the people who are paying for the free stuff by the people who are forcing some people to pay for their free stuff and giving them the free stuff in the first place. We have let the free stuff giving go on for so long that there are now more people getting free stuff than paying for the free stuff.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1373744293966</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 15:38:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373744467963-8</Id><Topic><Title>AHQ (cont.)...</Title><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1373679060098</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 21:31:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>11 States now have More People on Welfare than they do Employed! Last month, the Senate Budget Committee reports that in fiscal year 2012, between food stamps, housing support, child care, Medicaid and other benefits, the average U.S. Household below the poverty line received $168.00 a day in government support. What's the problem with that much support? Well, the median household income in America is just over $50,000,which averages out to $137.13 a day. To put it another way, being on welfare now pays the equivalent of $30.00 an hour for a 40-hour week, while the average job pays $20.00 an hour.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1373744467963</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 15:41:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373762389644-9</Id><Topic><Title>Yikes!!!

Nobody is going to sell their best income builder short. Your 6 months late. We have a faster/better network then VZ now but Its (vz) shares are $15 higher. Normally its only $5 -$8 higher. The AT&amp;T problems are priced in so the stock will go up with earnings. We'll probably see that $39 by the 4th quarter results. Longs (like me) should be happy for every dividend that is @ 5% for as long as they accumulate. 4 years form now this stock is $69.</Msg><Username>neeljak</Username><Timestamp>1373762389644</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 20:39:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373764919789-10</Id><Topic><Title>Eleanor Holmes Norton sees the end for old White men in TX</Title><Username>lavendarsen</Username><Timestamp>1373693159849</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 01:25:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"the white man was so gung ho for freedom that he forgot about morality" In my part of the country 40 years ago, it was the black women that popularized unwed pregnancies; white women were ashamed if it happened to them.</Msg><Username>emil_chesibilski</Username><Timestamp>1373764919789</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 21:21:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373768992273-11</Id><Topic><Title>Eleanor Holmes Norton sees the end for old White men in TX</Title><Username>lavendarsen</Username><Timestamp>1373693159849</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 01:25:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks.

Thank you for being a community watch member. If kids today only respected authority, Travon would be alive today. The parents should teach their kids to respect those who volunteer to protect their fellow citizens. George should not have suffered as he did. This was a trumped up charge. God bless both families. And those women of the jury. You stepped up, even the Preident of the United States played the race card as Bill Clinton so rightly accused him of.
