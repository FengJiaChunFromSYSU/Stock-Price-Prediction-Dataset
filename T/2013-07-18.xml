The buyout offer was $15 per share when it was prev. trading @ about $ 7 per share before this announcement, and now trading at just over $17 per share. As of yesterday there was no unusual movement from the " T insiders" .. they still usually sell (dispose) shortly after the aquire it. I usually watch T and VZ comparing their movements .. as a holder of both,, having formally been one Company .. hence, their tough competion between the two. I am a 'long' and purchased for quality divy re-investments. Time will tell on T and (for sure) will be watched closely by all interested party's. But in the meantime the politics &amp; such are just fillers .. and helps the board from becomming too dull from spamming posters like bozzo (oops, that would be osso). If I have any further on T I'll post it .. so, back to you guys (JMHO)</Msg><Username>echo.2l65</Username><Timestamp>1374155751530</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 09:55:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374156296883-6</Id><Title>Wow, heard there is a massive promo coming to MISM</Title><Msg>MISM plans to recomplete lucrative oil well in the Catrunesti Field</Msg><Username>lukehicks798</Username><Timestamp>1374156296883</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 10:04:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374156483772-7</Id><Title>Verizon Getting Slammed On Earnings, T Next...GET OUT!</Title><Msg>It's going to get ugly!</Msg><Username>mooseonaplane</Username><Timestamp>1374156483772</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 10:08:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374158905424-8</Id><Title>Markets setting new records!!

Look around. More people unemployed than anytime in the last 40 years. More people on food stamps that EVER! Fewer jobs, at least jobs that pay above minimum wage and getting worse. You can have all the opinions you want, but the facts are that our economy is in the tank. This country is soon to follow because we can not only pay our bills, soon we won't be able to pay the interest on our borrowing. Our government has convinced itself it can spend its way to prosperity. Only fools believe that. What 'facts' do you have that refute that? Wait until Obama care in implemented, if it ever is. It is being delayed and delayed because the idiots that passed it can't figure out how to make it work.</Msg><Username>winholder</Username><Timestamp>1374172091134</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 14:28:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374175413338-14</Id><Title>The road to forty is feasible,but long.</Title><Msg>the road to forty is rocky but the road to fifty will be a breeze. join me in a circle of friends cheer them on and upward.</Msg><Username>capp013</Username><Timestamp>1374175413338</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 15:23:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374175555557-15</Id><Title>Let's Face It, AT&amp;T Stock Is Nothing But A Junk Bond.

He stood by his car to drink his cola and watched a couple of men working along the roadside. One man would dig a hole two or three feet deep and then move on. The other man came along behind him and filled in the hole. While one was digging a new hole, the other was 25 feet behind filling in the hole. The men worked right past the guy with the Coke and went on down the road. "I can't stand this," said the man tossing the can into a trash container and headed down the road toward the men. "Hold it, hold it," he said to the men. "Can you tell me what's going on here with all this digging and refilling?" "Well, we work for the government and we're just doing our job," one of the men said. "But one of you is digging a hole and the other fills it up. You're not accomplishing anything. Aren't you wasting the taxpayers' money?" "You don't understand, mister," one of the men said, leaning on his shovel and wiping his brow. "Normally there's three of us: Me, Elmer and Leroy. I dig the hole, Elmer sticks in the tree, and Leroy here puts the dirt back. You see with the government sequestering, they are not buying any more trees so Elmer's job's been cut ... so now it's just me an' Leroy.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1374184718818</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 17:58:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374189299801-24</Id><Title>AT&amp;T has billions of pension liabilities they cannot meet</Title><Msg>just like Detroit folks.
