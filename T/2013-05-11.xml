Evidence for what? What is the cover up? What is the accusation? The President himself spoke the next morning to address the nation on Benghazi. He called it acts of terror. He never said spontaneous demonstratin or video. He said what it was thought to be, no cover up, no hiding, just the truth. That is the fly in their ointment that spoils it. They try to say the 9/12 speech was about 9/11 because he mentioned it in the Benghazi 9/12 speech. He already gave a 9/11 speech the day before. So duhhh yeah he is giving another one for the h of it, duhhhhh, even though we were attacked during the night, duhhhhhh. What kind of ignorant fool would believe that story, right from faux news? So they run with it, overlookng the fly in their ointment. If they can't believe his birth, what can they believe. Then you can go back to GWB and compare his record on terror compared to Pres Obama.

Go search for rose garden speech, go to the transcript, and read it, which you obviously haven't done. You are a good example of what faux news preys on, people who believe, and don't verify.

Well, I suppose it's possible Susan Rice was out on 5 different networks four days after his Rose Garden speech calling him either a liar or horribly confused: "No acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation, alter that character, or eclipse the light of the values that we stand for."

I was saying it because you said acts of terror was hogwash, which you show it wasn't, it's what he said. What's your point everything looks fine with the statements, what's the problem? Someone, many, changed her talking points for TV, so what. There is nothing to theorize about. The Pres already said acts of terror. She said our current assessment based on what we have at present. There is nothing here. It was an act of terror, four killed, spontaneous or planned, flamed by cairo or not. An act of terror can't come from a spontaneous demonstration? It doesn't matter what it was called on a tv show, nothing changes because of that, and nothing is being covered up. They could call it bag ladies gone wild, who cares, it killed four Americans.
