And it should be, we are intentionally being pushed aside and eliminated in our own country…” Whites like you SHOULD be pushed aside. Fortunately, your numbers are restricted to a very small minority of our race, and while I’m ashamed and embarrassed that you claim to be of European heritage, so too did Klaus Barbie and Adolph Eichmann. Admitting that you should be marginalized into extinction is one of the ONLY accurate statements you’ve ever made here. The racial “awakening” that you claim, is simply a fear inspired by the lack of even a fundamental, basic education. Ignorance fuels insularity and parochialism, leading to a narrow-minded view of the world and loathing of all things disparate to your being. You and your kind are the last remnants of a bygone era of an unfortunately sad chapter of intolerance in American history. That you awkwardly remain devoted to being some kind of modern day Bull Connor symbol of bigotry is pathetic. Not to mention, that you’re flat out full of sh#t, to wit: Total U.S. population in 2010 = 308,745,538 = 100% White or European American - 223,553,265 = 72.4% Black or African American - 38,929,319 = 12.6% Hispanic or Latino - 50,477,594 = 16.4% (Totals have discrepancies due to rounding) “It is downright awful living in states like Florida (the same as it is in cities like Minneapolis/St Paul Mn) where you are outnumbered and overwhelmed by non Whites everywhere you go.” Simply more #$%$ from a frightened, old man, balanced precariously on the precipice. There is no factual basis for this comment, either: Florida population = 19,057,542 total White = 57.9 % Latino = 22.5 % Black = 16 % Minnesota population = 5,403,925 total White = 83.1% Latino = 4.7% Black = 5.2% Maybe you need to get out of the basement occasionally, lavender, out into the light. “Darkness was at first by darkness hidden.” – Hindu Creation Hymn</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1353072442464</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-16 08:27:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353073504501-9</Id><Topic><Title>Lunch experience today</Title><Username>bouch84</Username><Timestamp>1352747876350</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 14:17:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"you're still a "fruitcake" Thanks, I've been called worse.</Msg><Username>av8lover</Username><Timestamp>1353073504501</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-16 08:45:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353074468942-10</Id><Topic><Title>Lunch experience today</Title><Username>bouch84</Username><Timestamp>1352747876350</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 14:17:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And when they are lower than expected next week due to statistical noise or hiring due to clean up and Christmas, are you going to say Obama caused that?</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1353074468942</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-16 09:01:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353075040423-11</Id><Topic><Title>Lunch experience today</Title><Username>bouch84</Username><Timestamp>1352747876350</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 14:17:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm impressed Lavendar.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration provided struggling battery maker A123 Systems Inc with nearly $1 million on the day it filed for bankruptcy, the company told lawmakers investigating its government grant. The company, which makes lithium ion batteries for electric cars, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last month after a rescue deal with Chinese auto parts supplier Wanxiang Group fell apart. That same day, October 16, A123 received a $946,830 payment as part of its $249 million clean energy grant from the Energy Department, the company said in a letter, obtained by Reuters, to Republican Senators John Thune and Chuck Grassley. In the letter, dated November 14, A123 said the October payment was the most recent disbursement it had received from the government, with an additional $115.8 million still outstanding on the grant. Thune and Grassley have pressed the Energy Department for more details about its funding of A123 as the company has faltered. "The Department of Energy needs to answer for why it appears to put federal grants on auto-pilot to the detriment of U.S. taxpayers," Senators Thune and Grassley said in a statement. "This can't stand."</Msg><Username>winholder</Username><Timestamp>1353090403354</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-16 13:26:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353090408507-20</Id><Title>OPTIONS DEAD = BUY SIGNAL NOW FOR $45!!</Title><Msg>BUY LOW, SELL HIGH!!</Msg><Username>monett4</Username><Timestamp>1353090408507</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-16 13:26:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353090666635-21</Id><Topic><Title>OPTIONS DEAD = BUY SIGNAL NOW FOR $45!!</Title><Username>monett4</Username><Timestamp>1353090408507</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-16 13:26:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Dead?

However, that is the price you pay for progress and expermentation. I suggest you look at all the investments that were made that ended up successful and understand that the percentage of successes far outweigh the failures.</Msg><Username>ellerbebil2</Username><Timestamp>1353098868587</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-16 15:47:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353099906576-32</Id><Topic><Title>Lunch experience today</Title><Username>bouch84</Username><Timestamp>1352747876350</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 14:17:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Rage?

Hey, I know this is early, but I’m gonna’ chill out to “Lawrence of Arabia” on Turner, shortly. It’s a terrific history lesson for all you confused souls, and a true love story for others who have lived spiritual, tolerant, and sometimes meaningful, lives. “Now what I want is, Facts.” – Charles Dickens, “Hard Times’, opening line “...the evils of mankind are caused, not by the primary aggressiveness of individuals, but by their self-transcending identification with groups whose common denominator is low intelligence and high emotionality.” – Arthur Koestler “When asked, 'Dr. Einstein, why is it that when the mind of man has stretched so far as to discover the structure of the atom we have been unable to devise the political means to keep the atom from destroying us?, Einstein responded, ‘ That is simple, my friend. It is because politics is more difficult than physics’.” "Well, finally the long race is over and as usual a guy from Kenya won…Obama won last night, and for the Democrats that's great, so we'll just have to wait and see what happens in tonight's debate…It was a big night for the Democrats. Obama was on the electoral vote and the popular vote. Mitt Romney on the other side won the unpopular vote…Some Republicans are taking it hard. Clint Eastwood spent the entire day buying drinks for an empty bar stool…A victory like this is just the kind of thing that might sway the undecided voters.” – David Letterman “The great thing in the world is not so much where we stand, as in what direction we are moving.” – Oliver Wendell Holmes “There are many worlds and many systems of universes existing all at the same time, all of them perishable.” - Anaximander, 546 BC "They had a CBS exit poll last night. 100 percent of the people questioned in the exit poll said they were leaving." - David Letterman “The test of courage comes when we are in the minority. The test of tolerance comes when we are in the majority.” – Ralph W. Sockman “Twenty centuries of 'progress' have brought the average citizen a vote, a national anthem, a Ford, a bank account, and a high opinion of himself, but not the capacity to live in high density without befouling and denuding his environment, nor a conviction that such capacity, rather than such density, is the true test of whether he is civilized.” – Aldo Leopold, 1933 "Pot was legalized in Colorado and Washington. This calls, not just for a reexamination of the drug war, but an entire rerouting of my touring schedule.” – Bill Maher “Beware when the great God lets loose a thinker on this planet.” – Ralph Waldo Emerson “As to pay, Sir, I beg leave to assure the Congress that as no pecuniary consideration could have tempted me to accept this arduous employment at the expense of my domestic ease and happiness, I do not wish to make any profit from it.” – George Washington "There are now a record number of Latinos in Congress, which has a lot more Americans talking about immigration reform. Americans seem to be in favor of it, while immigrants are still on the fence." - Jimmy Fallon “It has become appallingly obvious that our technology has exceeded our humanity.” – Albert Einstein</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1353113447652</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-16 19:50:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353113461591-43</Id><Title>AHQ (cont.)...</Title><Msg>... “All political parties die at last of swallowing their own lies.” – John Arbuthnot “An evil gain equals a loss.” – Publilius Syrus “Nations have recently been led to borrow billions for war; no nation has ever borrowed largely for education... no nation is rich enough to pay for both war and civilization. We must make our choice; we cannot have both.” – Abraham Flexner, 1930 “David Petraeus was reportedly not well liked at the CIA where he worked. A tip to you fellows out there – don't cheat on your wife if you work with professional spies who don't like you.” – Conan O’Brien “Paradox with him was only truth standing on its head to attract attention.” – Earl Warren “Science has not yet taught us if madness is or is not the sublimity of intelligence.” – Edgar Allen Poe "Mitt Romney arrived at his victory celebration in a 15-car Secret Service caravan. Of course, when you lose, the Secret Service dumps you immediately. So he had to hitch a ride home with his son. So there he is arriving in the 15-car motorcade and then he goes home in the back seat…Tagg driving, Ann riding shotgun, dog on the roof." - Bill Maher “So long as all the increased wealth which modern progress brings, goes but to build up great fortunes, to increase luxury, and make sharper the contest between the House of Have and the House of Want, progress is not real and cannot be permanent.” – Henry George “Everyone's a pacifist between wars. It's like being a vegetarian between meals.” – Colman McCarthy "Donald Trump is not giving up. When it was announced that President Obama easily won the Electoral College, Trump demanded to see Obama's Electoral College records." - Jay Leno “Infinity is just time on an ego trip.” – Lily Tomlin “No science is immune to the infection of politics and the corruption of power. … The time has come to consider how we might bring about a separation, as complete as possible, between Science and Government in all countries. I call this the disestablishment of science, in the same sense in which the churches have been disestablished and have become independent of the state.” – Jacob Bronowski “According to poll data, President Obama’s victory on Tuesday was due largely to his popularity with both college students and the unemployed. So basically Obama became President the same way Budweiser became the King of Beers." – Seth Meyers “I hope that posterity will judge me kindly, not only as to the things which I have explained, but also to those which I have intentionally omitted so as to leave to others the pleasure of discovery." - Rene Descartes</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1353113461591</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-16 19:51:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353113472381-44</Id><Title>AHQ (3)...</Title><Msg>... “This is the sort of English up with which I will not put.” – Winston Churchill “A young boy is a theory, an old man is a fact.” –Ed Howe “We say we waste time, but that is impossible. We waste ourselves.” – Alice Bloch "Another big storm could hit the Northeast by Wednesday, preventing millions from visiting relatives for Thanksgiving. But there's also a downside." –Jimmy Fallon “Such an atmosphere is un-American, the most un-American thing we have to contend with today. It is the climate of a totalitarian country in which scientists are expected to change their theories to match changes in the police state's propaganda line.” – Harry S. Truman, rebuking The House Committee on Un-American Activities “Broken promises don’t upset me. I just think, why did they believe me? – Jack Handy "A woman is so angry with the election results that reportedly she got in her car and ran over her husband. She's so mad that Romney didn’t win she runs over her husband. It was Karl Rove's wife." –David Letterman “The quality of a man's mind can generally be judged by the size of his wastepaper basket.” – José Bergemin "There is danger in reckless change, but greater danger in blind conservatism." - Henry George “Obama won single women by 38 percent. I think the message to Republicans was clear: get off me…That just doesn't happen in campaigns. You'd think his slogan was 'Have you lost weight’?” - Bill Maher “Remember that there is nothing stable in human affairs; therefore avoid undue elation in prosperity, or undue depression in adversity.” - Socrates “All religions are cruel, all founded on blood; for all rest principally on the idea of sacrifice — that is, on the perpetual immolation of humanity to the insatiable vengeance of divinity.” – Mikhail Bakunin "The Rockefeller Center's Christmas tree is being put in place this afternoon. They bring it in and hoist it with a crane and steel cables. It's the same way they get Chris Christie into his pants.” – David Letterman “The suppression of uncomfortable ideas may be common in religion or in politics, but it is not the path to knowledge; it has no place in the endeavor of science.

All I know is he's in for one awkward Thanksgiving." –Craig Ferguson “I am a bear of very little brain, and long words bother me.” – Winnie the Pooh “The term clinical depression finds its way into too many conversations these days. One has a sense that a catastrophe has occurred in the psychic landscape.” – Leonard Cohen "There's a petition for Texas to secede. It has 25,000 signatures. The signatures are from every state but Texas.” – Conan O’Brien "We want the finest wines available to humanity, we want them here, and we want them now!" - Withnail “The whole (global warming) thing is created to destroy America's free enterprise system and our economic stability.” – The Reverend Jerry Falwell “Florida has finally finished counting the votes. What is wrong with Florida? Why is it so hard for the people down there to count votes? We're talking about a state where half the population can play 10 bingo cards at the same time.” – Jay Leno “I fear one day I'll meet God, he'll sneeze and I won't know what to say.” – Ronnie Shakes 'Unless,' said I (Socrates), either philosophers become kings in our states or those whom we now call our kings:. and rulers take to the pursuit of' philosophy seriously and adequately, and there is a conjunction of these two things, political power and philosophic intelligence, while the motley horde of the natures who at present pursue either apart from the other are compulsorily excluded, there can be no cessation of troubles, for our states, nor, I fancy for the human race either. Nor, until this happens, will this constitution which we have been expounding in theory ever be put into practice within the limits of possibility and see the light of the sun. “ – Plato "I really think in all of what happened yesterday, the only person who should be considered a 'loser' is Donald Trump. I'll tell you why. He went on Twitter demanding a revolution. So far no one's listened to him — because he's Donald Trump! After that, Trump tweeted, 'The world is laughing at us.' I'm thinking, No, Donald. The world is laughing at you and this is why. It is because you're wearing an orange face and a crazy wig. This is the uniform the world over of a clown! Nobody laughs WITH the clown. They laugh AT the clown. Then when the clown gets angry, it is funnier." - Craig Ferguson “You have your way. I have my way.
