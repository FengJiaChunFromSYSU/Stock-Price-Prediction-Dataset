Well here was a similar brutality in America - Knoxville, TN. These 'youths' has an assortment of weapons. It`s only too bad the 2 White kids didn`t have guns to defend themselves. Per wikipedia: Channon Gail Christian, 21, and Hugh Christopher Newsom, Jr., 23, were a couple from Knoxville, Tennessee. They were raped, tortured, and murdered after being kidnapped early on the morning of January 7, 2007. Christian's vehicle had been carjacked. Of the four charged at the state level, three (Letalvis D. Cobbins, Lemaricus Davidson, and George Thomas) had multiple prior felony convictions. According to the testimony of the Knox County Acting Medical Examiner Dr. Darinka Mileusnic-Polchan at the subsequent trial of Eric Boyd, Newsom was repeatedly sodomized with an object and then blindfolded, gagged, arms and feet bound and his head covered. Barefoot, he was dragged outside the house to a set of nearby railroad tracks. He was shot in the back of his head, neck and back and his body was then set on fire. According to the testimony of the medical examiner, Channon's death came after hours of torture, having suffered injuries to her vagina, #$%$ and mouth. She was raped with an unidentified object and beaten in the head. It was also reported that her body was scrubbed with bleach which was also poured down her throat, in an attempt by her attackers to remove DNA evidence, while Channon was still alive. She was then bound with curtains and strips of bedding, her face covered with a bin liner and her body stashed within five large bin bags, before being placed inside a residential waste disposal unit and covered with sheets. The medical examiner said there was evidence that Channon slowly suffocated to death.</Msg><Username>lavendarsen</Username><Timestamp>1369386805061</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-24 05:13:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369395762551-9</Id><Topic><Title>No To Worry (gun hating LIBS)</Title><Username>echo.2l65</Username><Timestamp>1369264163101</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 19:09:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well (pa) echo &amp; (son) 'icky' ... when the police arrived, they THEN had to wait for the "armed" police before they could take any action ...

He did mention so very stupid comments made by our President, but that is nothing new either. Why do you liberals have to take every criticism of your thought process, a phrase used rather loosely, as a racist issue? Just following the lead of the President and First Lady and their entire staff I suppose, that or your just plain ignorant.

Here is the reality for non-racists: Black people, including Martin, have just as much of a right to defend themselves from armed people who are following them for no reason in the middle of the night as white people do.

The difference is a large proportion of Tea Brains ARE actually liars and frauds, while only a very, very, very few Muslims actually pose any sort of threat to this country. Thus profiling Tea Brains for tax frauds is likely efficient, while profiling Muslims likely is not. Just imagine the cost to surveil every Muslim in the country in the hopes of catching a handful of people each year. There are better methods. But it is easy to see how flagging the tax filings of Tea Brains for extra scrutiny would yield a large number of frauds and cheats. Either way though, in America we believe in equality before the law and innocent until proven guilty, so we do not profile whether it makes sense (as it does in the case of Tea Brains) or not.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1369411274867</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-24 12:01:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>13</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369412426337-32</Id><Topic><Title>2 MILLION shares sold at 12 noon</Title><Username>bshipleyinsurance</Username><Timestamp>1369248608360</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 14:50:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Do you mean to say that ALL of your "postses" aren't scrambled..(??)

Because he did so while black? You are what you are and you demonstrate it over and over and over again. "will be for you and for me an instant decision" It was not an instant decision. Zimmerman followed him for some time. Martin walked away, then ran away. At one point Martin walked towards Zimmerman's truck, walked around it, and tried to talk to him but Zimmerman rolled up his window. Martin left the road and Zimmerman followed him on foot, even though the police told him not to. Martin hid in the bushes, and still Zimmerman came towards him. Zimmerman never identified himself as a member of neighborhood watch or a concerned neighbor or anything. An instant decision? I think not. According to Zimmerman's own account Martin tried several times to get away and avoid a confrontation. Zimmerman continued to pursue him despite instructions from the police not to. You are right I am not a jury or an attorney and I do not have all of the facts. What my side wanted from this was a trial.

Senator Feinstein and her husband, Richard Blum, stand to make a fortune. His firm, C.R. I., is the sole real estate company offering these properties for sale. Of course, C.R.I. will be making a 6% commission on the sale of each and every one of these postal properties. All of these properties that are being sold are all fully paid for. They were purchased with U.S. taxpayers dollars, and they are allowed free and clear by the U.S.P.S. The only cost to keep them is the cost to actually keep the doors open and the heat and lights on. The United States Postal Service doesn't even have to pay property taxes on these subject properties. Would you sell your house just because you couldn't afford to pay the electric bill? Well, the Post Office is. How does a powerful U.S. Senator from San Francisco manage to get away with such a sweet deal? A powerful United States Senator's husband is standing by, all ready to make millions from a U.S. taxpayer funded enterprise.

According to the IG report, they were swamped after the Citizen's United decision and were looking for a way to efficiently identify cases of fraud. "Who told them to start or that it was OK do start?" According to the IG report, no one. Once the criteria list reached higher ups in the IRS they were immediately told to stop using that list. "Why are they still trying to cover it up?" The IRS requested the incident be included in the IG audit, and the information we have on the incident is from that internal audit. That does not sound like a cover-up. There are some questions about why it wasn't reported to Congress during the audit, but I would not call that a cover-up. If you are wondering why Ms. Lerner pled the 5th, I imagine it is because several powerful Republicans have publicly expressed that they intend to send someone to jail. "Why are they still lying about it?" What lies? This is what we're looking at with all of these scandals. The actual thing that we're supposed to be upset about turns out to be nothing, so we're talking about whether John Carney or Susan Rice or President Obama used the right word when and what that word really meant and who picked the words and why, or whether what was said was really an apology or not or what was meant or not, or whether something should have been said at a different time than it was said. No one cares, and you wouldn't either if you'd crawl out of your Tea Brain hole. What do real people care about? Make sure the State Department has enough funds to do its job and protect its workers.

Once the criteria list reached higher ups in the IRS they were immediately told to stop using that list." This went on for over a year, there was no 'immediate' order to stop. There were told to stop when they were caught and it was made public. Why was the IG's report shared with the WH, but supposedly no one had the guts to inform the President? I understand you position that the President can't be involved in everything, make every decision; that is why he has many, many, many staffers to look for things he needs to know about and to inform him. Again, he has a hard time hiring competent folks to work for him.</Msg><Username>pinhighshot</Username><Timestamp>1369429700047</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-24 17:08:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>14</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369429903158-57</Id><Title>OT-National Review Article</Title><Msg>I'm not usually one to start off-topic threads (though I do participate in them)).
