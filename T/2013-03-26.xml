I think American criminals get guns the same way Mexican criminals do: straw-buyers and gun shows in the US. Seems like the easiest way to me. Far easier than breaking into the house of a gun owner.

A democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover that they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury. From that moment on, the majority always votes for the candidates who promise the most benefits from the public treasury, with the result that every democracy will finally collapse over loose fiscal policy, (which is) always followed by a dictatorship." "The average age of the world's greatest civilizations from the beginning of history, has been about 200 years. During those 200 years, these nations always progressed through the following sequence: From bondage to spiritual faith; From spiritual faith to great courage; From courage to liberty; From liberty to abundance; From abundance to complacency; From complacency to apathy; From apathy to dependence; From dependence back into bondage." The Obituary follows: Born 1776, Died 2012 It doesn't hurt to read this several times. Professor Joseph Olson of Hamline University School of Law in St. Paul, Minnesota, points out some interesting facts concerning the last Presidential election: Number of States won by: Obama: 19 Romney: 29 Square miles of land won by: Obama: 580,000 Romney: 2,427,000 Population of counties won by: Obama: 127 million Romney: 143 million Murder rate per 100,000 residents in counties won by: Obama: 13.2 Romney: 2.1 Professor Olson adds: "In aggregate, the map of the territory Romney won was mostly the land owned by the taxpaying citizens of the country.

Thanks for another informative post, straight off the email spam wagon…this one another contrived, factually inaccurate Tea-brain concoction that’s circulated many times, beginning in 2000, with Bush &amp; Gore, then replaced with McCain &amp; Obama. Apparently our caddy friend, empty of both facts and originality, has once again re-circulated it, this time with Obama &amp; Romney. Tyler wrote no such thing. Joseph Olson confirmed he also didn’t write that which was attributed to him And your facts are incorrect, as usual. Snopes will confirm that, which means that you people are nothing but a pack of losers with nothing to offer other than intentional lies aimed at gullible fools like yourselves. Now go replace your divot and head on down to the ladies’ tee, Stymie.

Ancient Athens remained a Democracy until it was overthrown by Phillip of Macedon (Alexander the Great's father). Through its entire period Athens was a leading economic, cultural, academic and military center. I doubt your Scottish professor existed at all, but if he said what he said about Athens he was a very poor history professor. Usually when we see this email it is attributed to Rome, which was a Republic for about 500 years before Caeser installed himself as emperor. Loose fiscal policy did not end the Roman Republic--civil war and infighting among a wealthy elite did. The Empire lasted for another 500 years.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1364333704613</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 17:35:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364334792191-15</Id><Topic><Title>We are on our way out and Obama is leading the way</Title><Username>usganut</Username><Timestamp>1364321408280</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 14:10:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"voters discover that they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury" How true, and have the money to buy lobbyists, networks, and red necks with no brains. The largest, and most generous treasury gifts go to the wealthiest. In school we learn Presidents serve up to 8 years, then we elect another, guess home schooling doesn't teach that to rwnj's.
