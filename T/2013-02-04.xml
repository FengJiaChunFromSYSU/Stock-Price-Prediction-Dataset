The score board tells the whole story, who cares about the detail; 2.

Or accost you then say right to not stand down. Couldn't pay me enough to visit FL. Answer this question, when did your ancestors move to America, and were there already people here then? Mine came around 1890-1905 from Europe. There were lots of people here already. Gee the Europeans came here about 300 years ago, and found the land already taken, but they took it for themselves without even asking. They killed many of the residents who were already here for thousands of years, who thought it was their home. They killed almost all the buffalo for just the hides, leaving the bodies to rot away. Going to Church all the while. Technically does it even belong to them now? Maybe you should look think a little deeper.</Msg><Username>peppeek</Username><Timestamp>1359990947988</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-04 10:15:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359993634595-5</Id><Topic><Title>How sad what Florida has become</Title><Username>lavendarsen</Username><Timestamp>1359423608733</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 20:40:08 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>When again did your ancestors move to America?

What you want is an America that is exactly the same as it was in your youth. Well, that America was very much different than America during every previous generation. The America of my youth has changed too.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1360014715089</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-04 16:51:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360015909719-35</Id><Title>poster ricky is in Argentina</Title><Msg>Understand the rick has left the USA and is now in Argentina!

This includes more than 30 minutes hold time. Have two separate accounts as AT&amp;T formerly didn't allow more than 5 cellphones on a family plan. They allow 10 on the new plan. Have been a loyal AT&amp;T customer for decades, always paying my bills on time, have excellent credit. Despite this, good ol' AT&amp;T told me they couldn't combine my two accounts without a credit check. Now they have me back on hold because they have to transfer me to a third department to combine my home phone and internet bill with my cellphone bills, as they always were before. This really is a textbook example as to how inflict maximum pain, totally alienate, and #$%$ off your loyal customers. No wonder AT&amp;T consistently ranks by far the worst of all cell carriers in customer service satisfaction surveys. I WOULD SWITCH MY SERVICE TO VERIZON TONIGHT, BUT MY KID'S CELLPHONE CONTRACTS EXPIRE ON DIFFERENT DATES, AND IT WOULD COST ME A FORTUNE. If you invest in this company, you are a fool. Still on hold. Thanks, AT&amp;T. Addendum: Have now been on the phone with AT&amp;T for over 2 hours. I have been speaking with someone in India who insists that my home phone number, which I have had for over 25 years, doesn't exist. I finally convinced this Indian national to call this phone number and speak with my wife to confirm that this number is indeed a valid number. This same person keeps asking about my AT&amp;T U-verse service. I keep telling her that I don't have U-verse, I have dsl extreme 6.0 service. All I want to do is just combine my bill, as it was before. Addendum: The Indian woman couldn't figure it out. She's going to call me back. It is now 8:20 pm eastern time. I started on the phone with AT&amp;T at a couple of minutes after six. I am a busy physician and had plans to go run this evening. Instead have been sitting on my butt on the phone. I'm so mad I could spit bullets. A simple switch that should have taken 5 minutes has taken up an entire evening. And there is still no resolution to the problem.</Msg><Username>zephaniah70</Username><Timestamp>1360027721564</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-04 20:28:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360031074468-41</Id><Topic><Title>AT&amp;T Customer Service</Title><Username>zephaniah70</Username><Timestamp>1360027721564</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-04 20:28:41 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Now you know how patients feel.
