I went a very similar route in planning for and realizing my retirement except I wasn't union. I find it strange that Ricky and others seem to think that retiree's that did proper planning and saving and are collecting a government stipend that was promised them as a return of some of their own money are the leeches of the world. They think the Christmas goodies that Obama keeps piling on to some in order to maintain their votes. They think that paying two years of UE benefits because he cost them their jobs is a humanitarian effort of supreme proportions and we are thieves that never pay for any of our stuff. I suspect that you, like many of us, are still paying taxes on your retirement earning and withdrawals and your SS checks, unlike many of Obama's supporters that are paying no or next to nothing taxes for anything they receive.</Msg><Username>winholder</Username><Timestamp>1367588787088</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 09:46:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367589852862-6</Id><Title>get ready for the best stock alerts!</Title><Msg>All you have to do is follow their picks.

Well, it seems like our valuations don't agree. That's ok. It's not necessary to yell about it though Beau. I suppose you might think my comment candy coated it, but that wasn't my intent. The price sank to the low 36 range and recovered to nearly 38 before settling as it has in the mid 37's. you can interpret that as you see fit. I think it did well in spite of a lower than expected quarterly report. Regardless, I follow T closely and daily. My position is long term unless circumstances change. I haven't seen anything to change my thinking. The daily fluctuation is part of investing in stocks Beau. I can tolerate the ups and downs as I have stated many times. If you don't agree about my posts, that's fine with me. Criticize anyone that doesn't agree with your takes,but it's not necessary to use all cap's to scream your disagreement.

Yes Win, being union helped me and my family. I doubt we would be in our position today had I not been union. As for the Ricky bunch, I don't read their stuff, so I could care less what they post. They are on ignore. I take care of my business and that's all I can do despite who the president is. Let me respond to your last paragraph about taxes. I had 2 taxable IRA's in my retirement account. I converted them both to Roth's at great expense. We just sent the IRS and the state of Ca. 155K 3 weeks ago for last years conversion. I also have to ante up another 80K apx. by next January 13 for estimated taxes for the second Roth conversion I did in February of this year. I staggered yearly, them so as to not take a hit that might have been a budget-buster. Now, I can collect tax-free and not face MRD's at 70 1/2 as well. It also means I can pass it on to my son via a Trust we have set up and spare him paying taxes. So come 2014, any taxes we pay will be minimal in 2015. Health care is not a factor, as we use Kaiser and I have no complaints about the service they provide. It is excellent. Fortunately, we are in tip-top shape and our needs are minimal regarding medical expenses. Should problems arise, we have ample income to be properly cared for. I always have said one thing about finances Win and it's this. I have ingrained it in my sons mind forever: "It's not how MUCH you make...it's what you DO with what you make". Whether that is original, I don't know. I never read or saw it anyplace to my knowledge. But I take credit for coining it until proven otherwise.</Msg><Username>davemartin74575</Username><Timestamp>1367595649829</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 11:40:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367596362831-24</Id><Topic><Title>Dividend</Title><Username>cboatner</Username><Timestamp>1367290420419</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 22:53:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I see you can read the blogs that Yahoo!

Gravel says the media has aided what he sees as a government cover-up by not taking reports of ET encounters seriously. “What we're faced with here is, in areas of the media, and the government too, an effort to marginalize and ridicule people who have specific knowledge,” he says.</Msg><Username>art_bell51</Username><Timestamp>1367602951269</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 13:42:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367603315965-35</Id><Topic><Title>Democrat Sen.Gravel says BO hiding UFO evidence</Title><Username>art_bell51</Username><Timestamp>1367602951269</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 13:42:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Whay are you suprised?
