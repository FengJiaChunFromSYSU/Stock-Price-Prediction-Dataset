That means you should not as well. However, you have been sufficiently hoodwinked by these paid clowns into believing they are acting in the best interests of the people versus their own interests and careers. We are time and again lied to by our government; they misstate and or manipulate 'facts' to fit their needs and obscure many of their actions. They, through their failure to act upon illegal and immoral acts by their members, condone such actions. I would be willing to bet you don't have a degree or training in psychology or any other mental health discipline you're no more qualified to provide such diagnosis than the local crack head on a corner in your neighborhood. Therefore, your analysis is a worth zilch and shall be considered appropriately.

That means you should not as well.” Therein lies one of your repetitive mistakes. Just because you assert that something is so, does not make it reality. When you say “we,” you speak only for you, jon, lew, lav and your other assorted extremist, racist, birther, gun-nut, loonies who are constantly spouting off conspiracy theories. You lost the election badly and you cannot accept that fact. Suggesting that I, or any of the majority of other Americans who disagree with you, should do anything simply because you do, is delusionally pathetic. What’s really crazy is one, you are being played like a pawn by the one percenters you claim to represent – obviously you’re not one of them or you wouldn’t be here saying stupid stuff everyday - and two, you are not only out of touch with the majority of America, but you are gradually fading yourself out of even your own party. The intelligent people on your side have learned that the Palin-Bachman-Tea Party extremist concept, while popular with a small, old and rural base, is not sufficient to represent the ever changing demographics of modern America. Heck, you guys didn’t even want to LOOK at polls based on demographics. Instead, you’d rather have lavender or lew bemoan progress and pine wistfully for the old days. But, as I’ve told you for years, keep at it. You make it easy for the other side. Read jon’s most recent toilet humor post. Are you proud to have he and lew and the others represent your views? You really should be ashamed. Hey, tell us again…why do quail hunters need AR-15’s? (Don’t spaz out – you didn’t say that - I’m only asking.) Oh, that’s right – it’s so people like Nancy Lanza can leave them lying around the house to protect herself in case a mentally ill person, like her son, might assault her…plus, the occasional rogue woodchuck…Oh, and starter-guns for redneck bathtub races…</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1359322779149</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 16:39:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359323326504-11</Id><Topic><Title>Does the president have a point?</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1359293851462</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 08:37:31 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Football has changed gradually ever since it was invented.</Msg><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1359323326504</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 16:48:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359323810976-12</Id><Topic><Title>what a news!</Title><Username>ronbadger80</Username><Timestamp>1359033714046</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 08:21:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>thanks</Msg><Username>nathanshuler742</Username><Timestamp>1359323810976</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 16:56:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359324698786-13</Id><Topic><Title>AT&amp;T Insiders SELLING?!

I think you need to start by cataloging the instances of Obama doing the opposite of what he said. A good place to start may be Politifact's Obameter, which tracks Obama's campaign promises. Here's a rundown: Promises Kept: 45% Promises Compromised: 24% Promises Broken: 22% In the works, stalled, etc: 7% Not perfect, but certainly not out of line with what we expect from a President. If you were told that a president would achieve or make comprmised progress on 2/3 of his campaign promises, would you think that president was doing the opposite of what he says?</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1359342626381</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 22:10:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
