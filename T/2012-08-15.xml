If voters considered for a few moments the ridiculous statements that are later called, ‘misstatements’ or taken out of context comments attributed to some of these crooks, they might get a real picture of the people they are voting for. The media and money determine our elected officials, not the American people. The American people aren't that smart. They make decisions based religion, race, how much the government is or isn't doing for them or members of their family. They listen to thirty-second sound bites, the opinions offered on Sunday morning left leaning political talk shows, conservative talk radio or what their neighbors tell them. Few if any really understand the impacts of the platforms of either Party will have on the country. Some vote a straight ticket because 'they always have' or their father always voted with one Party or another. The biggest influence on politicians in this country is not the desire to provide a public service, but the power and money that comes with the position and how it will impact their ability to remain in the light of that power and money for as long as possible. We pretty much get what we deserve.</Msg><Username>winholder</Username><Timestamp>1345053841000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 14:04:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345053894000-15</Id><Title>re: Romney will never win...</Title><Msg>... jonwindandale - Suddenly Vice Presidents matter, right?
