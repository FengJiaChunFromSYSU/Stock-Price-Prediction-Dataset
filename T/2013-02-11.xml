That said, if they are courting each other, T &amp; DISH would have to find some creative way to implement the linkage. I say that because I don't see a merger in the cards given the regulatory approval that would be required by the current cast of characters in D.C. Since DISH does not seem overly interested in parting with any of its spectrum, I'm not sure what the linkage would look like.</Msg><Username>t.bfine</Username><Timestamp>1360590580697</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-11 08:49:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360591769757-4</Id><Topic><Title>Dorner, Crazed Lib, Likely at Doughnut Shop</Title><Username>robfisk</Username><Timestamp>1360551531335</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-10 21:58:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He's one of your people, jon2retard.

Surely DISH isn't going to start their operations from ground zero. They have to link with an established major telecom services provider where the choices narrow down to two. On an altogether different front, I expect AT&amp;T to make a major announcement in international markets, possible buyout of firms owned/controlled by Carlos Salinas (I hope I got his last name correct). Often times, Randall speaks of Carlos very highly.</Msg><Username>convergent_series</Username><Timestamp>1360592827143</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-11 09:27:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360593764932-6</Id><Topic><Title>t.bfine...</Title><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1360531429040</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-10 16:23:49 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>One she has power of attorney for...the other's she was helping.

Tell me what that mechanism is again? Currently there is a tax loophole that benefits business. That has been enough to create our employer-based health insurance system. Obamacare adds a penalty for not providing insurance to employers as well. This increases the incentive to employers to provide insurance. Understand? A benefit plus a penalty is a stronger incentive to provide insurance than a benefit alone. It is not a weaker one as conservatives have shrilly tried to argue. "Jonathan Gruber, the architect of the plan, acknowledged that insurance premiums would rise considerably " Jesus, Dan, when will you learn that I am very familiar with Gruber's work. Jon Gruber said no such thing. Jon Gruber posted a lengthy response pinpointing exactly what was wrong with the Daily Caller's article--the article which is driving this particular lie. Here's the one quote you need: "6) Finally, this all ignores tax credits. After tax credits, premiums fall substantially, on average, in each state." Put this in quotes and search for it on Google, and you'll find the source for Gruber's quote here. "an IRS report released last week showing that the cheapest health insurance plan under ObamaCare will cost a family $20,000 in 2016: " An IRS report used $20,000 as a hypothetical price in a few examples showing the effect of a proposed regulation. ALL the examples it used were of the $5,000, $10,000 &amp; $20,000 variety. Look up "RIN 1545-BL36" for the document. You're a liar, Dan.
