Tax increases will likely be on capital gains across the board not just dividends. Also, investors will have to research the yield curves for bonds or equal investment vehicles to T. Based on their time horizons, they can determine what is best for their portfolios in terms risk and return. I doubt that they will find much with a yield of 5 percent and 12 month term. We can make the argument with the gain from shorted shares and those rich guys. Maybe Obama should increase the tax on gains from shorted shares to 50 percent, this could stop them from bolting down our stocks, meaning more redistribute of wealth. I also don't believe in breadcrumb, trickle-down economics. Some of these people are just hording cash and feeding off the markets. They are not creating jobs, increasing incomes, redistributing wealth, promoting growth, investing in projects for growth or anything. They are engaged in a hedge fund mentality which is just feeding off and bleeding the markets. This is the whole problem.</Msg><Username>bass9189</Username><Timestamp>1352353127268</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 00:38:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352358861714-2</Id><Topic><Title>Biden Draws 900 at his Latest Rally</Title><Username>robfisk</Username><Timestamp>1352051129695</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 12:45:29 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yah but Biden won and you have nothing to say but hot air for 4 more years.

Some thoughts for the coming discussions on the budget and the fiscal Armageddon From The Constitution: Article 6 - Debts, Supremacy, OATHS (emphasis added): “The Senators and Representatives before mentioned, and the Members of the several State Legislatures, and all executive and judicial Officers, both of the United States and of the several States, shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution; but no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States.” The current Oath of office which was enacted in 1884, which is sworn to by all members of Congress: “I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter: So help me God.” This is the ONLY oath that your representatives, ALL of them, regardless of political affiliation are bound to uphold by law. Unfortunately, numerous politicians, mainly from the GOP, have taken it upon themselves to make another pledge to a lobbying group; a 501(c)(4) organization called The Americans for Tax Reform, which was founded in 1985, by Grover Norquist. This pledge for members of Congress states the following: I, _______________, pledge to the taxpayers of the _____ district of the state of__________, and to the American people that I will: ONE, oppose any and all efforts to increase the marginal income tax rates for individuals and/or businesses; and TWO, oppose any net reduction or elimination of deductions and credits, unless matched dollar for dollar by further reducing tax rates. (Note: a similar pledge for state legislators states: “I will oppose and vote against any and all efforts to increase taxes.”) In the last Congress, the pledge was signed by 236 of the 242 Republicans, plus 2 Democrats in The House and 40 of the 47 Republicans and 1 Democrat in The Senate. As the country moves forward and attempts to eliminate the potential of falling over the looming fiscal cliff, it is extremely important to ask yourself to whom do you want your elected officials pledging their allegiance. To the Constitution, as required by law, or to a lobbying group with absolutely no authority to legally meddle in the affairs of Congress. Sure it’s easy to say no new taxes…everybody would LIKE to say that. But what are the realities? How can an elected official make a promise to lobbyists representing special interests, and not be free to make legislative decisions as required by the times? What if a calamity arises, another war or natural disaster? How can some politicians bind themselves to a written pledge outside of their elected responsibilities? It makes no sense. In addition to prohibiting direct increases, this pledge also prohibits ending loopholes or deductions, since they likewise raise taxes. And, frankly, the real issue is the pledge, itself. What if another lobbying group organizes members to make similar pledges that would simply forbid raising taxes on specific groups, i.e. corporations, or manufacturing, oil, etc.? What if politicians signed a pledge to stop funding the defense department, eliminate regulations for special interest groups, defund social programs, or myriad other schemes. No doubt, the public would be up in arms. Difficult budgetary decisions lie ahead. Intelligent discussion is required, which cannot be achieved if certain groups feel they are bound by having signed written commitments to the allegiance of outside lobbyists, in contradiction to their sworn duties as elected officials. The issue will be revenues, and this election suggests America wants everyone to pay their fair share. We elect officials to make those choices. They should be free to do just that, without the outside interference of people like Grover Norquist.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1352383360644</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 09:02:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352385921136-9</Id><Topic><Title>The name's Cliff...Fiscal Cliff...Drop over sometime...</Title><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1352383360644</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 09:02:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Echo..do you have any preferences on how the sequestration should be handled?</Msg><Username>ciscokid_1st</Username><Timestamp>1352385921136</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 09:45:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352388629412-10</Id><Topic><Title>Good oppertunity run in when everyone else runs out</Title><Username>bill011012</Username><Timestamp>1352304190179</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 11:03:10 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wait a little while.

My point was, cooperation can’t happen if one side feels they have an allegiance to a special interest group which outweighs the obligations of their office. I’ll give you an example, however, of something I’ve told folks about my whole life. In the Marine Corps in Vietnam, as a gunner on a 3.5” rocket launcher in ’65 and “66, I was told that each 9 pound rocket I fired, cost about $90 (slight difference between H.E.A.T. rounds and White Phosphorous – early on, we didn’t yet have the self contained L.A.W.’s). That’s 90 bucks per round. That fact made me feel rather insignificant in the grand scheme, as we fired a lot of them, while at the time, as a Lance Corporal, I was being paid, base pay (combat pay added a little more) just $78 dollars a month (from memory). It seemed extraordinary to me at the time, that every round – a piece of metal, explosives, propellant – cost more than my life was worth. I know full well, the actual cost to make one was far, far less than 90 dollars. By the same token, however, my parents would have said the cost to make me was far more than 78 bucks a month. Of course, I would tend to agree. My point is, there is certainly room to eliminate both the overkill of our defense budget (larger than the next 16 countries combined), the obscene profits they make, all coupled with the fact that American defense manufacturers pay an average annual tax rate of 17.5 percent. I’m fairly certain that significant cuts can be made, without jeopardizing our safety or standing in the world. Obviously, there are a ton of lobbyists who will tell you differently. And, incidentally, your mention of FEMA’s inability to deliver in the Jersey/Metro area - You may have forgotten that I am a former Jersey guy, as well. As a small boy from Pennsylvania, we always vacationed at Ocean City. Later in my life after stops in Minnesota and elsewhere, I finished High School in northern Jersey…I lived a summer in Sea Bright at 21 - tended bar and life guarded (before the Stone Pony or The Boss was in Asbury)… I am very familiar with the Shore from Red Bank, Manasquan, Point Pleasant, Long Beach Island, Belmar, and was just in Stone Harbor/Cape May area last summer. I enjoyed the late 60’s there (so they tell me) and I know the areas of devastation very well, and feel a deep personal loss. I was going to mention to you, however, and I see someone else already did, that perhaps, with your disdain for Government, perhaps you’d like each state to deal with it on their own…or maybe they should just wait for the kindness of local churches, Red Cross, or whoever. It’s not an easy issue to deal with. I’m quite sure it would be more so without FEMA’s efforts, which are not perfect. Nor were they in Katrina. I’m not making comparisons, and I don’t think I blamed Bush back then. Regardless, I hope your relatives are safe and sound and that everything that can be done for them will be done as expeditiously as possible. Last thing…We’re off to Virginia outside DC tomorrow for Veterans Day/MC birthday and to visit my daughter and son-in-law who just got out of the Corps. Maybe I can find jon and buy him a drink…and a dictionary. What the heck, rob’s not that far away in Baltimore…maybe he’ll swing by in the Prius.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1352392395902</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 11:33:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352392948514-22</Id><Topic><Title>T going back down like all dividend stocks, going a lot lower tax hikes on dividends not priced in yet, Dividend we need to be close to 7% before T hits bottom</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1352312606134</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 13:23:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I have not found one good reason for this steep decrease in price.

What was that about? Then theres also this. Reviewing the 2012 presidential campaign, here are five ways the media elite tipped the public relations scales in favor of the liberal Obama and against the conservative challenger Mitt Romney: 1. The Media’s Biased Gaffe Patrol Hammered Romney: The media unfairly jumped on inconsequential mistakes — or even invented controversies — from Romney and hyped them in to multi-day media “earthquakes.” Case in point: the GOP candidate’s trip to Europe and Israel in late July. A Media Research Center analysis of all 21 ABC, CBS and NBC evening news stories about Romney’s trip found that virtually all of them (18, or 86%) emphasized “diplomatic blunders,” “gaffes” or “missteps.” Conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer blasted the news coverage in an August 2 column, calling the trip “a major substantive success” that was wrapped “in a media narrative of surpassing triviality.” Similarly, when the left-wing Mother Jones magazine in September put out a secretly-recorded video of Romney talking to donors about the 47% of Americans who don’t pay income taxes, the networks hyped it like a sensational sex scandal. Over three days, the broadcast network morning and evening shows churned out 42 stories on the tape, nearly 90 minutes of coverage. The tone was hyperbolic; ABC’s "Good Morning America" called it a “bombshell rocking the Mitt Romney campaign,” while ABC "World News" anchor Diane Sawyer declared it a “political earthquake.” None of Obama’s gaffes garnered that level of coverage. After the president in a June 8 press conference declared that “the private sector is doing fine,” the ABC, CBS and NBC evening newscasts gave it just one night’s coverage, then basically dropped the story — nothing further on ABC’s "World News" or the "CBS Evening News" in the weeks that followed, and just two passing references on the "NBC Nightly News." And, when Obama infamously declared, “You didn’t build that,” ABC, CBS, NBC didn’t report the politically damaging remark for four days — and then only after Romney made it the centerpiece of a campaign speech. 2. Pounding Romney With Partisan Fact Checking: There’s nothing wrong with holding politicians accountable for the honesty of their TV ads and stump speeches, but this year the self-appointed media fact-checkers attacked Republicans as liars for statements that were accurate. For example, a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reporter writing for PolitiFact branded VP candidate Paul Ryan’s convention speech anecdote about the closing of the General Motors plant in his hometown as “false,” even though Ryan was correct in all of his details. The slanted review became TV reporters’ talking points ; the next day on NBC, correspondent Chuck Todd grumped that while what Ryan said “was technically factual, by what he left out, [he] actually distorted the actual truth.” Matt Lauer greeted Ryan the following week in an interview on Today: “There are some people who are claiming that you played a little fast and loose with the truth....” The same thing happened when Mitt Romney talked about Obama’s “apology tour” during the final presidential debate. While in 2009 Obama had, in fact, criticized the United States as “arrogant,” “derisive” and having “too often... set [our] principles aside,” the networks said to call it an “apology tour” was “false” because, as CNN’s John Berman tenuously insisted, “even if he was critical of past U.S. foreign policy, he issued no apologies.” Writing in the New York Times August 31, correspondent Jackie Calmes scolded that “the number of falsehoods and misleading statements from the Romney campaign coming in for independent criticism has reached a level not typically seen.” That’s not true, either; Romney’s team was, at worst, guilty of highlighting those facts that best illustrated their points (something done by all politicians), and the Obama campaign certainly put out their share of tawdry TV ads and dubious campaign claims. But with “truth cops” who mainly policed just the GOP side of the street, the media used “fact-checking” as another club to tilt the playing field in favor of the Democrats. 3. Those Biased Debate Moderators: Upset liberals scorned PBS’s Jim Lehrer for taking a hands-off approach in the first debate on October 3, with MSNBC analyst Howard Fineman slamming him as “practically useless ” for not jumping into the debate on behalf of President Obama. Such criticism may have encouraged the activist approach taken by ABC’s Martha Raddatz in the vice presidential debate October 11, and by CNN’s Candy Crowley in the October 16 town hall debate , as both of those journalists repeatedly interrupted the Republican candidate and larded the discussion with a predominantly liberal agenda. Crowley earns extra demerits for taking the media’s penchant for faulty fact-checking to new heights when she jumped into the October 16 town hall-style debate to validate President Obama’s claim that he called the attack in Benghazi, Libya, “an act of terror” the very next morning. Crowley endorsed Obama’s story, telling Romney: “He did, in fact, sir, call it an act of terror.” Not according to the transcript, which had Obama only speaking generically about how “no acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this nation,” not assigning that label to the violence in Benghazi. Wrong though she was, Crowley became a heroine to many in the liberal media; ABC's Matt Dowd, for example, cheered : “What Candy Crowley did, I actually thought, was laudable....I hope we get to do more of that in this discourse.” Moderators are supposed to ensure both sides get a fair hearing, not pick sides. By leaping into the fray, Candy Crowley epitomized the media’s itch to tilt the scales this year — again, in Obama’s favor. 4. The Benghazi Blackout: Right after the September 11 attack in Libya, the networks proclaimed that the events would bolster President Obama — “reminding voters of his power as commander-in-chief,” as NBC’s Peter Alexander stated on the September 14 edition of "Today." But as a cascade of leaked information erased the portrait of Obama as a heroic commander, the broadcast networks shunted the Benghazi story to the sidelines. News broke online in late September, for example, that Team Obama knew within 24 hours that the attack was likely the result of terrorism. That starkly contradicted claims from White House press secretary Jay Carney, U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice, and President Obama himself that the attack was a “spontaneous” reaction to an anti-Muslim video posted on YouTube. Yet, ABC took nearly two days to bring this story to viewers, while CBS and NBC held off for three days. This was, shamefully, the broadcast networks’ pattern in October: New developments exposing the administration’s failure to provide adequate security, or contradictions in their public statements, were either given stingy coverage or buried completely. The puzzle pieces revealed a disturbing failure of Obama’s national security apparatus, but the networks flitted in and out of the story, never giving it any traction. Instead of an “October Surprise,” the networks engineered an “October Suppression” — keeping a lid on the boiling Benghazi story until Election Day. Who knows how voters might have reacted if the media had covered this story as tenaciously as they did Romney’s “47% gaffe”? 5. Burying the Bad Economy: Pundits agreed that Obama’s weakness was the failure of the US economy to revive after his expensive stimulus and four years of $1 trillion deficits. But the major networks failed to offer the sustained, aggressive coverage of the economy that incumbent Republican President George H.W. Bush faced in 1992, or even that George W. Bush faced in 2004 — both years when the national economy was in better shape than it is now. According to a study conducted that year by the Center for Media and Public Affairs, from January through September of 1992, the networks ran a whopping 1,289 stories on the economy, 88% of which painted it in a dismal, negative light. That fall, the unemployment rate was 7.6%, lower than today’s 7.9%, and economic growth in the third quarter was 2.7%, better than today’s 2.0%. Yet the media coverage hammered the idea of a terrible economy, and Bush lost re-election. In 2004, the economy under George W. Bush was far better than it is today — higher growth, lower unemployment, smaller deficits and cheaper gasoline — yet network coverage that year was twice as hostile to Bush than it was towards Obama this year, according to a study by the Media Research Center’s Business and Media Institute. When Republican presidents have faced reelection, network reporters made sure to spotlight economic “victims” — the homeless man, the woman without health insurance, the unemployed worker, the senior citizen who had to choose between medicine and food. But this year, with an economy as bad as any since the Great Depression, those sympathetic anecdotes have vanished from the airwaves — a huge favor to Obama and the Democrats. Given Obama’s record, the Romney campaign could have overcome much of this media favoritism and still prevailed — indeed, they almost did. But taken together, these five trends took the media’s historical bias to new levels this year, and saved Obama’s presidency in the process</Msg><Username>bouch84</Username><Timestamp>1352397903673</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 13:05:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>14</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352398776840-34</Id><Topic><Title>The name's Cliff...Fiscal Cliff...Drop over sometime...</Title><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1352383360644</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 09:02:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What is sequestration?

Yeah, but that would qualify you as a member of the Obama administration and the most of the elected Democrats, because they don't understand how to budget or 'delineate' how budgets cuts should be made. Mostly they can't even spell budget cut. Nice story about Vietnam but as usual you strayed from the subject at hand to try to introduce as much ambiguity as possible. I guess I was incorrect the other day when I guessed that the Democratic Party had stopped paying you and Ricky for your obnoxious posts. As for the difference between a solemn oath to your country and its Constitution and a pledge on how to conduct business in Congressional sessions, most of us didn't expect you to understand the difference. One difference is that the Democrats haven't taken any pledges to do anything but support Obama. Mostly they haven't done ANYTHING in the last 18 months but complain and point fingers. Part of the problem is that the Democrats definition of bi-partisan is to 'do it our way'. You often ramble about the Republicans discontent with the Democrats policies, but you never say anything about the Democrats constant refusal to do anything but what they desire to do, or to do NOTHING. Nice try, but I don't think anyone is going to buy it. When you have a President that sermonizes we must have bi-partisan efforts and agreements and doesn't even bother to speak to the other side for many months in a row, not much support can be given to his words.</Msg><Username>winholder</Username><Timestamp>1352401323896</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 14:02:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352401803250-38</Id><Topic><Title>4 more years</Title><Username>bouch84</Username><Timestamp>1352304628354</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 11:10:28 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In a few more years he will be leaving office and moving on to his exorbitant book revenues, editorials and speaking engagements so he won't care much about the economy because he will have his.

He wants more of that middle class dependent on government for their livelihood and well-being. He is a firm believer in government control over all aspects of our lives. If you truly believe that the success or failure of our middle class leads to the success or failure of our economy and country, you voted for the wrong man. This country's days as the preeminent economic power in the world are soon to be over.

You can blame Donald Trump’s lack of Karma. You can blame birth certificates.

You were wrong then…you are wrong now…and, once again, winholder…pretending it’s not so, won’t change things. Deluding yourselves about reality is exactly what got you fools into the predicament you find yourselves in, in the first place. Why don’t you step up to the plate and accept some of that responsibility that you are always preaching that others lack? Rhetorical question – obviously because you are some poor soul stuck in a cubicle working for people who have a total disregard for not only you, but all of us. BTW…has anyone told you…YOU LOST… big time! Y-O-U…..L-O-S-T!!!!!! Most true Americans would show some humility. Aligning with the losing side, in and of itself, is no big deal.
