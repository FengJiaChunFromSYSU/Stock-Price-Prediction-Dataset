You basically make it all cash, then transfer that to your own IRA. You don't in general transfer a stock or bond. You create a traditional IRA in your bank or broker, and direct transfer the 401 K money over to it.(do it properly so you get the tax and penalty). I never keep my money with my last employer's 401k. However, there are some small benefits. If you want to borrow against your 401k, you usually have to be still working with the company, otherwise the loan can typically be called much sooner than you may want.</Msg><Username>gsk10002000</Username><Timestamp>1343881861000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 00:31:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343908864000-2</Id><Title>ATT retiree benefits</Title><Msg>Retirees....what are your thoughts on the company not having a healthcare plan in effect for retirees in 2014 and beyond?

You've probably already addressed it but, if not, check the expense load of the administrator of your existing 401K vs. the rollover options you are considering. It is a key question given what the administrator charges can eat a significant chunk of your annual gains. By the way, they take their cut even when they take a loss with your money. Also, when I set up my IRA in 2006 I found what they propose to charge you is negotiable. At least at that time, they wanted the account &amp; competed for it using the admin cost to do so. Things may have changed on that front, perhaps someone with more recent experience can chime in. Good luck.</Msg><Username>t.bfine</Username><Timestamp>1343909601000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 08:13:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343910837000-4</Id><Topic><Title>ATT retiree benefits</Title><Username>splicerwannabe</Username><Timestamp>1343908864000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 08:01:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Talk to the Prez of your local about that.

Where did you get this 2014 cessation of health care plan from? I haven't heard anything about it. I don't how much our 2013 premiums will be yet, but I do know it costs $77.00 monthly currently for me and my wife with Kaiser South Senior Advantage California with catastrophic care included. While premiums have gone up and down over the years, it has never been more than $100.00 for me alone prior to my wife becoming Medicare eligible. With the $72.00 Medicare rebate check I get from State Street (as required by Federal law) every month, I don't consider my plan to be all that bad. If you are aware of the plan being discontinued, kindly post a link.</Msg><Username>dm74575</Username><Timestamp>1343910872000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 08:34:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343915315000-6</Id><Topic><Title>ATT retiree benefits</Title><Username>splicerwannabe</Username><Timestamp>1343908864000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 08:01:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>not true, if you are in t health plan will not be changed 2014 no change in contract will be sign soon.</Msg><Username>jckyhrs</Username><Timestamp>1343915315000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 09:48:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343916650000-7</Id><Topic><Title>ATT retiree benefits</Title><Username>splicerwannabe</Username><Timestamp>1343908864000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 08:01:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm thinking most of that is made up.

STOP LYING on this board. Poor sad without a life yahoo board poster lying spinning wicky. I in the past though Romney didn't have a chance. Looking like his plan is coming together to defeat the current fool on the hill. Also seen by the increased spinning being done by Obama. Has to continue to attack and that seems to be the strategy that Romney wants. Look at the monies Obama is spending with almost no impact in the polls vs what Romney is spending. With no record to run on and a poor track, Obama will soon be the underdog. What a turn around and strategy by Romney. And I am not a Romney supporter, but, admire the implemented strategy. Poor widdle wicky will be crying in his milk come November.</Msg><Username>dan2003hr</Username><Timestamp>1343936477000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 15:41:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343937258000-15</Id><Topic><Title>ATT retiree benefits</Title><Username>splicerwannabe</Username><Timestamp>1343908864000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 08:01:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>T can afford the benefits.
