You live in your own little fantasy land. You can forget about grasping reality--that ship has sailed. But if I were you, I'd choose more pleasant fantasies. The Obama administration was lax with security at one embassy. Bush thought Afghanistan &amp; Iraq were cakewalks. He had no plan and invaded two countries. Thousands of our country's best young men and women are dead because of it and tens of thousands more are permanently injured. Do you think anybody outside of your little Tea Brain hole cares about whatever you think about Benghazi? You people are pathetically transparent. You don't care about American lives. You care about your little egos which you've linked to politics and race. That is why you disgust people. In the real world outside of the Tea Brain hole Americans trust that the Obama administration will address whatever happened in Benghazi with competence and care because that is how the Obama administration addresses everything.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1367847727125</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 09:42:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367848205849-6</Id><Topic><Title>Will Benghazi take Obama down?</Title><Username>hubcap1234_00</Username><Timestamp>1367718841230</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 21:54:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Tell it to the parents.</Msg><Username>t.bfine</Username><Timestamp>1367848205849</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 09:50:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367848323558-7</Id><Topic><Title>Will Benghazi take Obama down?</Title><Username>hubcap1234_00</Username><Timestamp>1367718841230</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 21:54:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It depends what you definition of is "is".

Are you #$%$ kidding me? You want to boil this down to some trite phrase you heard on the conservative talk shows? Forget the fact that plenty of CEOs have remained on the job after deadly disasters. Obama is not a CEO of a company. He is the President of the United States of America. That means often has to send men and women into harms way. Sometimes those people are killed. It is you and your ilk who trivialize this and politicize these things. You and your ilk who get these young men and women killed. The Obama administration has and will continue to handle this with the seriousness and respect that it deserves. What you and your ilk have done is turned it into a farce. What about the parents? They have to watch this spectacle you and your disgraceful ilk have created.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1367852632361</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 11:03:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367852733198-12</Id><Topic><Title>Will Benghazi take Obama down?</Title><Username>hubcap1234_00</Username><Timestamp>1367718841230</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 21:54:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nice to have a great person like you even notice my useless existence.

Unfortunately, the forthcoming GOP circus is nothing but another pathetic Swift Boat attack, fueled by Fox news and Congressman Darrell Issa (who compromised the identities of several Libyans working with the U.S. government with the State Department communication memos he released. Encouraging the politicization of this attack is absolutely reprehensible.) Here’s what Fox commentator Juan Williams said about the GOP’s feeding frenzy about Benghazi last October: “Win at all costs and apologize later is the rule in political campaigns, and the GOP has seen Obama’s approval rating on foreign policy fall in the aftermath of the Libya attack. But this is one political strategy that is based on deliberate misinformation about the Benghazi assault. (In the piece he clearly spelled out the three lies being perpetrated...and he called them lies.) Here’s what he says about it now: “It’s waste of time…You want to go back to find out who shot J.R.” And he works for FOX, wilkie…and he’s calling you guys clowns!! “I don't think Obama will survive the questioning.” – more wilkes nonsense You really think so, wilkes?
