Could our savings be next?” – racist rob, ghetto entrepreneur extraordinaire Right, rob, the “socialist government” is coming after your entire net worth and retirement savings…that would include, your Beanie Baby collection, your time-share vacation condo in downtown Camden, your forthcoming windfall being sent to your bank account from the anonymous heir to Nigerian Royalty, your Enron portfolio, the future payoff on your hoarding of an arbitrary substance to corner an unorthodox futures market (yes, toe-jam MAY be the secret to Nuclear Fusion, but don’t hold your breath), the reverse mortgage on your ghetto dwelling, the 212 bucks you got for the future sale of all of your internal organs, and your limited edition Franklin Mint John Wayne Gacy Commemorative Coin. Oh, woe is you, rob! But don’t despair, rob.

Except when your rants include "keep your government hands off my Medicare." You were a child in 1930. You lived in an illusion. The unemployment rate averaged 8.7% in 1930, and would peak at 25% three years later. GDP fell from $103 billion in 1929 to $56 billion in 1933. And the government had yet to eradicate polio. Only a World War in which 60 million people--2.5% of the world population--were killed ended the Great Depression. If you think that was better than today you led an extremely insulated life. The Greatest Generation lived through a horrible time and built a Great Society which you Tea Brains are intent on destroying. And, btw, the Tea Party seems to be very much against emigrants these days.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1363700138970</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 09:35:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363701435765-3</Id><Topic><Title>Little things on military bases</Title><Username>bob.beachin</Username><Timestamp>1363576079741</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-17 23:07:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>SS benefits are higher for those with higher lifetime earnings. And why is that? Because they typically paid more taxes into SS than those with lower earnings. They most likely paid the max percentage for a lot more years than most. You don't like the cap, a lot of folks don't/didn't, but you know what...the guys paying the tax didn't make that rule. Congress did. If you want to blame someone, blame Congress and both have plenty of bad skin in the game. They didn't fund it properly, they raided the fund, and they refused to do anything but complain that the fund was going broke, paying out too much in waste and fraud but refused to risk a political career to make any necessary changes. If the government collected all those taxes, how do you figure those benefits weren't paid for? These are not entitlements, they are benefits funded by those paying into the system. The fault that the funds and the entire process have been historically mismanaged by Congress is not the fault of those who paid the tax and were promised a return. But you don't seem to envision that the government in their infinite wisdom should be required to keep this promise. I guess on that one you're right on the money...there are tons of other promises they have made that they haven't been kept so to quote or former SOS, what difference does it make now! When they start keeping their spending promises or the promises of how certain expenditures will advance our society, our defense, or other wet dreams of theirs, perhaps the expectation might change.</Msg><Username>winholder</Username><Timestamp>1363701435765</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 09:57:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363701677764-4</Id><Topic><Title>Has Jesse Jackson Got his Eye on Your Prize?</Title><Username>robfisk</Username><Timestamp>1363659289728</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 22:14:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You had better keep hoping you don't have to eat those stupid words.

GDP dropped 50% during the Depression. If the government could prevent that by borrowing 10% of GDP, that was preferable to depression REGARDLESS of the government's willingness to pay down the debt once the crisis passed. Of course, Keynes did argue for countercyclical government fiscal policy, and pushed for higher taxes and war bonds rather than borrowing during WWII. But I, like the greater majority of economists, think the $1.5 trillion deficit we ran in 2009 prevented a depression, and a potential loss of $7.5 trillion annually from the US economy (50% of GDP)--not to mention the loss of wealth from lowered asset values. That is money well spent regardless of what occurs afterward. And that is why you fundamentally misunderstand Keynes.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1363705326169</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 11:02:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363705423054-9</Id><Topic><Title>Ryan with his BA and minor in Econ</Title><Username>peppeek</Username><Timestamp>1363621508131</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 11:45:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Really, Obama has less?
