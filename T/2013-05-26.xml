The Cincinnati office was told once to braoden their criteria, it did not take, and then told again. Finally the IRS requested review of incident by the IG. By the time the IG report was presented to the White House earlier this month the issue had been resolved. I am not sure why you think a resolved issue in one IRS office merits the president's attention. If you want to get the bottom of what happened within the IRS, that's one thing. Same with Benghazi. But all you seem intent on doing in both cases is desperately trying to pin something on the President. What is really happening is the economy is recovering nicely, the deficit is shrinking rapidly, and you need to change the subject to something negative.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1369582910601</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-26 11:41:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369583260478-12</Id><Topic><Title>No To Worry (gun hating LIBS)</Title><Username>echo.2l65</Username><Timestamp>1369264163101</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 19:09:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If someone committed a crime then by all means investigate.

I'm sure it is being reported extensively in the conservative media, just as the birther nonsense was. Most people who develop their own opinions on matters see this as a problem internal to the IRS. There are some questions of whether civil rights violations were committed and whether there was some "reluctance" to inform Congress that may prove criminal. Some heads may roll, but that it doesn't really have anything to do with the administration. In the end your focus on the incident and your attempts to pin it on Obama is simply revealing you people for what you are--cheap partisan hacks. You say Obama created an environment that leads to disrespect for the Tea Party? The Tea Party has demonstrated itself time and again to not be worthy of respect. You are treated the way you are treated because of what you are, not because of Obama.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1369583702469</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-26 11:55:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369583731646-14</Id><Topic><Title>No To Worry (gun hating LIBS)</Title><Username>echo.2l65</Username><Timestamp>1369264163101</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 19:09:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Learn English, moron.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1369583731646</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-26 11:55:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369586857702-15</Id><Topic><Title>AT&amp;T INTERNET SERVICE AND MAINTENANCE</Title><Username>e.sciacca</Username><Timestamp>1369346700414</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 18:05:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Mr. Sciacca, as a retired AT&amp;T employee I have questions, where do you live ( rural or big city), are the main cables buried or aerial, do you know how old the cable is ( prior to about 1950 they had pulp insulation,, which I'm sure you're aware of), and are there square transformers on the poles opposed to round ones? I have done all of the job duties from the central office to T1 installation and repair. But I'm not real famailiar with the central office as the central office technicians. As a cable repair tech I have seen some weird things interfere with internet service. My 15 years of experience in cable repair gave me a good back ground in building DSL and T1 pairs. But if the technicians have tried all of the "simple" fixes then it's time for a Tier II tech to analyze it. It could be a central office problem but it could also be too many dsl subscribers in the same 25 pair group causing your internet trouble but if your 'pots' service is dropping at the same time it sounds more like a central office problem or a high open in a pulp cable. I wish I could see the situation. Tier II can actually put a monitor on your line that records the loss and helps isolate. When I was a T1 tech we did that on a chronic problem and found that every time a train went past a repeater case it was causing the outage. We replaced the repeater case and the repeaters would fit in the slots tighter and the problem was solved. As a suggestion of courtesy I would ask that you not post the names of the employees that are trying to help you. It could create a violation of their privacy and they are doing their best to solve your problem.</Msg><Username>whopperkaraoke</Username><Timestamp>1369586857702</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-26 12:47:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369594779274-16</Id><Topic><Title>No To Worry (gun hating LIBS)</Title><Username>echo.2l65</Username><Timestamp>1369264163101</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 19:09:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Lewcor, I no longer live in Florida. It`s too bad, I think I would have loved Florida of 20 years or more ago, even though the Florida summers are brutal for me. I lingered in Florida debating whether to move, it just seemed like I should like it. However, that poor young White man swallowed by a sink hole who in a matter of hours was covered with dirt with no apparent effort whatsoever to rescue him, and then the N Dakota family who had their children kidnapped by Child Protective services in Jacksonville, after only being there 3 days to get medical help for their toddler, well both of those incidents really creeped me out. Jolted me into the realization that no way did I want to grow old and possibly infirm in Florida if that`s how they treat vulnerable White people. AND I simply do not want to live around hordes of non Whites as a minority, with them controlling and dictating culture and society, which is what so much of Florida is now. Also, I never felt good in Florida. I don`t know if I just wasn`t cut out for that climate or if it is an unhealthy environment. They sprayed the skies INCESSANTLY in Jacksonville, where I lived. It made sick just to look up at the sky.</Msg><Username>lavendarsen</Username><Timestamp>1369594779274</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-26 14:59:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369595798193-17</Id><Topic><Title>No To Worry (gun hating LIBS)</Title><Username>echo.2l65</Username><Timestamp>1369264163101</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 19:09:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>" White people, including the parents of the victims, hate you.

You know, after the incident in Jacksonville where the White guy killed the Black teen, supposedly because of loud music and according to the White because they threatened him with a gun(of course there were no cameras to back up his story that they or one of them left of the scene for awhile), there were Blacks who turned up their offensive repulsive music so loud that you were forced to listen to it if stopped at a red light. Whenever that happened to me, I simply turned up my country music even louder. Let me tell you, they were ENRAGED that Whitey dared to do the same thing they did. I would get HATE stares you would not believe. But you know what was even worse. When some ignorant White teen or young adult pulled up next to me with their hats turned backwards playing the same music. As though trying to imitate their colored betters. Some of them not even with hats turned backwards, driving expensive cars and pretending to be cool sophisticates. Ignorant types who viewed me and my hillbilly music as backwards.
