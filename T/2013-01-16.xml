Another most informative night on the T Board. We have jon’s blatantly racist attacks on the President (his “pimp-mobile”) followed by more of the same immature, hillbilly trash talk (ubangi lipped .. bbq'd chicken-lip eating fool) – no racial slurs intended there, by golly. Then we’ve got the amphibious philosopher himself, The Frogg, showing exactly what these people are all about with this tidbit of lunacy sounding ever more like lew, lavender and the other crazies here: “Just a little example of what happens when the federal government comes to save lives in your state. In your heart you know he is right." And just who is it that that gremlin is defending by suggesting that he was right? That’s right, folks, these complete wack-jobs apparently worship, and want you to feel sorry for…none other than David Koresh – a hero to the uneducated, fundamentalist, gun hoarding, high school dropout, racist/chauvinistic, impotent buffoons like jon, lew, fake ricky, lav, frog, et. al. I’ll ask this one more time. How come none of you so-called moderates ever condemn the shameless racism, intolerance and hatred that appears here daily? In your heart, do you feel David Koresh was right? Is hoarding guns, women and children and opening fire on federal officials okay with you? Is it simply a coincidence that Frognot is a Texas city about 2 and a half hours from Waco. Is everybody okay with comments like “the president’s pimp mobile, Ubangi lips” and the other racist garbage? Who are these people pandering to?</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1358345039862</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 09:03:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358345360485-4</Id><Title>Economic Lies...</Title><Msg>... For those of you not intoxicated with imaginary elixirs: I’ll not only source, but give proud endorsement of Robert Reich’s editorial of 2011. This debate, which has repeatedly kicked down the road, isn’t going away. So have at it, kids. Former Sec. of Labor Reich, who has served in three different administrations, was ranked 6th on The Wall St. Journal’s list of the most “influential business thinkers” of 2008. He wrote this back in 2011. Sometimes, after you grow up, you realize...not unlike myths, tooth fairies, Tonkin Gulf, superstitions, yellow-cake and Santa, many of the things you were told to believe, are utter nonsense, designed to serve the special interests of a select few. The Seven Biggest Economic Lies: (courtesy of Robert Reich) “1. Tax cuts for the rich trickle down to everyone else. Baloney. Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush both sliced taxes on the rich and what happened? Most Americans' wages (measured by the real median wage) began flattening under Reagan and has dropped since George W. Bush. Trickle-down economics is a cruel joke. 2. Higher taxes on the rich would hurt the economy and slow job growth. False. From the end of World War II until 1981, the richest Americans faced a top marginal tax rate of 70 percent or above. Under Dwight Eisenhower it was 91 percent. Even after all deductions and credits, the top taxes on the very rich were far higher than they've been since. Yet the economy grew faster during those years than it has since. (Don't believe small businesses would be hurt by a higher marginal tax; fewer than 2 percent of small business owners are in the highest tax bracket.) 3. Shrinking government generates more jobs. Wrong again. It means fewer government workers -- everyone from teachers, fire fighters, police officers, and social workers at the state and local levels to safety inspectors and military personnel at the federal. And fewer government contractors, who would employ fewer private-sector workers. According to Moody's economist Mark Zandi (a campaign advisor to John McCain), the $61 billion in spending cuts proposed by the House GOP will cost the economy 700,000 jobs this year and next. 4. Cutting the budget deficit now is more important than boosting the economy. Untrue. With so many Americans out of work, budget cuts now will shrink the economy. They'll increase unemployment and reduce tax revenues. That will worsen the ratio of the debt to the total economy. The first priority must be getting jobs and growth back by boosting the economy. Only then, when jobs and growth are returning vigorously, should we turn to cutting the deficit. 5. Medicare and Medicaid are the major drivers of budget deficits. Wrong. Medicare and Medicaid spending is rising quickly, to be sure. But that's because the nation's health-care costs are rising so fast. One of the best ways of slowing these costs is to use Medicare and Medicaid's bargaining power over drug companies and hospitals to reduce costs, and to move from a fee-for-service system to a fee-for-healthy outcomes system. And since Medicare has far lower administrative costs than private health insurers, we should make Medicare available to everyone. 6. Social Security is a Ponzi scheme. Don't believe it. Social Security is solvent for the next 26 years. It could be solvent for the next century if we raised the ceiling on income subject to the Social Security payroll tax. That ceiling is now $106,800. #$%$ unfair that lower-income Americans don't pay income tax. Wrong. There's nothing unfair about it. Lower-income Americans pay out a larger share of their paychecks in payroll taxes, sales taxes, user fees, and tolls than everyone else. Demagogues through history have known that big lies, repeated often enough, start being believed -- unless they're rebutted. These seven economic whoppers are just plain wrong. Make sure you know the truth -- and spread it on.” – Robert Reich Please remember, that contrary to what the one percent would have you believe, we are all in this together.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1358345360485</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 09:09:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>16</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358346481722-5</Id><Topic><Title>Economic Lies...</Title><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1358345360485</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 09:09:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Exactly.

A spokeswoman for the Cook County Medical Examiner's Office, Mary Paleologos, said Tuesday that the heads were originally sent from Illinois to Italy for medical research and were returned to the area for disposal as part of the agreement.

The guy who wrote 13 other books in addition to this one, which pis#ed off a lot of people. Yeah, the same guy who said this in the book you reference: ‘If any of those with whom I rubbed shoulders, who are described in any of the following pages, feel ill-served by my account, I can only offer my apologies. I claim no higher truth than my own perceptions. This is how I lived it. This is what I learned.” And let me ask you, who do you think might have criticized him because of things he said, like these?: (quoted from the book): “For twelve years, the Republicans have perfected a strategy to shrink the size of the federal government. They could never have taken on public spending directly; too many of the programs were too popular. So they concocted a different plan: First, they cut taxes. They told the public that tax cuts would inspire so much entrepreneurial zeal that they would more than pay for themselves in new tax revenues. When that didn’t happen and the budget deficit ballooned, they changed the tune. They expressed outrage at fiscal irresponsibility. They called for massive deficit reductions. They talked about the importance of balancing the budget.” And this: “They don’t believe there should be any government except for national defense…They think all we need as a nation is a big military and a few billionaire entrepreneurs.” Or this: “Wall Street is the largest legalized gambling operation in the world.” Of course he received criticism from some people. That’s politics. He also criticized Clinton’s repeal of Glass-Steagal, so he’s an equal opportunity pis#er-offer, so to speak. And your point relative to his editorial that I posted was what, exactly? That Robert Reich is of dubious moral character because you found a criticism on Wikipedia of one of his books, but David Koresh is okay in your book? I know you didn’t say that, but your own criticism is always very selective. Hey, I could understand feelings about Reich something like, “Well, unless he can prove that he can consistently drain the 3’s from outside, I don’t think I want him on my hoops team.” That, I get. But criticizing a brilliant guy like this, and letting “Ubangi-lips” nonsense slide, is beneath you, I would hope. Or, maybe not.

Enforce the background check laws and expand them to gun shows, but to go much farther is a political over reaction. If I hear one more politician justify backing these changes with the comment that 'elections have consequences' I think I will literally throw up. We are rapidly approaching the state where the criminals will be the only ones with weapons and sadly they won't need them.</Msg><Username>winholder</Username><Timestamp>1358371958194</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 16:32:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358371966364-61</Id><Topic><Title>Obama doesn't care - EXPENSIVE</Title><Username>dan2003hr</Username><Timestamp>1358280734614</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-15 15:12:14 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"really worried about your opinion."

"She would have been crippled for life had it not been done promptly." “Again, no reading for context and just further proof of what a complete #$%$ you truly are!” – windandale Oh, Winnie, I am SO sorry that you were offended by that. Please extend my apology to your good friend, Lewcor. I really had no certain proof that Lew paid for his grandson’s girlfriend’s liposuction. After doing some research, I stand corrected. It would appear that Lew actually sprung for a multi-faceted operation for the young lady that involved tongue bifurcation, double nipple piercing, back hair removal, stomach stapling, a frontal lobotomy and palatoplasty for her harelip.Word is the young couple are very happy and considering joining Lewcor’s merry band of anti-semitic survivalists with lavender and jon in a refrigerator box lean-to somewhere in the wilderness. And, no, Eggbert, I didn’t make a mistake of not reading for content. I find it extremely interesting how certain contributors here constantly overlook all the racist, anti-semitic, completely bogus, unsourced garbage that continually appears, while defending dipstick, multi-aliased non-existent characters created simply to be provocateurs. Here are some posts from the clown you are defending, winholder. Lew is simply another of your collection of lunatic sidekicks: “I think the Libyan Ambassador got exactly what he deserved.” “Al Queda was and still is a front for the CIA…” “Oh, did I mention, Goldman-Sachs is the front for the Rothschilds in this country.” “Bush was another front man for those that run the money racket in this country…” “Bin Laden died in 2001” “George Soros has stated publicly that he would "Bring America Down.” “…troops have died in Afghanistan under liver lips…” “About forty of us cleared 3 blocks of these traitors in one of their largest parades. Best day of my life. They ran like rabbits…” “If the freak in the White House follows the orders of his New World Odor controllers…” “Echo hopes to be one of the camp guards in the new gulags being planned for us by the NWO.” “Libs are still in la la land worshipping their black god". “The Kenyan is importing muslims here as rapidly as he can.” “Military used to have a shotgun round that had small brass rods. Like to get some of that. Very effective on mobs…” “The government IS the criminal…” “It's all going to end real soon. It's a short read but I suggest to all that they read Revelations. It ain't going to be nice as the fallen angel we call Satan is removed from power on this earth along with those that go along with his program. Be careful which side you chose.” Yep, Lewcor, the apocalyptic, conspiracy enigma controlling the minds of folks like winholder. Nice friends you have, windandale. I’m bettin’ you like David Koresh also. So, me joking about a non-existent character is dastardly, but saying, “the Libyan Ambassador got exactly what he deserved” is just fine with you? You guys have some very strange values.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1358372581220</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 16:43:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358372730356-65</Id><Topic><Title>Economic Lies...</Title><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1358345360485</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 09:09:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>When you tax consumption in place of income and/or production you reduce consumption and thereby reduce production, jobs, and the opportunity to EARN wealth. We have far too many today that do not and don’t want to EARN their wealth. The government understands that through control of the money, they control the lives of individuals. That is the goal. The contention that less government will narrow the job market and suffocate the economy is just flat out dishonest. As long as government is as far-reaching and controlling as it has become, there can be no 'efficient' government. When health insurance is made to be truly competitive business and without government intervention, it will become more cost effective.</Msg><Username>ssdependent</Username><Timestamp>1358372730356</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 16:45:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358372911498-66</Id><Topic><Title>Economic Lies...</Title><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1358345360485</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 09:09:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And for decades, Congress has declined even moribund attempts to control or reform any of those costs and management.</Msg><Username>ssdependent</Username><Timestamp>1358372911498</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 16:48:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>11</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358373072225-67</Id><Topic><Title>Obama doesn't care - EXPENSIVE</Title><Username>dan2003hr</Username><Timestamp>1358280734614</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-15 15:12:14 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The health reform law is paid for.

It is paid for. It is projected to reduce the deficit by $210 billion over the next 10 years. Search for an article titled "Will health reform ruling help or hurt deficits?" on CNNMoney. Here's a quote: "The CBO estimated last year that the federal government would spend about $1 trillion to provide subsidized insurance to low- and middle-income families between 2012 and 2021. But on balance, because of the law's many cost-reducing measures and targeted tax increases, deficits would be reduced by $210 billion, the CBO estimated." Paid for, with taxes and savings. Look, you can't have your cake and eat it too. You can't say it is the largest tax increase in history AND that it is not paid for (as conservatives are wont to do). The fact is that it is paid for and it is nowhere near the largest tax increase in history.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1358375057173</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 17:24:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358376655536-71</Id><Topic><Title>Economic Lies...</Title><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1358345360485</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 09:09:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You were just reborn and the year is 1920.
