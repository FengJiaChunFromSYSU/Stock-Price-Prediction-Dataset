Using their own micro and macro analysis, they conclude that, at going prices, the shares offer value; 2. Indication that they have strong cash flows to support such moves; 3. Better use of the cash;and 4. As I have stated in the past, AT&amp;T is a blend of a utility, because it pays a high dividend, and a high tech because of the AT&amp;T Labs incorporates the latest technological innovations to data "security" and transmission. The author does not cite this unique differentiator in his coverage. Last, Apple has accumulated a substantial amount of cash earning next to nothing. The shareholders are correct to strongly object to the strategy of doing nothing with the cash. They could make a better use of the cash either to enter new markets and if not return the cash to the shareholders. Doing nothing does not work, not even while we are at home.</Msg><Username>convergent_series</Username><Timestamp>1361356988543</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 05:43:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361361770555-2</Id><Title>Featured stock ILNS getting ready for big move!</Title><Msg>trend upward!</Msg><Username>binaxk</Username><Timestamp>1361361770555</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 07:02:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361365330485-3</Id><Topic><Title>Featured stock ILNS getting ready for big move!</Title><Username>binaxk</Username><Timestamp>1361361770555</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 07:02:50 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>At 12:10 p.m. yesterday your ILNS was at 2 cents per share,with a close of same, a prev. day decline of 12 cents per share ...

I know dozens of folks that can't stand Obama or his ideology and not one of them retains this opinion because of his color. The economy is in the tank, still, because of actions mostly held on to or generated by liberals. Unemployment is still basically unchanged over the past four years. Government waste is still as rampant as ever. Hostilities between the governing parties in Washington is actually worse than before he was elected in spite of his phony 'can't we all get along' speeches. We are about to go broke, if we haven't already, and his solution is to spend more, tax more, spend more and the repeat. How much of that do you think is caused by his race? Zero. It is because he is a closet, soon to come out, socialist and a power hungry politician that is after his place in history and the rewards that he expects will come with it. He is not a champion of the people, any people...he is the champion of the wealth, legacy and power of Barack Obama. It really is that simple. People don't like him because of his actions or lack of and because he hasn't done what he promised, not because he is black.</Msg><Username>winholder</Username><Timestamp>1361376081972</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 11:01:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361376262108-14</Id><Topic><Title>Ban Democrats from guns</Title><Username>usganut</Username><Timestamp>1361229733682</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-18 18:22:13 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ah, yet another liberal with complaints about spelling versus the subject of the post or a discussion of the points raised.

Have they? Will they? Why haven't they? Are they willing to let what they are calling the worst cuts EVER to simply go into effect without a fight? Yes! They will allow what they say is a faulty fiscal decision to go forward for the sake of winning and having the opportunity to scream 'I told you so' and blame a further economic strain on our economy on the 'other guys'. It is about winning and blame, not good governance; they know and won't give up the fight unless they get their way. We have spending problems and yet the President in his efforts to talk down to the Republicans and ask the people, who he knows can’t do anything about Congress, from different sites all around the country. Doesn’t this supposedly intelligent man understand today’s communication channels? Is he not aware that he can make these speeches from the White House and still get as much press coverage? Why does he have to fly around the country in one of the largest jets ever made to accomplish this simple task? Now I can sit back and wait for a responding idiotic post that will claim I am racist because I don’t want a black man to use the plane.</Msg><Username>winholder</Username><Timestamp>1361377111358</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 11:18:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361377188511-16</Id><Topic><Title>Ia Obama redesigning the message board?</Title><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1361288425832</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 10:40:25 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well, I wouldn't be offended by someone calling me a guy. But, then again, It's fair to say I'm not overwhelmed with political correctness. However, it is fair to say I have little to no respect for H. Clinton after Benghazi. She was responsible for those American lives and her failure to act decisively resulted in their death. When that attack started she should have been standing on someone's desk demanding that our embassy be protected including getting Obama out of bed, if necessary. It appears she didn't act in any meaningful way and we lost four people. Even as Secretary of State, wringing your hands doesn't get it when lives are at stake. It was a terrorist attack that could have been fended off if she would have gotten off her tail. Echo, we didn't try to save those people. I find that a travesty.

OK let's do the math: o Average salary for federal employee = $100,000.00 o Average number of days worked during a year = 22 days per month times 12 months or 264 days o Average pay per day = $100,000.00 divided by 264 or $379.00 per day o Average savings from each furloughed employee = 22 days times $379.00 per day or $8,338. 00 per employee o Approximate savings realized = 800,000 employees furloughed times $8,338.00 per employee or about $6.67 billion o DOD employee pay remaining after furlough deduction = $100,000.00 minus $8,338.00 or $91,662.00 In summary: o The government saves about $6.67 billion by giving non-military DOD employees 22 days of unpaid vacation. o The average non-military DOD employee takes about an 8% pay cut for days not worked I guess I'm pretty hard hearted, but I'm having a little trouble having sympathy for someone who still has their $100,000.00 job, their government pension plan, their government health insurance, their accrued sick days, their accrued vacation days, and other perks.

That said, simply because something is said on a conservative radio to TV station doesn't mean it is wrong or inaccurate, just not to your liking, and mostly these days, there a very few here that care what you like...or think. Obama’s latest gambit about the layoff because of the cuts would be entertaining if he weren’t lying through his teeth and misstating the real impacts of what was originally his idea. But of course it was his idea and he thought a good one, until after the election. Now it is the miserable Republicans that want us all to die a slow, penniless death.

"Already some in Congress are trying to undo these automatic spending cuts. My message to them is simple: No," Mr. Obama said from the White House briefing room Monday evening. "I will veto any effort to get rid of those automatic spending cuts to domestic and defense spending." "There will be no easy off ramps on this one.," he added… "Some in Congress want to undo those cuts, particularly to defense spending, but Mr. Obama said he would not accept that. He called on Congress to come up with a deal in the next year to avoid that." "One way or another we will be trimming the deficit by a total of at least $2.2 trillion over the next 10 years," he said. "The only way these spending cuts will not take place is if Congress gets back to work and agrees on a balanced plan to reduce the deficit by at least 1.2 trillion dollars. That’s exactly what they need to do." After yesterday's speech in front of law enforcement officers, I am really confused. After coming up with the sequestration plan in the first place, is our "dear leader" for sequestration or is he against it? "In your hear you know he is right."
