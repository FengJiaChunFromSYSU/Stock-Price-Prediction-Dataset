It is perfectly within your mother's right to ask the nearest person for advice.) F. That this, overall, leads to more votes for Democrats, because I guess all nurse aides are unethical Democrats. G. That election officials have never thought of this and haven't taken steps to address it. (You should call your State Election Board about election problems.

You going to blame that on Obama too? This year, Aetna raised some rates 11.9%. If anything, annual rate increases in California are getting lower. The increases are only for some people in the individual and small group market. The insurers claim rising medical costs, critics claim that insurers are gaming the system before health reform goes into effect--trying to move higher-cost (older) members into lower-benefit plans by manipulating prices. Once health reform is in place, this sort of manipulation will be much more difficult. Conservatives are trying to prime the propaganda pump in advance of implementation next year. We do know that, before subsidies, premiums will rise for a select group of people in the individual and small group market. We also know that these same people will have access to subsidies and exchanges that should lower their overall out of pocket expenses. They will also have access to better benefits. You will hear conservatives talk alot about premium increases without mentioning the reduction in out of pocket expenses. Dan is right though, many of the changes are designed lower the cost of paying for boomer health insurance. Dan seems to think this will work, but the rest of the law is a SNAFU. I think he's wrong. Romneycare/Obamacare are great plans. But if Dan thinks the Republican plan is so bad, why not go single payer?</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1363370068341</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 13:54:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363371083655-33</Id><Topic><Title>Detailed AT&amp;T Research Report !!!</Title><Username>ashleyjones221</Username><Timestamp>1362156250127</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 11:44:10 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Awesome info , thanks !</Msg><Username>reese.donna</Username><Timestamp>1363371083655</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 14:11:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363371520200-34</Id><Topic><Title>Guess Who</Title><Username>lv66vette</Username><Timestamp>1363296073605</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 17:21:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"How could you miss that part of the post?"

Funny, I know and you know that the CA rates are being raised more than your 11.9% and what is clear from your spin is that you are hiding the CA headlines citing 20%+ requests. Are you out of touch or lying? I vote for the latter. By the way, I have not rendered an opinion on what will or will not work. It is what you asked for, now you SPIN SPIN SPIN. Why did you leave out the other Ca firms that made the headlines last week asking for 20%+ increases? Why not cite the premium increases and demonstrate to all that the offset is a negative in that payers will be paying MORE. Poor widdle wicky spinning again. The millennials, Xers, Yers and more voted for it, then, you get what you asked for. Not a real concern to me. I can afford it. It is nice to see that that lazy goof finally, after 4 years bought someone lunch.</Msg><Username>dan2003hr</Username><Timestamp>1363372987869</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 14:43:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363373217260-36</Id><Topic><Title>Hey! what's the matter with T today?</Title><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1363355725971</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 09:55:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I have an order in to buy 10 more 38 call contracts at 15 cents.

The top premium increases in California in 2013 are still much lower than in 2010 and affect fewer people. You are wondering why I picked Aetna. Why do you pick the highest premium rate increases in the state with the highest increases? Clearly these are outliers. In the last three years health cost increases have slowed substantially. Although the economy is one cause many also point to some of the earlier-implemented aspects of health reform as having an affect--specifically some of the payment reforms in Medicare &amp; Medicaid that are permeating the whole health system.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1363374914136</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 15:15:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363376673605-39</Id><Title>Employers Blast Fees From New Health Law</Title><Msg>Just another fee that will only be passed on to the American taxpayers. http://finance.yahoo.com/news/employers-blast-fees-health-law-030400728.html</Msg><Username>low_mac</Username><Timestamp>1363376673605</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 15:44:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363376841347-40</Id><Topic><Title>GREED MADE ME LOOKK STUPPIDD!!</Title><Username>rddr2022</Username><Timestamp>1363017138355</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 11:52:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Beginning to look like next week may be your chance.

"Companies and other plan providers will together pay $25 billion over three years to create a fund for insurance companies to offset the cost of covering people with high medical bills." "Boeing Co. and a union health plan covering retirees of General Motors, Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler, among other groups, have asked federal regulators to exclude or shield their insurance recipients from the fee." "Of the fees collected, $20 billion will go toward paying high medical claims. HHS says the remaining $5 billion will be used to retroactively offset an earlier program that reimbursed employers insuring early retirees through 2011.
