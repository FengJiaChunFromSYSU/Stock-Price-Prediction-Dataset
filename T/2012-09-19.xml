He gets caught pandering to his fellow millionaires that the 47% of Americans who pay no Federal Income Tax are ALL nothing but lazy, worthless, parasites leeching off society…the standard Republican mantra that attempts to label the victims of their own economic policies as simply ne’er’-do-wells with no measure of personal responsibility. And then lackeys like rob and jon come on here foaming at the mouth about how this has “Super Energized his Base” with this pack of lies. So again, I invite them to refute these statistics that make Mitt look absolutely silly: Of the folks who paid no personal Federal Income Tax: 61% of them paid PAYROLL TAX. These are not the stereotypical welfare state people that the Republicans want you to believe are all on the dole, homeless, drunkards and drug addicts. They are hard working folks, many in low paying jobs that make society run. Some are your friends and neighbors, raising families and trying to live the American Dream. And they pay an average of 15.3% of their income in payroll taxes. That’s 15.3% ! Compare that to the guy who made these accusations, Mitt Romney, who paid 13.9% of total taxes for 2010. Of course, while he’s criticizing others, he hides most of his tax returns. Of the others who paid no income tax: 22% are the Elderly. I guess when you’ve worked all your life and try to enjoy your remaining years, somehow you should be expected to finance the tax cuts for the wealthiest 2 %. 17% are students and the disabled, many of them disabled veterans who served this country only to be treated with viscous scorn and derision from a guy who supposedly wants to serve his country as President. Except he tells us he doesn’t care about these folks, many of whom are Republicans. Yes, indeed, it was a VERY straight forward speech, which succinctly sums up the huge differences in today’s political philosophies. And Paul Ryan’s Budget concept would only make matters worse. David Stockman, Ronald Reagan’s Budget Director said this just last month: “In short, Mr. Ryan’s plan is devoid of credible math or hard policy choices. And it couldn’t pass even if Republicans were to take the presidency and both houses of Congress. Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan have no plan to take on Wall Street, the Fed, the military-industrial complex, social insurance or the nation’s fiscal calamity and no plan to revive capitalist prosperity — just empty sermons.” Empty sermons won’t save Mitt Romney from his continuous chain of gaffes. This one’s over, kids.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1348056176118</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 08:02:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348063054605-2</Id><Topic><Title>COULD WE POSSIBLY WANT A MUSLIM PRESIDENT</Title><Username>sayuthink</Username><Timestamp>1347982764850</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 11:39:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>WE want a F'ng HONEST PRESIDENT you F'ng #$%$ WE want a poloticians with a sense of civic honor and integrity and NOT F'ng CAREER politicians in SELF PRESERVATION MODE.

He simply stated there are people that because of their lot in life, color, and/or political leanings are never going to vote for him. You can’t quarrel with that point. He never said he didn’t care about them as citizens, only that it was a wasted effort to spend much time and money on trying to change their minds. Obama’s plan, and people can argue about the what makes up the 47% all day, is to keep those dependent on the government in that position and to do all he can to increase the size of that population. In his mind anyone that is successful, let alone rich (sans those contributing to his campaign) had to have done something especially criminal and dishonest to have achieved that success and possible wealth. Unless you're a Hollywood liberal and you’re rich, you’re evil and corrupt and the government has every right to proceed with taking a proportion they determine of what has been stolen from the poor and give it back to them. He is a demented soul that believes in a socialist system and wants all of America to live under that philosophy if they want to or not. He is not only infatuated with the dreams for his father, but I believe tormented by those same dreams. Like the new 'Spring" leaders in the Middle East, he knows that the way to power and control is though elections. He won, and he should get to exercise his power in any way he so desires.

You may wish to review the evidence: blogsDOTreutersDOTcom/taxbreak/2012/09/12/which-tax-cuts-stimulate-the-economy/ Of course, the best evidence is the surplus we had at the turn of the century, along with the accompanying economic boom. It was brought about by reasonable tax policy and limiting the growth of government spending. Even you should understand that, even if trickle down works in some circumstances, there is some limit. That at some point lower taxes does not result in higher tax revenues. (I can't believe I even had to write that sentence). In any case, any moral argument you think you have against redistribution downward is moot if your answer is redistribute up. You are not for fairness or a free market. You are for redistribution.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1348103289814</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 21:08:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348103871350-39</Id><Topic><Title>Obama says he believes in redistribution</Title><Username>art_bell51</Username><Timestamp>1348073752677</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 12:55:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>According to an analysis of Obama’s tax returns by White House Dossier, the Obamas gave only in the range of 0.4 percent to 1 percent of their adjusted gross income to charity during a time when they were multi-millionares Meanwhile, Vice President Biden has not allowed political considerations to affect his stinginess.

The numbers from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office are significantly higher than a previous projection by the same office in 2010, shortly after the law passed. Obama pledged not to raise taxes on individuals making less than $200,000 a year and couples making less than $250,000. And the budget office analysis found that nearly 80 percent of those who'll face the penalty would be making up to or less than five times the federal poverty level. Average penalty: about $1,200 in 2016. "The bad news and broken promises from Obamacare just keep piling up," said Rep. Dave Camp, R-Mich., chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, who wants to repeal the law. There was no immediate response from the administration. The budget office said most of the increase in its estimate is due to incorporating the effects of new federal legislation, as well as higher unemployment and lower wages. Starting in 2014, the new health care law requires virtually every legal resident of the U.S. to carry health insurance or face a tax penalty. The penalty will be collected by the IRS, just like taxes. The budget office said the penalty will raise $6.9 billion when fully in effect in 2016.</Msg><Username>geoff_holt_2001</Username><Timestamp>1348106076765</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 21:54:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348108742002-42</Id><Topic><Title>Obama says he believes in redistribution</Title><Username>art_bell51</Username><Timestamp>1348073752677</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 12:55:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama wants to take your money you worked hard for and give it so someone else An audio recording of President Barack Obama surfaced on social media Tuesday in which the president can be clearly heard telling a Loyola University audience that he believes in the “redistribution” of wealth in America, something that his critics have long charged.

They carry Obama's water and will not report anything that might tell the truth about him. No one respects them anymore. If you want the news you have to get Fox News......the other stations just talk about one thing Romney said days ago, and they say it over and over and over.....all while the Middle East is on fire and Americans being murdered. You asked, I am giving you an honest answer. That is why Fox News has more viewers at any given time, day or night, than all the other stations put together. That's where you go to find out the news. That's why democrats hate Fox News......the CEO's of those networks are far left and won't report all the news.
