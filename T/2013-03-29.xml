In other words the criminals in these jurisdictions are very careful to only break local laws, and avoid breaking federal laws. Wow, you are truly the spinmeister. My hat is off to you sir, just when I think I have heard it all, you come up with a story that is so outrageous that even Harry Reid would have to shake his head in amazement, but knowing the sheeple of America at least 47% wil say sure makes sense to me.

Now there’s a rhetorical question if ever I heard one…of course it’s NOT a fact…just more lies from winholder’s band of propaganda loonies. How about if you supply some testimony to back up your above statement, there Winnie? Just once, could you have some facts to back up your hideous claims…is that too much to ask? While you’re searching to find who you claim to be “the majority of local sheriffs”, please note that the caption below the picture that accompanies the below article showing William Kilpatrick, the Chief of Police for the city of Golden, CO, states that he also represented the view of the Colorado Association of Chiefs of Police. Got that, Winnie…he REPRESENTS THE VIEW OF THE Colorado Assoc. of Chiefs of police!!!!! I’m reasonably sure that would, therefore, include “the majority of local sheriffs and other police agencies”. So, just once, if you would, kindly reply with: Either: “I’m sorry, my facts were completely unfounded, and I was totally wrong.” Or: “Okay, you caught me again. I’m simply a paid shill here to confuse people with total nonsense I make up to pimp for the Gun Lobby, despite the fact that 92% of Americans, including the rank and file members of the NRA, support gun legislation. ” I’m sure you have accurate and timely data to reinforce your view…but, hey, did you notice that this article is in TODAY’s Denver Post? Seriously, is there NOTHING that you won’t lie about? Colorado Police Chiefs Group Supports Magazine Ban, Background Checks By Sadie Gurman, The Denver Post, Friday, March 29, 2013 “The Colorado Association of Chiefs of Police supports a state bill requiring background checks for private gun sales, as well as a measure that would ban high-capacity ammunition magazines, the organization's president said Wednesday. "We understand that background checks will not stop all illegal gun sales, but it will stop the many people who easily can possess a weapon who should not be allowed to do so," Broomfield Police Chief Thomas Deland said in a statement. He said criminals are using the "background check loophole" to buy their weapons. "The ability of background checks to reduce homicides and gun violence is significantly diminished by this giant loophole for private firearm sales that criminals and traffickers exploit." The group also supports a plan to ban high-capacity magazines, in part because of data that shows such weapons are often used in the shootings of police officers. Deland said one in five officer-involved shootings involve guns with high-capacity magazines. "When a criminal chooses to use these rapid-fire weapons and their accompanying high capacity magazines, officers have little opportunity to protect themselves," his statement says. The organization formed its stance on a far-ranging series of gun control proposals at its regular meeting last week, where as many as 40 chiefs gathered. "Several chiefs spoke eloquently of how an officer facing a barrage of ammunition was gunned down by these weapons of war and their ammunition. Further, we have little opportunity to protect the public when bullets are flying fast, deadly and numerous," Deland said. Over the objections of hundreds of gun rights supporters, a Colorado House committee agreed with the chiefs on Tuesday and passed a bill requiring background checks for private gun sales and another banning certain magazines.”</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1364562065848</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-29 09:01:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364563736775-4</Id><Topic><Title>they get guns from obama ricky</Title><Username>dan2003hr</Username><Timestamp>1364488419645</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 12:33:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>These here are rabid racists, does no good to reason with them.

On one hand they say guns don't kill people, people do, then in the next breath blame Obama for someone else using an ATF tracked gun to kill. Not only blame the gun, they extend it to Obama as well.

My point is that Wayne La Pierre is full of sh** and so are you. But if you want a reason for why prosecutors may choose to file cases at the state and local level it is because they choose the venue where they think they will get the harshest sentence.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1364564334704</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-29 09:38:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364565018055-6</Id><Topic><Title>they get guns from obama ricky</Title><Username>dan2003hr</Username><Timestamp>1364488419645</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 12:33:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There was no gun running, it was an atf program started in 2006 to track guns to cartels.

As usual you suggest a story unrelated to any facts about anything. What I said about the gun tracking is 100% true, and the useage of the particular gun in question had nothing, zip, nada to do with holder or obama, no more than it had to do with george and laura bush.

As I have stated repeatedly I am providing the information from the very report Wayne La Pierre quoted. Are you claiming the report is right in one instance, but wrong in another? You tell me why the "logic" in the report is flawed in this instance but correct when Wayne La Pierre thinks it will make his case. We all know the answer to that question. You're both FOS. Which is the only conclusion "my logic" added. Everything else is Syracuse TRAC. You don't like it, talk to them. From the TRAC report: "Measuring the total number of such prosecutions throughout the nation, however, is very difficult. This is in large part because the burden of bringing weapons violators to court is thought to fall much more heavily on the thousands of local police departments and prosecutors than the much smaller number federal agencies and U.S. Attorneys. But here, because the statistics collected by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) focus on city, county and state arrests rather than than prosecutions, determining exactly how many gun cases are actually brought to court throughout the country is very difficult. In its latest report, for example, the FBI estimated that while there were a total of 12.4 million arrests for all causes in 2011, only 153,519 of them involved what it called "weapons, carrying, possessing, etc." This number did not include the large number of additional violent crimes which may have involved a gun. And, as just noted, the FBI statistical report does not cover the number of local prosecutions that resulted from local arrests. One thing, however, is clear even from these limited numbers. Because of the very different number of the enforcers and prosecutors working at the two levels, state and local gun prosecutions almost certainly dwarf anything that is done by the federal government."</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1364588933073</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-29 16:28:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364589373354-15</Id><Topic><Title>FLORIDA ATLANTIC UNIVERSITY "Stomp on Jesus"</Title><Username>topwardbound</Username><Timestamp>1364509849860</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 18:30:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You make Jesus sound mean.

Just checking. ‘In your heart you know he is right’." - The Frogg I’m curious, gremlin. Ricky’s point is easy to understand because he backs up his position with factual information from sourced material. You, on the other hand, provide mumbo-jumbo with nothing to back it up other than the infamous Barry Goldwater campaign slogan (which is getting you about as far as it got him.) While we’re on the subject, where’d your pal, winholder disappear to after being caught in more lies this morning. Do you agree with him that the Colorado police officials say they won’t enforce recently passed gun laws (which was sounded refuted)? If you don’t, why don’t you speak up? And while you’re “just checking”, what exactly is YOUR point? That you oppose the modest gun control legislation that 92% of Americans favor? Is that your stated position? How can you come on here and pretend to speak for what benefits Americans when you represent an extremely small minority of the lunatic fringe. That answer is obvious, because you really represent the gun lobby, bought by the gun manufacturers and pimped by the Board of Directors of The NRA…not the NRA members. And check this out. You love the quote, “In your heart you know he’s right.” That tells us you endorse and espouse the conservative views of Barry Goldwater. Very interesting, indeed. Read on, Frog Man: “I’m completely opposed to selling automatic rifles. I don’t see any reason why they ever made semi-automatics. I’ve been a member of the NRA, I collect, make and shoot guns. I’ve never used an automatic or semiautomatic for hunting. There’s no need to. They have no place in anybody’s arsenal. If any S.O.B. can’t hit a deer with one shot, then he ought to quit shooting.” – Barry Goldwater, The Washington Post, 1989 That’s your idol talking to you, frog man. I think it’s about time you quit shooting also, froggie. That webbed foot can only take so many direct hits.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1364590989259</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-29 17:03:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364591096943-17</Id><Topic><Title>they get guns from obama ricky</Title><Username>dan2003hr</Username><Timestamp>1364488419645</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 12:33:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>...Oh, and did I mention?
