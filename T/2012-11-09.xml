Where are these traders getting a better deal. Only a crooked and unethical short seller who is stealing from clients accounts would push the dividend yield much higher than this stock. I would like to know where they are getting a better yield, bonds or treasuries. I know they don't think S or T-Mobile will do much near term. S has about $28 billion in debt and it has just lost over 400,000 costumers. T-Mobile is not that far behind it. If the churn rates increases anymore, new investors are likely going to drop both companies.</Msg><Username>bass9189</Username><Timestamp>1352438828456</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-09 00:27:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352460534794-3</Id><Topic><Title>hey echo you are a liar</Title><Username>ltcolhen</Username><Timestamp>1352415095290</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 17:51:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>... I’m not certain what that second part meant about “option to spend this 2 years in the Marines.” We know you weren’t in the Marines, because, as I said, we already had your number when several weeks ago you listed you serial number (enough digits) that told us you were an Army draftee. So despite your bravado, macho, saber-rattling about the wonderful “all volunteer” army we have today (comprised, as usual of disproportionate numbers of minorities and the poor who are unable to find jobs elsewhere thanks to Mitt’s “job creator”’ shipping all the jobs overseas), you didn’t actually volunteer, but were drafted. I see. So, in other words, you would not have served your country without a draft. So why is it, that with you chicken hawks wanting to start wars everywhere, you don’t see fit to force everyone…and I mean everyone… with no deferments…people like Mitt’s 5 boys…to serve their country in some capacity? It doesn’t have to be the military…two years for all citizens in national service to their country…it could be cleaning up the cities and national parks, aides in schools, fixing the infrastructure, whatever…a national program of service to your country for every citizen, with no deferments for the privileged class, as has been the case up ‘til now. Regardless of your motive, I thank you for your service. I’ll be at the wall Sunday. Stop on by…have rob pick you up in the Prius.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1352460534794</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-09 06:28:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352462447695-4</Id><Topic><Title>Biden Draws 900 at his Latest Rally</Title><Username>robfisk</Username><Timestamp>1352051129695</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 12:45:29 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes you are correct,but he was being kind- giving Bush an opportunity which he failed at also.

What is a speech going to accomplish? As Echo has pointed out, he won. He doesn't need to make speeches, he needs to negotiate, lead, and think. Thus far in his term he hasn't shown the capacity for any of those traits. He thought terrorists would fold at the sound of his voice. He thought the nation would bow down and allow him to do as he pleased (and the Democrats in Congress did). Now he appears to think that the money problems will go away with a speech.

People that voted strictly democrat simply because their parents were democrats and they in turn have always been democrats. 2. People that still cling to the belief that Republicans are for the rich and democrats are for the poor. 3. College kids that voted for Obama and had no clue about anything going on in this country. 4. Black people voting for Obama solely because he is black and white people voting for Obama just to prove they are not prejudiced. 5. People that voted for Obama because they believed the negative campaign ads but never took time to look up the facts. 6. Women that fell for the fictional War on Women. 7. Hispanics that fell for the fictional War on Hispanics. 8. People that fell for the War on the rich and don't have a clue as to who creates the jobs in this country. 9. People on the dole that are too lazy to work and get free food stamps, phones, welfare, etc. from the government. 10. People that have no idea of all of the taxes that will hit Jan 1, and no clue that we go over that financial cliff, they will get nothing....... all benefits as they know them today will be gone. I could list a lot more, but when you really take a look at it, these are all due to stupidity. And those to blame the most are the people that were too stupid to see through any of the above.

Young people today are the children of boomers. They make up a very large chunk of the population, known as the boomer echo. As this group gets older and begins to vote at higher rates and hold more positions of influence, you will continue to see the political grip of the boomers wane, and at a faster rate. This is something boomers have never experienced and I am afraid reality is going to be very harsh for you. Especially if you continue to cling to the type of #$%$ you listed above.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1352491507367</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-09 15:05:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352492187915-34</Id><Topic><Title>Obama Ready To Sign "Compromise" Bill !!</Title><Username>jon3retired</Username><Timestamp>1352485613194</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-09 13:26:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The signing of this pledge you have such concern over is no different that than party caucus meetings the each party has to determine their strategy for a coming Congressional session or about a particular bill.

You seem to forget that existing law is to let ALL of the temporary Bush tax cuts expire. THAT is the status quo. At this point, we can let all of the Bush tax cuts expire as Democrats want, we can let none of them expire as Republicans want, or we can let some of them expire and others remain. Which position is the compromise? You also seem to forget that the Bush tax cuts were considered so extreme at the time--when Republicans had full control of Congress and the White House--that their expiration was explicitly written into the law. Making ANY of the Bush tax cuts permanent is a compromise. Yes, a small group of extremists has relentlessly adopted positions more and more extreme than ten years ago (and ridiculously more extreme by Reagan's standard). By no means does that mean the rest of us will or should follow you off that cliff.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1352494949075</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-09 16:02:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352494983016-39</Id><Topic><Title>Obama Ready To Sign "Compromise" Bill !!</Title><Username>jon3retired</Username><Timestamp>1352485613194</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-09 13:26:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama has offered a budget every year.

Nothing else comes close. On Sunday, April 29, 2012 it will be exactly three years since the U.S. Senate passed a budget. If you own or work for a small business that has a loan from a bank, I'm quite sure your business has a budget -- and a rather detailed budget at that. Every year around tax time, many American families sit down to fill out tax forms, estimate their income, and set spending priorities for the upcoming year. It's the responsible thing to do. And yet, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid appears to believe it is not necessary for the Senate to fulfill its legal responsibility by debating and passing a budget to account for $3.8 trillion in federal spending next fiscal year, $15.6 trillion of debt and, according to figures produced by the Senate Budget Committee Republican staff, more than $65 trillion in additional unfunded liabilities. Ron Johnson To provide some perspective to these incomprehensible numbers, the total net private asset base -- that is, the net value of all household assets, small business assets, and large business assets -- of the United States is $82 trillion, according to figures from the Federal Reserve Flow of Funds Account from March 8, 2012. Even worse, President Barack Obama and his administration seem to view budgeting as just one more political maneuver. His efforts have been so completely unserious that the President's 2012 budget was rejected by a vote of 97-0 in the Senate. And three weeks ago, when Rep. Mick Mulvaney, R-South Carolina, sponsored a budget proposal based on Obama's 2013 budget plan, it lost in the House by a vote of 414-0.</Msg><Username>fwayneh000</Username><Timestamp>1352495702956</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-09 16:15:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352496790201-41</Id><Topic><Title>Obama Ready To Sign "Compromise" Bill !!</Title><Username>jon3retired</Username><Timestamp>1352485613194</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-09 13:26:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"you sniveling sack baby diaper sqwirt .. grow up and put your big girl panties on, the go sniff Obama's Limo seat.

Republicans on the other hand, were more intent on forcing pointless votes or engaging in incessant brinksmanship so hacks like you could post crap like this. Well, you lost anyway.
