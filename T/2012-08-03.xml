The Fast is tipping down already whereas the slow is moving sideways currently. I seriously wouldn't expect the FED to do anything until they get an idea of what kind of inflationary measures Europe will be taking. Don't want to cause too much price inflation or they will sap whatever recovery exists with much higher input costs and even higher burden on the consumers. If the ECB can add some help, why leverage the FED during the election runup? Have to see what kind of impact fiscal cliff/resolution has on the dividend rate-- that might have more to do with the future price of T and VZ than anything going on in the market if people dump the stock because of higher tax rate. Although, even after the higher tax, you'd still see a better rate of return than on Treasuries or much of anything else. Have to see what turns out.</Msg><Username>vwdiesel10</Username><Timestamp>1344018634000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-03 14:30:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344019657000-17</Id><Title>You should get 1 more chance to get out of T when it makes its double top</Title><Msg>You should get 1 more chance to get out of T when it makes its double top</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1344019657000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-03 14:47:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344021152000-18</Id><Topic><Title>Paused, consolidated, and resuming the move higher now!</Title><Username>sblowmeh</Username><Timestamp>1344006058000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-03 11:00:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The volume is so low today that I think we may have hit a plateau and may never drop below $37.
