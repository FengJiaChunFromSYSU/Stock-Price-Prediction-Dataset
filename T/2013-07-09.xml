Focus on an obvious and understandable typo versus the topic of the post or the conversation at hand. This just shows how trivial, befuddled and juvenile are the workings of your brain. Apparently it is missing any connections to common sense and reality. If this is your best response, perhaps you should consider not posting any longer.</Msg><Username>pinhighshot</Username><Timestamp>1373378898728</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 10:08:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373381757267-3</Id><Topic><Title>how do i stop my union from taking dues out of my paycheck</Title><Username>ctmuscles</Username><Timestamp>1373062693186</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-05 18:18:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>my wife was with CWA and then she just quit the union and stopped paying dues it was fairly easy for her.... maybe right to work state has something to do with it TEXAS....now she found a much better job</Msg><Username>rscarbeck</Username><Timestamp>1373381757267</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 10:55:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373386653125-4</Id><Topic><Title>What have we learned today from our MSM?</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1372450034388</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-28 16:07:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>...“Focus on an obvious and understandable typo… “…unless we are on the jury is to shut up and allow the process to pay (sic) out.” Fine with me, golf boy. How much are they paying us? “Where else and why else than Obama's unnecessary comments does this warrant the national attention it is getting…” You know, the reason I joke about your repeated mis-spellings (no matter the alias) is that your content is even dumber than your grammar. You’re suggesting it’s the President’s fault that the media is focusing on this case????? Is that more of your racist nonsense? Was it Clinton’s fault that the media thrived on the O.J. trial? I guess Tricky #$%$ was behind the media circus of the Manson Family. If it hadn’t been for Gerald Ford, nobody would have heard about Ted Bundy, right? This case is in the public spotlight because clowns like you switch back and forth between Greta covering it, Glen Beck telling you it was the President’s fault and Duck Dynasty.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1373386653125</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 12:17:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373387426624-5</Id><Topic><Title>Friday close was 35.83</Title><Username>maingroup</Username><Timestamp>1373290384525</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-08 09:33:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No matter how hard you look beau$39 it won't be saying $39/share - LOL.

Judge , James Robertson .. that served on the FISA Court from 2003 - 2005 .. indicated the FISA Court is a "greatly" flawed Court ... it's nothing more than an extention of the Executive Branch of the Federal Goverment. Oh .. but this Judge served the FISA Court during the "Bush" Administration you say ?? YES he did .. and indicating further that a REAL Court hears arguements from TWO sides .. for fairness, not just the Gov'ts point of view - FACT !! The article went on to state that this Court was GREATLY expanded in 2008 (oh really) to give powers to the F.B.I. Branch of the Fed. Gov't, who's agents did not have to identify themselves (in certain areas). OH NO, say it ain't so ~ EXPANDED in 2008 (??) ... under our new most transparent Obama Administration ??
