Why not practice it versus stand back and admire it? Obama's strain of freedom envisions a people in total dependence on the government for their entire sustenance. The power, the money and the source of all good comes from the government in his world. If you need it the government will provide it, unless of course they have decided that you don't need it. That is not freedom and I don't care how many columns a building has in its facade. The pretense that we all need to worry about is the ideology of this man that wants more time to do more harm to the American way of life and many more of our basic freedoms. You keep your columns; I would prefer to be free. You and many of the other liberals on this board and those that fell for this trap when voting are far too much into symbolism versus reality.

On CNN’s “State of the Union” Sunday show, Jessica Yellin said she interviewed Obama for a forthcoming documentary and asked him why he did not do more outreach to Republicans in the beginning of his term to bridge the divides Obama often rails against. Yellin said Obama told her one of the reasons he did not was because he wanted to spend more time at home with his kids and family. "He was trying to spend some time at home with his family in the evenings and on the weekends,” Yellin said. He does indeed think family comes first, especially his family.</Msg><Username>winholder</Username><Timestamp>1347028502401</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 10:35:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347028739042-8</Id><Topic><Title>Ask yourself - Are you better off now...</Title><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1346964515340</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 16:48:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yep, things are better.

If a Republican doesn't like guns, he doesn't buy one. If a Democrat doesn't like guns, he wants all guns outlawed. If a Republican is a vegetarian, he doesn't eat meat. If a Democrat is a vegetarian, he wants all meat products banned for everyone. If a Republican is homosexual, he quietly leads his life. If a Democrat is homosexual, he demands legislated respect. If a Republican is down-and-out, he thinks about how to better his situation. A Democrat wonders who is going to take care of him. If a Republican doesn't like a talk show host, he switches channels. Democrats demand that those they don't like be shut down. If a Republican is a non-believer, he doesn't go to church. A Democrat non-believer wants any mention of God and religion silenced. If a Republican decides he needs health care, he goes about shopping for it, or may choose a job that provides it. A Democrat demands that the rest of us pay for his. If a Republican reads this, he'll forward it so his friends can have a good laugh. A Democrat will delete it because he's "offended".</Msg><Username>winholder</Username><Timestamp>1347028958664</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 10:42:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347029386895-11</Id><Topic><Title>Demoncrats are hypocrites</Title><Username>ru14u23nk</Username><Timestamp>1346900019997</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 22:53:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"The people who don’t pay federal income taxes are, as the phrase goes, “rational economic actors” just as much as anyone. Like all people, non-taxpayers respond to economic incentives. Their demand for entitlements and government programs is naturally insatiable because they don’t care at all about the cost. Non-taxpayers don’t have any “skin in the game” and are completely indifferent to the government raising income taxes. So they will always support increasing government programs as a long as they get even a small benefit from them because it does not cost them a cent. It’s also perfectly rational for non-taxpayers to support politicians who favor more spending. Non-taxpayers get something for nothing, at least until the country becomes insolvent." More of the Democratic platform...their version of keep them barefoot and pregnant. If you give them enough they will never desert you. Like the old adage, if you give a man a fish, he will soon be hungry again, if you teach him to fish, he will never go hungry again. If you teach a good Democrat to fish, he will just sit in his government furnished boat and drink beer all day. Those getting something for nothing will NEVER vote against the guys giving them their non-earned goodies.

So far, they have not used my suggestion.” – wilkes And this just in; the response from the Romney campaign staff: Dear Mr. Wilkes, We are in receipt of your recent message that you left stapled to the dog house on the roof of Mr. Romney’s Lamborghini. Unfortunately, much like the research and homework you put into your plan, sadly the dog ate most of it. With the tattered remaining remnants, we are able to ascertain that you’re making, essentially, two suggestions. First you want us to obtain some DNA samples from the President to try to support your conspiracy theory that Frank Marshall Davis is actually Mr. Obama’s father. We must confess, while most of our claims are indeed a bit wacky, yours is certifiable, outright lunacy. Forgetting that for a moment, good luck getting some DNA from a sitting President to support idiotic nutballs like yourself – and even if you could, Mr. Davis has been dead for almost a quarter century. I know you are available to take time off from your cubicle job to perform an exhumation, and would believe that you probably would even do it under the cover of darkness like Jerry Cruncher in the Tale of Two Cities. Or, perhaps you could luck into a date with one of his 4 daughters, and clandestinely obtain a hair sample, like Newman. We find your DNA suggestion to be something that only some kind of crazy, maniacal screwball would suggest. Having said that, the DNA suggestion pales in comparison to your next suggestion, which is further from reality. Release 5 years of Mr. Romney’s tax returns?????? Have you come completely unhinged? Now that’s really nutso. Don’t you think that if we could have done that and had any chance at being elected, we would have already done it? Get back to reality, man. Whose side are you on, anyway?

Secondly, five years of Mitts tax returns would only prove his honesty and generosity. The only reason he doesn't want to release them is that the Democrats would just run it through their lie machine and create mountains out of mole hills. Third; there is NO chance that Obama would make the trade because it would expose his book "Dreams from My Father" to be a total fabrication. Some of the research that has been done seems to indicate that Ann was three month pregnant before she first met Obama's "father".
