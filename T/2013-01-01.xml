They publish Foreign Affairs, the premier academic journal on foreign affairs. It is a top level, non-partisan think tank. Of course Bush and Kerry are both members. So are #$%$ Cheney and Bill Clinton, It is an arena where top level officials often debate and formulate foreign policy or articulate their policies and positions. It's purpose is non-partisan research. I don't know what else to tell you. Your conspiracy theories are pretty ridiculous.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1357071992990</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-01 15:26:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357072130734-8</Id><Topic><Title>Grover's cliff...</Title><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1356880373444</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-30 10:12:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"If you recall the Democrats are the ones that insisted on an end date for the current tax rates."

No, you did not. You ran up the deficit and expect your children and grandchildren to pay for it. You can talk about the rich and poor all you want. It is peanuts compared to the intergenerational transfer of wealth boomers have forced on their children and grandchildren. Boomers began running up the debt in the early 1980s. They certainly did not plan for the strain their retirements will put on Soc. Sec. and Medicare/Medicaid. Medicare is broke, Soc. Sec will be by the time I retire, and we are running record deficits--not saving. Our debt is approaching 100% of GDP, spending will rise automatically due to boomers collecting Soc. Sec. &amp; Medicare. When you were young and poor you had the greatest safety net this country has ever seen. When you were old and enjoying the highest incomes of your lives you lowered taxes on yourselves. And you still refuse to pay any meaningful portion of what you have lavished on yourselves. Instead you want to cut what? Food stamps? Education? Transportation? How much more do you want to take from future generations? Pay for your stuff, you ingrate.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1357073028350</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-01 15:43:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357073531690-10</Id><Topic><Title>Why is Obama Giving 17 Fighter Jets to the brotherhood?</Title><Username>robfisk</Username><Timestamp>1356619460727</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 09:44:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"You are already delusional" Yet I still don't think an unholy alliance is secretly running the US.

Martin had a right to stand his ground as well, did he not? Maybe stand your ground doesn't apply if you stand your ground with your fists instead of a gun? Or maybe it doesn't apply if you're black? You tell me why Zimmerman gets to stand his ground but Martin doesn't. As I see it, Zimmerman had a beating coming to him. You all focus on Martin being a dumb teenager as evidence he probably started the fight. Zimmerman is the one with a history of arrests for violent assaults, not Martin. Maybe that doesn't count if you're white? Or if you're the self-proclaimed good guy with a gun? You are right. As it is, only Zimmerman knows the truth. The one who brought a Kel-Tec PF 9mm semi-automatic pistol to a skittles fight. If he hadn't brought a gun both would have been able to tell their stories. Or, more likely, there would be no story to tell.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1357079766228</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-01 17:36:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357081978470-13</Id><Topic><Title>pinhighshot...</Title><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1356614875031</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 08:27:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I am glad you feel you've been entertained, but you've got this backwards. Me and my buddy Obama wanted this case to go to trial, so the facts could be known. Whatever the outcome of that trial, I will be satisfied. It is the other side that thinks it knows enough to prosecute Martin for assault and sentence him to death. And to allow Zimmerman to be judge, jury and executioner in the case. That is unacceptable.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1357081978470</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-01 18:12:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357087676857-14</Id><Topic><Title>Grover's cliff...</Title><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1356880373444</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-30 10:12:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>what I see among these posters generally is people only want to see what they want. They selectively forget specific bills passed under both Bush and Obama that have caused many of this countrys' problems. As a side note, I fail to see why many posters stick up for the republican refusal to raise the tax rate on people making $450,000. I doubt whether any posters here or other boards make that kind of money.</Msg><Username>m.swanger</Username><Timestamp>1357087676857</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-01 19:47:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357092876524-15</Id><Topic><Title>Might be time for a moment of prayer for the good people of Chicago</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1356789009225</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-29 08:50:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"It’s like the Aurora, CO theater story plus a restaurant!" Except for how its different. The gunman was targeting specific people whom he chased from the restaurant across a parking lot and into a theater. He was armed with a pistol, not a semi-automatic assault rifle. If either of those differences weren't true, this gunman would have killed alot of people. There was also an on-duty uniformed police officer in the parking lot. Yet this gunman managed to shoot people in a restaurant, chase them across the parking lot past the on-duty police officer, into a theater, fire shots in the theater and search a bathroom before being shot when he exited the bathroom. Shots were fired in the restaurant, the parking lot and the theater. So, the statement that he was shot before he had "a chance" to kill anyone simply is not true. He had plenty of chances to kill plenty of people. He simply chose not to kill the available targets or failed to kill the targets he did fire on. He clearly had plenty of chances to kill alot of people. So, what I can gather from this is that every time someone shoots someone with a gun, you people will claim there would have been a massacre except for the armed citizenry present. This particular armed citizen was an off duty police officer, Sgt. Lisa Castellano, with thirteen years experience hired by the theater to provide security. She was not simply "at" the theater.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1357092876524</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-01 21:14:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357093299443-16</Id><Topic><Title>pinhighshot...</Title><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1356614875031</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 08:27:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Jon, I cannot keep people from using an ID similar to my own.
