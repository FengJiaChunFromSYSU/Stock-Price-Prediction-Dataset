Now that our Muslim brothers have had an opportunity to live under the heals of the boots of dictators sanctioned by our "dear leader" and his minions, and a new "Arab Spring" is being spawned in places like Tahrir Square, the focus of the MSM appears to have wondered to more important topics like the latest revelations from the hit show "Big Brother" or the lack of DNA on this or that object in the George Zimmerman trial. Hey the MSM could have a point; they covered the first "Arab Spring" 24/7, what could be so different about the second one? Move on nothing to report here. Yes my friends I am sure that it will be a long time before you will get to see the visuals or hear interviews from freedom loving folks who are participating in this new "Arab Spring".

If so, why don’t you say what the article actually said, and not Limbaugh’s goofy attempt to turn it into something else…you are such a tool of the right, unwittingly or not (although you’ve proven consistently to be an intentional liar.) Obama: Man of the World New York Times, by Nicholas Kristof (‘07, btw) “The conventional wisdom about Barack Obama is that he’s smart and charismatic but so inexperienced that we should feel jittery about him in the Oval Office. But that view is myopic. In some respects, Mr. Obama is far more experienced than other presidential candidates.” (Note, frogboy – “myopic” – that describes you to a T.)… “…In foreign policy as well, Mr. Obama would bring to the White House an important experience that most other candidates lack: he has actually lived abroad. He spent four years as a child in Indonesia and attended schools in the Indonesian language… Mr. Obama recalled the opening lines of the Arabic call to prayer, reciting them with a first-rate accent. In a remark that seemed delightfully uncalculated…it’ll give Alabama voters heart attacks…”(folks like frog boy), “Mr. Obama described the call to prayer as ‘one of the prettiest sounds on Earth at sunset’… …Our biggest mistake since World War II has been a lack of sensitivity to other people’s nationalism, from Vietnam to Iraq. Perhaps as a result of his background, Mr. Obama has been unusually sensitive to such issues and to the need to project respect rather than arrogance. He has consistently shown great instincts. So, granted, Mr. Obama lacks the extensive experience at top levels of diplomacy of, say, V. P. Cheney or ... oh, never mind. What sets Mr. Obama apart is the way his training has been at the grass-roots rather than in the treetops. And that may be the richest kind of background of all, yielding not just experience, but also wisdom.” Once again, froggie, your sordid interpretation of events proves exactly what the article says…you clowns are arrogant, insensitive and try repeatedly to intentionally deceive the public because you have nothing else of value to contribute. “…or do what you normally do… respond with another alias, you cowardly phony.” – echo2165 And, frogboy, “In your heart you know he’s right.”</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1372944820604</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-04 09:33:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>15</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372948994274-5</Id><Topic><Title>“one of the prettiest sounds on Earth at sunset.”</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1372938978571</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-04 07:56:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Poor eggo ... you are quoting an article of praise from 2007(??) .. well how is that working for us now (in 2013) - along with the rest of the world's (No-Bama) opinion...

My reading of his post = in 2008 (a failed Arab Spring) - Obama's boasting of his study of the Koran, seemed to open an uncertain door in Egypt, which I honestly understand. It is a Muslim country - Obama tauts his Muslim education, his name is self-evident !! HOWEVER, he overplayed his rhetoric .. thus opening the doors to a difficult unclear interpretation, depending on the group doing the interpreting !! Morsi made pre-election promises, like Obama .. and again like Obama, failed to live up to these promises ,, with several Supreme Court TESTS on our Constitution !! BUT unlike Obama, Morsi blatantly struck down portions of the Egyptian Constitution which would leave him as THE SURPREME POWER, so he would be able to change things as the 'Brotha-hood' saw fit !! The Saudi Heads of State were the first to openly welcome this Egyptian Revolt , as reported by Algeezera .. R.T (Russia) .. France 24 &amp; others .. most was blacked out in Egypt (betcha our MSM didn't report THAT) Also (now) Snowden is holding the 2nd. spot, with R.T. just reporting "who the HELL does Obama think he is ??"

The poll was taken just this week, and you state that 93% of Republicans and 89% of Conservatives are “Extremely/Very Proud” to be an American. Well, there ya’ go…obviously the administration in power is doing a lot to make everyone happy. Gee, it’s pretty bizarre then, that all you do is complain about how horrible things are. Why is that, do you suppose, if all you folks are extremely proud to be an American? Of course the Liberal and Democrats weren’t very far behind in those categories either (76 and 81 percent) and they both had more Moderately Proud than either of your groups. But your silly point, as usual, was to suggest you have the monopoly on patriotism…which is as bogus as most of your other points. And, of course, as proud as you are, the rest of that Gallup Poll, which you conveniently left out, also points out the following: When asked if they believed that the signers of the Declaration of Independence would be pleased of disappointed at how the United States has turned out, quite a different story was told: Pleased – Conservatives: only 15% Republicans: only 12% …… Liberals: 41% Dems:42% Disappointed – Conservatives: 83% Republicans: 86% ….. Liberals: 54% Dems:56&amp; Gee, froggie, for being so proud, you sure are one unhappy lot. You also should look at the moderates in these numbers, but moderation is not in your vocabulary. So, let’s recap. This week over three quarters of all Americans say they are extremely proud or very proud to be an American. I’m glad you pointed that out. Do you know what the numbers from the same poll were back in 2001 were (total)? Who was governing then? Probably not, or you wouldn’t have brought it up. Extremely proud: 55% Very proud: 32% In your heart you know you really need to be more honest with people, Gremlin. Happy Fourth to you and yours.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1372970718959</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-04 16:45:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372971946567-18</Id><Topic><Title>Happy Independance Day everyone</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1372966836591</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-04 15:40:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yeah, but is Michelle proud to be an American yet?</Msg><Username>usganut</Username><Timestamp>1372971946567</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-04 17:05:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372972048346-19</Id><Topic><Title>Will Egypt Lead The WAY !!</Title><Username>echo.2l65</Username><Timestamp>1372726911171</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-01 21:01:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Do you know?
