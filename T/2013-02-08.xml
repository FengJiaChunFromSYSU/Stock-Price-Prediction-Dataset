Do you even know that ObamaCare addresses this problem? That was the whole reason, besides having a mandate, the republicans devised this plan. Now we call it ObamaCare, which is ironic, isn't it? I can't believe how misinformed you are. Pres Obama has even talked about the emergency room problem, many many times. Looks like you agree with the Pres. Where did your ancestors come from, and where in the Constitution does it say the doors are closed now, because I'm here? This is why you right wing extremist guys lost the election, you just aren't smart, and you react to things without thinking.

Part of the money was to come from the interest on student loans. The bill passed was to charge students 6%, now that bill has been changed to reduce the interest rate to 3% but nothing was done about making up the lost revenue that was noted to help pay for Obama Care. You see Congress doesn't plan things well, or maybe they do, but they apparently don't have a clue and no mechanism to keep track of their monetary promises or rules.

The one thing about the printed directories and the accounting practice is that it's not what you sell but what you collect. Of all the mergers to create the new ATT the Babco yellow pages were the worse at managing the bad debt allowing 48 month past due customers to surpass good paying customers in placement in their products. While the WEST and SW managed bad debt and took care of their customers who paid the bills, babco rewarded themselves by taking on unprecedented high precent of bad debt and gave huge discounts to canceling and bad pay customers at the expense of the good paying customers who lost business because of their placement. best decision T could make was let some other business that in not worried about growth but the free cash flow take it over. T still holds a minority stake but does not need to report on the top line that is losing 30% in the largest markets and 15% in the small markets from the backwards country of Tennesee, Alabama.

But it has nothing to do with Obamacare" What a lie, it has everything to do with Obamacare that brougt about changes that will cause employers to drop employee coverage and lay people off to avoid the expense of Obamacare. "You're arguing over projections here, not reality. No additional people are going to lose health insurance." What do you know about reality? You live in the a marijuana induced haze of Obama world . The reality is these projections are optimistic it is really going to be much worse. "Obamacare will reduce the number of uninsured by 34 million people. That is 34 million people with better health at a lower cost to taxpayers." During the debate over his health care reform proposal, President Barack Obama and his apologists in Congress insisted that it would hold down insurance premiums for American families. But despite these promises, Jonathan Gruber, the architect of the plan, acknowledged that insurance premiums would rise considerably under ObamaCare resulting in less people being insured. So it comes as no surprise to see read an IRS report released last week showing that the cheapest health insurance plan under ObamaCare will cost a family $20,000 in 2016:</Msg><Username>ricky1820l</Username><Timestamp>1360344956571</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 12:35:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>14</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360345178298-12</Id><Topic><Title>7 Million to Lose Insurance Under Obamacare</Title><Username>ricky1820l</Username><Timestamp>1360256571061</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-07 12:02:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>please spare us the details of your own medical conditions resulting from you homosexual activity.</Msg><Username>ricky1820l</Username><Timestamp>1360345178298</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 12:39:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>11</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360348194062-13</Id><Title>Obama doesnt care shafts the middle class</Title><Msg>People are now getting their W2's interpreted and are recognizing that that $20,000 to $35,000 in box 12 will be added to their income from which they will have to pay taxes. Think of those two family benefit payers where combined the numbers are often greater than $50,000. That is an increase in taxes. Those with less employees than 250 (might be 200) will be cancelling policies after they add box 12 next year. Some of the true costs will or are greater than some are salaried. As more busineses, can AT&amp;T be far behind, drop private insurance and thus more people are fined (that is not a tax, it is a fee, or a penalty - NOT A TAX) and contribute to shortfalls there is a strong positive impact. Keep in mind this year also that the fee on devices takes effect. Yes, those devices used for hip replacements and knee replacements, etc. Obamacare prices students out of the market. The pudits will tell you that their parents policies will make up for it and the students will get in on their parents work coverage. Oh, isn't that the coverage that the unemployed no longer receive and that the poor don't have anyway and if it is kept box 12 will be higher. Yes, the middle class and below will be hit hard by this regressive fee (remember, IT IS NOT A TAX). Oh yes, I always forget to add, now that everyone is beginning to understand the costs (NOT TAXES), there is a group that will benefit from it all. Yes, the baby boomers. Latest data that I have seen from a survey of insurance companies is that the younger members will see a premium increase over 150% while in the same timeframe babyboomers should see a decrease greater that 20%. So hold your breath when the cadillac plans are fee'd (NO TAXED). Thanks ricky and your fellow supporters. Spin it any way you want. I will take that decrease, after all it was what you and they voted for.</Msg><Username>dan2003hr</Username><Timestamp>1360348194062</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 13:29:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>18</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360348297326-14</Id><Topic><Title>7 Million to Lose Insurance Under Obamacare</Title><Username>ricky1820l</Username><Timestamp>1360256571061</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-07 12:02:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>When all is said and done, that 7 million figure is likely to be much greater, wait till 2017 to start the big drop in those covered.

Mr. Rat was on his way home after spending a hard day at the Bureau of Light Bulbs and Fixtures As he rounded the corner of his street, he found poor Mr. frogg sitting and shivering by the light post across from his home. As he came near, he could hear Mr. Frogg crying out: "I'm cold, oh I'm so so cold, will someone please help me?" Mr. Rat looked down and said: "Oh please Mr. Frogg come with me, I will help you" Mr Frogg said: "Oh thank you Mr. Rat, I will forever be in your debt" Mr. Rat said: "Oh Mr. Frogg not to worry, because I follow the motto of our "dear leader" and his party" Mr. Frogg said: "Oh yes I know his words well, you are a truely good person" Mr. Rat said: "I know" And there you have it, Mr. Rat with his new friend Mr. Frogg going into Mr. Rat"s home. Because of "global warming" Mr. Rat had learned to live a life that left a very small carbon foot print, so much so that Mr. Rat's home was just as cold on the inside as it was on the outside. Mr Frogg said: "Oh Mr. Rat your home is just as cold on the inside as it is on the outside" Mr. Rat said: "I know. I will light my stove, that should warm things up" Mr. Frogg said: "You are a truely good person" Mr. Rat said: "I know" Then Mr. Rat put a pot with fresh water on the stove and invited Mr. Frogg to jump in, because he knew that Mr. Frogg was an amphibious beast and was the happiest when he was in water. Mr. Frogg said: "Oh thank you Mr. Rat, you are truely a good person" Mr. Rat said: "I know, I am just following the words of our "dear leader" The Mr. Frogg asked Mr. Rat if he wouldn't mind turning up the heat on the stove just a little more, because the water was oh so cold. Mr. Rat said: "Not at all, and I will put in some crusts of bread and vegetables so that you may have something to eat whilst you are warming" Mr. Frogg said: "Oh thank you Mr. Rat, you are truely a good person, and would you mind puting the cover on the pot, because it is still quite drafty in your home" As Mr. Rat placed the heavy lid on the pot he said "I know" Later that evening Mrs. Rat came home from her job as the school lunch lady with her two daughters. As the three entered the room, one of the daughters said "Oh father the house is so warm and toastie, and what is that wonderful smell?" Mr. Rat said: "Oh just a little something I cooked up, because I came home early from the Bureau" His daughter said: "Oh daddy you are truely a good person" Mr. Rat said: "I know" Later that evening as the four sat at the dinner table Mr. Rat asked his daughter to say the blessing. His daughter said: "Thank you for our "dear leader" and all of the blessing that he gives us." "Thank you for our daddy and mommy for being good party members" "And thank you most of all for the words of our "dear leader": "From each according to his ability, and to each according to his need" Later that even after eating their fill Mr. Rat's daughter asked: "Daddy that was such a wonderful meal, but how did you get Mr. Frogg to get into your pot?" Mr. Rat said: "Oh my darling daughter you should always remember that Rats are always the members of the party of our "dear leader" and Froggs are always the members of the party of stupid. In other words Froggs will always serve up a Rat's dinner if you just turn up the heat a little bit at a time." "In your heart you know he is right."

"We have a new secretary of state, John Kerry, former senator from Massachusetts. For four years Hillary Clinton served as the secretary of state, and in a moving ceremony today Hillary official turned over the pants suit." –David Letterman “The humor of Dostoyevsky is the humor of a barloafer who ties a kettle to a dog's tail.” – W. Somerset Maugham “The Afghan War has clearly reached a stage similar to that moment at your child's party where you realize you've forgotten to give the other parents a pick up time.” – Jeremy Hardy "This is the first day of Black History Month; or as Republicans call it, February." - Bill Maher “The most preposterous notion that H. sapiens has ever dreamed up is that the Lord God of Creation, Shaper and Ruler of all the Universes, wants the saccharine adoration of His creatures, can be swayed by their prayers, and becomes petulant if He does not receive this flattery. Yet this absurd fantasy, without a shred of evidence to bolster it, pays all the expenses of the oldest, largest, and least productive industry in all history…The second most preposterous notion is that copulation is inherently sinful.” – Robert Heinlein “If you look like I do, it's hard to get a table for one at Chuck E Cheese.” – jon "Iran has successfully sent a monkey into space.

Finally there will be somebody in the tank who will stop and ask for directions." - David Letterman “Late at night in a bar, if you get lucky and go home with some trollop, it’s almost the same thing as murder. Well, you say the same thing after both don't you? ‘Damn I got to get the hell out of here!…What was I thinking’?’ – Dave Attell “Do you think Beethoven had any inkling in even the darkest recesses of his unconscious, when he was deaf and sweating over his Fifth Symphony, that one day it would emit from some idiot’s pocket, and the response would be ‘Oh, s#i*, it’s my mom’?” – Marc Maron “Fox News has their lowest ratings in 10 years. But Fox says it's not a case of them losing credibility. They say it's not because they're now widely seen as a clearing house for discredited ideas. They say it's mostly because of old people misplacing the clicker." - Bill Maher “In the depth of winter I finally learned that there was in me an invincible summer.” – Albert Camus “I am neither a Hindu nor a nationalist. And I don’t need to belong to those or to any specific ideological categories in order to use my eyes and ears…the essence of Hindu Dharma is not ‘tolerance’ or ‘equal respect for all religious’ but satya, truth. The problem with Christianity and Islam is superficially their intolerance and fanaticism. But this intolerance is a consequence of these religions’ untruthfulness. If your belief system is based on delusions, you have to pre-empt rational enquiry into it and shield it from contact with more sustainable thought systems. The fundamental problem with monotheistic religions is not that they are intolerant but that they are untrue (Asatya or Anrita).” – Koenraad Elst “Beyoncé finally admitted that she did lip sync the national anthem during the inauguration. Now Donald Trump is claiming that since she did lip sync, President Obama is not legally president. He said it invalidated the whole thing." – Jay Leno “Learn to bear criticism.

Because they don't care about winning elections. They care about separating rubes from their money. They've discovered there's a fortune to be made by keeping a small portion of America under the illusion that they are always under attack. From Mexicans, or ACORN, or Planned Parenthood, or gays, or takers, global warming hoaxers; it doesn't matter. They don't want a majority. They want a mailing list, a list of the kind of gullible Honey Boo Boos out there who think that there's a War on Christmas, and that the socialist policies of our Kenyan President have been so disastrous that the end of the world is coming." –Bill Maher “What most people don't understand is that UFOs are on a cosmic tourist route. That's why they're always seen in Arizona, Scotland, and New Mexico. Another thing to consider is that all three of those destinations are good places to play golf. So there's possibly some connection between aliens and golf.” – Alice Cooper “I have been commissioned to write an autobiography and I would be grateful to any of your readers who could tell me what I was doing between 1960 and 1974.” – Jeffrey Bernard "According to a new poll, 50 percent of Americans think the country is divided.
