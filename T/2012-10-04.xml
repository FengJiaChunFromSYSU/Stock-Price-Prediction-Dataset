The AARP, which put itself in the middle of the health care debate by endorsing ObamaCare, now is telling President Obama to keep the group out of his political talking points.

On Wednesday Congreess renewed their demand for documents after Clinton declined to hand over the cables they initially requested. The House Intelligence Committee has not received any documents from the department either. The Obama administration raised concerns among Congressional lawmakers that they are pushing off the review's conclusions until after the election and did not address specific allegations that diplomats had warned in advance of security concerns. There are clear signs that security concerns in Libya and other embassies around the world, and what they were doing is diminishing security in the name of normalizing relations. Bengahzi diplomats made "repeated requests" for additional security but were denied. The Obama administration had "about a dozen" intelligence reports within hours of the attack suggesting Al Qaeda-tied militants were involved. Intelligence officials were picking up that it was a terror strike within 24 hours. Libya was a different situation despite the initial claims of the Obama administration.</Msg><Username>ricky1820l</Username><Timestamp>1349369321412</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 12:48:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349369857829-28</Id><Topic><Title>AARP tells Obama not to reference them</Title><Username>ricky1820l</Username><Timestamp>1349367367730</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 12:16:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This is almost like when most of the sponsors pulled out after the Tiger Woods debacle!</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1349369857829</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 12:57:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349369919100-29</Id><Topic><Title>Obama begins policy to deny care to elderly</Title><Username>ricky1820l</Username><Timestamp>1349139815394</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 21:03:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>SPIN tRicky SPIN!</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1349369919100</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 12:58:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349371030873-30</Id><Topic><Title>obama, can he ask for a telepromter next time? lmao</Title><Username>elmaestro111</Username><Timestamp>1349369080408</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 12:44:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>One of the best comments I heard today relates to a rally this morning in Colorado.

"No idea what you're talking about." That was Mitt Romney's retort when President Obama repeated the claim during Wednesday's debate that companies are exploiting a loophole to ship jobs overseas. In one of the most memorable moments of the night, Romney said he's never heard of such a tax break in all his years in business. So who's right? Technically, companies can claim a deduction for the costs associated with moving jobs overseas. However, the deduction is not a special loophole afforded only to companies moving work out of America, as the president sometimes makes it sound. Rather, the deduction is written into the tax code pertaining to any cost companies face in the course of doing business. That means a company can claim the deduction whether it's moving operations to Bangalore or Boston, to Kuala Lumpur or Kansas City.</Msg><Username>ricky1820l</Username><Timestamp>1349371862509</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 13:31:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349375130559-33</Id><Title>Friday is ex-div day..</Title><Msg>Look out below!</Msg><Username>mikerego19</Username><Timestamp>1349375130559</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 14:25:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349375417043-34</Id><Topic><Title>AARP tells Obama not to reference them</Title><Username>ricky1820l</Username><Timestamp>1349367367730</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 12:16:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Say what you will, they are still supporting the Democratic Party.</Msg><Username>davemartin486</Username><Timestamp>1349375417043</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 14:30:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349375844608-35</Id><Topic><Title>AARP tells Obama not to reference them</Title><Username>ricky1820l</Username><Timestamp>1349367367730</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 12:16:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And for that reason, they are losing membership.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1349375844608</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 14:37:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349377898671-36</Id><Topic><Title>AARP tells Obama not to reference them</Title><Username>ricky1820l</Username><Timestamp>1349367367730</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 12:16:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>AARP stated that they do not endorse a candidate.

Since when did Republicans think throwing more money at a government program makes it better? The ACA makes common sense changes to Medicare that save money without lowering benefits to seniors. It cuts fraud, and reimburses doctors for keeping you healthy instead of ordering more tests. And it closes the prescription drug donut hole, without adding to the deficit. What will lower benefits to seniors in the voucher system, and the drastic cuts that Ryan/Romney have proposed to go along with it. If you're under age 60, look out. Like Romney said, he's going to make sure he keeps current seniors happy (they're his base). But he knows his plan for people under 60 is so bad he made it a point to remind seniors several times that his plan won't affect them. The question here is whether you support common sense spending cuts, or don't you? If you don't, vote for Romney. If you do, vote fro Obama. Because this is one of those common sense spending cuts, and Romney is against it.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1349378493490</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 15:21:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349378653093-38</Id><Topic><Title>Obama begins policy to deny care to elderly</Title><Username>ricky1820l</Username><Timestamp>1349139815394</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 21:03:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What spin, coral?

The pundits think he won simply because he "appeared presidential". Nevermind, the math doesn't add up. I think the debate format did clearly set out policy difference, just like the conventions.

AMAC was started by Dan Weber, a high school graduate, (equivalent to a Ph. D. amongst like minded Tea Partiers) who spent four years in the Air Force (immediately out of high school), and then ran his own INSURANCE COMPANY for 30 years. That’s right…his own INSURANCE COMPANY. Gee, now here’s an idea…I can take all the right-wing lunatic fringe insurance business away from AARP if I sound like Rush Limbaugh. From the right wing blog, “Conservative Thoughts and Profundity (now there’s a real oxymoron): “AMAC (pronounced A- Mack)…(editorial aside – Do potential members seriously have difficulty with that pronunciation???)…is one of the leading groups fighting against President Obama’s health care initiative. AMAC has organized “Tea Parties” and participated in rallies against expanding government and raising taxes. AMAC is pro-life, pro Second Amendment, and thinks government has grown too large and powerful. AMAC feels our elected officials are ignoring the will of the people. We need more members so we can have more clout with office holders. We need to counter the influence of AARP when they say they are speaking on behalf of Americans aged 50 and over.” So there you go. Yes, AARP does not endorse candidates, and they properly asked the President to not imply that they do. They state that they “are a nonprofit, nonpartisan membership organization for people age 50 and over ... dedicated to enhancing quality of life for all as we age.” Their membership, however, know and apparently agree with, their position on The AHC. AMAC, on the other hand, apparently doesn’t hold back regarding their political philosophy. There’s no problem with that, mind you, but one shouldn’t present it as a movement something akin to “The Reformation”. Seniors have “caught on” about AMAC???” Yes, if you call “catching on” their current membership which is several, tens-of-thousands of members. That’s about as trendy and popular as a Pet Rock. (Actually, I believe they have a current promotion going that if you join, you get a Mood Ring – but it’s always stuck on “Red-State Scarlett = angry, paranoid and disenfranchised” AARP, on the other hand, has 38 million members. Then again, you never pretend to represent anything other than the privileged few.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1349385227231</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 17:13:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349387536494-50</Id><Title>Dividend</Title><Msg>Last day to own T in order to Dividend is when....When can I buy and sell in order to collect Dividend....</Msg><Username>hrod57</Username><Timestamp>1349387536494</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 17:52:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349388257927-51</Id><Topic><Title>Romney is a Mormon vs. Obama is a Christian, you choose!!!!</Title><Username>jbhdallas2000</Username><Timestamp>1349324334513</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 00:18:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm and Episcopalianstain.

I am a contract employee, and i discovered something that was very unethical and potentially illegal that some company managers are doing. I reported the violations first to my contract manager. he followed up with the contract administrator. When I found more illegal doings that led to the VP in I and M, I was terminated. Funny, I worked for this company as an employee for 28 years, and retired with honors. I have been highly honest and have been a role model for integrity. Stealing is the one that I find appalling that a manager would do. Awarding contracts to family and friends bypassing the RFP process is a violation of corporate principles. This is what i found, and this is what i reported. Now I am paying the price for doing the right thing. It was reported to my contract manager that i am always late (I'm always early), that I don't follow instructions (I am a stickler for detail) and that I don't do my work (I have been commended by some area and district managers for the work I do). I can find some solace in all this though. It is time for me to move on. Honesty and integrity doesn't appear to be the company policy anymore. I am looking forward to some nice fishing, and some trips to the Sierra Nevadas. Right after I disconnect my ATT DSL, and go with Charter, and drop my ATT plan and move over to Verizon.
