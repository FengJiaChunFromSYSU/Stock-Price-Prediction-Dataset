It is certainly no joke. Here in Hesperia, we are totally surrounded by mountains and we have no idea what a 300 mile per hour wind is like. I can't even imagine what 45 minutes of that would be like. I'm sending a donation to the Salvation Army who has sent a team to help. I am afraid the toll will be much greater than 51 with two elementary schools destroyed during school hours. Moore, OK. was hit 14 years ago with a record breaking tornado with 44 killed. Those who remember say this was much worse.</Msg><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1369117407471</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 02:23:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369121051673-2</Id><Topic><Title>The U.S., especially the South has almost been destroyed</Title><Username>lavendarsen</Username><Timestamp>1369005998527</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 19:26:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Emil speaks the truth. The colored races have been invited in to destroy Whites. They are given one thriving city after with the assistance of powerful facilitators. After all the goodies are consumed and/or destroyed they move on to the next White city, like stalkers, taking over and destroying everything they come in contact with. There are only a few cities where Whites are still a majority, and they are in the process of being overrun and destroyed. It is intentional and it is part of the world wide White genocide in progress right now, in plain sight. It is absolutely criminal and sickening. It is facilitated by criminal psychopaths who want to eliminate White Europeans and our culture. Prepare if you are White.</Msg><Username>lavendarsen</Username><Timestamp>1369121051673</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 03:24:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369122146581-3</Id><Topic><Title>The U.S., especially the South has almost been destroyed</Title><Username>lavendarsen</Username><Timestamp>1369005998527</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 19:26:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Lewcor, I read that archeological evidence was found (tools, if i remember correctly) suggesting Europeans may have lived in North America before Native Americans. That they possibly were eliminated by Native Americans. Too many Whites seem to think they are exempt from genocide, they are so brainwashed believing they are guilty of White entitlement and so afraid of being considered supremacist by the colored racists. The colored races are most likely laughing and sneering at their stupidity WHILE THEY TAKE OVER THE COUNTRY. However, for whatever reason, I am not convinced the evil psychopaths working to eliminate us will succeed. Life does have a way of putting even the most powerful and wealthy in their place, just like it does everyone else.</Msg><Username>lavendarsen</Username><Timestamp>1369122146581</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 03:42:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369122700787-4</Id><Topic><Title>Trillions created from thin air OR WHAT?

Wonder why? Part of his deniability measures mostly, if their statements are even accurate. They changed the policy twice and it didn't take? And you can still make a claim of good transparent government with a straight face? Thus far it has been case after case of 'I didn't know', 'no one told me' I knew and had issued orders for that to change, but it appears that no one is listening. Incompetence at is ugliest. Big brother is watching and doing nothing apparently. Liberals are of the belief that big government can solve all our problems and can control our lives better than we can; regardless of the enormous spending and taxation that it will take accomplish this. Take a look at the countries where the government controls most everything that goes on and dictates a good portion of people’s daily lives: Russia, China, North Korea, Iran, Venezuela, and Cuba. Do we really want that much government involvement? I mean elections don't fix it; Russia, China, and Iran all have elections. We need less government in our daily lives, especially when it acts like this current administration.</Msg><Username>winholder</Username><Timestamp>1369146392746</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 10:26:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369146487088-15</Id><Topic><Title>T doing better today</Title><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1369068237898</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-20 12:43:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wilkes .. this a.m.'s vol. is at 10 mil. in the first half hour .. and shares are down ...

If it shouldn't have been made available to the media then you need to find the source of the leak, not the final recipient of the data. Understand now? "The Justice Department advised the AP about the wiretapping after the investigation was complete, as required by law." According to even the liberal MSM media they are obligated to inform them when the investigation starts, not when it is completed. They didn't release the information on their own; they planted a question with a member of the media so that it would come out before the feces hit the Westinghouse.

Well winholder, next time we'll have the FBI consult you before they begin an investigation. "According to even the liberal MSM media" Something that is true is true, winholder. It does not become more or less true based on who reports it. That disconnect is one of your major problems. " they are obligated to inform them when the investigation starts, not when it is completed." Unless informing them would impede the investigation. Read one of those "liberal MSM" articles you hate so much and you might learn something. You should choose your news sources based on which provides the most accurate and full information. You do not decide what is true or full information based on how liberal or conservative you've decided the people reporting something are.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1369148933688</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 11:08:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369148988360-34</Id><Title>All signs point to a huge run in GDTK</Title><Msg>GDTK looks like a winner in my book.

Because a few IRS workers acting improperly at an office in Cincinatti--workers that are already being dealt with--probably do not warrant the President's attention. What do you think the President does? Gets a daily briefing on minor personnel issues from every office of every agency in the Federal Government? Sit around all day thinking about how he can best brown-nose the Tea Party? The Congress could be dealing with serious issues now. So could the President. But Republicans have no intent on allowing that to happen, do they? Nope. We're going to be dealing with talking point edits, one subunit of one IRS office in Cincinatti and a single subpoena for the next two years. Because the best thing Republicans can do to win elections is to fail thier country.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1369149303708</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 11:15:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369149402217-36</Id><Topic><Title>IRS</Title><Username>ltcolhen</Username><Timestamp>1369105480276</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-20 23:04:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Seriously dude.

What human being on any side of the political spectrum would suggest that they want somebody else to control their lives? What a buffoonish statement. You sound like a complete fool when you regurgitate the same gibberish over and over again. And trying to suggest that the President is trying to turn America into Cuba, N. Korea etc. is comically absurd. Crackpots like you and Rush, Beck and Coulter have tried to commandeer the term “liberal” and convert it into another bogie-man scare tactic that they can make millions off of while selling fear, bigotry and intolerance to apolitical dunces Being liberal in no way suggests that “big” government can “solve all our problems and control our lives.” Folks like you and Ann Coulter seem to have this fixation that “size matters”, in government as well as your personal lives. Instead of trying to change the meaning of the word, why don’t you tell us all what problems you have with this?: “Liberalism first became a distinct political movement during the Age of Enlightenment, when it became popular among philosophers and economists in the Western world. Liberalism rejected the notions, common at the time, of hereditary privilege, state religion, absolute monarchy, and the Divine Right of Kings.” Definition: “A political or social philosophy advocating the freedom of the individual, parliamentary systems of government, nonviolent modification of political, social, or economic institutions to assure unrestricted development in all spheres of human endeavor, and governmental guarantees of individual rights and civil liberties.” Social liberalism goes a step further: …”the belief that liberalism should include social justice and that the legitimate role of the state includes addressing issues such as unemployment, health care, education, and the expansion of civil rights.” What part of that scares you so much, winbag...expanding civil rights and helping people get educated? Intelligent people understand that we live in an imperfect world and that there is a legitimate role for government to play in providing access to an equal chance for life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness for EVERYONE, not just those of a certain class, socio-economic status or members of the oligarchy through birthright or inheritance. Your problem is that in trying to protect the status quo of the good old boy network of the 2%, you attempt to malign everyone else, as Romney did with his 47% comments. Throwing out your repeated clichés under multiple aliases reveals your true intentions. Not even knowing the definition of liberalism indicates even more about your character, intelligence and ethics or lack thereof.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1369149754061</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 11:22:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>13</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369152681246-39</Id><Title>Wow!

And again you miss the point because instead of reading what was said, you were more interested in crafting what you think is witty reply, though off the mark. I didn't say that people want their lives to be controlled by others, but that our government believes that it is best if they do. Those government lackeys are wrong and the examples I cited are excellent illustrations of what happens when government runs the lives of their populations. And yes, if granted the power and without resistance that is exactly what I believe Mr. Obama would favor. Yes, I agree there are idiots on the left. You must have discover this when you passed by a mirror.</Msg><Username>winholder</Username><Timestamp>1369168222855</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 16:30:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369168597032-68</Id><Topic><Title>Hey Ricky</Title><Username>ltcolhen</Username><Timestamp>1369167199224</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 16:13:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I don't care. By the time McDonough was briefed the situation was over. The Inspector General report was set to be released but the situation had already been handled internally by the IRS. I do not expect the President to waste his time on things that have already been handled, nor do I expect the Chief of Staff to waste the President's time on such matters. Is this going to be another situation where the facts of the supposed "wrongdoing" don't matter, but you spend months braying about what the talking points said when? You want to know what I really think? Fox News decided they weren't earning their paychecks by reporting on stock market records so they went scandal hunting. You sheep are bleating right along like you always do.

I have voted for several moderate Democrats in local and state elections and in the past I have voted for Democratic Presidents but not since Clinton 1. I find it strange that as you rant about people no paying for their stuff when you continually demonize the older generation that has paid their share of taxes to support those promises that Democratic Presidents have made, while at the same time supporting a Democratic Party that wants to give more and more of your tax dollars (assuming you even pay taxes) to so many that have not contributed many tax dollars to any government programs.

What in the he** do "the airwaves" have to do with anything? By the time McDonough was briefed the policy &amp; criteria used by the Cinnicinnati IRS office to identify applicants for further scrutiny had been changed. That is what is important here, isn't it? "promised that HIS administration would be totally open and transparent." Where do you think this information came from? The Treasury Department Inspector General's Office in a public report and from a press conference with an IRS staffer. "He knew and said nothing" So what? Just because you have your undies in a twist does not mean the President needs to interrupt prime time. Grow up.
