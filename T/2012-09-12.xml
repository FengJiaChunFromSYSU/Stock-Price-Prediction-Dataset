WHY ARE THEY SEALED FROM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ! NO OTHER PRESIDENT HAS EVER SEALED THEM BEFORE” – another birther-nut shouting in ALL CAPS In a column entitled, “How They Did in Law School”, published Dec. 22, 2011, New York Magazine said this: About Obama: “(At Harvard Law School)… he became a research assistant to Laurence Tribe, a renowned professor working on an article applying physics to the law. ‘I thought … his talents are such that there's no ceiling to what he could achieve — and that included becoming president of the United States," Tribe told New York. ‘He's the only student about whom I've ever had that thought.’ By the end of his first year, Obama had won a position on the Harvard Law Review, widely considered the most influential and prestigious law publication in the nation. In 1990, Obama earned national recognition for the first time when he was elected the Review’s first black president. Obama graduated MAGNA cum laude and moved back to Chicago.” About Romney: “Romney enrolled in a joint program at Harvard Law School and Harvard Business School. At law school, he graduated cum laude, doing quite well with one particularly prominent professor: Supreme Court Associate Justice Stephen Breyer, who taught Romney antitrust law.” A quick review for you Birthers who are clamoring about seeing Obama’s grades, yet normally ridicule education and want to do away with the Dept. of Ed. Romney - Cum Laude (Latin for “with honor” – generally a GPA of 3.5 to 3.74 Obama MAGNA Cum Laude (Latin for “with great honor) - generally a GPA of 3.75 to 4.0 We know you can barely read English, let alone Latin, but how are you with basic math? Let us help you. 3.75 to 4 (Obama’s GPA) is higher than 3.5 to 3.74 (Romney’s GPA) at Harvard Law School. I hope this answers your question. Now could you return the favor? Where are Mr. Romney’s tax returns and what is he hiding? Are you seriously going to vote for a candidate who knows he’s being called a vulture capitalist, but still won’t show his tax returns to disprove those charges? Now there’s a rhetorical question. Of course you are. Your problem is that not too many other middle-class folks will be joining you in November. Keep at the birther nonsense – it’s served you well thus far (if your goal was to look really goofy and alienate yourselves from sane people) - but this one’s over, kids.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1347457276444</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 09:41:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347457595549-4</Id><Topic><Title>Message Board Poll:</Title><Username>mikerego19</Username><Timestamp>1346442280000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 15:44:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If Obama wins the market will drop like a rock.

Obama offers thanks to the Emir of Qatar--showboating some rather halting Arabic skills in addressing "His Highness Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani"--and praising the inspiring democratic example of the Arab Spring, which happened to leave the absolute monarchy of Qatar untouched. He also offers support for his envoys, including Attorney General Eric Holder, who is attending the Arab Forum conference as the chief U.S. representative. The Arab Forum's goal is to recover assets stolen by formerly autocratic regimes, including Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya. (But not Qatar.) The video, posted on the White House YouTube channel today, makes no mention of 9/11, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood, or the role of Qatar-based Al Jazeera in broadcasting radical anti-American propaganda. And while offering support for democratic change, Obama neglects to ask the Emir to step aside. Ironically, Obama caused a scandal last year when CBS News caught him criticizing the Emir of Qatar after reporters had left a fundraiser in Chicago: "He is a big booster, a big promoter of democracy all throughout the Middle East...He himself is not reforming significantly. There is no big move towards democracy in Qatar." Obama has evidently chosen to make up for the insult--by insulting fellow Americans on 9/11.</Msg><Username>geoff_holt_2001</Username><Timestamp>1347461864823</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 10:57:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347462124654-8</Id><Topic><Title>9-11...Please no more political junk on this day!!!</Title><Username>ciscokid_1st</Username><Timestamp>1347369351582</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 09:15:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes but Bill Clinton acting as the liberal coward he is did not stop bin laden when he had several opportunities.

The backdrop for a Democratic National Convention tribute to U.S. military veterans was a fleet of Russian warships.The event occurred on the final night of last week’s convention when ships from the Russian Navy were displayed on a gigantic screen . The background shows several ships with radar designs apparently not used in the U.S. fleet. Veteran Rob Barker reportedly said his assignment as an electronics warfare technician included the identification of foreign ships by their radars. Several experts identified the ships as being Russian. The Democratic National Convention Committee was contacted Wednesday but did not comment. The ships are definitely Russian,” said author Norman Polmar, a naval and aviation expert.</Msg><Username>art_bell51</Username><Timestamp>1347465952007</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 12:05:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347467812107-13</Id><Topic><Title>OBAMA SHOW US YOUR GRADES !

From your comment, it is clear you have no idea what that means. I'll also note that by your ridiculous statement, you think the US should have invaded Kenya, Tanzania and Jordan in the 1990s. National security requires cooler, calmer and better heads than yours. For you and Romney to imply the President of the United States sympathizes with Bin Laden for 9/11 and the people responsible for the murder of a US Ambassador and embassy staff is disgusting and divisive-- and at the very time we should be united.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1347500524477</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 21:42:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347500758778-36</Id><Title>First Time Ever, An Illegal Alien Addresses DNC</Title><Msg>It was missed by many, but what Illegals demand, need, of our Dem elected officials, were laid out in great detail. What a deal breaker for me. I'm going to pay taxes, contribute to society, possibly give to your campaign, and you're going to advocate for the citizens of another country. A country, like Mexico, rich with oil, natural resources, and endless supplies of poor, desperate people, taking all of our jobs.</Msg><Username>robfisk</Username><Timestamp>1347500758778</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 21:45:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347504957643-37</Id><Topic><Title>President, or Community Organizer</Title><Username>robfisk</Username><Timestamp>1347496823010</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 20:40:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I also hear you believe in the tooth fairy.</Msg><Username>minnflier</Username><Timestamp>1347504957643</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 22:55:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347505026410-38</Id><Topic><Title>President, or Community Organizer</Title><Username>robfisk</Username><Timestamp>1347496823010</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 20:40:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Maybe not in his first term, but the second GHWB was in charge, or was it Nancy?</Msg><Username>minnflier</Username><Timestamp>1347505026410</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 22:57:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347505358593-39</Id><Topic><Title>President, or Community Organizer</Title><Username>robfisk</Username><Timestamp>1347496823010</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 20:40:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Barry is head and shoulders above Rummy, did you see his grades.

He should have made himself available to answer question about an attack on what is considered American soil, instead he runs off to Las Vegas to hide. This is inexusable Americans want answers. The Obama admin knew this attack was likely since he had embassy officials issue one of his trademark appoligies prior to the attack instead of acting to protect the embasy staff.</Msg><Username>geoff_holt_2001</Username><Timestamp>1347505657715</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 23:07:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347507429892-41</Id><Topic><Title>OBAMA SHOW US YOUR GRADES !
