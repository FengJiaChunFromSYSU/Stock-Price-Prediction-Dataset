The guy is just shorting the stock up top and doing quick turn around trades to bring down the price on unrelated market news. T does not have much risk exposure to the eurozone, Italy or the yen. A trader just created artificial weights on the company and he push down the stock to gain from his bets against other investors ( likely someone clients). Also, this nonsense may be related to the Soft Bank move on S. Regulators should keep a close watch on this stock to insure that foreign companies are not trying bet against T while using S. They should be look at the total amount of spectrum a foreign company will control from the close of a S deal. That deal also should not go through without major restrictions for security reasons. Something does not seem right here. I smell a major short seller is involved in this nonsense. Right now he is trying to range bound this stock price with hopes of using a high risk S deal to push it down. S will still find it hard to compete in this market will only $20 billion in new investment and a high debt load. That money will likely be gone in 2 years, especially if it tries to expand or improve its network while paying off debt. This stock should be well on its way to $38 a share.</Msg><Username>bass9189</Username><Timestamp>1361859780653</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 01:23:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361865426638-4</Id><Topic><Title>Republican Accomplishments</Title><Username>lv66vette</Username><Timestamp>1361625594937</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-23 08:19:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think the problem is that we have not had a true economic policy in years. I also think that aggregated income will key the key to global economic growth. Th raise in incomes and the expansion of incomes should the most important point of any plan for growth. Central to all economic theories is the growth income income levels and the expansion of income. Taxes are created through income and consumption/demand is also related to incomes. Savings and investments are also directly related to incomes. We can theorize the Laffer Curve in many different ways but the fact is that a decrease incomes will result in a decrease tax revenues. High unemployment will make it worse with aggregated incomes decreasing and with very little effort to redistribute wealth from the higher income brackets to the poor and middle class.. We should maximizing income levels with a balance tax policy to close the deficit gap instead of engaging in policies that promote self interest. of a few or a pure capitalist system. Aggregated income levels is the the key. Put the money in the hands of many who consume and taxes, they will put pressure on supply which with create more household incomes.</Msg><Username>bass9189</Username><Timestamp>1361865426638</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 02:57:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361879980976-5</Id><Title>Top of the news</Title><Msg>"More than 30 companies worldwide have asked to license AT&amp;T’s Digital Life product, which lets customers watch over their homes for leaks and break-ins from a mobile device, said Glenn Lurie, president of emerging devices, in an interview from the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona."

Because researching policy matters is embarrassing. Why research? Policies should simply channeled fully formed from corporate lobbyists through Rush Limbaugh and directly into your head. Don't think. Don't research. Don't consider. Just repeat. Good trained monkey” - ricky18201 Having followed the antics of this board for quite some time, I wouldn’t give windandale anywhere near as much credit as simply being a Tea Party trained monkey. There are, indeed, many ditto heads being led around on a leash by the likes of organ grinding, tin-cup hustlers like Limbaugh and Beck…their audience being comprised of largely bigoted analphabets too ingrained with fear and intolerance for any rational thinking of their own. But there are also people like windandale and others, whose only purpose in being here is outlandish demagoguery, intended to flame those fears and to continue to try to spread the word of the 2 %, despite having been soundly rejected by Middle America. It’s comical to watch them jump from one alias to the next, responding to themselves, while trying their best to denigrate any form of government and obstruct any meaningful legislation that would better all of America. Why on earth would anyone who is actually included in that top 2% be relentlessly posting on a stock message board 24/7? Listening to winny’s tired refrain here makes you think he’s a direct spokesperson for the Koch Brothers. He’s an advocate for their war against Obama by championing climate science denial, Citizens United, voter suppression through gerrymandering, all while fighting gun legislation, health care reform, economic stimulus or social safety programs of any kind. No, winny is not simply some ditto head. He’s here for a purpose…to spread the message of a no oversight, Laissez-faire system from the folks who thought Mitt Romney represents middle class America and that almost half of Americans are bums. To put it in perspective: “The Kochs are on a whole different level. There’s no one else who has spent this much money. The sheer dimension of it is what sets them apart. They have a pattern of lawbreaking, political manipulation, and obfuscation. I’ve been in Washington since Watergate, and I’ve never seen anything like it. They are the Standard Oil of our times.” - Charles Lewis, the founder of the Center for Public Integrity, a nonpartisan watchdog group (Interestingly, there are actually FOUR Koch brothers. But David and Charles, like all good vulture capitalists, found greed preferable over humanity and funding the Tea Party and Americans for Prosperity far more important than brotherhood.) “You should be embarrassed winholder. You are embarrassing yourself.” - ricky Yes he should be embarrassed, but since when do Wall Street pimps have any conscience?... and, hey, it’s a job. A pretty pathetic one, but it keeps him off the streets.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1361888308336</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 09:18:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361889105266-8</Id><Topic><Title>Is AAPL better than T?</Title><Username>latrobejana</Username><Timestamp>1361829115071</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 16:51:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good job.

The end result is that the government will be spend about the same as last year and only the pace of growth of spending will be reduced. Businesses do this on a yearly, sometimes monthly basis and survive. The end of the world scenario being painted by Obama is a political shock tactic and most Americans know it. What problems there are can be related easily to the lack of a budget for the past three years, the lack of any negotiation skills on the part of many in Congress and other places in Washington. The liberal wing of this government still has not come to the realization that we cannot continue at an increasingly higher level without seriously putting this country in grave danger. This crisis was fashioned in Washington by the members of Congress, their bloated staffs, the White House cabinet staff and the President himself. It will not be resolved in Topeka, or in Virginia. It will have to be resolved in Washington, unfortunately by the same cast of incompetent worms that caused it. The President needs to get his lazy butt off Air Force One, stop the campaign speeches (he won, he told us so on multiple occasions) and get back into his office and meet with the fools that created this mess and see if they can find a way out and will allow them to save some of the little dignity they have left. He is afraid to sit with anyone that disagrees with him and try to work a deal like the one being offered by the Republicans today. He asked for this to protect his campaign efforts and thought he could simply forces a different deal if he won. It’s not working that way for him and he hasn’t the intestinal fortitude to meet the challenge like a man. He is a great speaker (when the advantage of the teleprompter is present) by a man of weak character.</Msg><Username>winholder</Username><Timestamp>1361905483547</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 14:04:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>13</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361905795093-30</Id><Topic><Title>How's that good old liberal tolerance working for you?</Title><Username>pinhighshot</Username><Timestamp>1361562557529</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 14:49:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In a pew in church, while reverently preparing for the service, I heard a little old lady, sitting next to me, quietly whispering a prayer.

Further none of these laws have ever resulted in the improvement of a law abiding citizen's ability to defend himself against well armed criminals. And from an international perspective, the progressive agenda is and always will be the confiscation of firearms from all law abiding citizens. This agenda is well documented and IMHO even ricky would have a hard time disputing it. So IMHO arguing whether POTUS or his party currenty support a federal gun registry is moot, because the real progressive agenda is total gun confiscation, but they will take whatever gun control laws they can get away with whenever they can. This is incremental gun control and is just one of the methods used to achieve the progressive agenda. "In your heart you know he right."

The legend of theological original sin tells us certainly how man came to be condemned to eat his bread in the sweat of his brow; but the history of economic original sin reveals to us that there are people to whom this is by no means essential. Never mind! Thus it came to pass that the former sort accumulated wealth, and the latter sort had at last nothing to sell except their own skins. And from this original sin dates the poverty of the great majority that, despite all its labour, has up to now nothing to sell but itself, and the wealth of the few that increases constantly although they have long ceased to work. Such insipid childishness is every day preached to us in the defence of property. M. Thiers, e.g., had the assurance to repeat it with all the solemnity of a statesman to the French people, once so spirituel. But as soon as the question of property crops up, it becomes a sacred duty to proclaim the intellectual food of the infant as the one thing fit for all ages and for all stages of development. In actual history it is notorious that conquest, enslavement, robbery, murder, briefly force, play the great part.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1361910315424</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 15:25:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361910550206-38</Id><Topic><Title>$ T Featured on MAD MONEY</Title><Username>kevinlee899</Username><Timestamp>1361805521276</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 10:18:41 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Informational report</Msg><Username>smithjoseph529</Username><Timestamp>1361910550206</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 15:29:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361914989555-39</Id><Topic><Title>The status quo won't get it done</Title><Username>winholder</Username><Timestamp>1361905483547</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 14:04:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Status Quo is a kick asz rock group that does get it done Win.</Msg><Username>davemartin74575</Username><Timestamp>1361914989555</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 16:43:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361915182846-40</Id><Topic><Title>The next crisis</Title><Username>winholder</Username><Timestamp>1361476845933</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 15:00:45 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"it was published by the MSM" Funny how I can't find a SINGLE article mentioning this.

Sequestration will cut $85,000,000.000.00 (actually $44,000,000,000.00 between March 1 and September 30, 2013) from the current expenditures of $3,800,000,000,000.00 leaving the government with only $3,715,000,000,000.00 to spend on government programs. Based upon these cuts, our "dear leader" has (on a daily basis) warned us about the dangers to our free society if these draconian cuts are allowed to take place. The real question is what will happen when the American people discover the real effects of cutting 2.2% from a $3.8 trillion budget. What if first responders are able to continue their functions, school children are still able to be educated, and the military is still able to protect us? What if the sequestor happens and no one knows the difference? IMHO it should be interesting. "In your heart you know he is right."
