Bush administration by a 73 to 23 vote on Friday, sending the FISA Amendments Act to President Barack Obama's desk for his signature." Well, well, well, it appears the Dems finally decided the tradeoff of protecting Americans from terrorism has merit after all. Good for them. Let's now see if the President, who railed about the practice when campaigning, signs it into law.</Msg><Username>t.bfine</Username><Timestamp>1356789755503</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-29 09:02:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356796873485-3</Id><Topic><Title>What Hitler would do with Congress.....</Title><Username>binnybeoris</Username><Timestamp>1356742395255</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-28 19:53:15 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He called them "Gaggling Geese".</Msg><Username>lewcor</Username><Timestamp>1356796873485</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-29 11:01:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356797076555-4</Id><Topic><Title>Wiretapping</Title><Username>t.bfine</Username><Timestamp>1356789755503</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-29 09:02:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Clear violation of the Constitution.

The rule that one house has to 'reconcile' a bill from the other house before it can be passed is just plain inefficient and stupid. When a bill in introduced it should go through both for agreement before it is voted upon, not rewritten after one house passes it. They are supposed to be working for the good of the people and country, not their own little fiefdom and publicity stunts for an upcoming election. The group that has been in Congress for the past six years is approaching being the worst in history.</Msg><Username>ssdependent</Username><Timestamp>1356798009174</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-29 11:20:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356798877303-7</Id><Topic><Title>Sidwell Friends School sounds like a very safe place for children</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1356558043024</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-26 16:40:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ricky, you forgot to change you handle again. Too much to drink/smoke or just getting old? Doing away with those specific departments has nothing to do with a desire not to fund education, etc. It has to do with a desire to eliminate several overspending, producing, less than their cost Federal government entities. Many of these functions are operated by and funded by local and state entities doing much the same things but with a lot more Federal interference. These Federal groups have involved themselves in many things they formerly had no place and it hasn't helped the situation consistent with the level of their costs.</Msg><Username>winholder</Username><Timestamp>1356798877303</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-29 11:34:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356804069019-8</Id><Topic><Title>AT&amp;T Chart looks ominous</Title><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1356630861968</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 12:54:21 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hey Jon, why don't you ask Ricky what size underwear you wear, he "knows" everything else, lol.</Msg><Username>mikerego19</Username><Timestamp>1356804069019</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-29 13:01:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356816407585-9</Id><Topic><Title>Sidwell Friends School sounds like a very safe place for children</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1356558043024</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-26 16:40:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>... “Ricky, you forgot to change you handle again” - -winjondalefrog Why would you suggest that wasn’t me that posted that? The standard wager about aliases still exists…anytime, Sybil. “Doing away with those specific departments has nothing to do with a desire not to fund education…” Of course not, Winnie. You say one thing, deny that you said it, get caught, back pedal, retreat then try slinging from another angle. Were you home schooled in that type of behavior? From your tired refrain here, you obviously have neither the knowledge nor qualifications to be discussing anything about education. Having some multiple-aliased, message board provocateur make frivolous suggestions about eliminating 20% of the federal executive departments is a novel exercise in jocularity. Write up your ideas and have jon proofread them before submission. Speaking of submission – doesn’t getting caught in lies ever get old for you?</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1356816407585</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-29 16:26:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356821355736-10</Id><Topic><Title>FACT::House Speaker Ranks Higher than Senate Speaker</Title><Username>kit3taylor</Username><Timestamp>1356786562504</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-29 08:09:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good post no matter your political leanings.
