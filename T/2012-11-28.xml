He promised a better, more civil Washington, then called a police department stupid before he had all the facts, put out campaign ads calling his opponent a felon and his supporters called him a tax cheat for not paying his taxes, a murderer for causing a women's cancer death, etc. He is a real charmer this guy is.

He sent out someone he admits didn't have anything to do with Libya or knew what happened so he could go begging. A real leader!

Poor decision-making, lack of oversight of their past decisions and complete ignorance of what their constituents are asking them to do. They spend so much time on vacation I am shocked they found the time to screw things up so royally! I guess they have more talent that we realize; unfortunately it is a talent that will lead to the destruction of our economy for good. I in fact have had to develop budgets and to actually track performance to those budgets and correct any deficiencies in expected performance. My future income, position, promotions and continued employment depended on meeting those expectations.

Congress responds to lobbyists more aggressively than they do the voters or even the President. The lobbyist finance their campaigns, they boondoggle trips to place they have no business being, furnish jobs for those that are retiring or have lost a recent election but still have friends in Washington. Grover has no more influence than the lobbyists that call on Harry and/or Nancy or fed fat Teddy before he passed. He has simply become the whipping boy for you loud-mouthed liberals. Congress is out of control and our present leader (who infamously voted present more than anything else) doesn’t have the chops to put them in line. We are strapped with this President for the next four years unless many of the missing truths about his past are discovered, but we do have the mid-term elections to do something about this lazy, incompetent, corrupt Congress. It remains to be seen if the American people have the guts to do something about the corruption and ignorance in Congress.
