Not much of one, but we’ve come to expect that from you. Alright, how about another chance? One last time, winjondale. This really is not a difficult question. I know it’s difficult for YOU, because you don’t want to answer it. Here’s what my post said (although, in retrospect, I see that it isn’t really aimed at you because it says “Moderate Republicans”, not lunatic fringe Tea Party wackos.) Nevertheless, how about a simple answer? “Moderate Republicans…speak up. Do you want someone speaking for you who suggests that The President of the United States is apathetic about public servants being killed and raped? Are you that warped?” Do you, or do you not, think that the President of the United States takes pleasure, or in any way gains politically, when public servants of his own administration are raped or killed, as robfisk stated? A simple yes I agree would do, if that’s your opinion. If it isn’t your opinion, forget your bogus answers that waffle with silly responses like, “No, he doesnt' seem properly upset when they are.” Who on earth do you think you are to interpret personal emotions about tragic events…what is “properly upset” as defined by your warped mind concerned only with making political fodder, at the cost of respect and decency for those who sacrificed their lives. “Did you happen to see the interview with the father of one of those killed?” Yes, I did and Tyrone Woods’ father was very upset about it, understandably so. Of course, you selectively edit that to your own propaganda. Is there any reason you didn’t tell the rest of the story? (Now, there’s a rhetorical question if ever there was – of course there’s a reason. You’re nothing but an unprincipled, cheap political shill who will lie and deceive at all cost for the mysterious 2 percenters who hire you – the mouthpiece for the money behind Citizen’s United. Let’s see what Tyrone’s mother said: “His mother was part of a family contingency that met Woods' remains at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland days after the attack. They were joined by President Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton. "While squeezing Secretary Clinton's hand and choking back tears, I told her that what worried me was that my son died possibly thinking that he had failed in the mission he was to carry out, that of protecting Ambassador Stevens and the people in the compound," she (Woods’ mother) said. "Looking me firmly in the eye, she told me that my son did not fail. She called him a hero and that if not for him, the 30 people inside the consulate would not have made it out. He was doing his job, fighting for his life, putting others ahead of his own safety, but then that was his job, which he did well." While we’re at it, let’s see what Ambassador Stevens’ father said about people like you who disgustingly try to play politics with the sacrifices made by REAL patriots. “The father of Christopher Stephens, the United States ambassador who was killed in the attack in Libya last month, said Saturday that it would be ABHORRANT for his son's death to be politicized in the presidential campaign. In an interview with Bloomberg News, Jan Stevens said the attack on Benghazi and the ensuing investigation has no place in the upcoming election. "The security matters are being adequately investigated," Stevens, who is getting briefings from the State Department on the investigation, said. "We don’t pretend to be experts in security. It has to be objectively examined. That’s where it belongs. It does not belong in the campaign arena. I’m not sure exactly what [Romney's] been saying and not saying, but our position is it would be a real shame if this were politicized," Stevens said. Or what about what Navy SEAL Glen Doherty’s mother said about #$%$ like you: “Last week, the mother of a Navy SEAL killed in the attack made a similar appeal to the Romney campaign, asking the Republican to stop mentioning her son's name on the campaign trail. "I don't trust Romney. He shouldn't make my son's death part of his political agenda," said Barbara Doherty, whose son, Glen was killed in Benghazi.” It's wrong to use these brave young men, who wanted freedom for all, to degrade Obama.” Last chance, winjondale…Do you agree with robfisk’s statement: “OBami was fundraising in Vegas, he could care less how many Ambassadors they rape, and murder.” (Obami? Uh, no racism there, right? You people are disgusting.)</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1351256339423</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 08:58:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351257304071-4</Id><Topic><Title>robfisk - mouthpiece for the myopic...</Title><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1351173651256</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 10:00:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>...

Tax Policy Center says Romney’s Tax Reform Will NOT Work! New York Times 10/25/12 “That study found, in short, that Mr. Romney could NOT keep all of the promises he had made on individual tax reform: including cutting marginal tax rates by 20 percent, keeping protections for investment income, not widening the deficit and not increasing the tax burden on the poor or middle class. It concluded that Mr. Romney’s plan, on its face, would CUT TAXES FOR RICH FAMILIES AND RAISE THEM FOR EVERYONE ELSE. (emphasis added) The center’s claim to provide reliable, nonpartisan information comes in part from its staff makeup. It has about four dozen affiliated staff members and scholars — most are economists, several are considered top experts in their fields, and a number have experience in either Republican or Democratic administrations. In many ways the report did just what the center was created to do: inject some solid numbers into a shifty, accusatory, raucous political debate. The decade-old center — a joint project of the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute, two nonpartisan grandes dames of the Washington world — was founded precisely to ‘fill that niche,’ Mr. Marron said. Many economists across the political spectrum have said they found the report’s conclusions convincing, like Alan D. Viard, a tax expert at the right-of-center American Enterprise Institute. Mr. Sullivan of Tax Analysts said: ‘I like tax reform. I want to broaden the base. It’s something I’ve devoted my life to. And I welcome Governor Romney and the Republicans’ strong push, but the plan doesn’t work out. It’s not mathematically possible’.” “THE PLAN DOESN’T WORK OUT. IT’S NOT MATHEMATICALLY POSSIBLE.” More Voo-Doo Economics of the ‘Trickle Down’ variety. Oh,my! Grover Norquist may have to get a job with Sesame Street. Please read the full story (I’d give you the link, but …well, you know.) There are some opposing views, mainly saying there’s not enough info. to perform a better analysis, to which the response was something like, “Duh, no kidding. Tell Romney that it’s about time he filled in all the missing blanks on his etch-a-sketch compendium of sound bites with no details!” Oh, and I would add, maybe if you want to preach tax reform, you might want to make your own returns available to the public to show them specifically why reform is so needed.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1351260193400</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 10:03:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351261252726-7</Id><Topic><Title>Romney's Tax Reform Will Not Work...</Title><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1351260193400</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 10:03:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Socialism is a proven failure time after time in history.

As I said, I believe the deal had always been that for "bargained" employees, part of the bargaining has always been that we work for certain scales within consideration for healthcare benefits in retirement being comensurate for affordable. We migrated to paying for them and gradually paying more in premiums and copays and reduction in some prescription coverage to keep it as efficient and affordable to maintain the benefit. With this baloney we now hear about "retirees not allowed to be considered" in bargaining and a HUGE increase with no "heads up" from ANYONE it really gets my jaws tight. Bad time for a promotion to mgt's new retiree benefits I agree. You have to say, I believe you may have had a better pay scale (hence perhaps a better retirement income) and no stress to deal with strike economics when you were a manager on active duty also. But I do agree, I think you got a raw deal on your healthcare also.</Msg><Username>topekabill</Username><Timestamp>1351265689543</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 11:34:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351266592972-10</Id><Topic><Title>T may be ended.

Socialism? Right. When are you going to grow up and realize that while poll tested buzz words might ring true with ignorant fanatics, main stream America is tired of them, and wants specifics…which, obviously, your guy will not deliver. Maybe that’s why even the Salt Lake City Tribune couldn’t see fit to endorse their favorite son. “Well, this must be awkward. The Salt Lake Tribune, the paper of record in Salt Lake City — which is also the city with the largest Mormon population in the country — has just gone and endorsed Barack Obama rather than fellow Mormon Mitt Romney. In an editorial, the paper praises and thanks Romney for his outstanding work in 2002, when the Olympics, organized by Romney, showed the world the city's best. But the editors say it was Romney's "shape shifting" during the nomination process, from courting the Tea Party to the GOP's far-right contingent that made them wary of the candidate. The paper calls Obama's leadership "decisive," and says he has earned a second term, whereas Romney "does not deserve a first." – MSN (You really should read the actual editorial – it’s far more critical than this summary.) Wow, that’s like La Repubblica, Rome’s largest newspaper, lobbying for Madalyn Murray O'Hair for Pope!</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1351267177655</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 11:59:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351268354041-13</Id><Topic><Title>Romney's Tax Reform Will Not Work...</Title><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1351260193400</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 10:03:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Don't look now you Democratic Party shill, but Obama's economic plans haven't worked very well either.

They loved each other so much and one day this kid's mom comes to her dear old son and gently gives him some money and send him off to buy her some meat so that she can cook dinner for the both of them. So, off this kid goes all chirpy and nice singing melodies on the way to the market get the meat that his Mom wanted to cook and comes back with the same cheerful tone. On the way, he sees this beautiful plant with a purple flower blooming by the sidewalk. He gets the thought that if he gives this purple flower to his nice Mom then she will appreciate him more and love him even more. So he picks it off the plant and moves along and reaches his home in no time, same cheerful state he had left earlier. 'Mommy, I got your meat', he goes. 'Thank you, my sweet dear', she would reply. But she notices that he's hiding something behind his back and asks him what it is. He bashfully says 'I saw this on the way back and I thought if I gave it to you it would make you happier'. 'That's so sweet of you my dear child, but what is it?', she smiles. 'This..', and with that, he presents the purple flower to his dear old nice Mom. Shocked, enraged, and fumed, she picks up an empty frying pan and hits the boy on his head. 'Get out!', she shouts. 'Help! Police! You Devil!', she would say at the top of her voice. The boy runs out of the small house that lives by the street. He runs and runs, crying and whaling about all the pain caused by his dear old Mom who thrashed him with an empty frying pan. He eventually stops at a corner of the garden, still whimpering about the pain caused by his dear old Mom. Then this nice old nanny walks along the same garden smiling ever so cheerfully, and sees this kid with tears in his eyes. 'What's the matter, little boy?', she asks. The boy, naturally wounded in his heart over his Mom thrashing him, says 'I wanted to make my Mommy happy by giving her this nice flower'. Sniffing and blurting out the last words, the boy presents the purple flower to the nanny, who in turn, is shocked, freaked out, and goes mental on the kid by thrashing him with her walking cane whilst shouting out 'Help! Police! Help! You psycho! Help!'. She thrashes and thrashes the kid on and on and on. And the kid runs away again.. He runs street after street after street crossing the roads from one neighborhood to another. Eventually he stops again at another crossroad. Still whimpering about his bad day and how he got kicked out of his Mom's house and by an old lady in public garden, comes along a nice young policeman who passes by the little boy and sees him crying and on his own. 'What's the matter, young boy?', he asks. And the boy says ' I wanted to make my Mommy happy by giving her this nice flower', and no sooner does the policeman see the purple flower does he pull out his gun and points it at the kid and shouts out, 'Oh my God! Hands up! You mean machine, you!', and throws him into Jail. Our little boy is now in Jail and is put in with this humongous brutal man. This man turns around to see the boy crying, bruised, in pain, and whimpering and asks him, “I was put in here for splitting a man in half because I caught him cheating with my wife; what about you?,” in a gruff voice. The boy, scared from head to toe from this man in front of him, says in a shaky voice 'I - I - I .....I picked this flower for my Mommy to make her happy', and shows him the purple flower. The man freaks out, goes ballistic and cries out to the jail-house guard, “Help! Guard! Get me out of here! Help!”. And with that makes a hole in the jail's wall trying to run for his life. The little kid, still whimpering over his bad luck, walks out the hole in the wall. Comes upon a street and crosses it. Bam! He's run over by an ambulance. The point is to the whole story is to always look left and right before crossing the road. *** “Romney's plan has flaws…” Well, yeah, according to the “plant” story, it has one…”the plan doesn’t work. It’s not mathematically possible.”</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1351285168218</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 16:59:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351287691895-29</Id><Topic><Title>Breaking news BO admin denies requests to defend Benghazi compoud during attack</Title><Username>lkglhklkh</Username><Timestamp>1351269709024</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 12:41:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>... …”nostral (sic) hairs aren't long enought (sic)” … guffaw, guffaw, chuckle, snort, smiles, giggles” - jon Jon, seriously, what are you…about eleven?

Sorry, but these are bumps in the road. I can't concern myself with all these military matters. I had a fund raiser to attend in Vegas that day. First things first. And calling in the nearby troops to try to extract your son would send this new regime the wrong message. I would be politically incorrect, to show the world, I didn't trust the local security. We have to cut defense, I had to take the Ambassador's plane away. Mouchelle has first dibs on planes. She needs them for taking her friends on fab vacations. Besides, he was ordered to stand down, not assist the Ambassador. So fighting till the last man is on him. Taking a pledge to defend the Constitution is a little over the top. Black folks you know were only considered 3/5ths of a man, by these old white folks who wrote that racist rag. You can bet your bottom dollar, or Mouchelle's next vacation, I'll be getting rid of this politically incorrect document. God and Country, no way. Read the inscription on the ring I wear.
