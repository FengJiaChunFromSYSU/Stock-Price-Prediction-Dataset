What a beautiful day. I hope you all enjoyed it. Jon, however, who apparently hasn’t any family or friends was locked in the basement for 14 hours posting the following intellectual banter: 10:57 – put on your “girly panties” (sign off as he prepares for bed after a long day) 10:04 – the President is an “Uncle Tom” (pretty outlandish claim after the earlier blatant racism) 9:30 – Saved GM – Killed Bin Laden (somehow while true, this is reason to “fire Obama”) 9:03 – “crap, dingleberry, toilet and flush” (there seems to be a reoccurring theme developing) 7:30 - racist nonsense about needing white gloves to eat a tootsie roll (highly sophisticated Tea Party Humor) 4:36 – “wife’s booty, too many flies (??) .. ya shudda giv her some ‘waddymellon’ ta draw dem the flies .. an keep dem off dat off dat thang she got ??” (jon frequently morphs into his minstrel routine around the cocktail hour – it seems cheap booze emboldens his racism. Can you imagine being immature enough to post this juvenile nonsense and think somehow that it’s either funny, or providing a positive political message in support of your side? How extremely bizarre!) 3:17 – warms up with “Flaming Liberal” rant accusing someone of being a “fake”. Now there’s some serious irony for you. 11:06 – “you're full of pee-poop - ya DWEEB !!” (Oh, my! What’s next…a noogie and a purple nurple? Jon, aren’t you supposed to be in Sunday school?) 9:22 – “five generations of in-breeding” (Gee, we’ve got a morning lecture on consanguinity from a DNA challenged buffoon who’s fixated on vegetables in his underwear! Very strange, indeed.) 9:07 – jon, who has more aliases than the Brontë Family, kicks off Sunday morning with “Don't you get tried (sic) of corresponding with yourself under 2 or 3 different aliases ??” Hey, jon, you were already called out on multiple-aliases as windandale…and you caved like the 64’ Phillies… the same wager still stands – put up or shut up. You also said, “I can't imagine how it really is with you being a ‘shut-in’ and all’ followed up with your typical grade-school girlish, “chuckles, snickering loudly, smiles!” (OMG!OMG! Awesome! Totally grodie! I’m like, ‘ Duh! What EVER!’) Right, jon, I’m the shut in. Meanwhile you are sittin’ in the dark pounding your key board (and who knows what else) from nine in the morning ‘til eleven at night on a beautiful Fall Sunday. Nine hideously juvenile posts as jon, interspersed with others from robfisk, winholder and others. You missed some fabulous Fall foliage, jon boy. And besides entertaining yourself, who do you really think you influenced? Kids who think racist watermelon jokes are funny? That will really help convince the undecideds that you are what America wants or needs. How pathetic. You are one sorry individual, indeed.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1350309349250</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 09:55:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350309872734-3</Id><Title>3rd qtr results</Title><Msg>What is expected for AT&amp;T 3rd qtr results?

Our Psy-Ops people kept the phony story of him going in order to get us involved in Afghanistan. Top CIA people have come forth along with the lady Bhutto who was murdered in Pakistan while running for office and said he was dead. She was probably killed because she knew too much. I'll bet you never read the story told by a man that lived next door to the house they raided. He said ONE copter landed and crashed and burned on take off. If so, then how did they get the body? Too many fairy tales told by government about almost everything. Things are suppressed forever. All the info on Lincoln's death were supposed to be released 100 years afterward. They are still holding some of it back.

Earnings estimates for the 9/2012 quarter have continuously been revised downward (.67/share to now an estimated .61/share) without any downward price change? Unfortunately, the significant rise in stock price from $27-$30/share did not seem to be grounded in financial fundamentals to justify stock appreciation to $38+. AT&amp;T is a solid company with a sound balance sheet, good cash flow and expense management, and a history of rising dividend payments to stockholders. Additionally, AT&amp;T has acquired much needed spectrum through additional small deals. At $27, the stock was undervalued; however, at $35; there still may be room for futher price decline. The Softbank, Sprint deal prospect was an additional catalyst to create uncertainty for price decline. As a stockholder, I too was enjoying the stock price appreciation. However in my estimation, this is not a question of the stock getting smashed, but rather a correction to normalcy. Hopefully for all of us, that will not be $30, again.</Msg><Username>mktoptimist</Username><Timestamp>1350337536855</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 17:45:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350338432956-43</Id><Topic><Title>Why Is T Getting Smashed?</Title><Username>timetraveler2u</Username><Timestamp>1350071208961</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 15:46:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>VZ is down far less than T.
