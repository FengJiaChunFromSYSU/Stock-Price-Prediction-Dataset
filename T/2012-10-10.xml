Barack Obama used his status as a legal hired gun to sue Citibank to force them to give loans to poor minorities in Chicago. He sued a bank into creating subprime mortgages. Subprime loans almost ended the financial system as we know it in 2008, after fueling a mortgage bubble that exploded with devastating effect on the economy. Obama was right there in the thick of it, helping to create the problem and undermine capitalism. Barack Obama used his status as a legal hired gun to sue Citibank to force them to give loans to poor minorities in Chicago. In other words, he sued a bank into creating subprime mortgages. We can see evidence first hand of what happens when Obama is involved in your personal financial choices: You'll probably go bankrupt. Only 19 of Obama's 186 still have clean credit. The rest have missed payments or have been foreclosed on. Almost half ended up losing their houses. Obama used government and legal coercion to subvert markets; he forced banks to give out loans that almost took out the United States economy 2008. Obama's leftist ideas are one reason we got into this mess in the first place.</Msg><Username>lkglhklkh</Username><Timestamp>1349844540576</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 00:49:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349862081416-3</Id><Topic><Title>5 Romney Boys Will Join Military to Serve our Country?</Title><Username>jbhdallas2000</Username><Timestamp>1349717118273</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 13:25:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No, they are Repuke cowards like their father.</Msg><Username>malibuden</Username><Timestamp>1349862081416</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 05:41:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349864081465-4</Id><Topic><Title>romney pulls a head in 11 swing states</Title><Username>dadiooftheradio</Username><Timestamp>1349809782450</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 15:09:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No TEA or RETURDS, sorry, America is sick of your obstructionism of job creation, and will do it without rich Repukes.

No, it's not. Across all of the major polls Obama retains a strong advantage, especially as you look at the electoral college math and the polls in the swing states. "please provide details" That's the $100 billion question, ain't it? Romney intends to lower all tax rates by 20%, but eliminate deductions. He's stated he's open to eliminating the deductions for mortgage interest, student loan interest, and health benefits to pay for those tax breaks. These mainly affect the middle class, while a 20% reduction is less beneficial for the middle class than it is for the wealthy. Under Romney's plan we'll all end up paying more so the Romney's and Obama's of the world can squirrel millions away in off-shore accounts. This is why he won't tell us the details of his tax plan. Is it because it will cause deficits? Is it because he will cut Medicare &amp; Social Security to pay for it, upsetting his tea party base? Is it because it will be paid for by the middle class? It's all three? We know with Obama our taxes won't go up. Can you say the same for Romney? No.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1349878754368</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 10:19:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349879956705-20</Id><Topic><Title>Peppeek</Title><Username>bob.beachin</Username><Timestamp>1349832874371</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 21:34:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>what's wrong with the prius, I would like to get one of those, look like a nice practical car, but they aren't that cheap.

Darden Restaurants [DRI 55.31 0.57 (+1.04%) ] declined to give details but said the test is only in restaurants in four markets across the country. The test entails increasing the number of workers on part-time status, meaning they work less than 30 hours a week. Under the new health care act, companies will be required to provide health care to full-time employees by 2014. That would significantly boost labor costs for businesses. About 75 percent of Darden's employees are currently part-timers. Bob McAdam, who heads government affairs and community relations for Darden, said the company is still learning from the tests, which was first reported by The Orlando Sentinel. "We're not at a point where we have results," he said. McAdam also noted that Darden is not alone in looking at ways to keep labor costs in check, with companies industry wide prepping for the new regulations to take effect. Darden, based in Orlando, Fla., has made cost cutting a priority in recent years as sales growth and traffic have stalled at its flagship chains. In the most recent fiscal quarter, the company's restaurant labor costs were 31 percent of sales. That's down from 33 percent three years ago. The reduction was driven by several factors. Given the challenging job market, Darden has been able to offer lower pay rates to new hires. Bonuses for general managers have been reduced as sales have stagnated. Servers at Red Lobster are handling four tables at a time, instead of three. And last year, the company also put workers on a "tip sharing" program, meaning waiters and waitresses share their tips with other employees such as busboys and bartenders. That allows Darden to pay more workers a far lower "tip credit wage" of $2.13, rather than the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. Darden isn't the only restaurant chain looking at managing labor costs. This summer, McDonald's [MCD 92.99 0.88 (+0.96%) ] Chief Financial Officer Peter Bensen noted in a conference call with investors that the fast food company was looking at the many factors that will impact health care costs, including the number of full-time employees. Darden operates more than 2,000 restaurants in the U.S. and Canada, including its LongHorn Steakhouse. It employs about 180,000 people.</Msg><Username>low_mac</Username><Timestamp>1349880224367</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 10:43:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349880827880-22</Id><Topic><Title>Prepping for Obamacare, Chain Cuts Workers' Hours</Title><Username>low_mac</Username><Timestamp>1349880224367</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 10:43:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Darden was already cutting hours, and doing other nefarious things to cut employee wages.

This is what really happens in 2014, and ObamaCare HELPS small businesses: Effective January 1, 2014 Starting in 2014 if your employer doesn’t offer insurance, you will be able to buy it directly in an Affordable Insurance Exchange. An Exchange is a new transparent and competitive insurance marketplace where individuals and small businesses can buy affordable and qualified health benefit plans. Exchanges will offer you a choice of health plans that meet certain benefits and cost standards. Starting in 2014, Members of Congress will be getting their health care insurance through Exchanges, and you will be able buy your insurance through Exchanges too.

If she has health benefits, they are likely provided by Medicaid through her children. Under the ACA, Red Lobster is required to provide health care benefits (and receive the associated tax benefit) or pay a fine. The fine is used to offset the subsidies the waitress will receive when she purchases insurance on the exchange. The fine is an added incentive, on top of the existing tax benefits, to employers to provide insurance to employees. What Red Lobster is doing is trying to reclassify employees to avoid providing health care and to avoid paying the fine. Just like they did with the tips. Just like many employers try to do to avoid paying overtime. This type of labor abuse is nothing new and not confined to the ACA. Mostly, it's another reason to not go to Red Lobster or the Olive Garden. (if you needed one. Support your local small businesses and go to a real restaurant). Whatever Red Lobster does, however, the waitress and her children will have an easier time getting health insurance--either through the exchanges or through the Medicaid expansion. Additionally, the ACA does not create a single payer system. Medicare is a single payer system. If the ACA was a single payer system, the waitress would get health insurance from the government at low or no cost just like seniors get Medicare from the government at low or no cost. The waitress, however, will get health insurance from a private insurer, either through her employer or by purchasing it on the exchange.
