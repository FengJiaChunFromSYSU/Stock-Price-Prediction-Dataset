"To be very blunt with you, we’re counting on all of you, the legitimate news media to cover these discussions because the truth is that times have changed,” Biden added, warning that people would continue to “misrepresent” the White House's plans for gun control." "The social media that exists out there, the tragedies that have occurred, the Supreme Court decision affirming that its an individual right to bear arms - all give a lie to the argument that what we're trying to do is somehow unconstitutional, or somehow goes after the legitimate right to own and bear arms and to hunt and protect yourselves," Biden added." Well now I do feel better, knowing that the "legitimate news media" is going to cover these discussions in a way that meets the approval of the administration. What could be more in keeping with the Constitution, a "legitimate news media" that only reports the news that is approved by the administration and the democrat party? "In your heart you know he is right."

It's kind of sad you have to try to make that case. He seems to consider banks people, while thinking it farcical that elected officials should work for the voters who elected them. "How is pushing business to another state for the benefit of the private citizens you are supposed to represent?" Which private citizens are you talking about? Senator Cruz' banks or actual people? Apparently the actual people of Chicago think guns are not of benefit to themselves. Who is Senator Cruz to force guns on the voters? Would he do the same for drugs? Polluters? The private citizens of Chicago don't want them. Considering the actions of Senator Cruz' big banks over the past few years, maybe we should all be kicking them out of our communities and support local, banks that don't gamble with our money.

It is a choice employers always deal with. Offer higher quality jobs to attract higher quality candidates or offer lower quality jobs and get not so good candidates. Either way, all of those state workers will now have access to health insurance, either through the state or through the exchanges or expanded Medicaid. I imagine most workers will see that as a worthwhile benefit. In the case of states, they have an added incentive to offer higher quality jobs and insurance because they often end up footing part of the health insurance bill if they don't--either through Medicaid or other programs--and they recoup part of the pay through taxes. And elected officials are likely even more averse to bad publicity in this arena than Red Lobster was. Basically, though, if you're worried that there may be more jobs of lower quality and fewer jobs of higher quality you should support things like minimum wage, education and unions. And for heaven's sake, Jon, et al., don't move to Texas.

He then hops on Air Force Two to fly back to his home in Delaware . At the end of the weekend, he returns on Air Force Two, usually a Boeing C-32. On Saturdays in warm weather, Biden regularly returns to Andrews on the airplane to play golf at the base with President Obama. After the game, he flies back to Delaware . On Sunday evening, he returns on the plane to Washington — all at taxpayer expense. The Boeing C-32 is a specially configured Boeing 757-200 commercial jet. The cost of flying the plane is $22,000 an hour, so each half-hour trip to or from Delaware costs about $10,000. Each golf game costs taxpayers $20,000. At that rate, the annual cost to taxpayers of Biden’s weekend trips is well over $1 million. That does not include so-called deadhead flights when the plane often flies back to Washington empty and then returns empty to pick up Biden. In addition, the Secret Service rents more than 20 condominiums in the Wilmington area for agents who must accompany Biden when he returns to his home state. Rather than try to find hotel space, the Secret Service decided to rent the condos in part because, even when he knows his schedule in advance, Biden rarely tells agents until the last minute when he will be returning to Wilmington beyond his weekend trips. As a result, agents cannot plan their own lives. A Secret Service agent says that since Air Force Two parks at Andrews, Obama is obviously aware that Biden is running up a huge government tab for each game of golf they play. Biden’s press office had no comment. Asked if President Obama thinks these costs are appropriate and why he has not questioned Biden’s flying to play golf with him at a cost of $20,000 per game, the president’s press office had no comment. Biden’s commutes have cost taxpayers at least $4 million so far. After my story ran on Newsmax, a major media outlet obtained Pentagon records confirming the trips and costs. But so far, that outlet has not run the story. The rest of the media have ignored it. In addition to his salary as vice president of $230,700, Biden has free use of the vice president’s residence at the Naval Observatory. The vice president’s residence is a handsome 9,150-square-foot, three-story mansion overlooking Massachusetts Avenue NW in Washington . Complete with pool, pool house, and indoor gym, the white brick house was built in 1893 as the home of the superintendent of the U.S. Naval Observatory. Congress turned it into the official residence of the vice president in 1974 and gave it the address One Observatory Circle . During the day, at least five Navy stewards attend to every personal need of the second family, including cleaning, cooking, shopping for food, and doing the laundry. Biden has portrayed himself as a regular Joe, a product of a working-class family who takes on millionaires and Republicans who are said to be out of touch with middle-class Americans. Last June, Obama appointed Biden to root out wasteful government spending. But behind the scenes, it’s a different matter. Biden’s disregard for the cost of constantly shuttling back and forth to his home in Wilmington and his additional trips to golf with the president betray the arrogant, contemptuous attitude we saw him display toward Ryan during the debate. “The White House is a character crucible,” Bertram S. Brown, M.D., a psychiatrist who formerly headed the National Institute of Mental Health, told me for the Secret Service book. “It either creates or distorts character. Few decent people want to subject themselves to the kind of grueling abuse candidates take when they run in the first place,” says Dr. Brown. “Even if an individual is balanced, once someone becomes president, how does one solve the conundrum of staying real and somewhat humble when one is surrounded by the most powerful office in the land, and from becoming overwhelmed by an, at times, pathological environment that treats you every day as an emperor?” The vice president has chosen the emperor approach, revealing his true character.</Msg><Username>ssdependent</Username><Timestamp>1360698564833</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 14:49:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360698902646-27</Id><Topic><Title>7 Million to Lose Insurance Under Obamacare</Title><Username>ricky1820l</Username><Timestamp>1360256571061</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-07 12:02:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Are you suggesting that a member of Congress would stand on the floor of Congress and lie?

Oh, wait a minute. That story appeared in the Washington Times in July of 2011. Nervermind! “According to Mr. Biden’s office, the vice president’s mother lived in the cottage until she died in January 2010. At that time, the Secret Service had been renting properties in the Wilmington area for agents who were providing a protective presence at Mr. Biden’s personal residence. Mr. Biden later asked the Secret Service if the agency wanted to rent the cottage property, but the Secret Service declined and Mr. Biden rented it instead to a private tenant, according to the vice president's office. But almost a year later, when that tenant moved out, the Secret Service approached Mr. Biden about renting the cottage.” Having perused the antics of regular board wackos, jon, rob, win, frog, wilkes, ssdepends et. al. the past two days, it would appear that the only real news is that they are frightened to death of a very popular President who is about to make a dramatic State of the Union address tonight. Having only memories of like-minded idiots like Bachman, Santorum, Perry and Cain, doing battle with each other and their eventual candidate, one would think they’d wise up at some point, but every day, they just get wackier and wackier. Instead of the old Biden story, why don’t you guys just say something like: “The National Press Club today announced that they’re actually a Marxist organization and The New York Times has changed its name to Izvestia.” “It’s been revealed that when President Obama and Joe Biden play golf, they have a Federal Reserve Bank Nassau wager on the match, and the Secret Service smuggles topless Hooter’s girls in to caddy for them.” “Melowese Richardson is actually The President’s half-sister, the secret love child of Frank Davis and Imogene Coca, and that she was actually the Chairwoman and head of last year’s Democratic Presidential Re-election Campaign Committee, which permitted all African-Americans to vote as many times as they wanted – by phone, word of mouth or carrier pigeon.” “At tonight’s State of the Union Address, NRA board member and psychopath, Ted Nugent will be a guest of Representative Steve Stockman, a Texas Republican who recently made headlines by threatening to file articles of impeachment against Mr. Obama if the president issued executive orders that strengthened gun control laws.” Oh, wait, that last one’s true…unbelievably reprehensible, but sadly, true. I would hope that between Ted and Steve, both of whom are against any laws that would strengthen gun legislation, including, assumingly, the universal background checks now favored by nine out of 10 Americans, they would seat Gabby Gifford to clue them in.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1360704714678</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 16:31:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360704989467-32</Id><Topic><Title>Uncle Joe sure has a way with words</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1360675475336</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 08:24:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>...
