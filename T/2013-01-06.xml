In your response you faithfully followed the rules, but you were not very creative in your implementation. My critique follows: Opening statement: Classic rule 5 tactic, but again not a very creative implementation Second paragraph: A rather sad rule 4 attempt, but I must admit had I not read the article where you lifted your information, I would have probably been inclined to grade it higher Last statement: A rather nice rule 12 attempt, that verges on a C+ As I have told many of my students in the past; good rules are guidelines and should be learned and practiced, but eventually you will need to go beyond the rules and use your own intellect and imagination to reinvent the rules and/or make them better. I must admit that is what I am attempting to do for my cause. I know I am not there yet, because I am still learning how conservatives can make use of these well thought out rules that have proven their worth over the years. Again nice attempt, but a little lacking in imagination and creativity.

Jimmy "Peanut" Carter shut down the pilot plant that had developed a process to take oil from the Rockies oil shale deposits at competitive prices to mid-East oil. There are also huge deposits of a methane gel in the off shore trenches. Bet you've not heard of that. The Japanese are studying ways of getting that with no ecological damage.

For a fee and a share of the interest the Import-Export bank provides loan guarantees to facilitate the export and import of goods. That's it. In this case the export of goods was to a foreign oil company doing some offshore drilling. Just about every country on earth has access to either it's own export credit agency or a multi-national development bank that provides these guarantees. They are a normal part of international trade. The US Export Import Banks has been quietly facilitating trade since 1934. The only reason you've ever heard of it is because some cheap conservative hack thought he could score some cheap points. He was right. You Tea Brains know nothing about business or economics. You make this strikingly obvious.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1357496748295</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-06 13:25:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357497069555-9</Id><Topic><Title>More Obamanomic Results</Title><Username>t.bfine</Username><Timestamp>1357396765440</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 09:39:25 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"She is adamant that we aren't going to discuss social security, medicare or medicaid.

Yet they have been a part of every grand bargain negotiation and Pelosi does not have the power to stop a grand bargain passed by the Senate. Obama and Reid both support these reductions--Obama more than Reid. From what I can gather, you want high spending on your old age checks but have no interest in paying for it with taxes that may affect you. You'd rather see the safety net and infrastructure gutted. I bet you also support the payroll tax hike.

The oil market is a global market. This is why the Keystone Pipeline wasn't expected to lower gas or oil prices in the US--because it makes it easier to export the oil. As it is now the oil has to be shipped by rail which is slower and more expensive to export compared to pipeline oil. The only question with the pipeline is whether the oil goes through the US for routing through Gulf terminals or through a Canadian pipeline to a new pacific coast terminal. But the oil is going to enter the global market--it will go wherever it fetches the highest price. This is what capitalism is all about. If you want to live in a place where government controls resources to keep prices low for the people, you're barking up the wrong economic system.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1357498063889</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-06 13:47:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357498994693-11</Id><Topic><Title>More Obamanomic Results</Title><Username>t.bfine</Username><Timestamp>1357396765440</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 09:39:25 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I see where our local hot dog vendor is closing up and selling his push cart.

You asked: "I bet you also support the payroll tax hike. Am I wrong?" While I didn't support that step as one of the best of many fix options available to law makers, it is a step in the direction to improving social security financial performance. The hike probably won't help the economy, but it's done. In my view, extending the benefit ages would have been more economy neutral. By the way, Ricky, I never enjoyed, as you have, the benefit of the lower tax rate since I retired some 6 yrs. ago. And, also by the way Ricky, I paid in at the newly restored higher rate for a great many years. So, as you are so fond of saying Ricky, pay for your stuff.</Msg><Username>t.bfine</Username><Timestamp>1357504498552</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-06 15:34:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357504679794-13</Id><Topic><Title>Milk 7 bucks</Title><Username>cmontx</Username><Timestamp>1357424620310</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 17:23:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you don't have to buy it.</Msg><Username>tsibr549</Username><Timestamp>1357504679794</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-06 15:37:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357507330903-14</Id><Topic><Title>Milk 7 bucks</Title><Username>cmontx</Username><Timestamp>1357424620310</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 17:23:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I can afford a gallon a week.
