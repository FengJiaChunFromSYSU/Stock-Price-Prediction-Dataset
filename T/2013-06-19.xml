I am not a Boomer, I am older than that, and I have paid every tax I was challenged by the IRS to pay. I did not accrue debt and I always paid my bills and saved and invested for my retirement. I did not and most others did not vote for any benefits. Those were proposed and voted in mostly by liberals members of our government looking for votes. They go them and they keep spending to keep them. If you're looking for scapegoats, look to Washington, not to the people that have worked and paid their taxes as required by law. If you don't like the tax system or the entitlements the government voted in, perhaps you should have voted not to allow it to happen. Individually you would have as much success as those you're trying to blame.

The bill also includes language that prohibits illegal immigrants from participating in Federal health care; it does NOT restrict them from applying for state health care programs and includes language that prohibits the states from denying them benefits. Illegal immigrants are not to be provided Federal sponsored health, so employers will simply hire more of them to hold down health care costs and avoid penalties from the IRS. Unemployment is too high now and will remain so if this is allowed. Harry Reid is in a hurry to get this passed because he wants it to be like Obamacare bills, no one has read them and they don't understand it; if they do they won't vote for it. If we must provide these illegal’s immigrants a different path to citizenship than everyone else that desire to come here, we must make sure that we have sufficient border security and we do not have anything close to what is required today. As soon as a reasonable bill is produced it will be ‘amended’ to oblivion unless we send a very powerful and passionate message to Congress. Call, E-mail, write your representatives, and tell them there has to be some teeth in this bill and language that will discourage further illegal immigration and the security to ensure that happens. This cannot be another bill passed through Congress so we can find out what it includes!!</Msg><Username>winholder</Username><Timestamp>1371664144152</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 13:49:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371664257706-17</Id><Topic><Title>Fair Tax Originator dies</Title><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1371172261696</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 21:11:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well said.</Msg><Username>t.bfine</Username><Timestamp>1371664257706</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 13:50:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371669180192-18</Id><Topic><Title>Fair Tax Originator dies</Title><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1371172261696</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 21:11:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No. It was when I was a kid and my dad lost 32 rental homes in 1929 because the people couldn't pay their $35 monthly rent and he needed the money to pay the mortgages.

I do use DRIP's and they have paid well over the years. I keep extra cash too and if the price drops enough I buy extra.

It's actually higher than "Big Bubba" tells you. They excluded fuel and food from the calculation years ago. Halloween candy used to be in 16 oz. bags. It's now in 12.5 oz. bags. Tuna the same way. Companies have to keep up with this or go under. So do you. It's as old as time. The OT warns about those that "Make the shekel great and the ephah (unit of volume) small." It's a racket run at your and my expense. You can't have a gang of private banksters issuing fairy tale money from thin air and charging interest on it without having inflation..</Msg><Username>lewcor</Username><Timestamp>1371690978162</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 21:16:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
