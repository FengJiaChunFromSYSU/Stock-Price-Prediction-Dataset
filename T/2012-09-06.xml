Since then the stock market is 75% higher. Four million American's are back at work. Unemployment dropped from 10% to 8%. More American's now have health coverage. American's are benefitting from stimulus programs that cut their taxes. The auto industry almost went under four years ago and now are in robust health. Hundreds of thousands of auto workers are still employed. Senior citizens have better Medicare than four years ago. The drug benefit doughnut hole is being closed. We ended the war in Iraq and killed Osama bin Laden. Women can now count on being paid on a par with men for the same job. Corporate profits are the highest ever. Housing is recovering. Many homeowners are no longer under water. Interest rates are the lowest in our lifetimes. Home mortgages are more affordable than ever. So yes, America is much better off than four years ago.</Msg><Username>bobzmcishl</Username><Timestamp>1346966745835</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 17:25:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346966981420-37</Id><Topic><Title>Obama removes God from democrat platform</Title><Username>obombed</Username><Timestamp>1346805849716</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 20:44:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>God is not mentioned in the U.S. Constitution at all, so why should it be in the Democratic platform?

Take democrats Brad Pit and Angelina Jolie for instance. How many of you can build and admusement park for your children? ------ THERE’S one way to avoid hours queueing at theme parks – build your own like Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. The Hollywood couple are finalising plans for a huge eco-friendly playground as a gift to their six-strong brood. They decided to go for the project in the grounds of their chateau in the South of France after last September’s visit to Legoland in Windsor, Berks, was cut short due to security concerns in the camp. A source said: “Brad and Ange felt really bad having to drag the kids home early when they were at Legoland last year. But if their bodyguards said there were too many people then they had no choice. “Their eldest son Maddox asked if they could build something similar at the house in France. They were already getting a new pool so they decided it was a great idea.” But unlike Michael Jackson’s Neverland, most of the park will be underground — with turf on top. It will be powered by sunlight, using panels in the roof and the water will be recycled. --------- This is only one example of celebrity extravagance. -------- So the next time celebrities promote the demoncratic socialist agenda and want everyone else, except those 47 percent that do not need to pay federal income taxes, to pay more taxes they need to pay more themselves. I propose a windfall profits tax on all celebrities, sports or otherwise, since we all pay a bit to support their lifestyles in one form or another anyway. Why shouldn't they? An actor making $2 million an episode for sitcoms like Seinfeld or Two and a Half men make more within that 30 minutes than anyone in the middle class will make in a lifetime! --------- And sports players: --------- Take a MLB player making $30 million a year for example. The average number of at bats per game is 3.3. --------- 3.3 x 162 = ~ 534.6 at bats per season 30,000,000 / 534.6 = ~ $56116.72 per at bat and they are lucky to be succesful one third of the time. Think about that the next time your favorite sports teams want to go on strike! --------- My point is, anyone of these fortunate extraordinary wage earners who politic for the raising income taxes on those squeezed between the haves and have nots should pay more themselves. At the very least lower the cost of the price for going to the movies or a game. Geesshhh! These people have enough money collectively to pay for all their beloved social programs.</Msg><Username>ru14u23nk</Username><Timestamp>1346977216107</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 20:20:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346977847668-50</Id><Topic><Title>No wonder the middle class is shrinking</Title><Username>ru14u23nk</Username><Timestamp>1346977216107</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 20:20:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Eva Longoria Parker: TV’s 4th Richest Lady by nocheLatina 09.23.2010 Share digg No wonder this Desperate Housewife is always smiling.
