Here’s an extremely informative post from that bastion of intellectual cogitation, jon3retired. Jon, based on both the subject matter of your post and the fact that you’ve apparently forgotten that you already offered up this pathetically lame attempt at humor just last week, perhaps your “retirement” should have been you retiring to bed instead of having that last 40 ounce Colt 45 last night. If it’s not Alzheimer’s that’s making you forget what you already posted, you should realize that “getting stupid” with consumption of spirits is not a good idea when you’re already really stupid to begin with! Last night’s political insight from jon: “Yep Geoff .. I think we have it now .. Minn .. lv66vette .. av8lover ... have better sun-tans than I do .. I guess I would too if I could parade the beach ... in a pair of speedo's .. but I sure wouldn't get mixed up like they did .. and put that ‘potato’ in the BACK .. instead of the front !! I can just imagine those sunbathers running and laughing till they cried.. the WELL TANNED DUMMY's .. signifing with A LOAD in the ‘seats’ of their Speedo's .. (chuckles)” Good job, jon - this post is a representative capsule of most all of your posts…you included a racist comment in the first sentence, followed by poor punctuation, misspelling (What exactly is “signifing?”, ending with the self-congratulatory, parenthetical, proclamation of how funny you were. (chuckles) Yeah, jon that was a real knee-slapper, alright! (tee-hee, giggles and winkie-faces) Now here’s Jon’s post of nine days ago, which he either liked so much that he repeated it, or was so waxed last night that he forgot he had already blessed us with his jocularity. “Mmm .. speaking of 2 idiots lv66vette - where's your twin ‘av8lover’ ?? I'm surprised you haven't activated him. Well, you two guys have a nice day today ... strolling the sunny beach .. signifying in your speedos, but remember .. put the potatos (sic) in the front dummies, not the "back" (chuckles)” Jon, I have no idea what your fixation with putting tubers in your shorts is all about, but attempting to re-circulate really old jokes that were totally lame to begin with and pretending that you created them is even more pathetic. That said, perhaps rather than stuffing your underwear with vegetables, you could alter your diet of alcohol and pork rinds long enough to actually ingest some healthy food to slow down your obvious cognitive decline and encourage focus and clarity. (Berries of all sorts are good for this, but ingesting them as Boone’s Farm won’t really help.) I mention this because of the glaring mistake in your second post above. You are apparently of a similar intellectual capacity as one of renown standard-bearers of you ideology, the inscrutable, Dan Quayle. You spelled potatoes as potatos. When he did that back in 1992, he mistakenly corrected a 12 year old boy, named William Figueroa. What the child said about Quayle, is an even more accurate description of you. “The young Figueroa crystallized the effects of this incident on Quayle's public image when he said that it ‘showed that the rumors about the vice president are true – that he's an idiot.’ Now, put some squash in your skivvies, stop vegetating, get back to your cubicle and get to work.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1348232055526</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 08:54:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348232554308-5</Id><Topic><Title>Obama admin knew embasy attack probable but did not protect staff</Title><Username>art_bell51</Username><Timestamp>1347598008522</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 00:46:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>By no means is it an apology ad.

On another note,, I noticed that the NEXT WAVE spectrum purchase is hitting a slight legal issue that won't mean much for AT&amp;T's purchase but means a lot to the common stock holders of NEXT WAVE (WAVE). The agreement that was made between the 2 companies wasn't fair to the common stock and there was a lawsuit, The common stock owners are ending up with a better deal on an out of court setttlement. That is a huge gesture and win to me. I never have seen those types of lawsuits turn out positive for the common stock owners. So I'm very happy for them.

In terms of looking at this as a long-term holding, I would then like to see that $4-5 drop after earnings to even out the slope of the line on the chart to more sustainable 40-45 degree angle. The price drop will also allow for better reinvestment price when the dividend is paid. I love to see the stock price soar like this, but I don't want it to get too far ahead of itself before the margins are confirmed and we have some guidance on the next earnings call.</Msg><Username>vwdiesel10</Username><Timestamp>1348237894125</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 10:31:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348238697985-12</Id><Topic><Title>Tuber Time With jon...</Title><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1348232055526</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 08:54:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I agree Jon, don't argue with him.

"You hate to think that the president would purposely mislead the American people, but it sure looks like it to me," House Armed Services Committee Chairman Buck McKeon, R-Calif., said. McKeon was among several top-ranking lawmakers who expressed frustration following a briefing with administration officials late Thursday. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said he learned "nothing" from it, claiming the administration is still blaming an anti-Islam film on YouTube for the attack that killed four Americans including the U.S. ambassador. The White House has been sending mixed signals. Press Secretary Jay Carney for the first time Thursday called the strike terrorism. Obama, though, continued to cite the anti-Islam film when asked about the attack during a voter forum hosted by Univision. The attack was clearly pre-planned and could lead back to Al Qaeda or an affiliate. Obama, in his interview with Univision, did not say whether Al Qaeda might be involved, saying the matter is still under investigation. You hate to think that the president would purposely mislead the American people, but it sure looks like it McKeon told Fox News that it's time for Obama to address the American people about what's happening. "If he'd spend some time in Washington ... rather than traveling around ... to raise money and campaign for four more years of what -- yeah, I think it would be good if he did a little bit of what he's being paid to do," he said. Several concerns have been raised about the version of events being pushed by administration officials. Foremost, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice's claims that the attack was a "spontaneous" event triggered by protests in Cairo were challenged by claims out of Libya and intelligence sources that the strike was premeditated and possibly tied to a former Guantanamo inmate. Sources also said there was no major protest in Benghazi before the strike, which further challenged assertions that the strike was part of a demonstration spun out of control. Furthermore, Fox News has confirmed that the two former Navy SEALs killed in the attack were not working security for the State Department but were in Benghazi for a separate agency. And they were not initially at the consulate -- but a separate facility -- when the main building came under fire last Tuesday night. These details also appear to conflict with the account given by Rice on ABC's "This Week." She said: "We had a substantial security presence with our personnel. ... Tragically, two of the four Americans who were killed were there providing security. That was their function. And indeed, there were many other colleagues who were doing the same with them." Some lawmakers have called for an independent investigation, expressing concern about whether the administration is handling it appropriately. Following Thursday's briefing with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and others, Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., reportedly slammed the meeting as "the most useless, worthless briefing that I have attended in a long time." "It was like a one-hour filibuster with absolutely not one single bit of new information being brought forth," he said, according to Foreign Policy magazine. The briefing "if anything, built far greater distrust about what's happening than just answering questions. It was pretty unbelievable."</Msg><Username>ricky1820l</Username><Timestamp>1348247147755</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 13:05:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348247245229-23</Id><Title>Are we losing steam?</Title><Msg>Excellent analysis and commentary! copy and paste it to your browser goo.gl/naCJn</Msg><Username>josephjohn697</Username><Timestamp>1348247245229</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 13:07:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348247950537-24</Id><Topic><Title>NY State "busted"in $15 B Medicare Fraud !!</Title><Username>jon3retired</Username><Timestamp>1348243694812</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 12:08:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Now that's what I call a BIG GULP!!</Msg><Username>dadiooftheradio</Username><Timestamp>1348247950537</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 13:19:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348248379185-25</Id><Title>T looking good</Title><Msg>Dividend and cap appreciation, sweet.

You and Romney should be criticizing the video and violence--not sniping at our FSOs for cheap political gains.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1348248843741</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 13:34:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348248869752-30</Id><Topic><Title>Obama reveals he doesn't know what national debt is and it is not his problem.</Title><Username>geoff_holt_2001</Username><Timestamp>1348161017133</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 13:10:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>By josephjohn697 Excellent analysis and commentary!</Msg><Username>spamo_1</Username><Timestamp>1348248869752</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 13:34:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348248976720-31</Id><Topic><Title>Obama says he believes in redistribution</Title><Username>art_bell51</Username><Timestamp>1348073752677</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 12:55:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>By josephjohn697 Excellent analysis and commentary!</Msg><Username>spamo_1</Username><Timestamp>1348248976720</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 13:36:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348249067517-32</Id><Topic><Title>Obama's New (Copy Cat) Flag</Title><Username>jon3retired</Username><Timestamp>1348180650601</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 18:37:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>By josephjohn697 Excellent analysis and commentary!</Msg><Username>spamo_1</Username><Timestamp>1348249067517</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 13:37:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348249154728-33</Id><Topic><Title>NY State "busted"in $15 B Medicare Fraud !!</Title><Username>jon3retired</Username><Timestamp>1348243694812</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 12:08:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Jon - Ricky already corrected your complete blunder and misstatement about the CONTENT of whatever point you were trying to make.

The Obama administration has made uncovering this type of fraud a priority. The amounts that some estimate are being lost to fraud in this system are staggering. I am glad it is finally being dealt with--by this administration and by Republicans in Congress. Fraud is not a partisan issue. I hope both parties are assiduous in eliminating, regardless of the party affiliation of whoever committed it. Lastly, your posts are barely comprehensible. The effort it must take to write so poorly seems painful. For a lover of the English language, your posts remind me of the smells that emanate from behind the stairwells of cheap Bourbon Street bars. If your name was e.e. cummings and it was 1920 and you were writing avant-garde poetry some might see you as a genius. But you're not and its not, so we see you for what you are: the most worthless poster on this MB.

These attacks are just an excuse for their actions and hoping that using religion as the excuse will stop the US from going after the perpetrators and it appears to be working rather well.</Msg><Username>winholder</Username><Timestamp>1348274223064</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 20:37:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348274414491-66</Id><Topic><Title>Obama says he believes in redistribution</Title><Username>art_bell51</Username><Timestamp>1348073752677</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 12:55:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>When the government passes laws to take your money so that it can be shared with others it is no longer 'giving'. The government has the authority to collect taxes to support common activities and basic infrastructure building and improvements and defense of the nation and its borders.

Why, if they are enhancing existing technologies, creating new products and employing more people should they not benefit from their work? Tax breaks did not make these people wealthy. The tax code may have allowed them to keep more of their money than is pleasant for you, but the laws that allow them to do so were written by the members of Congress you helped elect and reelect. The rich didn't create this problem by being intelligent, talented, or hardworking, but they helped create the problems you complain about due to the corrupt nature of the politicians in Washington. Don't blame the 'rich', blame the law writers and those that accept the payments of the rich to support them. They didn't and don't have to accept the offer to act in a corrupt manner, they have the opportunity to say no. And we have had more than ample opportunity to excuse them from office. It is time to excuse even more of them starting with the President.</Msg><Username>winholder</Username><Timestamp>1348274963166</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 20:49:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348275296579-68</Id><Topic><Title>Obama reveals he doesn't know what national debt is and it is not his problem.</Title><Username>geoff_holt_2001</Username><Timestamp>1348161017133</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 13:10:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He knows what the deficit is.

At one point Mitt was asked what he wears to bed. He said as little as possible. It's the same philosophy that Mitt has in regard to paying taxes." –Jimmy Kimmel “Man must develop his tendency towards the good.” – Immanuel Kant “It is dangerous for a national candidate to say anything people might remember.” – Eugene McCarthy “Today is the one-year anniversary of occupying Wall Street protests. Remember those? They stomped out greed forever." – Jimmy Kimmel “Education is the silver bullet. Education is everything. We don't need little changes, we need gigantic revolutionary changes. Schools should be palaces. Competition for the best teachers should be fierce. They should be getting six-figure salaries. Schools should be incredibly expensive for government and absolutely free of charge for its citizens, just like national defense. That is my position.

It should be a moral one; to teach self-trust; to inspire the youthful man with an interest in himself; with a curiosity touching his own nature; to acquaint him with the resources of his mind, and to teach him that there is all his strength, and to inflame him with a piety towards the Grand Mind in which he lives.” – Ralph Waldo Emerson “Confucius say, ‘Crowded elevator smell different to midget’!.” "Mitt Romney is trailing in the polls.

Who said they shouldn't? How low do you think Oprah's tax rate needs to be to allow her to benefit from her work? You already think it should be half the rate I need to allow me to benefit from my work. How low does it need to be so she can benefit from her work? "Tax breaks did not make these people wealthy." Sure doesn't hurt. How low should Oprah's tax rate be? It's already 15% for unearned income (so we are using the term "work" loosely here). Should Oprah's tax rate be 10%? 5%? 1%? Lower? Maybe you'll answer. Romney won't. jj won't.

The commercial does nothing but express our respect for all religions and inform people that the American government did not produce that video. Do you think stating American values is apologizing? Expressing our core values is not apologizing. Calling a despicable video what it is is not apologizing. Believe me, I am a strong believer in allowing Lavendar to be the despicable person he is. I am also a strong believer in calling him what he is--a despicable person. Same with the people who made this video. I don't apologize for him. I condemn him. So does America. The violence against random people we are seeing in the MidEast is despicable. The video is despicable. Obama is defending the right of Americans to produce that video, but by no means should he or any decent American defend the video. The violence is indefensible, but people around the world need to know that video was produced by a few despicable people. It does not represent America or our values. You shouldn't be ashamed to express that.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1348282383802</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 22:53:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348282435706-76</Id><Topic><Title>Obama admin knew embasy attack probable but did not protect staff</Title><Username>art_bell51</Username><Timestamp>1347598008522</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 00:46:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"the one spouting off before he knew anything about what was going on and making a fool of himself."
