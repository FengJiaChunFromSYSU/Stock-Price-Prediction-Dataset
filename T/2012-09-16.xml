For example in January of 2008 the CES was 138,023,000 jobs and the CPS was 146,595,000 jobs. If you compare those numbers to the August numbers (i.e., CES = 133,300,000 and CPS = 142,101,000) IMHO you can develop the numbers that you are trying to identify (i.e., net jobs plus or minus). In the example CES net jobs is (138,023,000 - 133,300,000 = -4,723,000 net jobs) CPS net jobs (146,595,000 - 142,101,000 = -4,494,000 net jobs). So in conclusion by comparing these numbers you can see that the US economy has lost over 4 million jobs in both cases (i.e., CES and CPS). Further by comparing these numbers on a monthly basis you can determine the monthly jobs gain or loss. Hope this helps.</Msg><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1347804625015</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 10:10:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347804672700-6</Id><Topic><Title>AHQ (final)...</Title><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1347671783074</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 21:16:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Great Orators of the Democrat Party - PAST "One man with courage makes a majority." - Andrew Jackson "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself." - Franklin D.

President Obama pulling troops out of Afghanistan and Iraq, while offering less than total support for Israel’s effort to stop Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, has left an exploitable void in the region. The Middle East believes there is a disengagement policy with the U.S Obama has made no significant foreign policy speech since the one in Cairo, Egypt, in 2009 and acknowledged the region poses “difficult” problems -- including the absence of stabilized, democratic governments to replace the recently deposed dictatorships. Obama appears to be in an “open fight” with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about how far the country will go to help stop Iran from achieving nuclear capability. The Obama administration faces serious questions about its record of leadership in the world. Attacks last week on roughly 20 U.S. Middle East posts -- including the fatal one Libya -- were the result of America's shift in foreign policy to one of "disengagement. Prior to 9/11, we had a policy of containment. Then after 9/11, it was a confrontation with the terrorists and Al Qaeda. Now it's disengagement. We're leaving Iraq. We're leaving Afghanistan. We're leaving the area. The people in the area are having to adjust. And they believe the United States is weak. The Obama administration and liberal media who right now think the attacks were sparked by an anti-Muslim video on the Internet are “ignoring the facts. Most people don't bring rocket-propelled grenades and heavy weapons to a demonstration.That was an act of terror. And for anyone to disagree with that fundamental fact, is really ignoring the facts.</Msg><Username>geoff_holt_2001</Username><Timestamp>1347827184988</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 16:26:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347844727462-13</Id><Title>If Romney can't run an orderly campaign, how is he going to run the country?</Title><Msg>His campaign staff is in full revolt, and Ryan is about to go rogue.</Msg><Username>clean_cool_water</Username><Timestamp>1347844727462</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 21:18:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347847914605-14</Id><Topic><Title>If Romney can't run an orderly campaign, how is he going to run the country?</Title><Username>clean_cool_water</Username><Timestamp>1347844727462</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 21:18:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And you are mentally handicapped.
