I mean the only thing that can stop a bad guy with dynamite is to face a good guy with dynamite (right there in the classroom).I mean that worked so well having guards carry weapons, carrying explosives makes lots of sense. Of course, along comes a crazy liberal who thinks maybe the way to decrease the killings is to make it very difficult to have dynamite and hand grenades ( and yes, guns and clips). Those liberals sure are crazy. More guns, more dynamite, more grenades that will stop deranged folks. It has worked great so far.</Msg><Username>ellerbebil2</Username><Timestamp>1356447391414</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-25 09:56:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356450995656-3</Id><Topic><Title>After Hours Quotes (final)...</Title><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1356384063642</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-24 16:21:03 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Merry Christmas echo.</Msg><Username>t.bfine</Username><Timestamp>1356450995656</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-25 10:56:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356483105402-4</Id><Topic><Title>Now it is official: America needs more gun control</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1356358184748</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-24 09:09:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes, as horrible it is the murder of these innocent kids, guns actually save many more lives. Just think how terrible crime would be in the USA, if our Officers weren't armed.

Now is the Time. Many excellent Docs will retire this year cause of their lowered Medicare payment reimbursements alone. Also, there's the big Yohoo headline. Barry may go after/tax your employer sponsored health care. It's just too big a pot of money to ignore.
