I know that I will feel safer knowing that law abiding citizens will no longer have the right to own or bear arms.

According to your logic, drug heads can always find drugs; rapests can always find victumes; thieves can always steal. Why do we have laws against anything if the logic is crooks are not going to pay attention to laws anyway.. Making guns harder to buy/own will not solve all the problem. But if we can solve half the problem that would be a big improvement. Does a policy have to work 100% of the time before it is a good policy? I would take a 50% decrease in murder and be pretty pleased. That means half of those kids in Conn would be alive today. I would take that. By the way, I just read where another person was exercising his 2nd amendment rights this morning. He set a fire then shot and killed two firemen when they responded. Too bad about the firemen. But at least someone got to use his second amendment rights and, god forbid, we take away the shoters' rights. Too bad idiots like you don't think about the firemens rights.</Msg><Username>ellerbebil2</Username><Timestamp>1356378357714</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-24 14:45:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356384043545-10</Id><Title>After Hours Quotes...</Title><Msg>..."There are no strangers on Christmas Eve." - “Beyond Tomorrow” “Happy, happy Christmas, that can win us back to the delusions of our childhood days, recall to the old man the pleasures of his youth, and transport the traveler back to his own fireside and quiet home!” - Charles Dickens “People can't concentrate properly on blowing other people to pieces if their minds are poisoned by thoughts suitable to the twenty-fifth of December.” – Ogden Nash "Christmas, in its final essence, is for grown people who have forgotten what children know.

You do all the work and the fat guy with the suit gets all the credit.” - anonymous “Christmas! The very word brings joy to our hearts.

O’Rourke "According to a new poll, most Americans think Santa Claus is a Democrat – which is really odd because when I think of a fat, old white man who hires unskilled labor, I think Republican." – Conan O’Brien “Christmas waves a magic wand over this world, and behold, everything is softer and more beautiful.” - Norman Vincent Peale “Somehow, not only for Christmas, But all the long year through, The joy that you give to others, Is the joy that comes back to you. And the more you spend in blessing, The poor and lonely and sad, The more of your heart's possessing, Returns to you glad.” - John Greenleaf Whittier “Christmas is a time when everybody wants his past forgotten and his present remembered. What I don't like about office Christmas parties is looking for a job the next day.” - Phyllis Diller “What is Christmas? It is tenderness for the past, courage for the present, hope for the future.

So it doesn't take guns to kill people, but it takes a crazy person. The Libs don't seem to understand that. Obama's kids have 11 armed guards at their school, so I don't see an issue with all other schools having at least one armed security officer. I believe almost 20% of all high schools already have some type of armed officer, so expanding the program to include all schools is not a reach. Also, it is crazy people who kill and not the gun. If there were no guns, then these crazy people would be like suicide bombers and that would be worse than trying to protect against someone carrying a gun.</Msg><Username>jbsjksaks</Username><Timestamp>1356410639731</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-24 23:43:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
