Bummer…so much for “stand your ground” I guess, huh? Maybe they just don’t like redneck crackers cleaning fish on the picnic tables in the park. Oh, and next time a shady juvenile delinquent asks you for a nickel, don’t respond “Do you have change for a fifty”, Einstein.

Only a sheep and a sheepdog were washed up with him. After looking around, he realized that they were stranded on a deserted island. After being there awhile, he got into the habit of taking his two animal companions to the beach every evening to watch the sunset. One particular evening, the sky was a fiery red with beautiful cirrus clouds, the breeze was warm and gentle - a perfect night for romance. As they sat there, the sheep started looking better and better to the lonely man. Soon, he leaned over to the sheep and put his arm around it. But the sheepdog, ever protective of the sheep, growled fiercely until the man took his arm from around the sheep. After that, the three of them continued to enjoy the sunsets together, but there was no more cuddling. A few weeks passed by and, lo and behold, there was another shipwreck. The only survivor was Nancy Pelosi. That evening, the man brought Nancy to the evening beach ritual. It was another beautiful evening - red sky, cirrus clouds, a warm and gentle breeze- perfect for a night of romance. Pretty soon, the man started to get those "feelings" again. He fought the urges as long as he could but he finally gave in and leaned over to Nancy and told her he hadn't had sex for months. Nancy batted her eyelashes and asked if there was anything she could do for him. He said, "Take the dog for a walk."</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1374327254962</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 09:34:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374331654618-4</Id><Topic><Title>Zimmerman Acquitted</Title><Username>geoff_holt_2000</Username><Timestamp>1373769095727</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 22:31:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>..

On Friday our "dear leader" gave us some insight into his feelings regarding the verdict in the Zimmerman case. Today the Reverend Al is organizing 101 "Justice for Trayvon Rallies". The Justice Department opens a tip line and continues to look for some excuse to persecute a Latino man. The MSM, the left and the democrat party continue their age old quest to divide the American people into racial, ethnic, class, gender, and sexual orientation groups. The Republican party continues their tepid resolve to reach across the aisle and be liked by everyone, thus reinforcing their irrelevance in any political discourse. A once great American city seeks bankruptcy protection after years of mismanagement and incurring a multi billion dollar debt. Chris Mathews makes an apology for all white people. I could go on, but what a difference a week makes. "In your heart you know he is right."

Don't recognize me? That's OK; I understand. My name was Antonio West. I was the 13-month old child who was shot in the face at point blank range by two black teens, who were attempting to rob my mother, who was also shot. I think my murder and my mommy's wounding made the news for maybe a day, and then disappeared. A Grand Jury of my mommy's peers from Brunswick, Georgia ruled the black teens who murdered me will not face the death penalty... too bad it was me who got the death sentence from my killers instead, because Mommy didn't have the money they demanded. See, my family made the mistake of being white in a 73% non-white neighborhood, but my murder wasn't ruled a 'hate crime'. Oh, and President Obama didn't take a single moment to acknowledge my murder. He couldn't have any children who could possibly look like me - so why should he care? I'm one of the youngest murder victims in our great Nation's history, but the media didn't care to cover the story of my being killed in cold blood. There isn't a white equivalent of Al Sharpton, because if there was he would be branded a 'racist'. So no one's rushing to Brunswick, Georgia to demonstrate and demand 'justice' for me. There's no 'White Panther' party, either, to put a bounty on the lives of the two black teens who murdered me. I have no voice, I have no representation, and unlike those who shot me in the face while I sat innocently in my stroller - I no longer have my life. Isn't this a great country? So while you're out seeking 'justice for Trayvon', please remember to seek 'justice' for me. Tell your friends about me, tell you families, get tee-shirts with my face on them, and make the world pay attention, just like you did for Trayvon. I won't hold my breath. I don't have to anymore.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1374368009190</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 20:53:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
