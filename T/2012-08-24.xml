Winholder, the apologist for the Tea Party mentality that global warming is a hoax, now tries to soften his stance. “I didn't say there is nothing we could do about climate change, just that there are some things we can't control. There are also some things that 'just happen' and there isn't a thing you or anyone else can do about it. Is that clear enough for you yet egghead?” One year ago today, 8/24/11 one of your many fake ricky cronies (ricky23009) said this: “only 44 percent of us now believe carbon dioxide emissions are warming the Earth, down from 51 percent in 2009 and 71 percent in 2007.Global temperatures peaked in 1998. People have noticed winters are getting colder. Man-made global warming is a ‘contrived phony mess that is falling apart of its own weight," said Texas Governor Rick Perry…IT'S THE MOST HARMFUL HOAX IN HISTORY….” …to which you responded: '“I think there is evidence that we are getting warmer, but not all of it is man caused. Many scientists can provide evidence that it has happened before. There is evidence that in most parts of the planet, the air is actually cleaner than anytime in the past century. For man to think we can control or manually change the atmosphere is so egotistical it is difficult to comphrehend (sic).” And now you say, “What is your argument about nature doing some things we cannot control regardless of how hard we try.” (You mention rain and wind.) My argument is this. Nobody’s talking about rain and wind (although we have an impact on them, as well.) We are talking about man-made climate change. Yet, your forked-tongue logic suggests maybe it’s getting warmer, but not really, but if it is, it’s not ALL our fault, and who cares ‘cuz we can’t do anything about it anyhow. You can argue and call names all you want, but that is the continued message from you and your parasitic alter egos. “For man to think we can control or manually change the atmosphere is so egotistical it is difficult to comphrehend (sic).” What’s difficult to comprehend is how you can make such an outlandish statement when what we are talking about is exactly that - man changing the atmosphere. That’s precisely what is happening. Only fools with bloated egos like you have difficulty comprehending that. And, unfortunately, we’re not doing it out of ignorance – we’re doing it out of greed, with people like you supporting it through lies and deceit. There are almost 1,400 actively published climate researchers in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Ninety-eight % (98 percent) of them support the belief that the main cause of climate change is Anthropogenic (man-made) “The relative climate expertise and scientific prominence of the researchers unconvinced are substantially below that of the convinced researchers.” It would appear, as with most issues you choose to debate, you are once again representing the 2%.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1345812512000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 08:48:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345815017000-3</Id><Topic><Title>ROMNEY HIT A HOME RUN TODAY IN NEW MEXICO</Title><Username>sayuthink</Username><Timestamp>1345774446000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 22:14:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"America's biggest export currently is oil/gas.

Since, the beginning when he was elected secret meeting were held to make him a one term President, and who know maybe even less. Watch them a team is when both horses work as one, they have to get orders from their trainers. This is leadership we do not need. Remember the 3am call? Hope they have their speed dial programed correctly. The House has been sitting on their hands, and made the GOP the party of NO. They want to make Obama look as bad as they can. This regardless of what it means to the guy, no job, and with a family to support. They are willing to spend money on arms, and tax breaks to the One Percenters. It can actually called a consiracy to remove Obama from power, if they did it with deadly force it would be a capital crime. Yet, in a way this is even worse, they let people suffer while they wait till after the election to turn loose their positive votes. Obama got healthcare on it's way, and history will note this, going after Bin Laden,women's rights, women's pay, &amp; the relentless pouring in of unmarked money to buy votes for Romney. Once, people fully see the positives of Obamacare they, and our Corporations will love it.

The Forbes Article. Too funny, as the article states "This didn’t happen after 1999, when Mitt Romney says he left Bain" Do you ever read what you post? You got nothing but the lies you have been brainwashed to believe. It does prove how easily you liberal can be lied too because you won't invest the time to find out the truth.</Msg><Username>ricky1820l</Username><Timestamp>1345825025000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 12:17:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345825397000-31</Id><Topic><Title>Romney rescues kidanpped girl</Title><Username>geoff_holt_2001</Username><Timestamp>1345821361000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 11:16:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>&gt;&gt;&gt;something along these lines is far more likely what he'll do to the country yes he will take the country the direction it needs to go unlike Obama who will eat it up and leave nothing but bare bones.</Msg><Username>ricky1820l</Username><Timestamp>1345825397000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 12:23:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345825841000-32</Id><Topic><Title>Romney rescues kidanpped girl</Title><Username>geoff_holt_2001</Username><Timestamp>1345821361000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 11:16:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What are you talking about??

He runs up huge credit-card bills and at the end of the month, if I try to pay them off, he shouts at me, saying I am stealing his money. He says pay the minimum and let our kids worry about the rest, but already we can hardly keep up with the interest. Also he has been so arrogant and abusive toward our neighbors that most of them no longer speak to us. The few that do are an odd bunch, to whom he has been giving a lot of expensive gifts, running up our bills even more. Also, he has gotten religious. One week he hangs out with Catholics and the next with people who say the Pope is the Anti-Christ, and the next he's with Mus.lims.. Finally, the last straw. He's demanding that before anyone can be in the same room with him, they must sign a loyalty oath. It's just so horribly creepy! Can you help?
