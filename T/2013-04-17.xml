After discharge I got my bachelors degree from USC and went into Accounting for 21 years. I didn't pass the CPA exam until 1961 because I worked mostly in commercial accounting rather than CPA firms. We did have a Sir George's in Pasadena but I think it is now closed like most of them are. It was a company store and the company went out of business. There are still some of the franchises operating independently and doing rather well. I grew up in Pasadena and the house I lived in is now part of the parking lot for Lake Avenue Congregational Church where I attended until 1949 when I left Pasadena and bought my first house in Torrance. I have done taxes for friends and family ever since 1950 when I graduated from USC but didn't really get serious about it until after I retired and finished building my third house in Hesperia. Electronic filing of tax returns was just getting started and I opened a service bureau to provide that service to tax preparation firms. After a couple of years I realized that my client companies were making much more money than I was so when a couple of my clients wanted to retire I bought their business. Now I want to retire and can't find anyone to buy my business. Well I really haven't tried very hard.</Msg><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1366178676750</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-17 02:04:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366179505740-3</Id><Topic><Title>June 41 calls are selling for 14 cents</Title><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1366140217074</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 15:23:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>As for the option trading thing, I just got serious about that about a year ago when I subscribed to a service that put out a trade every week and virtually never lost. They tell subscribers exactly the spread to get the maximum profit with a minimum risk. They trade in weekly SPX options that are so far out of the money that they expire worthless. On Wednesday they tell us the spread to sell, usually for a 30 cent credit, so we are only in the trade for three days. Well I started dabbling in T options and found I could do even better by purchasing cheap "out of the money" weekly options on Thursday and Friday for the following week. If I think T is too high I buy puts and if it is too low I buy calls. Using those two days to load up I go into the new week with an equal number of calls and puts. T invariably moves enough so I can recover the entire investment by selling either the call or put depending on which way it moves. The one I keep is pure profit when I sell it if I am lucky enough to get a move back to where it is worth something, and it usually does. I am not a professional shorter. In fact I am not a professional anything. I'm just having fun.</Msg><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1366179505740</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-17 02:18:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366202501763-4</Id><Topic><Title>Much needed tax break</Title><Username>zonbac89</Username><Timestamp>1366074786962</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 21:13:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"we can't deduct that money from our tax burden."

It sounds like a well lived life, and like he created opportunity for many people as they created opportunity for him. But I also think he wouldn't have had as many VWs to fix without the interstate highway system, or without good union jobs that created a large middle class able to afford multiple vehicles. And that the state's role in regulating accountants and the Federal role in regulating accounting likely increased his income. And that absolutely no one would eat at a place called "Sir George's Smorgasbord" without the FDA, the USDA and health inspectors make sure the food was safe (which also lower food costs and insurance costs). It is easy to see wilkes' individual initiative. It is much harder to see all those things that made his initiative more lucrative for him and for the economy as a whole. It is also much easier to see the cost of taxes than the cost of a restaurant having to buy more liability insurance or the cost of having fewer cars to repair because the road system is #$%$, or because wages are so low no one can afford to eat out or buy a car. It is not a matter of this side or that side getting rich off the backs of the other side, which is what both liberals and conservatives argue. It is about an integrated web of relationships. If any part of that web is weakened, the whole web is at risk. We should do our best to keep all parts strong.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1366205210953</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-17 09:26:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366206084625-7</Id><Topic><Title>Gov.

So you do your taxes in the garage, do you, jon? Where do you work on your cars…in the kitchen? You must be a very well organized individual, jon. It’s Monday night, April 15th, with the deadline for filing taxes about 3 or 4 hours away. Some 4 hours earlier, his country has been attacked by terrorists, but jon’s in the garage pouring over 32 square feet of receipts, records and statements getting a jump start on filing his tax returns before midnight for 2012. I guess you can really maximize your deductions when you’re working under pressure like that, huh, jon? And you come here offering investment strategy to people? You’ve had three and a half months to prepare your taxes…maybe if you spent less time making a fool out of yourself here, you could have had them done long ago. Or, better yet, wilkes could have done them for you. Let’s see here…wilkes is the tax preparer, but jon’s sudden excuse for not knowing where his country was attacked was that he was pouring over his tax returns in his garage…coincidence????

Here it is with paragraphs but I had to split it into two posts because of yahoo's post size limitations. You may not expect an answer but it is a good question and deserves a good answer.. It was 1971 and I made the mistake of giving an honest answer to a franchisee of my employer (Sir George's Smorgasbord). He had been waiting over a year after paying his $25,000 franchise fee and asked me when he would likely see some action on his franchise. He was not the only one waiting and, from my vantage point, I knew that the company was using the franchise fees for operating capital. I told him that it was doubtful that he would ever see any action. (he didn't) I was fired. I was 43 and obviously didn't get good recommendations from my previous employer. I had tinkered with mechanical work ever since I was 7 and built my first bike with parts from a trash bin at a bicycle shop two blocks from my house. While I was looking for another job a friend from church asked me if I could fix his VW Square-back. I did and he was so pleased with the work and the low price he sent a couple of his friends. Dido with those two. Within a few weeks I had VW's parked in front of my house, some without engines while I was rebuilding them.</Msg><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1366206989967</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-17 09:56:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366207182968-9</Id><Topic><Title>June 41 calls are selling for 14 cents</Title><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1366140217074</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 15:23:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I lived in an upscale area in Yorba Linda, CA. and, although none of my neighbors had complained, I didn't think it was going to be long before they did. So I rented a small shop a couple miles away and I hired a young man to help me. That lasted a little over a year and I moved to a larger shop and hired two more mechanics. A couple years latter I rented the adjacent shop and I was doing very little mechanical work myself. I spent my time setting up a machine shop to do work in house that we had been sending out. In 1982 I moved to an 8,000 SF shop in Placentia and soon had 8 mechanics all working on air cooled VW's. We were rebuilding and installing 3 engines a day.

But AR-15s are available at Walmart to anyone at any time.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1366231494239</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-17 16:44:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366231517606-29</Id><Title>Google Fiber in Provo will att follow?</Title><Msg>Google Fiber in Provo will T follow?</Msg><Username>skardem</Username><Timestamp>1366231517606</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-17 16:45:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366232684823-30</Id><Topic><Title>The NRA !!</Title><Username>zonbac98</Username><Timestamp>1365726571507</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 20:29:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"icky" .. you are really BORING now, I'm tired of seeing your tears and hearing your sniffles .. how about just waiting for the "vote" ..</Msg><Username>my_eyez_n_earz</Username><Timestamp>1366232684823</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-17 17:04:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366233021690-31</Id><Topic><Title>The NRA !!</Title><Username>zonbac98</Username><Timestamp>1365726571507</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 20:29:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No, we go after the guns and political tricks to solve a problem that all their work won't do. We insist that the FBI, CIA, local police, Secret Service, all go after bombers, but when there are shootings, we find the shooter and go nuts for weeks and months about changing the rules that wouldn't have stopped what happened in the first place and won't prohibit it from happening again. This #$%$ taking up all the media's attention the past few months is nothing but political grandstanding for votes.</Msg><Username>usganut</Username><Timestamp>1366233021690</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-17 17:10:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366233112010-32</Id><Topic><Title>June 41 calls are selling for 14 cents</Title><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1366140217074</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 15:23:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>...“Another ‘attack’ tennacle (sic) of echo…” – speller jon Jon, what exactly is a tennacle? Like the London Marathon question which you’re apparently still researching, we’ll give you some help by making it multiple choice: a. Tennacle – one more than nineacle. b. Tennacle – what you call uncle number ten. c. Tennacle - what jon’s doctor is holding when he asks him to turn his head and cough. d. Tennacle – the most cynical you can be on a scale of one to ten. e. Tennacle – identical to tentacle but spelled by jon. “…try focusing on some of the better things in life…” I’ll pass, jon. I know you enjoy those things…like inbreeding, catfish noodling, taxidermy, potato cannons, burping the entire album “Greatest Hits of Luderin Darbone and His Hackberry Ramblers”, duct tape sculpture, WWF, plunking beer bottles in the back yard, watching and betting on NASCAR re-runs played on fast rewind (BETA) and serving as the heavily armed guard at the entrance to your gated community, Double Wide Holler Heaven, where you protect the neighbors (mostly crack heads and incestuous ex-cons) from encroachment by insidious outsiders who might be promoting a “socialist” agenda. Alas, it sounds like a vibrant and exciting lifestyle you lead, jon, but, perhaps just a bit too cerebral for me.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1366233112010</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-17 17:11:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366233746270-33</Id><Topic><Title>The NRA !!</Title><Username>zonbac98</Username><Timestamp>1365726571507</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 20:29:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What an ignorant, over-broad statement. I am a law abiding citizen and am not and never have been a member of the NRA. If you don't understand or agree with an organization, group or a common thought process your approach is to tear it down rather than try to understand it.

I have no ulterior motive to steal our name, identity, bank account or whatever. I post my name freely and don't give a damn who knows it. If someone tries scamming me, it won't get them jack. I got my bases covered. Who is to say I am in fact Dave Martin anymore than echo is echo? It's only a user name my friend. Your background was interesting and if other viewers enjoyed it as I did, good for them. For those who viewed it as The Dating Game, so be it. I cant change that juvenile mentality. I suppose there is a risk in revealing too much. I don't think you crossed that threshold. I do take exception to your being viewed a a dim lightbulb...or words to that effect...by Zobac. That's his opinion. I wont argue that with him. Granted you have lost a bundle, but as you wrote for all to see, you figured it out and now turn a profit. I commend you for that. Continued good luck in the option plays you make. It's still not for me. This weeks stock hit seems tied to the DOJ or FCC trying to limit T and VZ from snagging spectrum at the upcoming auction. Once that blows over with some modest profit taking as well, the march forward resumes. The 23rd should be revealing with the earnings forecast. Watch for a nice pop when it beats estimates. Tomorrow is VZ with in-line to a penny less. We'll see how that shakes out.</Msg><Username>davemartin74575</Username><Timestamp>1366236226827</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-17 18:03:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366245532638-36</Id><Title>Wonderful speech</Title><Msg>Did you hear The President's speech this evening?
