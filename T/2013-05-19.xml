The biggest heist yet?</Title><Msg>According to Veterans Today, this story has documentation. Here is a snip. Can you figure out what happened? I can`t. On February 16, 2012, Lord James of Blackheath, member of Britain’s House of Lords presented evidence of an illegal scheme begun, he has thus discovered, in 2009. His documents including originals signed by Alan Greenspan and Timothy Geithner, show the illegal “off the books” transfer by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York of $15 trillion to, initially, HSBC (Hong Kong Shanghai Banking Corporation) London and then to the Bank of Scotland. The Bank of Scotland, under royal charter but restricted from involvement in any such transactions, simply “gave” the money to 20 European banks to use in a highly profitable scheme of co-trading “fresh cut” MTN’s (mid-term notes), generating trillions of dollars in profits over 3 years, none of which is shown on books, none has been taxed or has benefited shareholders in those banks. As Blackheath outlines, the “deception and cover” for this transfer is the imaginary seizure of 750,000 tons of gold by agents of an unspoken entity (confirmed by the highest official sources as the Bush family and CIA), the listed “source” of the money. The government of Indonesia confirms this to be an utter fabrication and that the individual named had 700 tons of gold (about half of what Gaddafi was holding), not 750,000. It is noted that only 1,500 tons of gold have ever been traded in world history, as stated in the House of Lords. The issues that are initially brought out, issues inconsistent with international convention and starting the reader on what is only the surface discovery of two decades of crimes involving dozens of governments are as follows: At no time has the Federal Reserve Bank of New York been authorized to hold the funds indicated However, documents held by Lord Blackheath prove, conclusively that they did hold such funds and transfer them in a manner as to obscure their origin</Msg><Username>lavendarsen</Username><Timestamp>1368994293927</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 16:11:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368995339650-23</Id><Topic><Title>California does something right..(!!)</Title><Username>echo.2165</Username><Timestamp>1368990343979</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 15:05:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>They can pretty much do that now with shell casing scars, barrel twists etc. aka firearms forensics However if we didn't have the batf running illegal guns into Mexico and our US AG playing stupid, we'd be alot better off' OH .. and I see my red-headed illegitimate stepbrother AND his cousin (echo dot 2165) are collaborating on this post Hey echo dot 2165 .. welcome to Tea Party territory, ya lemon</Msg><Username>echo.2l65</Username><Timestamp>1368995339650</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 16:28:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>11</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368996450161-24</Id><Topic><Title>California does something right..(!!)</Title><Username>echo.2165</Username><Timestamp>1368990343979</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 15:05:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Proven staistics show that 100% of "gun crimes" are commited with mostly with handguns (for 'icky') - and ALL of the violence are commited by criminals &amp; whackos.

It also predicts a violent and sudden end for those running the operation. It comes from the heavens and will take the one that used a dragon or serpent as his symbol and those that follow him and put them away once and for all. Time has no meaning for God.
