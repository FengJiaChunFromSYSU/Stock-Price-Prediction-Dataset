Ah, the extremists hiding behind their limited knowledge and interpretation of the Constitution once again, believing they somehow have the ultimate authority to be judge, jury and executioner. “Shame she didn't have one of those 10 bullet clips. She could have probably done a better job.” – frog “… he sure was ‘mean’ AND UGLY looking...but if she'd had good aim, or wanted too, perhaps there'd be no need for a trial (??)…Good job girl ...– jongunshowgeek (Hey, jon, if being ugly was a death sentence, you’d have served life in the electric chair long ago.) “One shot from the Judge with PDX ammo would have done the job…” – fake ricky “…we all need to have an equalizer.” – wilkes (isn’t that what the mass murderers say?) These people are nothing more than crackpot, tea party, extremist wackos who refuse to acknowledge that America’s repeated tragedies are unlike anywhere else in the world simply because of archaic gun control and mental health laws. And, not unlike their other politics, their only way of trying to get their way is through obfuscation of the issues. Nobody is trying to take all your guns away, kids. Sane regulation of an out-of-control arms industry is NOT a violation of your 2nd Amendment rights. You can still gather at your gun shows in your cammies and compare caliber, lethality and potency of your Freudian symbols of masculinity in a futile attempt to compensate for your own lack of self-esteem. What you CANNOT do is to attempt to transform a logical and long overdue discussion of these issues into some off-the-wall, lunatic government conspiracy theory which is out to disarm everyone, give them lobotomies and put everyone into detention camps. You people are really, really off-the-wall. And no one symbolizes what jon and all his aliases represent any better than Alex Jones did on Piers Morgan. This knuckle-dragging, frothing-at-the-mouth, red-neck ignoramus came completely unhinged like some finger-pointing, loud mouth drunken bully in a bar. These frightened little sick people, with Napoleon complexes who are unable to defend themselves otherwise (like most of the mass-murderers) are the LAST people we want to be walking around with automatic weapons.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1357740395747</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 09:06:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357740531198-3</Id><Topic><Title>They remove some of these crackpot posts before one can respond...</Title><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1357740395747</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 09:06:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>... “According to the FBI, the #1 weapon used in violent crimes…is a baseball bat.” – pinhigh who thinks Tiger Wood’s wife should have used and AK-47 instead of that nine-iron.

My, my, your responses get more juvenile by the day. Yes, the end date of the report is, indeed, 2005, which is not too surprising to everyone but you, because the report was entitled “FBI, Supplementary Homicide Reports, 1976-2005.” Had you clowns posted it you would have just made up nonsense like your normally do for the ensuing years. Incidentally, the full report list numbers for every year, not just the ones I posted - all, incidentally, which refute your nonsense. Then again, you’re never interested in facts. Now, Einstein, where exactly are your facts and figures to support your original post as pinhighshot alluding to “BAT” statistics. Batty is certainly appropriate. Incidentally, Doofus…Mirriam Webster says: “Doofus”. (Dufus is listed as a secondary variation.) Kinda’ like #$%$ listed with a secondary variation written as jon3retired. (It’s right there in the book…you’re famous.) I’m out the door. Get someone to play some Little Feat for you. I know it’s not Barry Manilow, but hey.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1357768796105</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 16:59:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357771711067-30</Id><Topic><Title>They remove some of these crackpot posts before one can respond...</Title><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1357740395747</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 09:06:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You were never a marine...you sad imposters make the corps sick...you scream of your glory...when the truth is you never served....you are not only a coward but a sick piece of sh1t .You as the rest of you want to be hero's go #$%$ yourself</Msg><Username>ltcolhen</Username><Timestamp>1357771711067</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 17:48:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357775312373-31</Id><Title>Ownership date</Title><Msg>Can someone tell me on what date do you have to own the stock to be able to vote at the stockholders meeting?</Msg><Username>bmichael1</Username><Timestamp>1357775312373</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 18:48:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357781688584-32</Id><Topic><Title>They remove some of these crackpot posts before one can respond...</Title><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1357740395747</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 09:06:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>She calls them cammies because they are his camo'ed jammies!</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1357781688584</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 20:34:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357790625707-33</Id><Title>Harry Reid the new hero of the right</Title><Msg>Again Nancy's prophetic words "you have to pass the bill to find out what's in it" have come back to haunt us.

People with guns kill people.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1357791124876</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 23:12:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
