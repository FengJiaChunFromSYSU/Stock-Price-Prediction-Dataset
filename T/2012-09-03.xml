Hopefully, fire weilding hooliganistic illegal mexican terrorists out west could be made an example by lining them up against a wall - rat-tat-tat style. Similarly, I believe western citizen landowners know how to protect their land and make quick work of the terorists. I believe John Boehner would understand land owners' USA Constitutional actions against noncitizen terrorists.</Msg><Username>kit3taylor</Username><Timestamp>1346662234000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 04:50:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346663480000-3</Id><Topic><Title>Why Isn't the Media Covering Arson?</Title><Username>robfisk</Username><Timestamp>1346638050000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 22:07:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Of course OTOH, if it was members of the media lighting fires, employing their warped social engineering agenda, to create their own stories and propaganda against good mexicans - these communist media social engineers could expectedly be tarred &amp; feathered before shooting them.

This is more of the liberalization of morals and conscience that helped to ruin many of the world’s great societies in the past. I guess with enough drugs in your system you don't consider the consequences of things like history and not going out of your way to repeat it. If you think legalizing drug sales and use is the key to fixing our economy, I don’t think even the brilliant economist Obama would agree with you. This kind of thinking might help explain some of your previous posts.</Msg><Username>winholder</Username><Timestamp>1346685835000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 11:23:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346685863000-10</Id><Topic><Title>Obama standards will double car prices</Title><Username>ricky1820l</Username><Timestamp>1346175055000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 13:30:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No, I think he would go for it.

He views America as being the reason other less fortunate countries are not prospering and he thinks we need to pull back and share more with the rest of the world. It is the typical liberal philosophy that says it is hard to raise all boats, but to put a little water in the bilges of the big fancy boats and bring them to the level of the leaky John Boats is pretty simple. He is an anti-colonialist. He thinks we have been going around conquering other lands and pillaging their societies. Us helping to rebuild Europe and Japan after WWII was an act of colonialism, not charity. He wants to level the global playing field, but he wants to level it by bringing America down to the level of the others. That by the way was the basis of the fathers’ dreams.</Msg><Username>winholder</Username><Timestamp>1346686214000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 11:30:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346686333000-13</Id><Topic><Title>The Socialist Party endorses President Obama</Title><Username>fishnman1973</Username><Timestamp>1346578990000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 05:43:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Oh yes.

He wants one where there are no stars of industry and commerce. He wants on where everyone is playing on the same field and if they are talented enough to get on the field, then he wants the rest to make them whole. They don't have to work for it, study for it, think about success, just ask for it and the government will give it to them. He wants the top capitalist in this country to be the all controlling, all-important, all-knowing, all-encompassing government.

You take a perfectly reasonable idea--equality of opportunity and a strong middle class--and warp it to an illogical conclusion. That exists in YOUR head (put there by a strong helping of the right-wing media, I'm sure). Obama doesn't want it. I don't want it. Sean Hannity &amp; Rush Limbaugh want it more than anyone, because "Obama is a moderate" just doesn't drive ratings. So they make this up and senile old fools fall for it. That's it.

A lie str8 out of Hell... Pastor who endorsed Perry on Friday says Romney is a cultist By Chris Moody | Dr. Robert Jeffress, the influential pastor of a Dallas-based megachurch, offered his formal endorsement of Texas Gov. Rick Perry Friday at the Values Voter Summit in Washington, D.C. Friday, shortly before he explained why Perry's opponent atop the GOP field, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, is a cultist. Jeffress introduced Perry before he addressed the annual gathering for social conservatives, making a special point to emphasize Perry's Christian faith--as opposed to Romney's, who a Mormon, which Jeffress said was a "cult." "We understand Mormonism is not Christianity and thus the difference between somebody who's moral and good like Mitt Romney and a true born-again follower of Christ," Jeffress said after Perry's speech, adding that Perry had welcomed his endorsement. "I really think the decision for conservative evangelical Christians right now is going to be, do we prefer somebody who is truly a believer in Jesus Christ, or somebody who is a good moral person but he's a part of a cult." "It's not politically correct to say, but it's true. Mormonism is a cult. And for those reasons, besides Governor Romney's lack of consistency on social issues, I think Rick Perry is the most electable choice among Christian conservatives," he went on. Jeffress' views, however, do not reflect Perry's, his campaign spokesman told The Ticket. "The governor does not believe Mormonism is a cult," Perry Communication Director Mark Miner said in an email. Labeling Mormonism as a cult does not put Jeffress outside of the Southern Baptist mainstream. The denomination officially recognizes Romney's church as a cult, and has done so for years. Jeffress's views also should not come as a surprise to Perry's camp, since the preacher has publicly called Mormonism a cult in the past. "The Southern Baptist Convention has officially labeled Mormonism as a cult, so this is not some right-wing extremist view. It's a view of the largest Protestant denomination in the world," he said. "I think there are a lot of people who will not publicly say that's an issue because they don't want to appear to be bigoted, but for a lot of evangelical Christians, that is a huge issue, even if it's unspoken.</Msg><Username>jbhdallas2000</Username><Timestamp>1346727996000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 23:06:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346728335000-47</Id><Topic><Title>Obama ignores New Orleans</Title><Username>ricky1820l</Username><Timestamp>1346432456000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 13:00:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>&gt;&gt;&gt;More jobs created in less than one term than GWB did in two terms.

And the Real Ricky knows that the the states with the lowest unemployment rate are rural, agricultural states with low population density. The agricultural industry has not suffered in this recession. This is the cause of low unemployment rates, not the governor. The Real Ricky also knows that about 6 out of 10 governors are currently Republican. So in any list of ten governors, we would expect 6 of them to be Republican. So 7 in the "top ten" for unemployment rate is nothing to speak of. The Real Ricky is a statistician.
