I guess I am just an average American who feels the need to be informed. I know this is a difficult concept for you to grasp, which probably gives some insight into some of your responses.

Very sad, but this is still a free country, and everyone is still entitled to their own beliefs, even when those beliefs are those of his or her master. Yes my friends, the plantation of the left is alive and well in the democrat party. Probably not surprising when you consider the democrat party's history: o The party of slavery o The party of "Jim Crow" o The party of the KKK o The party of segregation o The party of eugenics and forced racial sterilization I could go on, but the history of the democrat party and their progressive cousins is quite famous. Also not surprising is that when the only thoughts the slave is allowed to have are those of the master, asking for a sense of history is probably really asking for too much.

I like your enthusiasm. Be prepared to get blasted for making a statement like that. The Troll and troublemaker patrol will condemn you and call you every name in the book for even THINKING like that. I'd like nothing better than to see your prophecy come true, but I think most stock holders like myself and others would be satisfied to see half that projection met. I believe we het a stronger earnings report than VZ turned in. However, for some reason T rarely jumps as much as VZ does with similar reports. We'll see come Tuesday. Once again, disregard all the krap that you may receive. The easiest way to not have to deal with the Torwilligers and other nutcases is to simply use the ignore feature. Spare yourself the aggravation by rendering them invisible.

As I recall, did T not hid a high in the 90's some 18 years or so ago? The market view t as a bid of an income and an equity play as does the market view its' peers. While 100 seems a might bit aggressive, viewing t as a growth/divi/equity play is in order. 18 months though - nah! much too aggressive, yet nice thinking.</Msg><Username>dan2003hr</Username><Timestamp>1366584423113</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-21 18:47:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366584481380-9</Id><Topic><Title>Tuesdays earnings report</Title><Username>davemartin74575</Username><Timestamp>1366480014495</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-20 13:46:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ya think little wicky will go after him as ricky or his new moniker rentfree?</Msg><Username>dan2003hr</Username><Timestamp>1366584481380</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-21 18:48:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366584630774-10</Id><Topic><Title>Possible MSM interview with DHS Secretary:</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1366400124054</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-19 15:35:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ah rentfree, such a breath of ricky fresh air.

There really isn't that much going on to have VZ surge as it did. The only other factor I can think of is VZ lurking in the background. I would think the added debt it would take for VZ to pull off the wireless buyout would dampen buying. VOD ain't giving it away as you know. Maybe by tomorrow, some of the more astute board members will chime in with their opinions. Weekends aren't exactly a hot spot of activity on the T board. Then again, the NBA playoffs began and are front and center. I'm dialed into the playoffs. The trusty ipad does send audible alerts, so I don't miss a beat here while following he action. Loyal San Antonio Spur fan fom the ABA days. Great to see them smack the arrogant LA Fakers down in game one. Looking forward to them winning a 5th league championship for the greatest power forward of all-time. Tim Duncan. And yes fans, that means they can beat Miami. Hopefully Wilkie will add his two cents on the quarterly report when he advises the board of his latest option play. I always enjoy his posts. He just needs to update that ADP. Last time he wrote about it, he was down from 300 bucks a day to 47.</Msg><Username>davemartin74575</Username><Timestamp>1366591270754</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-21 20:41:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366592521678-12</Id><Topic><Title>Tuesdays earnings report</Title><Username>davemartin74575</Username><Timestamp>1366480014495</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-20 13:46:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I also love T and similar to you have a huge % of my portfolio in it, but you're nuts. 18 months till $100 ??
