The current progressive US tax system allows 47% of its citizens to pay virtually no federal income tax and places a majority of the federal tax burden upon the remaining 53% of its citizens and businesses. This is considered fair because those who are well off should pay a higher percentage of their income because they are rich. Because the current tax system is unable to collect enough taxes from its citizens, it must borrow in order to make ends meet. This is called deficit spending. In 2008 (a year before our current president took office) the deficit as a percentage of GDP was about 3%. In 2009 it jumped to a little over 10%, and has remained around 8.5% for the following three years. Now when you compare the Russian system that collects a flat 13% income tax from its citizens and runs a deficit of around 1.5% of GDP, you have to wonder how can people survive in an environment of such unfairness? I don't know about you, but I want to express my thanks to all of the voters that voted for our current president and his party, and put fairness back into the federal income tax system.

Russia's income tax is a flat 13%, but they get little of their revenue from it. Similar to the US, they have a separate payroll tax on earned income--26% in the lowest bracket and 2% in the highest bracket. Russians don't earn much and corruption is rampant. Almost a third of Russia's Federal revenue comes from excise taxes and royalties on oil &amp; gas. About another third comes from a national sales tax (VAT). You are correct that Russia keeps a low debt. They were in surplus until the recession hit. It is a system that would make Romney proud, except for the oil &amp; gas taxes and the budget surpluses.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1357229671748</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 11:14:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357230921527-10</Id><Topic><Title>AT&amp;T and January Effect</Title><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1357163695358</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-02 16:54:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>One other thing I just noticed is that we are again trading above the 200 DMA.

Yes, there was an election and Obama won, just like Bush won when he ran, but you don't think that was a good decision. Voter's quite often make very bad decisions, just look at the crew in Congress as a prime example. It isn't over, but Obama and his changes will ruin this economy and our government. He wants everyone to pay his or her 'fair' share. He has yet to fully define his version of fair and what it will cost. If his recovery is on its way, we are recovering and his first priority (a priority that seems to change with every campaign style interview we does) is jobs, why did they need to extend the unemployment benefits for another year? Under his wonderful leadership, they should all have jobs very soon. Romney's 47% was a mistake only in the fact that he said it publicly, it was still relevant, just the wrong thing to say publicly. According to Forbes we now have 11 states with more people on welfare than paying taxes. Is that his version of recovery? “Bull. Even the MSM questions which religion he (Obama) claims” – Winholder, queen of the Birther’s. How the he&amp;&amp; did you stretch a comment about his religion or I think his lack of any, to his birth certificate questions? “I don't know for sure if Obama is a Muslim or even if he sympathizes with them…His track record of failure will cost him this election” And it SHOULD have cost him the election. His economic performance is dismal at best. His foreign policy is weak. His leadership in getting Congress to perform even to do what he wants past the health care bill is terrible. He has put his foot so deep in his mouth so often it’s a wonder he can walk. His wife and their vacations are shameful in these economic times. Oh, yeah, and about my comment this morning…”Obviously, Middle America likes the decision…so, if the market likes it this morning, as well, just who is it then that you are pretending to represent?” I don't pretend to represent anyone but me. The market may like it this morning but it will take a lot more than one or two good days for anyone in the market during Obama reign to recover, a lot more! You have your opinions, I have mine. You think mine are wrong, I think yours are wrong.

State Government spent about 1/5th as much as the local government. In 2011 over 87% complete High School, 58% do some college, and 40% complete college. With all that education the Federal Government runs a 1.3 Trillion Dollar Deficit and State and local spending is about equal. The Federal Government spends more than the State and Local Governments combined. Thus the saying "when ignorance is bliss, it is folly to be wise."

A 1. No Q 2. A 2. I don't know Q 3. A 3. Not sure Q 4. A 4. No Q 5. A 5. I don't know Q 6. A 6. Not sure Q 7. A 7. I don't know Q 8. A 8. I don't understand the question. Statement responses: o ... "conservative fluff piece," (I am not sure what that is, and am unsure why Forbes should be ashamed they published this article?) o As to winholder's lie: I find it amazing that when someone on the left tells a falsehood, they are given a pass with words like hyperbole, out of context, error in judgement etc., but let a conservative read an article to fast and erroneously make a mistake in math, then that person should be branded as a dirty rotten liar. Well if that is your position, then so be it. I am so glad that you have never been guilty of such behavior. o "My suggestion..": Sorry you are not going to get rid of me that easy, and by the way I have never made a threat to move to China or Russia. That must be an example of hyperbole or an error in judgement on your part. Well that about covers it, but again I really do appreciate your interest in my thoughts.
