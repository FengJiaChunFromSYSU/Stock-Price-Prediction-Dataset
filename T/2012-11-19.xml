You're right. They would hate a person, any person, with your beliefs--race notwithstanding. It is your beliefs, not your race, that makes you contemptible. They are not valid beliefs. The status of white people is clearly not a cause for concern. And as for this zany genocide you keep claiming, I hold up your continued free existence as well as mine, and the wealth, influence and freedom of just about every white person I know. You are delusional, which I suppose may make you an object of pity. But the nature of your delusions certainly holds you out as an object of contempt as well. If you are too much of a coward to speak with the people around you, well, I guess that says it all. Stay alone in your basement and stay silent in your Captain D's. It gives me immense pleasure to know that is what those with your beliefs are reduced to.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1353342361366</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 11:26:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353345325346-10</Id><Topic><Title>T may be ended.

Well, that's the Unions &amp; our Govt. making things better for us, right ... (geez !!) Are we keeping track of these job losses folks ?? An interesting post and some good points. Why a Union would strike with the economy so bad, sales down, etc. just does not make sense. Then on the other hand these people can't be too upset losing their jobs. With the new extension of unemployment benefits for 93 weeks, these people can sit at home and do nothing and get paid, of course at our taxpayers expense. Isn't this Obama and his ObamaCare wonderful for all of us! Now, here is a prediction. Since Hostess is closing, some other bakery will pick up on these unhealthy treats and they will be back on the market within 90 days. You can bet on it.....</Msg><Username>sayuthink</Username><Timestamp>1353349114009</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 13:18:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353351239325-15</Id><Topic><Title>Breaking news BO admin denies requests to defend Benghazi compoud during attack</Title><Username>lkglhklkh</Username><Timestamp>1351269709024</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 12:41:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"These lies go ALL THE WAY TO THE " TOP" = OBAMA !!"
