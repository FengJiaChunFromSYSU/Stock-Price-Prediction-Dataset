In fact, one of the arguments raised in the AT&amp;T breakup was the powerful pension fund then of which was thought out to be as powerful as the U.S. Treasury. Today, the pendulum has swung in the opposite direction creating monumental problems in figuring out exactly what the liabilities are, never mind the fact that they have a terrible time in earning a reasonable returns on invested funds in a skyrocketing stock market. Take a look at the IL Pension Fund, with shortfall approaching the $100.00B mark. I believe moving to Cash Balance type of a plan is a move in the right direction coupled with the fact that less and less companies continue to have the traditional plans anyway. It is fair, easily understood, simplifies the accounting immensely.</Msg><Username>convergent_series</Username><Timestamp>1368087770059</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 04:22:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368100188776-3</Id><Topic><Title>"What difference, at this point, does it make?"</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1367862161237</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 13:42:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"that no one in the State Department can answer" What do you think "systemic management and leadership failures" means?

The Dow may have soared past the 15,000 mark, but the economic fundamentals are telling an entirely different story. If historical patterns hold up, the economy is heading for a very rocky stretch. For example, the price of copper is called "Dr. Copper" by many economists because it so accurately forecasts the future direction of the U.S. economy. And so far this year the price of copper is way down. But that is not the only indicator that is worrying economists. Home renovation spending has fallen dramatically, retail spending is crashing in a way not seen since the last recession, manufacturing activity and consumer confidence are both declining, and troubling economic data continues to come pouring out of Asia and Europe. So why do U.S. stocks continue to skyrocket? Will U.S. financial markets be able to continue to be divorced from reality? Unfortunately, as we have seen so many times in the past, when stocks do catch up with reality they tend to do so very rapidly. So you better put on your seatbelts because a crash is coming at some point. But most average Americans are not that concerned with the performance of the stock market. They just want to be able to go to work, pay the bills and provide for their families. During the last recession, millions of Americans lost their jobs and millions of Americans lost their homes.

The fact that it is down nearly 20 percent so far this year has many analysts extremely concerned... Copper's downward trend foreshadows a stock market collapse, according to Societe Generale's famously bearish strategist Albert Edwards, who said equity markets will riot "Japan-style." "Copper is acting exactly as it did when I wrote about the impotence of liquidity in the face of the (then imminent) 2007 recession. Once again it is giving us an early warning that liquidity will not save risk assets: time to get out of equities," Edwards wrote in his latest research note, on Thursday. #2 Home renovation spending has fallen back to depressingly-low 2010 levels. #3 As Zero Hedge recently pointed out, U.S. retail spending is repeating a pattern that we have not seen since the last recession... Retail sales of clothing is growing at the slowest pace since 2010; but while major store sales are about to drop negative YoY for the first time in over 3 years, the utter collapse in general merchandise sales is worse that at the peak of the last recession at -5%. It seems tough to see how a nation with an economy built on 70% consumption is not in a recessionary environment. And while this alone is a dismal signal for the discretionary upside of the US economy/consumer; as Gluskin Sheff's David Rosenberg points out real personal income net of transfer receipts plunged at a stunning 5.8% annual rate in Q1. The other seven times we have seen such a collapse, the economy was either in recession of just coming out of one. #4 Manufacturing activity all over the country is showing signs of slowing down. In fact, Chicago PMI has dipped below 50 (indicating contraction) for the first time since the last recession. #5 In April, consumer confidence unexpectedly fell to a nine-month low...</Msg><Username>bshipleyinsurance</Username><Timestamp>1368111308471</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 10:55:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368111382585-15</Id><Title>The Price Of Copper And 11 Other Recession Indicators That Are Flashing Red Pt 3</Title><Msg>The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary index of consumer sentiment declined to 72.3 in April from 78.6 a month earlier. This month’s reading was lower than all 69 estimates in a Bloomberg survey that called for no change from the March number. #6 NYSE margin debt peaked right before the recession that began in 2002, it peaked right before the financial crisis of 2008, and it is peaking again. #7 The S&amp;P 500 usually mirrors the performance of Chinese stocks very closely. That is why it is so alarming that Chinese stocks peaked months ago. Will the S&amp;P 500 soon follow? #8 The economic data coming out of the Chinese economy lately has been mostly terrible... For starters, China’s recent economic data, as massaged as it is to the upside, is downright awful. China’s PMI numbers were the worst in two years. Staffing levels in the Chinese service sector decreased for the first time since January 2009 (remember that year). China’s LEI also shows no sign of recovery. If anything, it indicates China is heading towards an economic slowdown on par with that of 2008. And if you account for the rampant debt fueling China’s economy you could easily argue that China is posting 0% GDP growth today. #9 Things just continue to get even worse over in Europe. Unemployment in both Greece and Spain is now about 27 percent, and the unemployment rate in the eurozone as a whole has just set a brand new all-time record high. #10 Crude inventories have soared to a record high as demand for energy continues to decline. As I have written about previously, this is a clear sign that economic activity is slowing down. #11 Casino spending is usually a strong indicator of the overall health of the U.S. economy. That is why it is so noteworthy that casino spending is now back to levels that we have not seen since the last recession. #12 The impact of the sequester cuts is starting to kick in. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the sequester cuts will cost the</Msg><Username>bshipleyinsurance</Username><Timestamp>1368111382585</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 10:56:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368111639571-16</Id><Topic><Title>AT&amp;T Going down to $35...</Title><Username>upyou_s</Username><Timestamp>1368106724991</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 09:38:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>$40 IMHO.

Why did anyone allow an Ambassador to go to an unsecured, unsafe, even by Libyan standards on Sept 11th? Why does everyone accept that the SF team was told not to go to Benghazi, but no one seems to know the name of the person that issued those orders? There may indeed be acceptable and understandable answers to those questions, but until the State Department and our national leaders actually do answer those questions honestly, we may never know. The WH media dummy isn't the person to answer those questions. He like Rice only tells what he is told to tell. We need to hear from those folks telling them what to say. There are too many why’s and no answers forthcoming, just political speeches.</Msg><Username>winholder</Username><Timestamp>1368117835908</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 12:43:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368118335099-32</Id><Topic><Title>"What difference, at this point, does it make?"</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1367862161237</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 13:42:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Were they pursuing the attackers and did not want them to know they were on to them?" Well according the hearing yesterday the FBI couldn't get to the site for weeks and only after the local thugs had prowled through the building for weeks because Susan Rice's speeches basically called the Libyan government fools and liars about what caused the attack. They were in country within days but were not allowed to go to Benghazi because of political embarrassment on the part of the State Department. So they weren't really chasing anyone. Where was Obama during all this? No one has answered that question either. If there is nothing to hide, nothing done that wasn't supposed to be done, why all the ducking and dodging by this administration? Why not tell the truth and the single truth instead of varying stories? Just tell us that they are protecting the name of innocent people, tell us that they screwed up even using those building in Benghazi. Do something that doesn't smack of a smoke screen. People believe honest people when they tell the truth.</Msg><Username>winholder</Username><Timestamp>1368118335099</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 12:52:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368118576644-33</Id><Topic><Title>"What difference, at this point, does it make?"</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1367862161237</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 13:42:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How can you even have the guts to post such #$%$?

I have and he makes sense.” – dave martin Really, dave? Of which type of lew’s posts are you most fond…those containing racism, anti-Semitism, conspiracy theories, physical threats or just his normal enigmatic blathering with the occasional pump and dump thrown in for self-aggrandized legitimacy. Here’s a few more you might cherish: “The Kenyan is just a front man for the New World Odor crowd” “There are still many unexplained things about the Oklahoma City bombing. Surveilance (sic) films confiscated from several businesses that had the Murrah (sic) bldg. on them have never been released just as the tapes from the Pentagon attack have never been released. I know enough about explosives to know that a fertilizer bomb would not have”…with more tin foil hat nonsense “Liver Lips admits to getting it (cocaine) from his "Father Figure" the card carrying commie Davis. “I'm selling off most of my stocks. I sold off all my shares in a closely held non traded stock 18 mos. ago. Thgis (sic)market is being pumped by fairy tale money from the "Fed". Be afraid. (this was just last month, as was this: “I told you several days ago to evacuate this market. The international thieves that control it are getting ready to foreclose on America. I really don't know where to put the money but survival gear seems the best bet.” Five days later: “I now have 6,200 shares…” “If I want I can get guns from many sources other than legal.” “I can still hit what I aim at including any commie-liberals that think they can grab my gun “Our modern liberals are doing the same thing with the Constitution. There will be a reaction. Better hope you arten't on the wrong side.” I was charged once with "Felony Assault", my fists.” “Funny isn't how all the coloreds want to get into White nations…It's going to come to a screeching halt very soon. The real culprits in this mess will get their just desserts.” “…the Kenyan's ‘Father Figure’. And, possibly his real father…” When someone told him “ten 30 round clips for assault rifles are NOT contitutionally gauranteed IDIOT!, ” lew replied, “It may not be ‘guaranteed’ but I will tell you something. Anyone trying to take it is guaranteed a trip in a hearse.” “I knew Juan Erquiaga who was Castro's armorer in the Sierra Maestro…” “Clinton bombed and killed many innocent Serbs (lew supposed) to protect the drug dealers in Albania.” “It only means that criminals now run this government.” “The rulers of this country have stated openly that they intend to reduce the population. Why do you think the national (sic) “security?" agencies are arming like never before?” “I learned to recognize these leftist lies…There are many other studies that show the true causes of climate fluctuations.” Yeah, dave, lew’s a real inspiration…if one is terminally uninspired.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1368126557313</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 15:09:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368128705074-70</Id><Topic><Title>"What difference, at this point, does it make?"</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1367862161237</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 13:42:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yep, he was supposed to be resigning today and Hilary in jail, but they are quiet about it now.
