For example, Nanny Bloomberg should be delighted that Hostess (twinkes, and ho ho(s), ring dings, ding dongs), will no longer be made. Just think of the heart attacks prevented. However, these makers of dangerous desserts, are Union Members who funnel their dues to the Dem Money laundering machine. On which side should Barry come down on this one? It's easy, he'll just ignore it. Heck, he's taking a victory lap in Asia, on yet another vacation. One thing for sure, this Presidente has campaigning, and the kicking back part of the Presidency down to a science. It's the governing, (aka heavy lifting) part of the job (Middle East Meltdown), that always gets put on the back burner.</Msg><Username>robfisk</Username><Timestamp>1353553099852</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 21:58:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message></Date>
