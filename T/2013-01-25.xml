I for one don't want more liberal guns laws, what I don't want is any further involvement in my life by the Federal government. Banning automatic weapons has already been done, banning semi-automatic weapons was done, and in the infinite shrewdness of our 'leaders' it was allowed to expire. One problem I have is that we can no longer trust our government to take one-step to resolve a problem, track the results of the resolution and honestly report success or failure on its own. The 'slippery slope' as some call it is a reality in Washington D. C. and that should be more important to a lot more people. Many of our real criminals aren’t out on the street with an illegal or legal weapon; they are walking the halls of our government offices.

Over time perhaps the stigma of the 'weaker' sex and the protectionist attitude of many men would recede to a different level, but currently I think these are liabilities to women serving in combat. Next would be the size issue. Many women are physically strong, but typically not as strong as most men. If a soldier is down and needs to carried, drug or lifted out of harm’s way and he is 200+ pounds, can she do it? If an enemy soldier attacks in hand to hand and is of a large size, can she win that battle, keeping in mind it is not some fat, lazy punk on the street attacking her but another well-trained soldier. While I understand the quest for equality, there are some physical issues that make this decision questionable. I am sure that many women have the mental capacity, perhaps even and emotional edge on some men, but the physical issue still concerns me. I would have no problems with either of my daughters serving in the military, but being in combat would be a major concern. The other issue is that there wasn’t much discussion or public debate about this issue, the SOD just ‘decided’ to change the rules.</Msg><Username>winholder</Username><Timestamp>1359129668314</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 11:01:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359130127157-18</Id><Topic><Title>The REAL Killer, List Of School Shootings Known To Be Linked To SSRI's</Title><Username>bouch84</Username><Timestamp>1358886099113</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 15:21:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>... “Many of our real criminals…they are walking the halls of our government offices…One problem I have is that we can no longer trust our government…” – winholder, as much as it must have pained him greatly to make such a heartfelt public admission. Bingo! Good job, winholder. Finally, a reasonably accurate analysis and self-critiqued, psychological evaluation. Seldom do they let the inmates run the asylum, let alone self-diagnose themselves, but admitting that you HAVE a problem is that critical first step to recovery. Unfortunately, you’ve only admitted to “one problem” while you have many others. Nevertheless, by confessing that you “no longer trust our government” you’ve acknowledged that your repetitive displays of delusional anxiety and claims that you’re being unfairly targeted indicate you suffer from paranoid schizophrenia, among other things. If we could also get you to admit to the multiple personality disorder, we could probably cut down drastically on the number of posts on this board! So that’s the good news. The bad news, unfortunately, is that the treatment for your psychosis is a combination of on-going psycho-therapy and a wide array of second-generation (atypical) antipsychotic drugs. And, needless to say, you know what that means…you’re gonna’ have to turn in your guns.

Then you simply haven't been paying attention. Second, since 2004 there have been 350 deaths attributed to semi-automatic 'assault weapons'. That is a very small percentage of the total gun related deaths in the same period. While I agreed with the past assault weapon ban and that it should have continued, you're knee jerk reaction to a solution is typical of a liberal and a #$%$ As for our current situation, UE is still too high and the light at the end of the tunnel is still and oncoming train. Our debt and spending are still out of control and they are now wanting to change the mortgage industry rules back to those similar to what cause a large part of our current economic difficulties in the first place; you of course recall those stupid loan rules that were pushed into place by liberals and when the house was on fire, those same liberals denied seeing any flames. We have State Department folks killed and the government has yet to tell us what exactly happened or why and what they will do to stop it again. They still haven’t allowed anyone to interview those on site that might be able to shed some light. It is a cover up and if you deny that, you’re still not paying attention.</Msg><Username>pinhighshot</Username><Timestamp>1359130168214</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 11:09:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359130466309-20</Id><Topic><Title>Women in combat</Title><Username>lavendarsen</Username><Timestamp>1359075036992</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 19:50:36 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>...

You can simply carp about it. On the other hand, if you look around American business it is not unusual. If you really want to puke, look at the funding levels of many, if not most, of the public sector pension funds. If you are an employee, you could and probably should be pleased T is strengthing the pension fund.
