I don't view snopes as the final authority on very much. It seems to have as many errors as it claims others have. The main point of your post is that the United States is in serious trouble and seemingly nobody cares. The responses to your post seem to substantiate that thesis.</Msg><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1364394990003</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-27 10:36:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>12</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364395842306-2</Id><Title>Not too late for the ride up</Title><Msg>Next week AT&amp;T will pay another dividend and, as usual, there will be greater demand for shares and the price will go up. The price of the stock will drop at least 45 cents after the dividend and often much more due to decreased demand for the stock. Using options you can make great % gains buying calls now and selling them the day before the ex-dividend date and buying puts at the same time that you sell the calls. April options are best for this purpose but the weekly options might give even better results.</Msg><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1364395842306</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-27 10:50:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364397515864-3</Id><Topic><Title>We are on our way out and Obama is leading the way</Title><Username>usganut</Username><Timestamp>1364321408280</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 14:10:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Koch Industries doesn't seem to be in a lot of trouble, they're better than ever. To a very rich entity, depressions are only buying opportunities. I'm on the side of the little guy, who must eke out a living for low wages for hard work, and never has the cushion the Koch Bros do. Thanks to Obama things are vastly better than when he took office.

In the sixties 800 M-1 rifles were stolen from a National Guard armory in Florida. They turned up in a warehouse in Mexicali, Mexico. The newsman that exposed it, Barney Balaban, was machine gunned down in Acapulco a few weeks later. I never saw any explanation of what was behind the theft of those weapons. Military weapons disappear regularly. We had two rifles "grow legs" and walk away from my basic company many years ago.</Msg><Username>lewcor</Username><Timestamp>1364399468915</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-27 11:51:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364400536361-10</Id><Topic><Title>Organizing for Action (again)</Title><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1364306714081</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 10:05:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Tuesday, March 26, 2013 21 weapons seized from felon, officials say By Claudia Grisales American-Statesman Staff Local and federal authorities say a law enforcement sting targeting a convicted felon led to the seizure of 21 weapons, including shotguns and assault rifles. Eric Davila, 36, who is facing a federal criminal charge for unlawful gun possession by a felon, was booked into Travis County Jail early Thursday and moved to federal custody Tuesday, authorities said. He faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted. Officials say 20 of the firearms – 12 handguns, five shotguns, two assault rifles and a rifle – were found in Davila’s Southeast Austin home in the Dove Springs neighborhood. At least 10 of the firearms were stolen, and police continue to process the remaining weapons to see if those are stolen as well, said Austin police Cmdr. Donald Baker of the organized crime division.</Msg><Username>t.bfine</Username><Timestamp>1364400536361</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-27 12:08:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364400581015-11</Id><Topic><Title>Will the Keystone pipeline ever be approved?</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1363902082055</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-21 17:41:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Probably need to add a week to that time line in order to get that last OK, since the first family is on spring break.
