They`re real low key at this point, committing murders and violence with few realizing they are responsible. Supposedly most Oregonians do not realize their state has been infiltrated. It probably won`t be long though until the cartels will want Oregonians to know they have arrived, let them know they plan to control their forests and wild lands like they do in many parts of California, from what I`ve read. It could be dangerous to visit a national forest or park unarmed, apparently.</Msg><Username>lavendarsen</Username><Timestamp>1373526729654</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 03:12:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373528518138-2</Id><Title>Who is the fella occupying the WH? no one seems to know for sure</Title><Msg>Mike Zullo, the Sheriff Joe Obama fraud investigator, is still working towards justice regarding the likelihood that Obama`s birth certificate is a forgery. I just listened to an interview with him on youtube =High-Ranking Government Official Meets With Sheriff Joe Obama ID Fraud Investigator. He said he has evidence that the birith certificate IS a forgery, also that when investigating his background they can`t get far, there are no records available, therefore they really do not know who he is, or if the people he claims are his parents are really his parents, etc. In other words, we really don`t know who the colored fella is. He could be anyone, including an illegal alien. He also stated that there seemed to be some type of agreement between republicans and democrats to completely ignore the subject of his birth certificate`s legitimacy. WE HAVE REALLY REALLY REALLY BEEN SCREWED if this fella isn`t at all who he claims to be. Was all of this preplanned? The financial collapse, the elimination of the White majority and eventual genocide of the White race, the destruction of the United States of American with the installation of a colored fella who may not be who he says he is?</Msg><Username>lavendarsen</Username><Timestamp>1373528518138</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 03:41:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373542323182-3</Id><Topic><Title>Dividend</Title><Username>insider117</Username><Timestamp>1373291015764</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-08 09:43:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>8/10/2004 in this example</Msg><Username>insider117</Username><Timestamp>1373542323182</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 07:32:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373544899533-4</Id><Topic><Title>Who is the fella occupying the WH? no one seems to know for sure</Title><Username>lavendarsen</Username><Timestamp>1373528518138</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 03:41:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>...A note to any self-respecting Republicans, if there are any of you left here on this board… Overnight there were six posts on this board…two by jon (fake echo), two by lew and two by lavender, all of whom repeatedly represent the views of the far right. They began with jon suggesting the President (baracolli – sic) wants a looted big-screen TV, followed by what he considers funny, a suggestion that Travon Martin’s official cause of death was “lead poisoning” – that’s freaking hilarious, jon, if you’re some demented racist, #$%$ clown with an IQ of 14. We then heard lew’s stock advice, followed by him referring to The President of the United States as “a dictator with liver-lips”…certainly no racial connotation there, right? We then get lavender telling Oregonians to arm themselves, followed by a mind-boggling discussion of ancient Birther nonsense from another crackpot, which leads lavender to the conclusion that “we really don`t know who the colored fella is” in reference to the President of the United States. He then suggests that it’s all a preplanned conspiracy aimed at the genocide of the white race and the destruction of The United States, again by “this colored fella.” My question is, what in the world is the matter with you people? Aren’t there any of you out there who are at least moderately sane enough to speak out against this flagrant racism, hatred and scorn for our democracy. Don’t you get tired of being represented by these warped individuals, and if so, how come none of you supposed “moderates” of the right don’t speak up? I’d think folks like jon, lew and lavender are the people you should be trying to rid yourselves of if you EVER hope to have a political resurgence. Lavendar actually said something partially accurate, however, when he said, “WE HAVE REALLY REALLY REALLY BEEN SCREWED…” Yes, you have…if you let these ignorant racists continue to represent what you stand for, you, will indeed be perpetually screwed by the overwhelming majority of Americans who realize we are all in this together. Your continued silence of consent bodes ill for your future. BTW, jon, lew and lav…it’s Free Slurpie Day starting at 11:00, so that should keep you occupied for awhile.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1373544899533</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 08:14:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373551430655-5</Id><Topic><Title>? for the board</Title><Username>ossobucco20l2</Username><Timestamp>1373481399548</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-10 14:36:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>UHmmm not sure if it does...... however MORIN DEAR !!!</Msg><Username>beau287</Username><Timestamp>1373551430655</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 10:03:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373551505264-6</Id><Topic><Title>Who is the fella occupying the WH? no one seems to know for sure</Title><Username>lavendarsen</Username><Timestamp>1373528518138</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 03:41:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He sealed all his Records.

PCYC has a lot of room to go a lot higher.</Msg><Username>deal.smart</Username><Timestamp>1373569358528</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 15:02:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373570761445-31</Id><Topic><Title>DOJ(HOLDER?) organized protests in Sanford</Title><Username>lavendarsen</Username><Timestamp>1373563450415</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 13:24:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Your post is correct Lav. ... but I'm not "shocked", Obama metioned this in (early) 2008, when he declared his want for "A National Defense Force" to be utilized with-in the 50 States - BUT thinking this would need congressional approval (??) , I had a 'wait &amp; see' attitude !!

POLL FINDS EIGHTY PERCENT OF SERIAL KILLERS VOTE REPUBLICAN March 14 2010 Washington, D.C. – Ed Gein, Ted Bundy, David Berkowitz, John Wayne Gacy, Jeffrey Dahmer. For decades those names, and the names of dozens of others, have stalked the American consciousness. Psychological questions aside, a new poll has indicated that the general population in the United States may have more in common with serial killers than previously believed, namely political leanings. A new poll of living and deceased serial killers has shown that upwards of 80 per cent lean towards conservative ideals and the majority routinely voted Republican, something becoming more and more common throughout the United States as a whole… ‘Across the board, serial killers are predominantly conservative in their political leanings. Gary Ridgeway, Dennis Rader, and probably the biggest name of all, Ted Bundy, were all active in the Republican Party at some level. Quizzing other killers showed the same thing, that the vast majority vote Republican,’ said lead pollster David Quick. ‘We gain no analysis from this, it garners us no insight into the workings of the minds of conservative politicians or serial killers, but it is an overwhelming majority. Because serial killers come from diverse backgrounds and possess vastly different IQ’s they appear to have nothing in common save their conservative ideals and their desire to butcher people. It’s compelling data to be sure’.” Vastly different IQ’s? Yeah, ranging from the teens to the mid-twenties, as their representatives on this board demonstrate daily. So, apparently none of you will condemn jon, lew and lav…what a bunch of juvenile cowards you are.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1373571212872</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 15:33:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373571430222-33</Id><Topic><Title>? for the board</Title><Username>ossobucco20l2</Username><Timestamp>1373481399548</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-10 14:36:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks for the info !</Msg><Username>beau287</Username><Timestamp>1373571430222</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 15:37:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373576049765-34</Id><Topic><Title>Volume only 2/3 average volume</Title><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1373560331364</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 12:32:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Perfectly normal volume.

It appears to me they are working together as a team, but their objectives are unclear to me. I read that various law enforcement agencies are preparing for riots if Zimmerman is found innocent? Therefore, are law enforcement agencies at the DOJ also preparing for riots, preparing to battle some of the same people they sent out to protest? Or will their people safely disappear when the violence starts? It appears to be a preplanned and staged violent event, should it occur. We now live in a country where colored fellas like Holder and Obama(or whoever he is) have been handed the levers of power, and they are using that power in a way that reveals deep racial hatred, imo. It is only going to get worse for Whites as we are marginalized and eliminated, if things continue on as they are now. There may never be a White man in the top job again, only more of these same type of colored people who will be able to increasingly use their power to vent their racial hatreds against us, as we disappear and become increasingly vulnerable. We will be in the same position Whites are now in in South Africa, where they are being slaughtered and eliminated in a country they created.</Msg><Username>lavendarsen</Username><Timestamp>1373584869195</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 19:21:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373593676383-40</Id><Topic><Title>DOJ(HOLDER?) organized protests in Sanford</Title><Username>lavendarsen</Username><Timestamp>1373563450415</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 13:24:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Lav, understand that Obama is a front for the likes of George Soros.

I don't think all those sub cultures are so stupid as to not see that the only countries/cultures that rose above hunting and gathering were the white European countries and then those same whites came to and built the US of A. Used to be a call for "back to Africa" until the blacks saw what a s**t hole Africa was and realized slavery was the best thing that happened to their fore-fathers for them. Maybe we need a back to Europe movement for the whites. The US will become the new Africa/Mexico within three generations fighting the Indians over food, land and slaves again.</Msg><Username>emil_chesibilski</Username><Timestamp>1373596964713</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 22:42:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373599715780-44</Id><Topic><Title>Who is the fella occupying the WH? no one seems to know for sure</Title><Username>lavendarsen</Username><Timestamp>1373528518138</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 03:41:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>...
