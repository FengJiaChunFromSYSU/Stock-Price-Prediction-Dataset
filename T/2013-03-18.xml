In another thread I asked you about some potential reasonable changes, a question you chose to ignore. Probably because you are not really interested in ANY changes. You Tea Brains continually put up insurmountable roadblocks to any minor or reasonable change. You can't adjust Medicare--we have to pass a Constitutional amendment abolishing it forever and ever first! You can't adjust gun laws--that's just a slippery slope (which is an insurmountable argument). There can't be any change to fiscal policy if it involves one cent of new revenue! These arguments are designed explicitly to maintain the status quo by being insurmountable. They maintain high deficit spending on the elderly while giving the appearance of wanting change.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1363623024046</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 12:10:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363623167726-20</Id><Title>Is VZ better than T?</Title><Msg>can anyone shed lights on why VZ stock behaves better than T - at least in the past year?</Msg><Username>joking.yang</Username><Timestamp>1363623167726</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 12:12:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363623709870-21</Id><Title>BCCI --COFFEE UPGRADE ON FIRE!!!!!!!!!!</Title><Msg>HOUSTON</Msg><Username>sioigtry</Username><Timestamp>1363623709870</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 12:21:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363627441572-22</Id><Topic><Title>Where will AT&amp;T Bounce?</Title><Username>bettinarosado</Username><Timestamp>1363622972570</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 12:09:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Very helpful report !!</Msg><Username>parker.diana</Username><Timestamp>1363627441572</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 13:24:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363627949212-23</Id><Topic><Title>Detailed AT&amp;T Research Report !!!</Title><Username>ashleyjones221</Username><Timestamp>1362156250127</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 11:44:10 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Very helpful report !!</Msg><Username>parker.diana</Username><Timestamp>1363627949212</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 13:32:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363628744267-24</Id><Topic><Title>Ryan with his BA and minor in Econ</Title><Username>peppeek</Username><Timestamp>1363621508131</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 11:45:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If you are talking about Paul Ryan you are displaying your ignorance again.</Msg><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1363628744267</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 13:45:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>12</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363629328572-25</Id><Topic><Title>Ryan with his BA and minor in Econ</Title><Username>peppeek</Username><Timestamp>1363621508131</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 11:45:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Paul Ryan, ex Vice Presidential Candidude, pretty good little con man isn't he, fools a lot of the gullible.

I see your predicament though, all you liberals that support gay marriage, abortion, etc. are having a negative impact on the population growth, at least of citizens, and that means there are becoming fewer of you to support us geezers. Maybe you should reconsider your positions. We geezers are dying off at a pretty brisk pace, but apparently not hastily enough for you. In the meantime Obama wants to spend as much of your money as ours on many, too many stupid things while you support him. And you wonder why people question your wisdom.</Msg><Username>winholder</Username><Timestamp>1363636473190</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 15:54:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363636713809-40</Id><Topic><Title>Little things on military bases</Title><Username>bob.beachin</Username><Timestamp>1363576079741</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-17 23:07:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>OK, we don't need a Constitutional Amendment.

Maybe the theory is if it is income Romney gets, it shouldn't be taxed. . . Social Security and Medicare are entitlements, but they mostly benefit the wealthiest people for a variety of reasons: 1. Payroll taxes are not withheld on income over $110,000. 2. Soc. Sec. benefits are higher for those with higher lifetime earnings. 3. Wealthy people tend to live longer, meaning they tend to collect benefits longer.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1363642455030</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 17:34:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363642497632-49</Id><Topic><Title>Little things on military bases</Title><Username>bob.beachin</Username><Timestamp>1363576079741</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-17 23:07:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You shouldn't be ashamed to collect them.
