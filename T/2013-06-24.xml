It was up 200% in the past year, but it is only at the very early beginning of its rally because it reported an outstanding quarterly report and Consumer Report rated TSLA Model S car with a score of 99, the highest score ever given to any car in the history. Tesla is the builder of THE BEST car of the world! This very young company has explosive revenue growth rate of 1,700%. Tesla is becoming THE best automaker in the world.

Each 10oz. bar was $69.30 - plus local sales tax. The good thing about the 10oz. bars and higher, is they're serial numbered for your own proof of ownership, not transfer, in case of theft or robbery. My 5oz. bars and 1 oz. bars &amp; rounds are not numbered. I missed the most recent spike, I think it was May 2011 when it shot up to about $50 per oz. I think the previous spike to that was around 1970 due to market manipulation, again at about $50 per oz. A clue about ebay .. beware of buying ANY coinage or bullion, with an origin from China.</Msg><Username>bill.polk79</Username><Timestamp>1372118052289</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-24 19:54:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372118861104-41</Id><Topic><Title>SILVER</Title><Username>bshipleyinsurance</Username><Timestamp>1371744870057</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-20 12:14:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Might that be a 100 oz. bar for $2200 .. those zero's can throw ya butted up against that "oz"</Msg><Username>bill.polk79</Username><Timestamp>1372118861104</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-24 20:07:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372122853565-42</Id><Topic><Title>SILVER</Title><Username>bshipleyinsurance</Username><Timestamp>1371744870057</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-20 12:14:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm hoping their prices will drop a little more. I'm expecting a large amount of money in the next week and part will be put in silver at least and maybe some gold.. I expect a major collapse by years end. I also have barter materiels that have proven popular in the past during such periods.</Msg><Username>lewcor</Username><Timestamp>1372122853565</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-24 21:14:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372126746971-43</Id><Topic><Title>SILVER</Title><Username>bshipleyinsurance</Username><Timestamp>1371744870057</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-20 12:14:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>My bomb shelter is full of $100,000 bars.</Msg><Username>geoff_holt_2000</Username><Timestamp>1372126746971</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-24 22:19:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
