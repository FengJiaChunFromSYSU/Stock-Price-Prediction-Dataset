Jameson was arrested on May 25 after her Range Rover struck the pole in Westminster, resulting in minor injuries. Prosecutors in Orange County say tests showed her blood-alcohol level was well above the legal limit. Jameson has pleaded not guilty and wants the case thrown out, stating, “Well, I’m a little foggy about that night, but, based on my screen career, I’m pretty sure that wasn’t a breathalyzer the officer asked me to blow in to!!!”</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1343389905000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 07:51:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343390739000-3</Id><Topic><Title>And this just in...</Title><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1343389905000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 07:51:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well, that was a good start to the day.</Msg><Username>t.bfine</Username><Timestamp>1343390739000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 08:05:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343391101000-4</Id><Topic><Title>And this just in...</Title><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1343389905000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 07:51:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>...but, admitedly, and old joke.

Right – we’re discussing a right wing lobbying group who started a news organization with the express purpose, not of delivering objective news, but to combat “liberalism” – that great bogie-man fools like you want to depict as the devil incarnate. Then you, who profess to be “informed”, suggest that NBC fits in that class. Except that NBC is owned by General Electric, one of the top twenty defense contractors in the world with over 4 billion in arms sales in 2010. Those defense contractors sure are liberal, alright. Oh, and not to mention, the current CEO, Steve Burke, is a registered Republican. “regardless what you limp wrist liberal believe.” Oh, pul-e-e-e-e-e-z-z-z! “limp wrist liberals” Give me a break.

Then I buy the calls back and sell the puts after it corrects. When it looks like it is turning up again, I buy calls and short puts. Next week I expect T to correct back to about $36.60 and then start up again; slowly.</Msg><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1343418050000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 15:40:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343418499000-41</Id><Topic><Title>UK paper calls Romney</Title><Username>jdanielman</Username><Timestamp>1343406831000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 12:33:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He certainly embarrased the U.S. with his imprudence.

Short positions will have a very anxious week end, knowing a gap up Monday morning is in order....followed by a continued rise. I just love how they diid a flush out before earnings and briefly after quarter results. Takes out the weak hand longs, attracts and increases the new shorts on "supposedly weakness". Then announce a buyback AH on Friday night. Guaranteed long buyers (those poor shorts). Someone has a good sense of humor at this company. No sympathy. Have a great week end, all longs and shorts--- to be buying long on Monday.</Msg><Username>rpschom</Username><Timestamp>1343425492000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 17:44:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343425867000-48</Id><Topic><Title>UK paper calls Romney</Title><Username>jdanielman</Username><Timestamp>1343406831000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 12:33:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Like Leno said, it is not the job of Presidential candidates or Presidents to say stupid things, that is the VP's job.</Msg><Username>winholder</Username><Timestamp>1343425867000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 17:51:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343426923000-49</Id><Topic><Title>UK paper calls Romney</Title><Username>jdanielman</Username><Timestamp>1343406831000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 12:33:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Romney is a communist disguised as a libtard democrat from Maschussettes.
