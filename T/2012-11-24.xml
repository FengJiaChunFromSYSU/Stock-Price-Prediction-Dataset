Here in Maryland, we got in-state tuition for illegals, and gay marriage. These young, ill informed voters, now have no jobs. No job prospects. Those lucky enough to have a job (have beaten out the well entrenched illegal alien, slave wage work force), are seeing their hours cut back. Young folks are now subsidizing the mostly rich gay folks, (those now enjoying the marriage tax advantages), on their minimum wage jobs. Businesses, those nasty rich people (small businesses), are closing their doors in record numbers. Effectively, taking themselves out of the game. Hoping that Barry will wake up, or are waiting to see if the Republicans can stop, or at least slow down, our undeniable race to third world status. The trouble with Socialism, is that no one really believes it makes things better, except those who refuse to work, or those leading the charge, Barrack, and George Soros.</Msg><Username>robfisk</Username><Timestamp>1353776191381</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-24 11:56:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353779914517-3</Id><Topic><Title>Has aggressive 'Fix The Debt' campaign started yet?</Title><Username>lavendersin</Username><Timestamp>1353427660081</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 11:07:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>None of these people will ever mention the corrupt money system that is the direct cause of an unpayable deficit. Bernie Madoff is quoted as saying that "The whole government is a Ponzi scheme." Take it from an expert. I advise people to learn about the so called "Federal" Reserve System. It is a privately owned corporation that makes a profit from debt based currency. They issue currency for debt but do not issue currency to pay that debt. It entails an ever increasing debt and more vigorish for those that run the racket. Your pols are mostly in the "Fed's" pocket. Very few will speak out as they know the propaganda machine run by the shylocks will go after them.</Msg><Username>lewcor</Username><Timestamp>1353779914517</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-24 12:58:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353780254759-4</Id><Topic><Title>Morsi = Peace Deal = Foreign Aid !!</Title><Username>jon3retired</Username><Timestamp>1353764635299</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-24 08:43:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Muslim Brotherhood has been on the U.S.'s and Britain's intelligence payrolls since the 1920's. Just as Al Queda was created by the CIA.. They create "enemies" to justify their insane desire to run the world and you and I get to pay for it. 1984 has come and gone and "Big Brother" is totally in charge. The "Ministry of Truth" tells you all you need to know.</Msg><Username>lewcor</Username><Timestamp>1353780254759</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-24 13:04:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353804798307-5</Id><Topic><Title>Pensions</Title><Username>lewcor</Username><Timestamp>1353718010663</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 19:46:50 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wait till they sock it to you on Jan 2013 for your medical.</Msg><Username>lv66vette</Username><Timestamp>1353804798307</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-24 19:53:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
