No one in their right mind would turn the country over to an investor like ronmey, they will privatize ss and suck every mom and pop acct dry. they know how and it's all they think about all day every day, how to get money without working for it. Rmney has no foreign policy skill, poor decision making ability. poor memory, an indecisive flip flopper, and has chosen a running mate who is intent on privatizing ss and changing medicare to a voucher system, with a BA as a resume. All to feather their own nests.

Perhaps that is because you do not know where he stands or because his position on issues seems to be frequently shifting. Yes, I voted for Eisenhower, Nixon, Reagan , Goldwater, Ford and H. W. Bush.. I doubt that today any of them could even be nominated by the Republican Party of today. After all Eisenhower created the national highway system, Nixon the EPA, and G.H Bush raised taxes.</Msg><Username>dwb360</Username><Timestamp>1350233737534</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 12:55:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350245624440-5</Id><Topic><Title>Snoop Dog's top ten reasons to vote for BO</Title><Username>lkglhklkh</Username><Timestamp>1349711348914</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 11:49:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>From Barrack's debate performance, laughing, and smiling Snoops is right.

Never.The seals are tools, it takes the chief, the commander, the general to lead the mission. Just like there is a coach in sports and generals in war, that's Obama, and yes he does get credit as it was a priority he set from day one. Patriotic American that he is, he got this back on track and made correct decisions. Now you racist anti America losers blame him for something that involved deaths of Americans in service, he has no fault in whatsoever,and is being investigated as to exactly what happened. The father of the ambassador tells you to stop it, if you don't you are no better than a terrorist yourself.</Msg><Username>lithiumniobate</Username><Timestamp>1350258826188</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 19:53:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350260899121-9</Id><Title>,035,000 Construction Jobs Lost Under Obama</Title><Msg>President Barack Obama vowed in February 2009 that the economic stimulus legislation he was signing would create construction jobs for 400,000 people building and rebuilding the nation's infrastructure. But despite a price tag now estimated at $833 billion, there are 925,000 fewer construction jobs in the United States than in February 2009, and 1,035,000 fewer than when Obama was inaugurated, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). And there are even 484,000 fewer jobs than when the last recession officially ended in June 2009. When Obama signed the stimulus bill in Denver, Colo., he told a crowd: "Because we know we can't build our economic future on the transportation and information networks of the past, we are remaking the American landscape with the largest new investment in our nation's infrastructure since Eisenhower built an Interstate Highway System in the 1950s. "Because of this investment, nearly 400,000 men and women will go to work rebuilding our crumbling roads and bridges, repairing our faulty dams and levees, bringing critical broadband connections to businesses and homes in nearly every community in America, upgrading mass transit, building high-speed rail lines that will improve travel and commerce throughout our nation." But in September 2012, according to the BLS, 5,523,000 Americans had jobs in the construction industry, down from 6,558,000 in January 2009, when Obama took office, and down from 6,448,000 in February 2009, when Obama signed the stimulus. It is also down from 5,564,000 in January of this year, when Obama started the fourth year of his term. Construction jobs in the United States peaked at 7,726,000 in April 2006.</Msg><Username>ricky1820l</Username><Timestamp>1350260899121</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 20:28:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350261619978-10</Id><Title>Obama-funded Battery Plant laying off Workers</Title><Msg>Two years after a groundbreaking ceremony attended by President Obama, a Michigan plant built with $150 million in taxpayer funds to make batteries for hybrid vehicles will be laying off workers before a single battery has been produced. Employees at the Compact Power manufacturing plant in Holland, Mich., are working only three weeks a month due to a lack of demand for lithium-ion cells. The plant — run by LG Chem, a South Korean company — was opened in July 2010 to make batteries for the Chevrolet Volt, a plug-in hybrid vehicle built by GM. But the car has seen poor sales, despite a $7,500 federal tax credit for each vehicle, and fewer than 25,000 Volts had been sold by September. Production of the car has been plagued by several plant shutdowns. Considering the lack of demand for electric vehicles, despite billions of dollars from the Obama administration that were supposed to stimulate it, it’s not surprising what has happened. Just because a ton of money is poured into a product by Obama does not mean that people will buy it The $300 million plant was supposed to produce 15,000 batteries per year and create hundreds of new jobs. Batteries for the Volts are instead being made by an LG Chem plant in South Korea. The Michigan plant has spent the past two years building infrastructure and conducting pre-production “test runs,” The factory was funded by a $150 million grant from the U.S. Energy Department, and received tax breaks from the local government worth nearly $50 million over 15 years in property taxes and $2.5 million a year in business taxes. Obama told workers at the groundbreaking ceremony: “You are leading the way in showing how manufacturing jobs are coming right back here to the United States.” A factory that produces nothing and furloughs workers is a symbol of where American is going under [Obama’s] failed policies.</Msg><Username>ricky1820l</Username><Timestamp>1350261619978</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 20:40:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350261768353-11</Id><Topic><Title>The President did get OBL, you like it or not</Title><Username>lithiumniobate</Username><Timestamp>1350258826188</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 19:53:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>please don't give us your racist crap.
