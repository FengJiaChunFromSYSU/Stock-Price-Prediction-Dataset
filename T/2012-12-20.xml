What is so difficult to comprehend here? You lost the election, convincingly based on these very issues, and yet your House goes on as though it never happened. The President came up from $250K to $400K. Far less than one percent of the American Public makes $400K. Who do you think you are representing? Americans know who are pulling your strings, and the game is over. Take us over the cliff, and it might be the death knoll for the Republican Party for all time. Enough is enough. CBS News Poll released 7:00 p.m., Dec. 18th, 2012 Views on Two Measures to Reduce the Deficit Raise the tax rate on persons making over $250,000 (Imagine these numbers at 400K) Favor 69% Oppose 29% (Note: even 51% of REPUBLICANS were in favor – over half of them) Reduce Government Programs Favor 45% Oppose 48% Trying to take from the people’s safety nets to help less than 1% who are very wealthy is not…I repeat…NOT, going to happen.

Obama wants to raise taxes on everyone not just the rich in order to finance his spending spree which will send this country into a death spiral. Most Americans have already seen their annual healthcare costs rise an average of $2500 because of Obamacare and it will rise another $2500 once fully implemented. John Boehner has proposed, in what's being called Plan B, raising taxes without anything in return. Basically what Boehner has done here is adopt a plan put forth by Pelosi this past spring. And the White House has rejected it. This is Boehner explained Plan B because the president won't talk to him. The president won't move on anything. the president wants to go over the fiscal cliff. The Republicans don't want to go over the fiscal cliff. If we go over the fiscal cliff, the Bush tax rates expire for everybody, and everybody's tax rates go up to what they were during the Clinton years. They go up not just for the rich, but for everybody exactly what Obama wants. The country has a lot of low-information voters #$%$. who got Obama elected. To the low-information voters Obama is a cult leader he is whoever they want him to be. They don't know or care about the truth. They are going to discover that their take-home pay is significantly less but will be too stupid to realize it was Obama who caused it.</Msg><Username>ricky1820l</Username><Timestamp>1356024742589</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-20 12:32:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356025148132-4</Id><Topic><Title>Wake up, Mr. Boehner...the clock's ticking...</Title><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1356010640460</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-20 08:37:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>LETTER to the EDITOR-- MINNEAPOLIS STAR TRIBUNE Let's look at what we have learned from this election: Twenty-one of 22 incumbent senators were re-elected, and 353 of 373 incumbent members of the House were re-elected.

His 'give backs' are nothing, they are all for show and tools to use so they can blame it all on the Republicans. Obama has refused to own the spending, lack of budgets and terrible economy for the past four years and it apparently looking for a way to blame the next four on someone else. Why? Because he knows it won't get much better, but he will have gotten his way. He wants to remake this country, but what he wants it to become is not what the American people will want or enjoy.</Msg><Username>pinhighshot</Username><Timestamp>1356033346221</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-20 14:55:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356033374350-10</Id><Topic><Title>Wake up, Mr. Boehner...the clock's ticking...</Title><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1356010640460</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-20 08:37:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You mean counting you?</Msg><Username>pinhighshot</Username><Timestamp>1356033374350</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-20 14:56:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356033720238-11</Id><Topic><Title>Cars versus guns...</Title><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1355946081474</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 14:41:21 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Timothy McVeigh didn't use a gun but he killed 168 innocent people including 19 children under the age of six.

Obummer has the stats, only 16% of the elderly bothered to vote. Most economists are urging the FOMC to stop buying our debt.

I guess that's why their votes never make it back in time to be counted. Hillary has a headache, and can't be bothered. And Obama, obviously could care less. The election is over. This Marine after getting the paperwork, (to bring in an antique firearm) into Mexico, has been imprisoned. Why, the rifle is 1 inch longer than what they require.

No they are not. Most economists are busy debating whether the FOMC should have set targets for unemployment/inflation. They are quite confident that the Fed should keep "buying our debt" as you put it. Additionally, about 70% of seniors vote in every presidential election, compared to 60% of the general population. Seniors made up 21% of the 2012 electorate--a new record. For the previous four elections they failed to top 16%. The proportion of seniors in the electorate should continue to rise as the baby boomers get older. More lies from so-called conservatives. Election's over. You can stop now.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1356063138003</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-20 23:12:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356063302356-39</Id><Topic><Title>Barry Targets Old Folks Dividends</Title><Username>robfisk</Username><Timestamp>1356056827350</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-20 21:27:07 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Of course, when seniors like Jon here seem to believe everything they read on the internet, no matter how idiotic, why would you stop?
