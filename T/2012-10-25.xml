At that price level, the dividend yield is 4.6 percentao, later next year to increase to 4.76 percentao going by Madam's dividend increase projections. Now then, if the company can borrow money at ridiculously low rates, this appears to be a golden opportunity to profit from the "spread." 2) The share buyback also illustrates that the company has a strong cash flow to enter into such transaction and highly optimistic that the share price at $38.oo presents a tremendous valore.</Msg><Username>madam_hillary07</Username><Timestamp>1351158987708</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 05:56:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351162710349-4</Id><Title>If obama wins another 4 years *</Title><Msg>You can expect him to raise the dividends up to 20 trillion dollars before we can get rid of him.

Obama voters sign the back of the check, and Romney voters sign the front.” We’ve discussed this silly quote previously. We understand that it was Michael Savage’s racially charged quip aimed at people on welfare. Sadly, it missed its mark, big time. He’s right. The people that sign checks on the front are generally business owners or corporation officers. The people that sign them on the back, are the middle class workers including laborers, both Union and Non, teachers, police and firefighters, military personnel, factory workers, truck drivers, medical personnel, hospitality &amp; food service employees, sales people, marketing and human resource professionals – in short the entire work force from Wall Street office staff to Main Street store employees, white collar and blue. Why does anyone think that America is strictly a vehicle for business owners? If you count the numbers of those folks who sign the checks on the front (Romney voters, as he says), versus those who sign them on the back, I’d say this one’s over…as it well should be.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1351173096530</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 09:51:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351173167453-9</Id><Title>5%, adding? div going up a penny me thinks :)</Title><Msg>AT&amp;T (T): The telecom giant reported its third quarter earnings on Wednesday. While revenues missed expectations, earnings per share beat estimates thanks to the company's stock buyback. The company boosted its free cash flow guidance by $2 billion to $18 billion this year. The company also activated 4.7 million iPhones in the quarter, more than in Q2. AT&amp;T is the leading activator of iPhones in the U.S., and its subscriber base for the phone is rather large. In early October, AT&amp;T traded above $38 per share, meaning it was yielding 4.6%. With the recent decline in share price, the yield is up to 5.07%. That's an impressive yield, and the stock is at its lowest price since before the latest rally started in July. While the Q3 results may not have been spectacular, this is still a company generating lots of cash, allowing the company to pay an impressive dividend and buy back stock. With the yield crossing 5% again, investors might want to start looking at this name again.</Msg><Username>tiglet2l</Username><Timestamp>1351173167453</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 09:52:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351173307921-10</Id><Topic><Title>Why did they Take away the Plane?</Title><Username>robfisk</Username><Timestamp>1351047019924</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 22:50:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>... “Where in my message did I say anything about returning to Bush years or any other years?” – winholder, lying as usual And where in MY message did I say that you did? Those words about going back to the Bush years were mine. Once again, you got caught saying something totally asinine, and you try to lie your way out of it. We’ve been through this over and over, winjondale. First, as jon, you reply, “Ok Echo .. the market may be up…BUT blah, blah, blah, and you’re a freeloader.” Great response. Winholder tells you to sell all your holdings, but I’m a freeloader. Somewhere there I missed the connection. Then you come back with the above, completely ignoring the fact that you just told everyone here that they should sell everything that you have if the President is re-elected. The President under whose watch the market is up almost 5000 points. That would indicate two things to anyone following this board. One, you obviously are a paid political shill, with absolutely no interest in the stock market based on your financial advice posted yesterday, or two – you’re an idiot. Personally, I believe both. You then continued on with: “You can spread crap with your words” Well, yes, I’ve found words generally are the best medium in a written format. You, on the other hand, having experienced such difficulties with the written word, may want to switch to crayons and do cave man drawings in keeping with your Neanderthal social and political philosophy. “ Again, just more blather with no substance.” Well, saying that to try to cover up your idiotic statement is the DEFINITION of blather with no substance. But, for the record, let’s review exactly what was said, so you and jon can’t lie your way out of it again. Winholder’s post at 10:47 a.m yesterday: “Whats Nov7 gonna do to T? Depends on who wins. If Obama wins, sell everything you have, quickly.” To which I responded at 11:14 “ ‘Depends on who wins. If Obama wins, sell everything you have, quickly.’ – More sage advice from winholder, who says really stupid stuff just to hear himself talk. Why should anyone pay any attention to your ongoing inaccurate verbosity – you’ve proven time and again, you’re nothing more than a paid shill. Might I also add, you’re not real smart! The Dow opened at 8279 on January 20th, 2009. Gee, I think that is where W passed the torch to the current President, is it not? Today it’s over 13150 around 11:00 a.m. Spin that somehow. Yeah, let’s bring back the Bush years. Maybe even start a couple more wars.” Note that I invited you to “Spin that somehow.” Your response was what’s become the norm from you guys - pathetic obfuscation.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1351173307921</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 09:55:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351173651256-11</Id><Title>robfisk - mouthpiece for the myopic...</Title><Msg>... “OBami was fundraising in Vegas, he could care less how many Ambassadors they rape, and murder.” – robfisk You call yourself an American?

Moran must have clout ... the local media hasn't mentioned the issue this A.M.” - jon Here it is, word for word, from yesterday’s Richmond Dispatch. The kid was bushwhacked by sleezeball James O’Keefe. He screwed up and he resigned, as well he should have. I notice you conveniently left off the last part of the story. Why does that not surprise me? Rep. Jim Moran's son resigns after video alleges election fraud Oct. 24th, 2012 Richmond Dispatch Patrick Moran, a son of Rep. Jim Moran, D-8th, resigned today as field director of his father's campaign after a conservative organization said it recorded him advising an undercover videographer how to commit election fraud. Earlier today, Project Veritas, an organization led by activist James O'Keefe, released the video in which an undercover operative suggests a voter-fraud plan to the younger Moran. The operative said he wanted to cast ballots in the name of 100 voters who were registered but rarely voted. In the video, Patrick Moran first expresses doubts about the plan but eventually tells the undercover volunteer to "look into it." A spokeswoman for Moran's congressional office did not immediately return a request for comment. A spokesman for Moran's congressional campaign was not available for comment. Also today, the Virginia State Board of Elections asked Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli to look into allegations of efforts to destroy voter registration applications. A Pennsylvania man working for a company Republicans hired to conduct voter registration drives faces criminal charges in Rockingham County on allegations that he threw eight completed voter registration forms into the trash. Colin Small of Phoenixville, Pa., has been charged with 13 counts of disclosure of voter registration information, destruction of voter applications, and obstruction of justice.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1351174690192</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 10:18:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351175525805-13</Id><Topic><Title>Premarket news on CGUD!</Title><Username>erynncf7413</Username><Timestamp>1351128643272</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 21:30:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Just signed up.

If the answer to any of these concerns is yes, then what is your problem? This is also a President that refused to discount a campaign ad declaring that his opponent caused the death of a cancer victim. The closest he got was to sheepishly state that he had no control over those that produced the ad. He never once said he disagreed with it or denounced it.

What a band of contemptuous cowards you are.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1351182543564</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 12:29:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351183003753-31</Id><Topic><Title>5%, adding? div going up a penny me thinks :)</Title><Username>tiglet2l</Username><Timestamp>1351173167453</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 09:52:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yeah, dividend going up 2% and the stocks down 12% - WHOOPIE!!!</Msg><Username>mikerego19</Username><Timestamp>1351183003753</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 12:36:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351183033053-32</Id><Topic><Title>Son of Jim Moran D, Virginia = voter Fraud</Title><Username>jon3retired</Username><Timestamp>1351134943597</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 23:15:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hi Lav. Voter fraud has gone on in this country for a long time. My grandfather told me of helping a So. Alabama Sheriff rig the vote in the 1890's. (He was a deputy) It is really quite unbelievable that theAmerican people accept Liver Lips with no real personal info on him. Something very odd. It is known that George Soros picked up on him about ten years back through his connection to ACORN which Soros founded. Soros's depradations around the world have been backed by the Rothschilds. I've seen the video wherein Soros says he "Will bring America down". Gee wonder if he's sold the dollar short and with the help of his stooge, Liver Lips, intends to wreck our economy even more.</Msg><Username>lewcor</Username><Timestamp>1351183033053</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 12:37:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351183261627-33</Id><Title>Another day..another hammering for this stock</Title><Msg>Wonder where it ends.

No, he doesnt' seem properly upset when they are. He isn't worried as much about them as the impact of their death on his campaign. Did you happen to see the interview with the father of one of those killed? He said Billary sounded as about as insincere as anything he has ever heard and was talking about putting the guy the made the video in jail. He said Obama shook his hand while looking over his shoulder and never did look him in the eyes. Sounds like a real sensitive guy.
