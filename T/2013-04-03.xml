If you are a white European your ancestors have had hundreds of years of history in their favor. Native land handed out like candy, people they could buy to do their work for them, segregation and racism that gave them advantages in jobs, schools, housing, government services, loans, transportation, groceries and everything else. And not one of them could pull themselves up from the dregs to enter the middle class? Not one gentleman farmer? Not a bootlegger? Not one to take advantage of the GI Bill? You are the product of generations of failures who failed in a system that was set up to see them succeed. And what do you do? Pull yourself up by the bootstraps? Try to make something out of yourself? No. You sit in your basement and your Captain D's blaming others for your pathetic life, practically begging the government to suppress and enslave others. What I feel for you is not condescension. Disgust and contempt is what I feel for you. I may one day have a bunch of colored grand kids--gay colored grand kids even. And I will be happy.

His answer suggested that too much education was an impediment to receiving a miracle from God. He stated “... it has to do with evolution...Those people overseas didn't go to Ivy League schools,” he said...”That's what God's looking for. That's why they have miracles.” When asked if God only performs miracles for stupid people, Smokey Robinson, lead singer of The Miracles, chuckled and broke into ‘Tears of a Clown’: “Now there's some sad things known to man But ain't too much sadder than The tears of a clown, when there's no one around Uh hum, oh yeah baby” Oh, yeah, baby…you can’t make this stuff up.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1364999132009</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 10:25:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>14</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364999429537-11</Id><Topic><Title>New sources of information for AT&amp;T, you should see it!</Title><Username>larry_williams64</Username><Timestamp>1364908299493</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 09:11:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>important information !</Msg><Username>mike.westwood</Username><Timestamp>1364999429537</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 10:30:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365002139794-12</Id><Topic><Title>And this just in...</Title><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1364999132009</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 10:25:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>bjsh library will contain a good number of childrens books.

Will YOU the depositor bail out the banks in the future?(you`re safe deposit boxes willprobably be seized also). I read these excerpts at washington blog. This is a real plan written by the F #$%$? PREPARE. "Although few depositors realize it, legally the bank owns the depositor’s funds as soon as they are put in the bank. Our money becomes the bank’s, and we become unsecured creditors holding IOUs or promises to pay. But until now the bank has been obligated to pay the money back on demand in the form of cash. Under the FDIC-BOE plan, our IOUs will be converted into “bank equity.” The bank will get the money and we will get stock in the bank. With any luck we may be able to sell the stock to someone else, but when and at what price?. The 15-page FDIC-BOE document is called “Resolving Globally Active, Systemically Important, Financial Institutions.” It begins by explaining that the 2008 banking crisis has made it clear that some other way besides taxpayer bailouts is needed to maintain “financial stability.” Evidently anticipating that the next financial collapse will be on a grander scale than either the taxpayers or Congress is willing to underwrite, the authors state: An efficient path for returning the sound operations of the G-SIFI to the private sector would be provided by exchanging or converting a sufficient amount of the unsecured debt from the original creditors of the failed company [meaning the depositors] into equity [or stock]. In the U.S., the new equity would become capital in one or more newly formed operating entities. In the U.K., the same approach could be used, or the equity could be used to recapitalize the failing financial company itself—thus, the highest layer of surviving bailed-in creditors would become the owners of the resolved firm. In either country, the new equity holders would take on the corresponding risk of being shareholders in a financial institution</Msg><Username>lavendarsen</Username><Timestamp>1365006049779</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 12:20:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365006553962-18</Id><Topic><Title>AT&amp;T Upgraded to STRONG BUY?</Title><Username>miguel.janis</Username><Timestamp>1364394934253</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-27 10:35:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>well done</Msg><Username>savage.richard</Username><Timestamp>1365006553962</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 12:29:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365006681244-19</Id><Topic><Title>Is FDIC planning to eliminate insured deposits with this plan?</Title><Username>lavendarsen</Username><Timestamp>1365006049779</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 12:20:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Don't worry, Lav, your food stamps won't be affected.

A man was sleeping when a sink hole opened up around his bed and swallowed him. His brother, who I believe was in another room, jumped in the sink hole and tried to help him as he cried for help, but was unable to help him. This story has really creeped me out because what I can gather from the news stories is that within a day or two the house was demolished, the sink hole filled in and a chain link fence put up around the property to keep out trespassers. Apparently, from what I have heard and read NO ATTEMPT whatsoever was made to rescue that poor man. It sounds as though there wasn`t even any consideration of whether a rescue attempt could be made. Needless to say, the man was White and I would guess working class or poor. And needless to say, if that man would have been colored there is no way they would have so hurriedly and without fanfare possibly have smothered him with dirt. This is the how the story of the White MAN in Florida appears to me today, ONLY MY OPINION (and probably most of America). If he stumbles and fall, he will be plowed under without the least consideration or thought, and probably those responsible for his demise will feel self righteously good and grand for doing it. Because they will be making room for the colored illegal law breakers the government criminals want to replace the White man with. You know, Florida and its leaders - from top to bottom- are appearing more and more creepy and ghoulish to me everyday. Or are they simply incompetent, or do they simply hate poor White MEN?</Msg><Username>lavendarsen</Username><Timestamp>1365009056576</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 13:10:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365009743615-22</Id><Topic><Title>And this just in...</Title><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1364999132009</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 10:25:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And of course there are no liberals that are ‘gullible, easily manipulated, unclear, and inconsistent thinkers’ in your view of the world.

But be of good cheer my friends (and I know it is sometimes hard to remember). Jesus taught us that: "People will say bad things against you and hurt you. They will lie and say all kinds of evil things against you because you follow me. But when people do those things to you, know that God will bless you. Be happy and glad. You have a great reward waiting for you in heaven. People did those same bad things to the prophets that lived before you." So as someone who has received Jesus into my heart, I choose to wear the persecution of those on the left like a badge of honor and I thank God every day for the chance to be both light and salt during my time. "In your heart you know he is right."
