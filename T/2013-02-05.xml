These positives include excellent cash flow, steady revenue growth, solid guidance, increased subscribers, U-Verse expansion, and a 5.30 percent yield. The Forward P/E is also just 12.59.

Anytime the words "this time is different" pop into your head, smack yourself and realize that, no, this time is the same. Your immigrant ancestors are no different than the immigrants entering the country today. The direction, the language, the culture, the times may be different, but it is the same.
