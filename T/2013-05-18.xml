Overall, I would rate this move as positive although the rate seems a bit on the high side and also would have expected the face value to be larger than what is stated in the May 15th filing but still this is a positive move to take advantage of the current low rates. Going by the Friday's stock price action, the market doesn't seem to positively have reacted to this offering given that there are many moving parts to affect the stock price the most important one being competition such as DISH, Sprint, you name it. I am not terribly thrilled about VZ and the hoopla generated in the press and do not agree with the optimism expressed by Barclay.</Msg><Username>convergent_series</Username><Timestamp>1368872446747</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 06:20:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368875431066-2</Id><Title>AHQ (cont.)...</Title><Msg>...“The highest activities of consciousness have their origins in physical occurrences of the brain just as the loveliest melodies are not too sublime to be expressed by notes.” - Somerset Maugham “The Mai Tai got its name when two Polynesian alcoholics got in a fight over some neckwear.” – George Carlin "For those of you who have not been following Benghazi-gate, President Obama...has done the worst thing ever that anyone ever did in mankind. The Republicans now just have to figure out what. They have no idea what it is…They want so bad to find a smoking gun and there just isn't one. There is no smoking gun. How said is that?

Though in fairness, she hasn't said anything to him since 1998." - Jimmy Fallon “The inner sensation which I have of myself informs me that I am, that I think, that I will, that I have sensory awareness, that I suffer, and so on; but it provides me with no knowledge whatever of what I am — of the nature of my thought, my sensations, my passions, or my pain — or the mutual relations that obtain between all these things ... I have no idea whatever of my soul.” – Nicolas Malebranche " ‘Spirit’ is matter seen in a stronger light. What else did Malebranche mean when he spoke of ‘seeing all things in God’?

Tried, convicted, and sentenced all in one breath. Because that's all you guys got on him, hot air. Ever stop to think what you are really saying/doing? What you are saying is when the Pres was elected, before he was even Pres, he went and ordered the IRS to "attack" the catholic league. Do you realize there are several impossibilities in those connections? probabaly not.
