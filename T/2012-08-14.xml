Tampa, Florida (Routers) Chris Christie to Deliver GOP Convention Keynote New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has been selected to deliver the keynote address at the Republican National Convention later this month in Tampa. Party leaders announced the decision on Tuesday by saying, “We selected Governor Christie to help overcome the impression people have that we’re nothing but a bunch of stodgy, old, white fat-cats.” While the Republican National Committee is busy adding numerous planks to the final party platform for the convention to accommodate the Tea Party, construction workers (non-union, of course) in the convention hall in Tampa are busy adding numerous, additional (weight-bearing) planks to the actual stage platform to accommodate Governor Christie.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1344944189000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 07:36:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344946679000-5</Id><Topic><Title>And this just in...</Title><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1344944189000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 07:36:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>SAFETY FIRST!

Address the issue at hand. Why are all these projects funded in the first place? How many of them do you think really have a positive impact on our economy or strength as a nation? Let’s see how really smart your collective Ricky/Echo consortium isn’t. How many of them are simply pet pork projects that some lobbyists paid to have a member of Congress create? We need to fix Congress; the only problem is that with the rules of behavior that Congress has set up for themselves, they are the only ones that can change Congress. That is a dead end, they have the country by the short hairs, and they know it.</Msg><Username>winholder</Username><Timestamp>1344953322000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 10:08:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344953681000-8</Id><Topic><Title>Banned Fox News Video: 9/11 The Is_raeli Connection</Title><Username>phil_garner_50</Username><Timestamp>1344951524000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 09:38:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Do you have a real life?

ABBOTT: Good Subject. Terrible Times. It's 8%. COSTELLO: That many people are out of work? ABBOTT: No, that's 15%. COSTELLO: You just said 8%. ABBOTT: 8% Unemployed. COSTELLO: Right 8% out of work. ABBOTT: No, that's 15%. COSTELLO: Okay, so it's 15% unemployed. ABBOTT: No, that's 8%... COSTELLO: WAIT A MINUTE. Is it 8% or 15%? ABBOTT: 8% are unemployed. 15% are out of work. COSTELLO: IF you are out of work you are unemployed. ABBOTT: No, you can't count the "Out of Work" as the unemployed. You have to look for work to be unemployed. COSTELLO: BUT THEY ARE OUT OF WORK!!! ABBOTT: No, you miss my point. COSTELLO: What point? ABBOTT: Someone who doesn't look for work, can't be counted with those who look for work. It wouldn't be fair. COSTELLO: To whom? ABBOTT: The unemployed. COSTELLO: But they are ALL out of work. ABBOTT: No, the unemployed are actively looking for work. Those who are out of work stopped looking. They gave up. And, if you give up, you are no longer in the ranks of the unemployed. COSTELLO: So if you're off the unemployment roles, that would count as less unemployment? ABBOTT: Unemployment would go down. Absolutely! COSTELLO: The unemployment just goes down because you don't look for work? ABBOTT: Absolutely it goes down. That's how you get to 8%. Otherwise it would be 15%. You don't want to read about 15% unemployment, do ya? COSTELLO: That would be frightening.. ABBOTT: Absolutely. COSTELLO: Wait, I got a question for you. That means there are two ways to bring down the unemployment number? ABBOTT: Two ways is correct. COSTELLO: Unemployment can go down if someone gets a job? ABBOTT: Correct. COSTELLO: And unemployment can also go down if you stop looking for a job? ABBOTT: Bingo. COSTELLO: So there are two ways to bring unemployment down, and the easier of the two is to just stop looking for work. ABBOTT: Now you're thinking like an economist. COSTELLO: I don't even know what the hell I just said! ABBOTT: Now you're thinking like a politician.</Msg><Username>winholder</Username><Timestamp>1344982169000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 18:09:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344982714000-19</Id><Topic><Title>Economic Fairness in Obummer's 2nd Term</Title><Username>robfisk</Username><Timestamp>1344517169000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-09 08:59:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ryan looks like Reagan, he acts like him also.

He moved to Indonesia and no one noticed or cared. He attended Islamic schools and no one noticed or cared. He moved back to Hawaii and spent an inordinate amount of time smoking drugs and skipping class and no one noticed or cared. He somehow, with his lack of attendance in HS and his drug use, got into college, and no one noticed or cared. Again, we don't know how, but he got into Harvard and no one noticed or cared. If fact the media is having a hard time finding anyone that even knew him in college. He got elected to the Illinois legislature and again, no one notice or cared and apparently neither did he. He got elected to the US Senate and no one noticed or cared...until he surprisingly decided to run for President.
