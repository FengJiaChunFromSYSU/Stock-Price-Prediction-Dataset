Speaking of “slothful, lazy behavior”…you consider posting here daily with multiple aliases to be “hard work and success?” How very strange. “You can write a post like this just by reading the news headlines.” Really? You wrote this all by yourself, did you? Then why is it posted all over extremist, xenophobic websites including the Ventura County Tea Party? How can anyone call our elected officials “idiots” when they’ve previously foisted upon us geniuses like “W”, Dan Quayle, and the biggest collection of obtuse non-thinkers like Bachman, Palin, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and Christine “I am not a witch” O’Donnell, ever assembled?

The unemployment numbers put out by the government may not be a lie, but they aren't as accurate as they should be if you really want to learn how many people that want to work are still out of work. The recovery is still failing. Forget what they market has done over the past week, there are too many other people manipulating the market for the government to have much influence on it. Even the media stories that are supposed to be the reasons for all the market fluctuations are bogus. The fiscal cliff bill raised taxes on everyone and increased our debt even more with all the pork that was included and Congress nor can the President deny that they knew this abomination included all this additional spending. You can talk of grand bargains all you want but the Democrats have flat refused to have any meaningful discussion about cost reductions as has the President. They have no intentions of reducing spending or reworking welfare, Medicare, Social Security at all and if they do even open discussions (which will result in zero action taken) it won't be until after the mid-term elections. Again, another prime example of their attitudes of protecting their jobs and their Party over the responsibility they have to the American taxpayers. Obama just changed the way people have to respond in order to get visas for trailing family members without even consulting Congress, he simply changed the way the government will follow or not follow the existing laws. The man is working toward a dictatorship and no that he has been reelected; he isn't even being subtle about it.</Msg><Username>usganut</Username><Timestamp>1357588811493</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 15:00:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357588862263-25</Id><Topic><Title>More Obamanomic Results</Title><Username>t.bfine</Username><Timestamp>1357396765440</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 09:39:25 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I had a dream last night... There sat the dog faced John Kerry before the Senate confirmation hearings for his appointment to Secretary of State. After the Chair had praised his vast "Diplomatic Experience"... Followed by praise for his integrity, honorable service, etc. He finally turns the hearing over to the rest of the panel for questioning... and here is where my dream turned to fantasy... For in my dream... the first Republican Senator to ask a question starts like this.... Senator... your life story is a long and storied one...well known throughout the world... and the Chair has praised your integrity and diplomatic experience... I'd like to start by asking you to once again to describe your famous Christmas Eve, secret mission into Cambodia... Which I find most interesting since you weren't even in SE Asia during the Christmas time of year? Then I would like to ask... is consorting with our nations enemies part of your "Diplomatic Experience"... Like North Vietnam while we were at war? The Sandinista's while we were engaged in conflict in Central America? The butcher Assad and Saddam Hussein in the Middle East... and the Russians and Chinese when we were engaged in the Cold War? And would you explain to us how you recruited your fellow "Winter Soldiers" to come and testify before Congress about atrocities committed by our American Soldiers and Marines... when most of the so called witnesses you recruited... were never even in the military or had ever gone to Vietnam? Remind us of your eye witness accounts of our Vietnam Veterans as being as ruthless as the hordes of Genghis Khan? Tell us when and where you observed that first hand, Senator Kerry? And then I'd like to know why your citations for your Silver Stars were signed by a Secretary of the Navy... many years and years after the war was over? And also, is it true as charged by eye witnesses... Your Purple Hearts were as a result of your own incompetence? Friendly fire by your own hand? These are just some of the questions I have... and should be answered before your confirmation. And in my dream... I was cheerleading the line of questioning and thinking subconsciously... "Ask why he couldn't pass the Bar Exam... if he is so brilliant"? "Ask him why he parked his boat in Rhode Island... Was it to avoid taxes on it in his home state"? "Ask him how he has accumulated such grand wealth on the salary of a Senator"? "Is it true that your wealth was derived by marrying homely, if not down right, ugly... rich heiresses and widows"? "And ask him why the men who served with him in Vietnam... universally hate his guts... along with 99.9% of all Vietnam Veterans"? "Ask him if it is true that of all the men and women in the U.S. Senate... he is known to be the most egotistical of them all... only his good buddy, John McCain comes close. A man who also married well... birds of a feather......"? And then... I woke up! Ain't gonna happen... Politicians are gutless! But I have to ask myself? Is this the face America wants to present to the rest of the world? A man who has made a career of lies, falsehoods and deceit? I can think of no human being... who symbolizes the term; "Ugly American" more than John Kerry. A liar, a phony, arrogant, piece of human dog squeeze if there ever was one! Is this a man we should be proud to be hailed as a "Great American"? Can any foreign leader ever trust a single word out of this man's mouth... when it is documented that he has lied to his own countrymen...time after timeafter time... Is this the best we have offer? In a perfect world... this man wouldn't even be considered for "Dog Catcher"... even though he did manage to capture two in his lifetime. He is an insult... a mortal insult... to all who have served !!!!! -- Ed Schriber Col. USMC (Ret.)

Until that happens this country is just sliding farther down that slippery slope to doom. Congress runs this economy, basically this country. They make their own rules, they have no one to answer to for their stupid decisions expect an ignorant electorate that pays them way less attention than they warrant. If we could put together a commission, Washington like these anyway, that would review, revise where necessary, the rules under which Congress acts and forces them to abide by them or suffer the consequences, there might actually be some accountability in Washington. A commission of Constitutional scholars, parliamentary proceedings experts, business leaders, and some just plain old taxpayers, they actually come up with a good plan. Not only allowing the fox into the hen house, but also allowing them to tell the chickens what do to, when and what to eat and how much to get paid simply is no longer working. Congress is out of control.</Msg><Username>pinhighshot</Username><Timestamp>1357590079953</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 15:21:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357590106432-29</Id><Topic><Title>Having problems?</Title><Username>sdmiller4747</Username><Timestamp>1357588962108</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 15:02:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Do what your wife tells you to do.

There sat the dog faced John Kerry…And ask him why the men who served with him in Vietnam...universally hate his guts... along with 99.9% of all Vietnam Veterans"? – posted by usganut and attributed to Ed Schriber Vietnam Veterans hate no one who served in country. However, we’re not real big on chickenhawk cowards who send disproportionate numbers of minorities, the poor, and other folks’ kids off to war. Earlier today I commented on the fake ricky’s post which was not his own creation, but simply a widely circulated right wing ranting about “idiots who run the country.” I found it on The Ventura County Tea Party’s website (among other wacky groups.) Now, comes forth usganut (gee, USGA and pinhighshot – is there a “links” theme developing among the multiple aliased goofballs – what happened to the Igolf nutjob?) posting another lunatic swift boat rant against John Kerry. The diatribe, according to usganut, was attributed to Ed Schriber, Colonel, USMC. And then, lo and behold, look here…Ed Schriber also has his own page on The Ventura Country Tea Party’s silly propaganda site. Hence, fake ricky, usganut, pinhighshot, and many other noms de plume are all the same, silly little loser who refuses to accept that the election is over. Get over it. You lost, bozo. Now, if you could have cast one vote for each alias you use here, it would have been somewhat closer….nah, just kidding. You got your collective clocks cleaned and all the crying in the world won’t change that. Perhaps next time… instead of running on a platform of intolerance and Birther nonsense, endorsing voter suppression and gerrymandering, having a war on women and minorities, being generally totally out of sync with the majority of Americans and now, empty of legitimacy and short on morality, once again resorting to “swiftboating” tactics… perhaps next time you might think about finding some better candidates. And you might grow up, as well. Or, you could keep doing this, your day job, despite your glaring ineptitude. Either way, your foursome is out of mulligans…and you’re holding us up, so we’re playing through. “Fore!” In your heart, you know he’s really only Carl Spackler.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1357596164662</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 17:02:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357596512243-33</Id><Topic><Title>More Obamanomic Results</Title><Username>t.bfine</Username><Timestamp>1357396765440</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 09:39:25 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>t.bfine I think the final score was Obama 53, Romney 47.

You suddenly are suggesting going to a regulatory agency of the government to get some control over a denizen of the free market system? What’s gotten into you, man? What happened to your “Laissez-faire at all cost” attitude of privatizing all things from education to energy with no accountability or regulatory oversight?

Huge money still coming in on N.D. getting 10. No need to move the line, but if that last minute volume continues to support those with Divine Guidance powered by Touchdown Jesus, look for a late drop to 9.5 and killer last minute wagers on Alabama to even out the bookmakers. Either way…I’m rooting for the Irish, but I’d bet on Bama – blowout. Local connections with Nick, and his wife and mine are friends who taught together. 75 million might bring him back to the Browns. Bama’ might be the best team, but the undefeated Buckeyes should be in this game, and they’d beat the Irish. Kent lost, but they’ll be back in another 40 years.
