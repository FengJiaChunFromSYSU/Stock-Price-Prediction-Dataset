The terrorist will get us, Social Security, and Medicare will be broke in a few years. Obama's people say the other are lieing..." Well Minnifer, surely you don't believe there is no longer a terrorist threat. And, as to Social Security and Medicare, pick up any paper and you will find plenty of reports about when each will go broke and that the fixes will be painful. It seems both parties only disagree on when and how to fix them. It also seems to me the Dems are stalling and the Republicans have a sense of urgency. For me, it is a matter of which is being honest and candid about the mess. Both programs are on unsustainable paths and many experts argue the longer we wait the more difficult, both politically and personally, it will be to repair these programs. Please note, I didn't pin blame for the current state of affairs on any one party. Both are to blame. It boils down to which has the guts to seriously tackle the mess. On that, I don't have a bit of doubt. We need leadership now, not finger pointing, denial and excuses. The same is true with respect to piling on the debt and the deficit. Unfortunately Minnifer, politicians have handed us a lot to be scared about. Who best to step up and fix it? That is what we will be voting on come Nov.</Msg><Username>t.bfine</Username><Timestamp>1345367191000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-19 05:06:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345381435000-5</Id><Topic><Title>romney will never win</Title><Username>ser3324</Username><Timestamp>1345048976000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 12:42:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What is his fear about taxes.

The point is that many people who are middle class have to pay more than 13% of their income in taxes and then add in the Social Security tax that they pay on their entire income.

For the first two years of his term, Obama had a Democratic majority in Congress. The Democrats have had control of Congress for the better part of this century. You state the tax rates should go back up. They haven't. Why should Romney or anyone else pay more than the law requires? Congress wrote and passed the current tax laws; mostly Democrats in Congress wrote and passed the current tax laws or refused to change them. Why do you blame Romney? What percentage did Kerry pay, or Kennedy, or Dirty Harry, or Nancy? What percentage did Little Timmy pay when working on Wall Street or should the question be didn't pay? You want to castigate someone for doing as the law requires, why? Why? Are you just upset because he was smart enough to make $200M dollars? He made it, Kennedy inherited it, Kerry married it – twice, but you don’t question the fact that they were/are filthy rich. Did Romney move a yacht to another state to avoid paying his home state taxes? Kerry did and he is still in Congress. People died in the back seat of Kennedy’s car and he stayed in Congress, Timmy didn’t pay taxes he knew he had been paid extra to cover and he got appointed to the top financial job in the administration. Why no questions about where their money came from and how much they paid?</Msg><Username>winholder</Username><Timestamp>1345392661000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-19 12:11:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345392795000-9</Id><Topic><Title>Ask the twit about his 2002 taxes</Title><Username>jdanielman</Username><Timestamp>1345215680000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 11:01:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Watch this video. Read the book. Go see the movie and then answer this question. Understanding the heart of Obama Look at the film clip at the link below An extremely important movie is coming this summer - - It is called simply "2016". The speaker here is Dinesh D'Souza, college president in New York and author of many New York Times best sellers. The movie is from Gerald R. Molen, producer of Academy Award winning Schindler's List, Jurrasic Park , and Brave Heart. It explains in plain language who Barack Obama really is, what he stands for, and the dangers of him being reelected for another four years. Watch this short informative video preview of this movie which came out only yesterday and share it with others. The preview has already been seen by over 18,000 people. Within a very short time it will have been seen by millions! After you see the preview, listen to what Dinesh has to say about Obama. http://www.youtube.com/v/Z6QOscKvUjU?version=3&amp;feature=player_detailpage Even if you don't believe it all, it does raise some interesting questions. I have been posting since his election that he has an agenda he is not sharing with the American people.</Msg><Username>winholder</Username><Timestamp>1345392795000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-19 12:13:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345393100000-10</Id><Topic><Title>SSA orders ammo why?</Title><Username>art_bell51</Username><Timestamp>1345083236000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 22:13:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Politicians would be really frightened if the bullets the SS is buying were distributed to those getting checks.</Msg><Username>winholder</Username><Timestamp>1345393100000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-19 12:18:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345395336000-11</Id><Topic><Title>Ask the twit about his 2002 taxes</Title><Username>jdanielman</Username><Timestamp>1345215680000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 11:01:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>McCain saw Mitt's taxes and chose Palin over the twit.

I don't care if the person is a Republican or a Democrat. I also don't blame him for paying that amount if that is the law. However the Republicans do not want to raise the tax rate for the rich. In fact Romney wants to cut taxes for the rich even more.It seems they also want to prohibit ordinary folks from deducting the interest rates they have to pay on their mortgages. That could cause some of the middle class to have to pay more in taxes. It could also hurt the economy because the would have less money to spend and the economy depends on the spending done by those ordinary folks. Oh the only other thing I would be curious about concerning Romney's taxes would be- did he set up accounts outside of the U.S. to avoid paying U.S. taxes?</Msg><Username>eseyfried</Username><Timestamp>1345400073000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-19 14:14:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345400420000-14</Id><Topic><Title>Ask the twit about his 2002 taxes</Title><Username>jdanielman</Username><Timestamp>1345215680000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 11:01:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It would seem to be a lot to an ordinary person, but it is nothing to someone who makes over 20 million dollars a year.He could pay some more and not change his lifestyle one bit.

You really think your crack union negotiators are going to get a better deal than what the other CWA regions got? Wrong. All your stupid silly highschool strikes will get you is less money for employees' pockets. Meanwhile the union leaders and reps don't lose a single penny!!!!!!!! Hmmmmm. Talk about the 1%. Sounds to me like the rank and file ought to be picketing district 9 HQ and occupying their offices. Clickers and stickers don't make the company do anything, but in the process they make the union look like stupid little twits. Grow up district 9 and pull your head out of your backside. Settle or bust.</Msg><Username>feo2drean</Username><Timestamp>1345425945000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-19 21:25:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345427348000-42</Id><Topic><Title>Smart</Title><Username>sonyajvq913</Username><Timestamp>1345396103000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-19 13:08:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Post of the day!
