I never took anything for free. Obama never offered anything to me for free. Romney is the one promising the moon. If Romney made 50k at a job like an average guy, with the 5 boys he would pay no income taxes. Then some rich guy calls him a freeloader, a guy who isn't working but living off 14 million/yr interest. The rich guy wants to save a few percent on his taxes, get money free. The working guy doesn't get those tax loopholes for the rich, the ones that Ronald Reagan used to speak against. Obama is for the working person, Romney is for the rich people who want to save a few % on their taxes. I am way better of than in Oct 2008, and I bet you are too.</Msg><Username>peppeek</Username><Timestamp>1349239240495</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 00:40:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349241002354-2</Id><Topic><Title>Doctors overwhelmingly support Romney</Title><Username>ricky1820l</Username><Timestamp>1349196052728</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 12:40:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If Obama has his way you will be forced to drive Prius very soon</Msg><Username>ricky1820l</Username><Timestamp>1349241002354</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 01:10:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349241934932-3</Id><Topic><Title>Obama admin denied requests for more Benghazi consulate security</Title><Username>ricky1820l</Username><Timestamp>1349197300876</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 13:01:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>BO is reponsible for these lost lives.

They're mainly concerned about their own bottom lines. They're worried about lower reimbursements, but like some of the administrative changes and having patients who can pay their bills. Obamacare is speeding up the decline of private practice in favor of employment by hospitals, health systems or large group practices. Older physicians tend to like private practice, younger physicians tend to like employment. From an economic perspective, I think private practice is inefficient. Physicians are highly trained specialists. They should be spending their time treating patients, not wasting 25%+ of their time running a business.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1349270570883</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 09:22:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349271141281-13</Id><Topic><Title>Doctors overwhelmingly support Romney</Title><Username>ricky1820l</Username><Timestamp>1349196052728</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 12:40:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Jon.

"As far as I'm concerned, the Democratic Party is not pro-African American," said Rev. Bill Owens, president of the Coalition of African American Pastors. African Americans in the U.S. are used as "pawns" because they automatically assume that the Democratic Party supports their interests. But if Democrats truly have the interests of the black community at heart, and if African Americans consistently vote the Democratic ticket, he asked, "why are we in such bad shape?" "We have more young men in prison than in college," he said, explaining that African Americans are "behind every group in the country" as far as education, even falling behind groups that come to the U.S. from other nations. President Barack Obama is the first leader that Owens has ever publicly spoken out against. He said that he is extremely concerned about the implications of the president's positions, including his unprecedented support for "gay marriage," on black families. The black community has voted against "gay marriage" at every opportunity. He explained that he and a group of pastors had invited Obama to a dialogue about important issues within the black community but "he didn't give us the courtesy of an answer," despite the fact that George Bush, his predecessor, had agreed to meet with the group. Owens said that the Democratic Party takes the black vote for granted.</Msg><Username>ricky1820l</Username><Timestamp>1349287599987</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 14:06:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349288065725-35</Id><Topic><Title>Black leaders say Democrat party harmful to blacks</Title><Username>ricky1820l</Username><Timestamp>1349287599987</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 14:06:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Bishop E.W. Jackson, calls for both liberals and the African Americans to make a mass exodus from the Democratic Party decrying what he sees as a “slavish devotion to the Democrat Party.” “Denocrats have insulted us, used us, and manipulated us. They have saturated the black community with ridiculous lies,” he said, speaking directly to the black community. ”They think we are stupid and that these lies will hold us captive while they violate everything we believe as Christians.” The Democratic Party has created an unholy alliance between certain so-called civil rights leaders and Planned Parenthood, which has killed unborn black babies by the tens of millions, Jackson took issue with the party’s internal debate over “God” being dropped from its platform and derided the notion that homosexuality should be equated “with being black.“ He called the later tenet of the Democratic Party an ”outrageous lie.” “We as Christians ought to know better. Shame on us for allowing ourselves to be sold to the highest bidder,” Jackson continued, we need to make a decision between supporting Democrats and embracing Jesus.</Msg><Username>ricky1820l</Username><Timestamp>1349288065725</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 14:14:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349288675571-36</Id><Topic><Title>Doctors overwhelmingly support Romney</Title><Username>ricky1820l</Username><Timestamp>1349196052728</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 12:40:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No. I think physicians could benefit from working in larger private organizations. That way they would be free to practice medicine. The private practice model is the equivalent of having each engineer at GM also doing his own sales, IT, marketing, payroll, QC, etc, while still creating something as complex as a motor vehicle on his or her own. Larger organizations allow division of labor &amp; specialization. They allow complex processes to be managed efficiently. The difference in administrative costs is large. An organization like Kaiser Permanente, which uses the employed physician model, has admin costs of 3%. For most of the healthcare system it's 20-25%. Kaiser does other things too, but we know how to get to efficiency. Part of the goal of Obamacare is to push organizations like Kaiser's to become the rule rather than the exception.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1349288675571</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 14:24:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349289073072-37</Id><Topic><Title>Doctors overwhelmingly support Romney</Title><Username>ricky1820l</Username><Timestamp>1349196052728</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 12:40:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ricky, how will that new business model help rural areas of the country?</Msg><Username>ciscokid_1st</Username><Timestamp>1349289073072</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 14:31:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349289728846-38</Id><Topic><Title>Black leaders say Democrat party harmful to blacks</Title><Username>ricky1820l</Username><Timestamp>1349287599987</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 14:06:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Blacks are still slaves they just have a new master called the democrat party.
