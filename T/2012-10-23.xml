When asked what he will do for students, Romney is quick to point to the John and Abigail Adams Scholarship, the program he established as Governor of Massachusetts. The program pays the 4-year tuition fees for the top 25% of high school performers if they are enrolled full-time in a Massachusetts public college or university. Jason Delisle tells The Daily Ticker that this plan is not viable. "I'm not entirely sure that it would be a model for the country," he says. "There's a certain culture around these student aid programs. They are to provide open access and not necessarily direct aid to certain types of students based on their performance." Obama's proposal to lower student loan debt centers on the income-based repayment plan (IBR). The initial plan was passed under the George W. Bush administration in 2009. IBR allowed college graduates to spend just 15% of non-discretionary income on student loan repayments with complete loan forgiveness after 25 years. President Obama amended the program in 2010 so that graduates spend only 10% of non-discretionary income on loan repayment and are granted forgiveness after 20 years. The new rules are scheduled to go into effect in 2014 but the White House wants to implement the updated program by the end of this year. Jason Delisle and Alex Holt have published a paper examining the effects of Obama's new proposal and the results are not promising. The study found that under the new IRB rules there is no extra cost in borrowing an additional dollar after a student loan debts exceed $60,000, regardless of salary. "This is the more you borrow the more you can have forgiven," explains Delisle. "The provision doesn't really have any safeguard so that someone earning a substantial income wouldn't be disqualified from getting loan forgiveness." For example, a law school student with $120,000 in debt and a starting salary of $65,000 might have $160,000 forgiven after 20 years. "On the one hand you have the Obama administration talking about the spiraling cost of tuition and that they have a plan to keep tuition low and stop the growth or slow the growth, but this goes in a completely different direction," Delisle notes. Delisle suggests reverting back to the Bush-era plan for borrowers with high incomes and implementing the new Obama plan for borrowers with low incomes. "Those two things alone should essentially take care of the issues that we've highlighted," he says. "That will leave the core of the Obama administration's proposal in place and essentially close the loophole for these high-income earners." Just another attempt to buy votes.</Msg><Username>pinhighshot</Username><Timestamp>1351000724199</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 09:58:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351001255089-23</Id><Topic><Title>TIME CLOCK - OBAMA OWNS ...

If it is being collected from a business that will pass the tax onto their consumers, doctors and insurance carriers raising their rates because of his health care, etc., he did not raise taxes. He is a supporter of typical Democrat principles; tax more so we can spend more on buying votes of those that normally don't even bother, but will if they fear they are losing their government check. It is a pretty simple premise and an old adage, but the government can't give to some if they aren't taking from others. When you pay money to the government and get nothing in return, like infrastructure, safety, and protection from foreign invaders that means they are simply giving it away. Obama is really good and that and wants to get even better. He is a master of the art of deflection and deception.</Msg><Username>winholder</Username><Timestamp>1351002613155</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 10:30:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351003893626-26</Id><Topic><Title>We were just asked by a friend how to vote.</Title><Username>dwb360</Username><Timestamp>1350873962883</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-21 22:46:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>DWB360, where do all these ignorant misinformed people come from?

Paying a good wage and providing affordable medical for workers while working to support their families and to look forward to in retirement maintains workforce continuity and that ability.

Iran-Contra resulted in at least 30 indictments and 13 people convicted. Yet Reagan plead ignorance, as did Bush the elder, who then proceeded to pardon his cronies. “Ronald Reagan knew of and approved a great deal of what went on with both the Iranian initiative and private efforts on behalf of the contras and he received regular, detailed briefings on both.... I have no doubt that he was told about the use of residuals for the Contras, and that he approved it. Enthusiastically.” – Olive North Vice President Bush denied any knowledge of the Iran–Contra affair though his diaries stated that he was one of the people who were in on it.

As the story goes, Brer Fox constructed a little man made of tar, dressed him up, and sat him on the side of the road where he knew Brer Rabbit would pass. As anticipated by Brer Fox, when Brer Rabbit passed by the little man and did not get the expected responses from the little fellow, it agitated Brer Rabbit to the point that he started throwing punches, found himself mired in tar, and bound for a lunch date with Brer Fox and Brer Bear. Well last night we may have seen an updated version of this strategy. In this version Mr. Romney and the Republicans (playing the part of Brer Fox and Brer Bear) set up the little man of tar to sit by the side of the road, and when our President (playing the part of the lovable Brer Rabbit) did not get the expected responses, he became upset, covered himself with tar, and finally ready for lunch. I know that the MSM and the dems believe that our "Dear Leader" beat the heck out of that pesky little man made of tar, but I guess time will tell whose lunch ultimately gets consumed.

Even Forbes magazine said Obama won. “...a plurality of debate watchers questioned in a national survey say that the president won his final faceoff with Republican nominee Mitt Romney.” “Forty-eight percent of registered voters who watched Monday night's third presidential debate say that Obama won the showdown, with 40% saying Romney did the better job in a debate dedicated to foreign policy. The president's eight-point advantage over the former Massachusetts governor came among a debate audience that was slightly more Republican than the country as a whole and is just within the survey's sampling error. Nearly six in ten watchers say that Obama did a better job in the debate than they had expected, 15 points higher than the 44% who said that the GOP challenger had a better than expected debate performance.” Can we see your sources who say otherwise?

When you hear the words, it is going to be really tough for Obama to refute what he actually said. He is partially correct though, he didn't apologize for America; he indicted America as an overbearing, demanding, controlling demon in the world. He insisted that America forced freedom on parts of the world. The problem is that you cannot force freedom upon people; you can only take it away. There are too many cemeteries around the world containing the bodies of American servicemen that fought to keep many parts of this world free for people to forget what we really bring to the world at large.

Now; who is your daddy???</Msg><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1351038522835</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 20:28:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351038578651-63</Id><Topic><Title>Obama will ban guns in his second term!!</Title><Username>bouch84</Username><Timestamp>1350575258049</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 11:47:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>only people with a uterus should have a voice in abortion. got one? if not, then why don't you adopt all the unwanted children just in your town?</Msg><Username>pcolafun</Username><Timestamp>1351038578651</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 20:29:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351038638725-64</Id><Topic><Title>Obama will ban guns in his second term!!</Title><Username>bouch84</Username><Timestamp>1350575258049</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 11:47:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>how many babies have you given birth to? i thought so.</Msg><Username>pcolafun</Username><Timestamp>1351038638725</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 20:30:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351039065585-65</Id><Topic><Title>Did Romney Endorse Obama During Debate?</Title><Username>jbhdallas2000</Username><Timestamp>1351017452560</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 14:37:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"I thought Obama displayed his ignorance best on the auto bail out subject."

Americans are abandoning support for a man who has talked a good game, but failed to provide good jobs, affordable energy and a strong economy that Americans expect. Even worse, Obama’s foreign policy chickens are coming home to roost. September 11th is the when the tide formally turned for President Obama in 2012. Our embassy consulate in Libya was attacked and gutted in a terrorist attack by al-qaeda muslim savages (capitalization intentional). Not only did the Obama administration lie to the American people, claiming the murder of our Ambassador, a diplomat and two former Navy SEALs was the result of a savage islamic protest, but they then blamed a YouTube video for the supposed protests for almost two weeks. To make matters worse, the justice department sought the arrest of the man responsible for that YouTube video in question, “Innocence of muslims” (again, capitalization intentional) – a production so bad that it was funny to watch. Many across America were stunned that the man who created this pathetic YouTube video was effectively arrested because of some “protests” by muslim extremists half a world away. What happened to free speech in America? Arresting film-makers here in America after “protests” allegedly over their film is not the America Americans know and love. To make matters worse, over one month has passed since the murder of our ambassador in Libya without any meaningful response from the Obama administration. All we’ve gotten from the White House is talk. They talk that we’ll bring those responsible to justice, but a few days later we find out the Obama administration has waited 17 days for VISAs to be issued to investigative personnel to enter Libya so they may go to the scene of the attack and look for evidence. What kind of farce is this? Americans are upset. We don’t want to bring those responsible to justice. We want to bring justice to those responsible. Just when the Libya debacle was winding down, President Obama calls the incident “not optimal”, once again ginning up American anger at the ineptitude with which Obama’s team has handed the attack and its follow-up. Most Americans recognize the murder of an ambassador and embassy staff isn’t “not optimal”, instead it is an act of war. But the September 11, 2012 attack was just the first and perhaps largest single issue of a cascade of problems for Obama and company. His disastrous first debate performance hurt him badly. Romney got his first opportunity to be seen alongside President Obama and Romney wasn’t the cold-hearted monster the mainstream media has painted him these last six-plus months. Americans saw first-hand and un-edited Romney’s calm and steady demeanor and his presidential appearance. Romney was human and likeable. Obama was cold and distracted, as if his mind was on his later plans with his wife on their 20th Anniversary instead of the debate. The Vice-Presidential debate gave us old Uncle Joe, the pompous jerk who seemed more like a slimy used-car salesman (no offense to car salesmen) than a Vice-President of the United States. Romney’s VP pick, the staunchly pro-gun Paul Ryan, held his own and didn’t get distracted or unnerved by Biden’s repeated interruptions and snickering. The second Presidential Debate saw Obama do better, but he still couldn’t match Romney’s juggernaut. Romney slashed Obama’s record in two minutes and left Obama stammering to change the subject. In another answer, he told Americans “it doesn’t have to be like this” referring to high gas prices, high unemployment and trillion-dollar deficits. Another key moment was Candy Crowley picking a gun control question as a “gotcha” moment against Romney. It turned out to be a huge “gotcha” for President Obama, who has successfully kept a very, very low profile on the gun issue for the last four years, instead telling voters he won’t take their guns time and time again. Obama’s answer contradicted four-years of sleight of hand by Obama. He basically affirmed his desire to see a ban on America’s favorite rifle, the AR-15, and tens of millions of similar guns and maybe even bans on affordable handguns as well. Romney? Romney said he opposes further gun control laws or banning certain guns. Period. Point Romney. It was worse than that though. The mainstream media trumpeted Obama’s call for banning semi-automatic rifles and many of his gun-owner supporters started asking themselves if President Obama was going to ban their hunting rifles and shotguns, along with guns they depend upon to defend their families from potential predatory criminals. Poll numbers continued to shift towards Romney in this time. States Obama previously expected to win are leaning Romney and Obama’s campaign team is triaging to staunch the bleeding of electoral votes. It continues to rain bad news at the White House and the Obama campaign headquarters. More recently, we find the Republicans are trouncing the Democratic Party in fundraising. In fact, the DNC is nearly 15 million in the red, basically relying on bank loans to subsidize their operation with over two weeks to go before the election. Obama has taken a 15 million loan from Bank of America in the past few days, apparently needing that money to pay their staff and campaign expenses. The Republicans, on the other hand, enjoy nearly $100 million in the bank, and they’re going to use that money to bury the Democrats in key races and states in the last couple of weeks before November 6th. At this point, if this trend doesn’t change quickly for Obama and crew, it’s not a matter of whether or not he’s going to lose, but the only question is how badly will it be and how much will be be in debt when it’s over. Get out and vote on November 6th. Help make this a reality for America. This entry was posted on October 20, 2012 at 1:35 pm and is filed under Blog.
