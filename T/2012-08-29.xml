Worse yet, is that the people you are shining on with this BS, are so ignorantly gullible as to believe stuff like this: “So conservatives are racists, extremists, and every bad thing in the book because we want to preserve the Constitution and not depend on the big government to save us. Yet, here we have the liberals outright denying a cardinal and instead allowing two clearly anti-American M#slims to usher in the DNC. Sad...” – Patriot Action Network “It is troubling that the Democratic National Convention has decided to promote and lend its name and national political platform to the organizers of the Jummah at the DNC?. The leaders of this event...are no moderates. They are radicals.” - RedState “Is it fair to say Democrats are embracing radicals at their upcoming national convention? It seems more than fair to say it, based upon the evidence.” – Breibart So are all you fear mongering birthers delighted with this nonsense? Anybody want the truth? This story is... FALSE!!! http://www.snopes.com/politics/religion/dncprayer.asp Cardinal Dolan had not been refused. Since being contacted by the DNC he is giving the closing prayer at the Dems convention, just as he is for the GOP. The Jumah event, starting four days before the Democratic Convention is an independent, non-convention community event. It is neither sponsored by the DNC nor a part of the official convention schedule. There were 1200 non-official events at the Dems’ convention in ’08 in Denver, and about 1000 scheduled for Charlotte. The Jumah event is one of them. BFD. If you look at the schedule of events, you’ll see that the events scheduled for Charlotte are “all-inclusive,” which is indicative of the party’s egalitarian platform representing all Americans – unlike the supercilious views of those in Tampa. It’s interesting to note the apparent lack of confidence in their vision that would require them to consistently spread malevolence through lies and deception to thoughtless, fearful individuals.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1346245565000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 09:06:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346249474000-4</Id><Topic><Title>T News cadence up prior to the multitude on the looming huge Multi take home</Title><Username>tmillard88</Username><Timestamp>1346246069000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 09:14:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Beautiful women always come around when there is money.

The speed cams, red light cams, Police tag readers, auto theft rings, and auto insurance costs, have made driving in the inner city too costly. Everywhere I go in the hood. I see nice rides for sale. Since Barry came to power, we have rent to own car companies. I'm not sure how that works. But, I bet it isn't a good deal the the consumer.</Msg><Username>robfisk</Username><Timestamp>1346284899000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 20:01:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346285133000-35</Id><Topic><Title>Obama standards will double car prices</Title><Username>ricky1820l</Username><Timestamp>1346175055000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 13:30:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>But, if Barry gets a 2nd term, he could pass an EXECUTIVE Order. That could make you buy a Volt, or walk.

He gave Venezula BILLIONS to start drilling. That money is gone, and Chavez is getting friendly with the Chinese, and Russians. At least when a Sailor blows all his money, he has the memories that last a life time. Barry borrowed from the Chinese, to give our stimulus money to Venezula, to drill for oil, alright. But it's for the Chinese. Looks like the Chinese got over on that one. I say we take it out on Barry, and Mouchelle, and take away Air Force One, and all the grand vacations.</Msg><Username>robfisk</Username><Timestamp>1346285592000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 20:13:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346285834000-37</Id><Topic><Title>Paul Ryan is Trending #1 now on searches</Title><Username>robfisk</Username><Timestamp>1345748488000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 15:01:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Very nice, thank you Yvette.

I'm sure his sister-in-law is smarter than that. Why would she fight her way there, through a hurricane, only to be edited out on the MSNBC cutting room floor. Why, because she is Black and at the GOP Convention. Barry doesn't like people who wander off of the plantation. Our media is starting to act like the Soviet rag, PRAVDA. It meant the truth. You can be be sure, it's the opposite if it appears on these shows.</Msg><Username>robfisk</Username><Timestamp>1346286586000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 20:29:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346294044000-39</Id><Topic><Title>AT&amp;T Midwest Terminations</Title><Username>fezofreese</Username><Timestamp>1345943740000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 21:15:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>bait taken by right wing-nut.....
