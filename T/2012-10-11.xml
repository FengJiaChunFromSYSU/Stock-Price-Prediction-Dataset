Pass the word on!!!!! Florida governor gives phone sex number for meningitis hotline [ TALLAHASSEE, Florida - In an embarrassing mistake, Florida Governor Rick Scott gave out a phone sex hotline number to Floridians seeking information on a deadly fungal meningitis outbreak. Scott was providing an update on the outbreak at a cabinet meeting on Tuesday when he announced what he said was the hotline's toll-free phone line, but gave out the wrong number. The governor's office was alerted by a public radio station in Tampa, WUSF, which was monitoring the cabinet meeting and posted the number on its website. The station said it was "quickly notified by a reader that the number instead connected to an adult telephone line." Callers are greeted with the recording of a woman's voice saying: "Hello boys, thank you for calling me on my anniversary." ]</Msg><Username>thesilverarrowflies</Username><Timestamp>1349957583548</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 08:13:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349958193815-6</Id><Topic><Title>5 Romney Boys Will Join Military to Serve our Country?</Title><Username>jbhdallas2000</Username><Timestamp>1349717118273</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 13:25:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"the message America has sent to the Romney boys" The message went to Obama before it went to the Romney boys.</Msg><Username>t.bfine</Username><Timestamp>1349958193815</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 08:23:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349962562350-7</Id><Topic><Title>Is T going to survive?</Title><Username>chang.eva75</Username><Timestamp>1349958209475</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 08:23:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's great to have this information available.</Msg><Username>lherring54</Username><Timestamp>1349962562350</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 09:36:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349962880982-8</Id><Topic><Title>5 Romney Boys Will Join Military to Serve our Country?</Title><Username>jbhdallas2000</Username><Timestamp>1349717118273</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 13:25:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Romney had a LEGAL deferment as defined by the selective service and Congress.

This has nothing to do with the ACA. Hospitals are required to see and stabilize every soul who walks into the ER since Reagan signed the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) in 1986. This is one of the many economic cases for the individual mandate, and one of the moral cases as well--to prevent people from freeloading. However, undocumented immigrants will still be able to freeload at hospitals when it is cheaper overall to provide them Medicaid. Not because of the ACA. Not because of Obama. Not because of Democrats.

He has been practicing for over a week non-stop. However, defending Obama's socialist policies will be very hard. I'm sure Ryan will speak about the stimulus toilet bowl. The money wasted, that might as well been flushed down the scrapper. The money we borrowed from China, and gave to cronies of Obami. I hope they mention the $40 MILLION that Claire McCaskel's husband got in stimulus funds. In this case, hidden pretty well by the media so far. Claire's husband's scam was shovel ready. Shoveling millions of the taxpayer's dollars into his pockets.</Msg><Username>robfisk</Username><Timestamp>1349998006685</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 19:26:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349998363253-78</Id><Topic><Title>Blood on Obamas hands</Title><Username>bob.beachin</Username><Timestamp>1349994193779</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 18:23:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hill was in a meeting.

Do you guys not remember what you Republicans did to us for 8 years. Had America been invaded the damage could not compare to what Bush did. It looks like you guys would just say, "So sorry," be the hell quiet. You have proven that you have no judgment and will buy anything advertised.</Msg><Username>ellerbebil2</Username><Timestamp>1349998379371</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 19:32:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349998905198-80</Id><Topic><Title>Blood on Obamas hands</Title><Username>bob.beachin</Username><Timestamp>1349994193779</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 18:23:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The wife of the slain Ambassador asked him. Do you need anything? Yes, he said, " a new President". Well, as Ronald Reagan would say. We can honor this hero in just a few weeks. Regime change is right around the corner. We can flush Barrack, and Biden. Barrack took his only plane away. He had no way out of this hell hole. Then there is Mouchelle, and her 50 friends that go on vacation every month or so, on Air Force One. How come she gets a plane? But he Ambassador doesn't?</Msg><Username>robfisk</Username><Timestamp>1349998905198</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 19:41:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349999263720-81</Id><Topic><Title>AT&amp;T Inc.
