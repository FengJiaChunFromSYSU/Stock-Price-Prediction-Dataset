Overnight we became aware of this supposed debt, when the day before our 'education' began most of us knew little about it. Doesn`t that seem fishy?" Hardly fishy! It's simple math. Each year over the last four years the feds. (in order of magnitude numbers) spent $3 Trillion while taking in $2 Trillion. These numbers would suggest you might be right, i.e., Congress doesn't have a clue about spending. However, from my view, you would have to have your head in the sand to not see the impact on the national deficit. Not surprisingly, the CBO just forcasted, at the current rate of federal spending, in four years we will have a national deficit in excess of $20 Trillion. Wow, what a blinding flash of the obvious! You may recall 4 yrs ago Obama told us ,if elected, he would cut the deficit in half during his first term. Now Obama says, "FORWARD".

So why are details surfacing, piecemeal, only now? The Obama administration sat by doing nothing for seven hours that night, ignoring calls to dispatch help from our bases in Italy, less than two hours away. It has spent the past seven weeks stretching the story out, engaging in misdirection and deception. Charles Woods, father of former Navy SEAL and Henderson resident Tyrone Woods, 41, says his son died slumped over his machine gun after he and fellow ex-SEAL Glen Doherty held off the enemy for seven hours. The Obama administration was warned. They received an embassy cable June 25 expressing concern over rising Islamic extremism in Benghazi, noting the black flag of al-Qaida "has been spotted several times flying over government buildings and training facilities." The Obama administration removed a well-armed, 16-member security detail from Libya in August, The Wall Street Journal reported last month, replacing it with a couple of locals. Mr. Stevens sent a cable Aug. 2 requesting 11 additional body guards, noting "Host nation security support is lacking and cannot be depended on," reports Peter Ferrara at Forbes.com. But these requests were denied, officials testified before the House Oversight Committee earlier this month. Based on documents released by the committee, on the day of the attack the Pentagon dispatched a drone with a video camera so everyone in Washington could see what was happening in real time. The drone documented no crowds protesting any video. But around 4 p.m. Washington received an email from the Benghazi mission saying it was under a military-style attack. The White House, the Pentagon, the State Department and the CIA were able to watch the live video feed. An email sent later that day reported "Ansar al-Sharia claims responsibility for Benghazi attack." Not only did the White House do nothing, but a counterterrorism team ready to launch a rescue mission was ordered by the Obama administration to stand down. The official explanation for why Obama administration officials watched the attack unfold for seven hours, refusing repeated requests to send the air support and relief forces that sat less than two hours away in Italy? Silence. Prompt and strong action from the White House on Sept. 11 would have saved American lives, Instead Obama showed weakness and dithering and flying to Las Vegas the next day for celebrity fund-raising parties.</Msg><Username>art_bell51</Username><Timestamp>1351871675167</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 11:54:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>14</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351871758793-30</Id><Topic><Title>"A coward dies a thousand times before his death, but the valiant taste of death but once."</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1351531591967</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-29 13:26:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>At least your voting maching didn't keep matching up Obama's name when the Romney button was selected like the lady in Ohio found.

It contradicts White House statements that the attack occurred without warning – and in response to anti-Muslim sentiment over a video produced by a California real estate developer. According to the document, the U.S. State Department’s senior security officer – also known as the “RSO,” or Regional Security Officer – did not believe the consulate could be protected. “RSO (Regional Security Officer) expressed concerns with the ability to defend Post in the event of a coordinated attack due to limited manpower, security measures, weapons capabilities, host nation support, and the overall size of the compound,” the cable said. Further, the consulate’s Emergency Action Committee was also briefed "on the location of approximately ten Islamist militias and AQ training camps within Benghazi …,” the cable said. “These groups ran the spectrum from Islamist militias, such as the QRF Brigade and Ansar al-Sharia, to ‘Takfirist thugs,’” . The cable also described the security situation in Benghazi as “trending negatively” – and specifically said that the mission would ask for more help. “In light of the uncertain security environment, US Mission Benghazi will submit specific requests to US Embassy Tripoli for additional physical security upgrades and staffing needs by separate cover,” the cable said. On the day of the Sept. 11 attack, Stevens wrote a three-page cable about “growing problems with security” in Benghazi and “growing frustration” with the security forces and Libyan police. the Aug. 16 cable served as a direct warning to the Obama Administration that the Benghazi consulate was vulnerable to attack, that it could not be defended, and that the presence of anti-U.S. militias and al-Qaeda was well-known to the U.S. intelligence community. Obama administraion officials declined to answer questions regarding the cable, citing its classified status.</Msg><Username>art_bell51</Username><Timestamp>1351872580091</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 12:09:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>12</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351874000085-33</Id><Topic><Title>Obama betrays Benghazi</Title><Username>art_bell51</Username><Timestamp>1351871675167</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 11:54:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>America needs to know what happened in Benghazi now, the liberal press won't report anything</Msg><Username>art_bell51</Username><Timestamp>1351874000085</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 12:33:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>12</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351874256340-34</Id><Title>Non-Union Electrical Workers turned away in NJ</Title><Msg>I heard a report that volunteer electrical workers from Alabama were turned away from volunteering to help in NJ.

Back in 1961 people of color were called 'Negroes.' So how can the Obama 'birth certificate' state he is "African-American" when the term wasn't even used at that time ? 2. The birth certificate that the White House released lists Obama's birth as August 4, 1961 &amp; Lists Barack Hussein Obama as his father. No big deal, right ? At the time of Obama's birth, it also shows that his father is aged 25 years old, and that Obama's father was born in " Kenya , East Africa". This wouldn't seem like anything of concern, except the fact that Kenya did not even exist until 1963, two whole years after Obama's birth, and 27 years after his father's birth. How could Obama's father have been born in a country that did not yet exist? Up and until Kenya was formed in 1963, it was known as the "British East Africa Protectorate". 3. On the Birth Certificate released by the White House, the listed place of birth is "Kapi'olani Maternity &amp; Gynecological Hospital". This cannot be, because the hospital(s) in question in 1961 were called "KauiKeolani Children's Hospital" and "Kapi'olani Maternity Home", respectively. The name did not change to Kapi'olani Maternity &amp; Gynecological Hospital until 1978, when these two hospitals merged. How can this particular name of the hospital be on a birth certificate dated 1961 if this name had not yet been applied to it until 1978 ? Why hasn't this been discussed in the major media ? 4. Perhaps a clue comes from Obama’s book on his father. He states how proud he is of his father fighting in WW II. I’m not a math genius, so I may need some help from you. Barack Obama’s “birth certificate” says his father was 25 years old in 1961 when he was born. That should have put his father’s date of birth approximately 1936—if my math holds (Honest! I did that without a calculator!!!) Now we need a non-revised history book—one that hasn’t been altered to satisfy the author’s goals—to verify that WW II was basically between 1939 and 1945. Just how many 3 year olds fight in wars? Even in the latest stages of WW II his father wouldn’t have been more than 9. Does that mean that Mr. Obama is a liar, or simply chooses to alter the facts to satisfy his imagination or political purposes (still qualifies as a “liar”) ?</Msg><Username>art_bell51</Username><Timestamp>1351875690212</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 13:01:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>17</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351877533836-36</Id><Title>•7 Reasons To Buy This 7% Yielder</Title><Msg>i think mpw is really the way to go..</Msg><Username>sandiegoautofinders</Username><Timestamp>1351877533836</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 13:32:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351879096787-37</Id><Title>Biden admits he has never been proud to be BO's vice president</Title><Msg>It's true Joe Biden, at a campaign event today said, "There's never been a day in the last four years I've been proud to be his vice president."</Msg><Username>ricky1820l</Username><Timestamp>1351879096787</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 13:58:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>11</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351879857598-38</Id><Topic><Title>Biden admits he has never been proud to be BO's vice president</Title><Username>ricky1820l</Username><Timestamp>1351879096787</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 13:58:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Biden could be our next president.

"This is the day after Hurricane Sandy, and once again we have no studio audience. We don't care, we're still going to do a show. I had to come in. I've used up all my sick days. "I feel like Clint Eastwood – an old guy talking to empty chairs!” – David Letterman “Campaign promises are—by long democratic tradition—the least binding form of human commitment.” – Supreme Justice Scalia “An infinite God ought to be able to protect himself, without going in partnership with State Legislatures.” – Robert G. Ingersoll “Politics is a pendulum whose swings between anarchy and tyranny are fueled by perpetually rejuvenated illusions.” - Einstein “This is an impressive crowd: the Have's and Have-more's. Some people call you the elites. I call you my base.” – George W. Bush "I'm looking forward to interviewing the first lady Michelle Obama on our show tonight. I sat next to her when I hosted the White House Correspondents Dinner. But it's hard to have a conversation with Newt Gingrich yelling 'You gonna eat that?' over and over again in my ear." - Jimmy Kimmel “Naturally the common people don't want war; neither in Russia, nor in England, nor in America, nor in Germany. That is understood. But after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine policy, and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy, or a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship. Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same in any country.” – Hermann Goering “Have you ever seen a candidate talking to a rich person on television?” – Art Buchwald “Those who are too smart to engage in politics are punished by being governed by those who are dumber.” – Plato “With the hurricane approaching, Today Mitt Romney advised that men should head for the shelters and women should remain in their binders." - Bill Maher “Government is a contrivance of human wisdom to provide for human wants. Men have a right that these wants should be provided for by this wisdom.” – Edmund Burke “We stand now where two roads diverge. But unlike the roads in Robert Frost’s familiar poem, they are not equally fair. The road we have long been traveling is deceptively easy, a smooth superhighway on which we progress with great speed, but at its end lies disaster. The other fork of the road — the one less traveled by — offers our last - our only chance to reach a destination that assures the preservation of the earth.” – Rachel Carson “Have a good weekend, all.” – echo2165 “Bad officials are elected by good citizens who do not vote.” – George Jean Nathan</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1351905619016</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 21:20:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351908058390-59</Id><Title>Gov Cumo tries to justify Gas shortage</Title><Msg>His spin made absolutely no sense.

Hillary Clinton is an outstanding statesman and deserves our loyalty. Republicans are desperate to destroy the reputation of our Administration to win an election. You are proving yourselves to be snakes in the grass and true patriots despise your behavior. You should also keep in mind that Romney's LBO practice destroyed jobs and leveraged companies into bankruptcy while he off-shored ill-gotten cash to avoid paying US taxes. Some patriot. And his Bain Capital took decent paying jobs and sent them to China for 30 pieces of silver. What a fantastic businessman HE is. A Romney victory will be a win for GREED and the upper 1%. But he's a good salesman and you're buying the snake oil . . . Plus, Romney doesn't believe the seas are rising. This guy scares the "H" out of me.</Msg><Username>btwnthelions</Username><Timestamp>1351908737860</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 22:12:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351908761520-61</Id><Topic><Title>Non-Union Electrical Workers turned away in NJ</Title><Username>plsnomorobama</Username><Timestamp>1351874256340</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 12:37:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I HOPE PEOPLE WAKE UP.They derserve better than Doomberg, Cumo, &amp; Company.
