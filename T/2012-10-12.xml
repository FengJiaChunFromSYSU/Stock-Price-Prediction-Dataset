Not a d***ed one of them, No. 1 or No. 2, ever served in the military. All four of the them are, without question, patriotic Americans. If you are concerned about national security this election, I suggest you examine Obama's competence over the past four years and contrast it with Romney's complete lack of competence in his one foreign policy trip during the campaign. Romney's foreign policy plan doesn't adopt any new positions, it consists mainly of saber-rattling. Maybe he means it, maybe he doesn't, but in my experience the combination of saber-rattling and incompetence in foreign policy gets alot of America's finest killed for no reason.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1350074487859</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 16:41:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350074531959-63</Id><Topic><Title>New Info in T</Title><Username>shantelduusw444381</Username><Timestamp>1350050460805</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 10:01:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Very informative.

Ask any Indian.” – Robert Orben “He gave the world another world.” – Georg Santayana “I wished to give a complete relation to your Highnesses, and also where a fort might be built…. However, I do not see it to be necessary, because these people are simple in armaments…. With fifty men I could subjugate them all and make them do everything that is required of them.” – Christopher Columbus, October 14, 1492 “When asked by an anthropologist what the Indians called America before the white man came, an Indian said simply, ‘Ours’!” – Vine Deloria, Jr. “And I say that Your Highnesses ought not to consent that any foreigner does business or sets foot here, except Christian Catholics, since this was the end and the beginning of the enterprise, that it should be for the enhancement and glory of the Christian religion, nor should anyone who is not a good Christian come to these parts…When there are such lands there should be profitable things without number.” – Columbus, November, 1492 “Columbus went around the world in 1492. That isn't a lot of strokes when you consider the course.” - Lee Trevino “Christopher Columbus’ government was characterized by a form of tyranny... Even those who loved him had to admit the atrocities that had taken place. No one can understand why he was sacked and we can see that there were good reasons for doing so. The monarchs wanted someone who did not give them problems. Columbus did not solve problems, he created them.” – Consuelo Varela “What a pity, when Christopher Columbus discovered America, that he ever mentioned it.” – Margot Asquith “If Columbus had an advisory committee he would probably still be at the dock.” – Arthur Goldberg “So, Columbus said, somebody show me the sunset and somebody did and he set sail for it, And he discovered America and they put him in jail for it, And the fetters gave him welts, And they named America after somebody else.” – Ogden Nash “Every one of us has in him a continent of undiscovered character.

They are Ignorance, Superstition, and Bigotry — the most sinister and tyrannical rulers on earth.” – Emma Goldman "Moderator for the debate was Jim Lehrer of PBS, and Jim was as in control of this evening as a replacement referee." –Jimmy Kimmel “Empathize with stupidity and you’re halfway to thinking like an idiot.” – Iain Banks “To dispose a soul to action we must upset its equilibrium.” – Eric Hoffer “The nearer I approach the end, the plainer I hear around me the immortal symphonies of the worlds which invite me. It is marvelous, yet simple.” – Victor Hugo "Unemployment is 7.8 percent, the lowest it's been since Obama took office. The Obama campaign said they can't wait to take these statistics and not use them in the next debate…I gotta say, if you’re cooking the books, 7.8 percent unemployment is a sh*tty recipe." – Leno/Stewart “Laugh if you are wise.” – Martial “Few men during their lifetime come anywhere near exhausting the resources dwelling within them. There are deep wells of strength that are never used.” – Richard Byrd “Mitt Romney said he’s going to get rid of Big Bird and slash PBS. And then he mentions Donald Trump, who endorses Mitt Romney. It's interesting -- one is a comical TV character with synthetic yellow hair, and then you have Big Bird.” – David Letterman “Everything in excess! To enjoy the flavor of life, take big bites. Moderation is for monks.” – Robert A. Heinlein “To know what is right and not to do it is the worst cowardice.” – Confucious “Rum - ‘Noun; Generically, fiery liquors that produce madness in total abstainers’.” – Ambrose Bierce “The fishing was good; it was the catching that was bad.” - A.K. Best "People close to the campaign are saying that Mitt Romney's son, Tagg, is now one of his chief advisers. That's right, when Mitt asked him to join the team, he put his arm on his son's shoulder and said 'Tagg, you're it’!” - Jimmy Fallon “We have inherited an incredibly beautiful and complex garden, but the trouble is that we have been appallingly bad gardeners…We now stand so aloof from nature that we think we are God.

That is the life worth living.” – Mark Twain "Now we know what Romney looks like when he is all charged up. And now we know what Michael Jackson looks like on diprivan,,,I'm sorry, Obama sucked. He looked tired. He had trouble getting his answers out. It's like he took my million and spent it all on weed." - Bill Maher “If our Creator has so bountifully provided for our existence here, which is but momentary, and for our temporal wants, which will soon be forgotten, how much more must He have done for our enjoyment in the everlasting world.” – Hosea Ballou “An election is a moral horror, as bad as a battle except for the blood; a mud bath for every soul concerned in it.” – George Bernard Shaw “Most heterosexual people in this country, and around the world, meet each other, and get together with one another when they’re totally, totally drunk. Smashed out of their minds they could not spell their own face. And they go home with that person! And you might spend months with that person, or a year, or you might have a family! This is what happens, this is how you meet. But you wouldn’t buy a toaster when you’re drunk, ‘cause that’s too important.” – Dylan Moran “During the debate Mitt Romney said that he loves Big Bird. What made it even more awkward was that the question was, ‘Can you explain your tax plan’?” - Jimmy Fallon “Psychologists have hitherto failed to realize that imagination is a necessary ingredient of perception itself.” – Immanuel Kant “I got a king sized bed. I don't know any kings, but if one came over, I guess he'd be comfortable. ‘Oh, you're a king, you say? Well you won't believe what I have in store for you! It's to your exact specifications! I believe I can set up your old lady, too’!" – Mitch Hedberg “For I never have seen, and never shall see, that the cessation of the evidence of existence is necessarily evidence of the cessation of existence.” – William de Morgan "A new survey found that atheists are the fastest-growing religious group in the U.S. And if you find that hard to believe – well, you're probably one of them." - Jimmy Fallon “What has religion to do with facts? Nothing.” – Robert Ingersoll “Ignorance Is Strength!” – Ministry of Truth, “1984” (Orwell) "Here comes the vice-presidential debate. My favorite part of a debate is when a candidate will tell a heartfelt anecdote about a struggling American who lives in a swing state." = David Letterman “Droll thing life is — that mysterious arrangement of merciless logic for a futile purpose. The most you can hope from it is some knowledge of yourself — that comes too late — a crop of un-extinguishable regrets. I have wrestled with death. It is the most unexciting contest you can imagine. It takes place in an impalpable grayness, with nothing underfoot, with nothing around, without spectators, without clamor, without glory, without the great desire of victory, without the great fear of defeat, in a sickly atmosphere of tepid skepticism, without much belief in your own right, and still less in that of your adversary. If such is the form of ultimate wisdom, then life is a greater riddle than some of us think it to be.” – Joseph Conrad, Heart of Darkness “Mystery has its own mysteries, and there are gods above gods. We have ours, they have theirs. That is what's known as infinity.” – Jean Cocteau “Have a good weekend, all.” – echo2165 “One does not discover new lands without consenting to lose sight of the shore for a very long time.” – Andre Gide</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1350090198402</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 21:03:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350091971249-76</Id><Title>More weakness to come.</Title><Msg>Does anyone think this Softbank news can move T lower.
