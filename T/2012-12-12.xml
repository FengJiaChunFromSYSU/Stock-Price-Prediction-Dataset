With respctao to utility, Madam's benchmark uses DUK which has a BBB+ rating and yielding 4.8 percentao. In case of T, the rating varies from A to A-, depending which rating agencia you go by. In the latest bond offering, Fitch rated T as an "A" with the qualifikasyone of the outlook being negativo. That said, strictly judged as a utility would yield FV north of $40 (U.S.) for the comparisyone to hold valid and here we are are rookie telling the world the fair valore to be $35.oo.

The ironic part isn't that just a group of 8th graders can't read, but that it was a group of 8th graders in a school district that the President had just praised. Teachers are only part of the education process, a good portion of that education and the ambition and drive to obtain a good education start at home. The problem is that many of the parents of failing kids today were high school failures themselves. The wheel just keeps turning and it never gets any better. I agree that good teachers should be paid well, but I also agree that poorer performing teachers should be replaced and union won't allow that simple, but necessary process to be part of the equation. Yes, unions did have a place at one point in time to reduce the instances of sweatshop type employers. Since then they have made millionaires out of union leaders, criminal out of others and have driven many companies and in some cases entire industries out of this country or existence. What praise should be heaped upon them for that service to their fellow citizens? You keep looking for the misspelled words, ignore the rest of the world around you, keep expecting the different results from the same idiotic actions, and see where that gets you. As for as some of your other comments, I was taught by teachers before there were teachers unions in my part of the country, I never belonged to a union, never worked in a union shop and owe little if anything to any union for my personal successes.</Msg><Username>pinhighshot</Username><Timestamp>1355324829600</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-12 10:07:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355325337344-10</Id><Topic><Title>T is too beneficial to miss right now.

What kid knows. I had good teachers though. I have family members who are teachers, how do you determine a "good' teacher? Experience and stamina are one way. It takes quite a few years for a teacher to become "good." There are very very few "bad" teachers, those don't make it. My children went to probably one of the best school districts in the country, certainly one of the richest. They had all the perks, smaller classes, and we the parents made sure our kids studied. A teacher can't be a parent to 40 kids per class. Now in an inner city school, there are other examples in rural America just as good, kids go home to a totally different environment than a rich area. It isn't the teacher who is causing the problem, it is the parents and the depressing poverty. So when Obama praises the Detroit teachers, I praise them too. Obviously President Obama has a better handle on the reality of it than you two here. Actually your own statement above agrees it isn't all about the teacher, the teacher can only do so much. I am caught up in a mispelled word? You are caught up in persecuting Obama. Which is worse? There is nothing wrong with what he said or did, nothing. Why do teachers have unions? Because there was a problem with administrators hiring young to replace old because young is cheap. There was a problem with administrators acting like dictators and hiring firing for any reason. How would you like to be replaced by a youngster when you are too old to get another job but too young to retire? Right to work states have teachers unions. Unions are the foundation of America. We are a union, the tea party was a union standing up, through group strength, to the king. You want to go back to aristocracy? That's more where it's headed than "socialism", a paid for talking point hammered into gullible minds. Any President is only there for a few years, then we get to vote again. If you start finding better candidates, stop talking about birth certificates, maybe you will do better next time.</Msg><Username>peppeek</Username><Timestamp>1355327188495</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-12 10:46:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355327765239-14</Id><Topic><Title>Obama steps on his tounge again.</Title><Username>pinhighshot</Username><Timestamp>1355251416026</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 13:43:36 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Taken as a whole, I think the T message board reflects badly on every facet of the American educational system-- union, non-union, &amp; public, private alike.

I listened to a union guy today claiming that this will hurt union employees that risk their lives and careers everyday to keep their way of life and ensure their livelihoods. What a crock! A union contract is negotiated for 2-3-4, sometimes for as long as five years. During that time a union worker has no fear of losing his job unless their demands are driving the company out of business or out of the country. Even if they are losing workers that even you or I wouldn't keep on the payroll, the union will fight to keep them employed so they don't miss out on the union dues. The only time a union workers career is at risk is when they elected to strike rather that agree to a contract offer. Right to work does not put an end to unions, it simply says that if a prospective employee or even a current one sees no or little value in joining the union, they don't have to join or pay dues or see their union dues sent to political candidates they don't support. Unions will continue to exist and fools that see value in joining them will continue to robotically toe the line. It's all about rights, freedoms, and not having to join an organization you might strongly disagree with to get a job. Evaluating teacher’s performance is a difficult task to be sure, but just because a teacher belongs to a teachers union is no reason to keep the obvious poor ones and that is what happens. It’s an old cliché, but you really can’t see the forest for the trees.</Msg><Username>pinhighshot</Username><Timestamp>1355349812535</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-12 17:03:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355350177374-32</Id><Topic><Title>Garrison Keillor</Title><Username>lavendersin</Username><Timestamp>1355341410071</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-12 14:43:30 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Report the sticky buttsmudge to Yahoo.

They don't get fired because the boss's kid needs a job and it's yours he wants. Union is basically what we are as a country, starting with revolting against a king. The king could do whatever he wanted and the people had no say. Now that we are a Union, we get to have a say. Each of us get one say, rich or poor, big or small. The big danger, if there is one, is the Koch Bros forming the country to their likes with their power, similar to like the king did. It sort of goes with being very rich, thinking you are better, and entitled to more say than average people. There are lots of unselfish good rich people and there is nothing wrong with being rich. Every rich prson especially those born rich, should have to work at a 1200/mo job and rent a 900/mo apartment for two years to see what people are living through. In America we still each get one vote, and we the people decide what we like. We like Obama this time.</Msg><Username>peppeek</Username><Timestamp>1355354279466</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-12 18:17:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355363023153-35</Id><Topic><Title>Obama steps on his tounge again.</Title><Username>pinhighshot</Username><Timestamp>1355251416026</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 13:43:36 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yeah, kinda like the Kenyan's "57 states".
