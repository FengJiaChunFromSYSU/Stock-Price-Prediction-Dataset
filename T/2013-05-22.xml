U.S. Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said Tuesday the IRS was out of bounds in seeking information on the group's prayer activities and a guarantee that it wouldn't protest at Planned Parenthood. "That's outrageous that that statement would be made by anybody in government, that somehow you've got to compromise your First Amendment rights," Grassley said. "It appears the IRS offered this group a quid pro quo: you can become a charity if you don't protest in front of a Planned Parenthood." The Iowa group isn't the only anti-abortion organization that appears to have been singled out for scrutiny. In 2011, IRS singled out asked Christian Voices for Life of Fort Bend County in Texas and Texas groups faced unfair IRS intrusion into their activities because of "political and religious bias" that chilled their constitutional rights.</Msg><Username>ricky1820l</Username><Timestamp>1369244902067</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 13:48:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369245152100-25</Id><Topic><Title>This is BAD.</Title><Username>smithersj1234</Username><Timestamp>1369232619415</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 10:23:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I wonder how many times he has to be told T didn't miss EPS estimates.</Msg><Username>t.bfine</Username><Timestamp>1369245152100</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 13:52:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369245523104-26</Id><Topic><Title>Hey Ricky</Title><Username>ltcolhen</Username><Timestamp>1369167199224</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 16:13:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"why do you and your pals think for one moment that only our elderly" I'm sorry.

All of the available evidence points to this. These were all field operations managed by field personnel. Why do you think Obama would be personally involved in any of these things? As I have said before, just because some Tea Brains decided to get their undies in a twist does not mean something warrants Presidential attention. This IRS thing is a case in point. The targeting ended in May 2012, due to internal IRS management ending the process at the field office. IRS management also asked the IG to review the incident to make further improvements. Clearly you want the President himself to be personally responsible if you have to wait an extra day for your Soc. Sec. check.

Well, it looks like all of our senior citizens on the board got their delivery of "crazy gas" today. Guns, and the President being arrested (first wet dream Wilkes has had in 50 years), fakecho shrieking incoherent "insults" at bshipley. You girls go on with your bad selves. It's time for a little lunch, a beer and then back out into the waves, which rise and fall...there's a metaphor for "T" performance in there somewhere, but I'm too tired and lazy to think it through.</Msg><Username>hotdoggitwiggie</Username><Timestamp>1369264844233</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 19:20:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369264965044-69</Id><Topic><Title>The Tea Party Trinity</Title><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1369232834304</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 10:27:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>DOUCHE!

I'm stuck in a depressing defunct mining town in Virginia with a gassy 15 year old Rat Terrier as my only company. The high point of my life is looking out the living room window and waiting for the mailman every day. Sometimes my Social Security check comes and I can run down to the store and buy ammo. Even if it's just a couple of 22 shells, anything to do with guns is like German kink porn for me. It's the only thing that makes me feel alive and I cannot get enough..(!!) I know it's a sad life, which is both small and constantly diminishing but it's the best I could put together with my being essentially uneducated, functionally illiterate and steeped in the myth that my white American "male" superiority would guarantee me riches...oh, that and my "good looks".
