You make it sound like a ‘racism rally’ with talk like that !!” – jonthepaptest Well, jon, with your understanding of political history limited to sound bites from Rupert Murdoch and Ann Coulter, I wouldn’t expect you to know where the quote came from…nor, apparently have any understanding of what it means. Inferring that it’s racist is typical…like there’s not seriously racist nonsense posted every day here by your cronies that you could criticize. “The Ballot or the Bullet” speech was originally made by Malcolm X in ‘64 when he left the Nation of Islam and declared he was joining with the Civil Rights movement. “The Ballot or the Bullet presented a fundamental difference with The Nation of Islam in its advocacy of voting, a position opposite that of the Nation of Islam, which forbade its members from participating in the political process.” For disavowing racism and expressing willingness to work with civil rights leaders, Malcolm X was soon thereafter assassinated by members of The Nation of Islam. Now THAT was a racist action on the one side, just as the much earlier killing of his father and uncle by white Supremacists was on the other. However, “ballots not bullets” has been used repetitively over the years by many people advocating the Democratic process, over the “political anarchy if we don’t get our way” concept of you and the lunatic fringe of the far right. Suggesting my post, or the Obama rally in Kent had anything to do with racism, is simply another futile attempt by the right to interject racism into this campaign. Read the quote again, jon. It said “BALLOTS Not Bullets”, not “BULLETS Not Ballots”, you dyslexic buffoon. “Democracy triumphs. The fundamental wisdom that has long distinguished our nation and has led her to greatness resides in our unwavering commitment to settle our differences with ballots, not bullets... let us recall the words that Bobby Kennedy spoke on that tragic occasion so many years ago: ‘Let us dedicate ourselves to what the Greeks wrote so many years ago: to tame the savageness of man and make gentle the life of this world’.” - Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney (D-NY), in the aftermath of the shooting of Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1348834579898</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 08:16:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348835360064-2</Id><Topic><Title>Dem Polls aren't what they Seem</Title><Username>robfisk</Username><Timestamp>1348445228622</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-23 20:07:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>William Bennett on Obama- " Broken promises: If you think I'm being too hard on the president, let's hold him to his own words and promises. He promised to cut the deficit in half in his first term. He sought in Cairo in 2009 a "new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the world." He promised to change the "tone" of Washington. His economic team promised that his $800 billion stimulus package would keep the unemployment rate under 8 percent. In 2008, he promised to tackle entitlement reform in his first term. Before Obamacare was passed Obama promised to "cut the cost of a typical family's premium by up to $2,500 a year" and that "If you like your health care plan, you will be able to keep your health care plan." Americans realize the president has over-promised and under-delivered. The objective record, the multiple failures, and the unkept promises make a profound and fair case against the reelection of Barack Obama."

No racism there, by golly. Hey, Bill, check out the betting odds. Man, with all the points you’re getting, why not put a couple hundred grand on the GOP? A betting man like you should know some good odds when he sees them. (Well the ODDS are good...chances of winning...not so much.) And this was before the “47%” and the recent “harvest them at a significant profit” comments. “In a slide that just won't seem to stop, the Democrats and Obama keep climbing in the odds while Romney and the GOP just keep falling. Since we updated last, both parties have held or are currently holding their national conventions signifying that we are now hitting the home stretch. In that time, Obama and the Dems have risen all the way to -215 (risk $2.15 to win $1) while the Republicans and Romney have declined to just +175 (risk $1 to win $1.75) to take the November General Election.” – PoliticalBettingOdds</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1348838194544</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 09:16:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348840940051-4</Id><Title>BONZ BONZ BONZ HIT GOLD</Title><Msg>Bonz hit gold went fron 2 cents - 5 cent in two days can hit 50 cents in a week</Msg><Username>drughelpline1</Username><Timestamp>1348840940051</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 10:02:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348841794031-5</Id><Title>How much petter penatration though cement do you get with T's 700 Meg vs Sprint's 600 meg ?</Title><Msg>Any reference to if it makes any difference.</Msg><Username>snaps4u2</Username><Timestamp>1348841794031</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 10:16:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348842016383-6</Id><Topic><Title>Like a Replacement Ref, Barry is so Wrong</Title><Username>robfisk</Username><Timestamp>1348626911097</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-25 22:35:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Your getting desperate jon2retard.

You are again comparing things that aren't in the same ballpark. If you want to imagine the US is like France or the Soviet Union, or we're on the verge of WW III or in an economic depression feel free, but realize you are discussing an imaginary world. You may as well be talking about Star Trek. I discuss the real world here. The 47% Romney cited DO pay taxes, they just don't pay federal income taxes--a very specific line. There are no deductions for payroll taxes (a separated category), which are 13.9% for earned income. Ironically, Romney does not pay this tax. If he did, it would double what he pays in taxes. When you consider the marginal tax rates, you need to consider the payroll tax. Others are seniors, the disabled and military veterans. There are very few working age people who do not pay any tax due to unemployment, and they generally only do so temporarily. The idea that the rich are overtaxed in this country is absurd. For every dollar a worker draws in salary, 13.9 cents is gone before income tax is even added on. People like Romney, with no earned income, don't pay a payroll tax and have an exceptionally low capital gains tax. So again I ask, how low should the tax rate for the wealthy be? 10%? 5%? 1%?</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1348857896501</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 14:44:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348858236364-20</Id><Topic><Title>Spread the news.

Sponsored LinksBut this can be one of the most risky places to cut if you are a student needing the expected tools of technology at your fingertips. It can also be a serious disadvantage if you are a job seeker. Immediate access to the Internet and telephone are important to search effectively and to be immediately available when that important job interview comes along. Additionally, it doesn't make a good impression to have no phone to list on an application or resume, or to answer your email sporadically. For others, it can be dangerous. Without a phone or an Internet connection, seniors can become cut off from their families and health care providers. Clearly, technology has become a basic need.

THIS INCLUDES WHEN YOUR CHECK IS DIRECT DEPOSITED!!! Do you consider yourself rich? Hill was hoping you would think money transfers would apply to the super rich.

Former Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty has quit as co-chair of Mitt Romney's presidential campaign. I think the technical term is 'jumping ship’!

The HHS mandate requires employers to provide coverage for contraception, abortifacient and sterilization services. The mandate makes no exceptions for religious institutions and their affiliated entities. The administration tried to reach an accommodation with the church. The accommodation was a dishonest effort. It was merely rearranging some words. The institutions would not have to pay for contraception et al, the insurance company would; but the institutions must provide, pay or partially pay for the insurance that pays for… You get the picture. This is an unjust law and unjust laws “must not be obeyed”. They are including lay employers in their statement. Employers, who for reasons of faith or conscience, may not want to provide or pay for contraceptive, sterilization, or abortifacient services. Religious liberty is not just the right to worship freely as one chooses. There is a duty and obligation to make contributions to humanity based upon whatever faith is practiced without compromising the tenets of faith, morals, conscience, or values. How many companies is BO going to drive into bankruptcy or people are they willing to imprison over the mandate or the act itself? The Affordable Care Act is proving to be an unnecessary burden on society and an albatross around the BO’s neck that he no longer wants to talk about.</Msg><Username>lkglhklkh</Username><Timestamp>1348888340546</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 23:12:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348888744808-40</Id><Topic><Title>There is a Romney Phone too</Title><Username>t_bag_d_bags</Username><Timestamp>1348871286256</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 18:28:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's called one you have to pay for.</Msg><Username>lkglhklkh</Username><Timestamp>1348888744808</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 23:19:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348889183078-41</Id><Title>God Bless Our Christian Brother, President Obama Saved America!!!</Title><Msg>God Bless Our Christian Brother, President Obama..
