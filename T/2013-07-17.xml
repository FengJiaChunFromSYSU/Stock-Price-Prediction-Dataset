Times) the story about Cuauhtemoc Negrete: "City Terrace resident Cuauhtemoc Negrete said he was told: "You better blend in or you’re going to get hurt." The group eventually approached him, someone punched him in the head and another person stole his bicycle. …" "Shortly after the attack, Negrete broke down in tears and expressed his frustration over the violence." “Why does it always have to go down this road?” he told The Times on Monday night." "He said he felt he was targeted because he was Latino. Others in the crowd said they saw similar incidents." I rest my case: Not only was George Zimmerman (a registered democrat and Hispanic) thrown under the bus by his own party, the left, and the MSM, but now it turns out (at least in L.A.) that any Hispanic man can and will receive the retribution of the racist mobs of the left, if (as Mr. Negrete was advised) he doesn't "blend in". Again, to my Latino and Latina brothers and sisters be very careful out there, because at least from the perspective of Mr. Negrete, you have a target on your backs and you will be made to pay the price for not "blending in".

It was only after society changed its sentiment was he able to resume the family name of his father. o In the case of Elizabeth Warren it became convenient for professional purposes to assume a Native American identity. o And finally in the case of our "dear leader" for many years both during his scholastic career and for many years after to self identify himself as a foreign exchange student and in the case of his literary career (according to the brochure published by his literary agent) he self identified his foreign origins.

I shared a shelter half with one who was pretty decent. I heard of others that were not. There was a shootout in the Pusan red light district early in the Korean War. Most have never heard of it. Blacks started it and shot it out with thre MP's. About 60-70 died there. Early in the war everyone carried arms as there were so many No. Korean infiltrators.</Msg><Username>lewcor</Username><Timestamp>1374104445892</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-17 19:40:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374104590279-34</Id><Topic><Title>Zimmerman Acquitted</Title><Username>geoff_holt_2000</Username><Timestamp>1373769095727</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 22:31:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You can't appeal an acquital.

If not crawl back into our hole. Witnesses had their way. The jury heard the testimony and made a decision. I don't know about black people, but when someone is following you and you don't know if they are armed or not, it is not a good plan to confront them. It is in fact quite stupid. It also appears from the witnesses that Martin was very aggressive and was not defending himself as the weapon had not been shown yet. According to his girlfriend, he was just going to 'put some whoopass on him to chase away a homosexual. But that isn't prejudiced I guess. The only time on recorded record that Zimmerman even mentioned he was black, was after the 911 operator ask him if he was black, white or what he looked like. Of course Martin calling him a 'cracka' was racist either in your book? Unless you have film of the event, why not just shut up!</Msg><Username>winholder</Username><Timestamp>1374104644011</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-17 19:44:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374104784077-36</Id><Topic><Title>Zimmerman Acquitted</Title><Username>geoff_holt_2000</Username><Timestamp>1373769095727</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 22:31:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Now you're learning.

He walked back to his truck and Martin followed him and assaulted him. There was no confrontation 'til then. He followed initially to get in front of the apartments to get an address to give to police.

Zimm Prosecuters to face Lawsuit from fired Fla. State Attorneys Office Emp .. YEP, and this goes REAL DEEP !! Seems that Ben Kruidos, the former director of Angela Cory's "Info.Technology" office was fired after testifing at a pre-trial hearing. He had extracted potentially damaging prosecution info from Martin's cell phone, that the PROSECUTION was "legally obligated" to SHARE the with Zimmerman's Defense Team - info that the Judge would not allow either .. as requsted by Zimm's defense !! ... (the photos, texts, etc) All of this cell phone info was reported .. then swept under the rug, then Ben was fired for revealing it to 'other superiors/officials'. Ben has filed a "WhistleBlowers Lawsuit" against Angela Cory's Fla. State Attorney's Office Ben's Lawyer is 'another attorney' that was fired by Angela Cory's Fla. State Attorneys Office ... This Reuters article has quite a few twist &amp; turns that will bring down a lot of unscrupulus people involved in this trial .. and may extend further ?? AND Zimm is found "NOT GUILTY" .. which really shows this was a malicious political 'Witch Hunt" .. (from our POTUS, and illiminating "this excuse" for anymore leftist anti-gun fodder) . Titled ... "Zimmerman Prosecutors To Face Whistleblower Lawsuit From Fired Fla. State Attorney Employee" .... New York, July 16th - (Reuters) It'll make you laugh with disgust .. their jig is up and we'll see what MSM's will dare carry this story ??</Msg><Username>echo.2l65</Username><Timestamp>1374118360978</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-17 23:32:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
