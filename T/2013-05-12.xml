Rational: Right and left, investors are rushing to buy dividend yielding stocks to the point that, today, 3% yield would seem favorable in a continuing deflationary environment we are in. As a result, the dividend yielding stocks are in high demand. We are gradually reaching a point where even the utilities such as DUK, SO, etc. have posted sizable gains in stock price driving the yield closer to the 4% mark. Unlike these utilities where there is absolutely no growth, AT&amp;T is expected to grow earnings in high single digits with track record of increasing the dividend as they have done during the last 25 years. Okay then, why do investors prefer to stay away from investing in this stock? Simply stated, people keep thinking this is still the AT&amp;T of Bob Allen, Greg A. Smith, Jerry Mulyk and of course who can ever forget the dinasore called BELL LABS, IMO. No more of these incompetent managers and gone are the golden days of BELL LABS where the sky was the limit for spending without observable accomplishments. In fact, one of the major achievement of today's AT&amp;T was to ditch BELLLABS. I command those individuals for having made such a brilliant move. Caution- The above is just one man's own opinion and interpretation. Always do your own DD. The author holds a position in the AT&amp;T stock.</Msg><Username>convergent_series</Username><Timestamp>1368360239528</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-12 08:03:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368363295519-13</Id><Topic><Title>Tea party, right wing extreme, GOP congress, etc's defintion of proof</Title><Username>peppeek</Username><Timestamp>1368209230720</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 14:07:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>...“…you know nothing about the hearings because you don't watch FOX News and that was the only station to broadcast the hearings…” – wilkes “Fox News was the only outlet that aired most of the hearings so we could draw our own conclusions unfiltered from the talking heads.” – t.bfine What’s up with you people?

They targeted groups that put "Tea Party" or "Patriot" in their name because, apparently, those groups tend to commit tax fraud. Those groups, particularly the Tea Party groups, are definitely NOT patriotic and aren't really conservative either. Putting a word in your name or calling yourself something does not make it so. You people are judged by your persistent lying, partisanship, obstinance and idiocy. These are not characteristics of patriots or conservatives.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1368375257115</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-12 12:14:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>15</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368376401736-17</Id><Topic><Title>Tea party, right wing extreme, GOP congress, etc's defintion of proof</Title><Username>peppeek</Username><Timestamp>1368209230720</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 14:07:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well said.</Msg><Username>zonbac89</Username><Timestamp>1368376401736</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-12 12:33:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368391014425-18</Id><Title>Dave Martin</Title><Msg>I was asked if I knew who Dave Martin is.

Well, if you are correct I'm wondering why the IRS publically apoligized yesterday!!!! By STEPHEN OHLEMACHER 05/11/13 09:50 PM ET EDT AP The IRS apologized Friday for what it acknowledged was "inappropriate" targeting of conservative political groups during the 2012 election to see if they were violating their tax-exempt status. The agency blamed low-level employees, saying no high-level officials were aware. By the way, the last sentence will likely be the next lie exposed.
