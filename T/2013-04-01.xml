Everything is some attempt to extort money from American taxpayers, as if the world is made up of jealous old misers counting pennies. North Korea's entire system is based on a delusion--that totalitarian Communism and the rule of Dear leader are the only things that protect them from the American Imperialists. If (or I should say when) that delusion collapses, the leaders of North Korea are in for a very harsh reckoning. To maintain that delusion, there must be a certain level of confrontation with the US. It is a dangerous game for N. Korea but without it the regime would collapse. What happens in N. Korea has alot more to do with internal politics than with the US. I think all of this has much more to do with shoring up young Kim Jong Un's power than any action with the US.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1364824913884</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 10:01:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>13</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364825143971-10</Id><Topic><Title>Michelle and Barack are both hate-filled racists who occasionally slip up in public on open mic’s.

They are simply in favor of economic policies that favor them and the enforcement social policies they prefer. They couch this in populist language, but when the rubber hits the road they strongly support the largest government entitlement programs, redistribution of wealth and Federal enforcement of social policies (see DoMA). The main difference between the Tea Brains and any other political group is they are willing to bankrupt the country and destroy the future of their children to ensure their government checks keep flowing and to get their way over everyone else. The populist language only serves to rationalize this extreme greed and self-centeredness. See tbfine. "Are you one of those OWGs?"

I then challenged you to either apologize or show us your data: “Just once, could you have some facts to back up your hideous claims…is that too much to ask?” You then switched subjects without answering, as you always do when you get caught lying, and decided to discuss the demise of the message boards. My comment wasn’t directed at the message board question…it was why you intentionally lie, get caught, and think you can get off with really stupid comments like this, your latest sorry response: “Again, you have no reasonable, coherent response even remotely associated to the subject, so you deflect to hide your embarrassment.” I’m pretty sure most people are wondering if you’re talking to yourself with that question…because they’re all certainly aware, based on your response, that you’re apparently totally void of logic, veracity and integrity…and a coward, to boot.

The Tea Party Caucus pushed a bill that would have forced Obama to defend it, despite the fact that no such duty exists, and despite the fact that the law is unconstitutional.

In one message string you contradict yourself several times. You have listed several complaints about what the Tea Party wants, then say they only have one individual right they care about. You don't know what the Tea Party stands for you just know you're against anything they stand for and support anything the liberal's want to inflict on this country. And before you go on some ballistic rant about my being a Tea Party member, understand that I don't agree with their approach to many things, I don't believe they are a legitimate political Party in this country. I think the Lame Stream Media came up with that name because they couldn't think of anything else to call people that don't happen to subscribe to their version of a world order, any world other than the one right in front of them that they can follow without much thought. “Obama administration decided not to defend the law the Tea Brains were all up in arms about his "Constitutional duty" to defend the law.” You don’t think that it is important that when a seated Congress writes a law that the President and the Department of Justice follow the law of the land and enforce ALL those laws? Do you feel it is an option for those two entities to arbitrarily decide which laws they like and don’t like and which they will enforce? That is not the actions of a democratic or representative government; that is an autocracy pushing toward dictatorship. If you feel that a law is unacceptable, there are processes in this country to change those laws. Ignorance of the law is no excuse to not adhere to a law and ignoring laws because they don’t please you, personally or politically should not be allowed either.</Msg><Username>winholder</Username><Timestamp>1364839185680</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 13:59:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364839232643-34</Id><Topic><Title>Hillary Clinton says Billy &amp; Bengazi wreck her chance to run as an Old Bag in 2016.</Title><Username>maxwizard688</Username><Timestamp>1364752449529</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 13:54:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Now that is a cat fight I would pay to watch.</Msg><Username>pinhighshot</Username><Timestamp>1364839232643</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 14:00:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364839509256-35</Id><Topic><Title>Yahoo solves the SPAM problem</Title><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1364490014803</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 13:00:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wrong string dip wad and I did post the text of the National Review article that discussed the laws in CO, apparently Yahoo saw fit to take them down.

CCUR currently $7.91 with 9.2mm o/s cash of $24.6mm no debt an enterprise value (EV) of $48.17 million or just 0.77x revenue. CCUR together with Seachange (SEAC) control the majority of the global video on demand (VOD) market. SEAC just hit a new 52-week high last week and is now trading with an EV/revenue ratio of 1.89, which would value CCUR over $15.50. While SEAC has gross margins of 50.18% and is losing money, CCUR has gross margins of 58.81% and was profitable the past four consecutive quarters. CCUR's EPS has been ramping up big - last quarter it was up 100% from the previous quarter and 300% from two quarters ago. CCUR's clients include 6 of the 8 largest cable TV companies in the U.S. CCUR just announced last month that a new undisclosed Top 5 North American pay-TV service provider has signed on as a new client. CCUR and SEAC are about to capitalize on the new biggest cable TV spending boom, as cable TV subscribers demand access to live TV and on demand content on their tablets/smartphones. CCUR's MediaHawk unified multi-screen video solution is already powering a new multi-screen service called Xvie that was just launched by Jupiter (JUPIY) the largest cable TV company in Japan. Just the other day, CCUR announced a brand new huge multi-screen client Virgin Media (VMED) the largest cable TV company in the UK with 3.8 million subscribers. VMED could add greatly to CCUR's revenues and profits in the upcoming quarters as they deploy CCUR's MediaHawk to power their new multi-screen service - Virgin TV Anywhere. Both CCUR and SEAC have been rumored takeover targets (Google it) and major consolidation is already taking place in the industry this year.</Msg><Username>frankf4u489</Username><Timestamp>1364843731329</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 15:15:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364843839142-46</Id><Topic><Title>Michelle and Barack are both hate-filled racists who occasionally slip up in public on open mic’s.

Perhaps if you cared a bit less about what the people on this board do or say and more about what our government is doing to us, you might be a better person for it.</Msg><Username>winholder</Username><Timestamp>1364852381827</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 17:39:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364852653052-61</Id><Topic><Title>Michelle and Barack are both hate-filled racists who occasionally slip up in public on open mic’s.

Why because of all the vacation they take and the money she spends on them? "You see they weren't given silver spoons and passes through life because they were white." No, they were given tuition and other benefits through affirmative action’s and other government entitlements because they were black. "They had to endure the ignorant racism depicted here in these posts against them." Is that the liberal excuse for the racism reflected in many of their actions and comments? I don’t care that the President is black. I just want him to stop pretending he is President without his being black and the support he received because of that.</Msg><Username>pinhighshot</Username><Timestamp>1364852653052</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 17:44:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364858878357-62</Id><Topic><Title>district 9 way to go in voting no on your contract</Title><Username>ctmuscles</Username><Timestamp>1363990920442</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 18:22:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>just say no in your vote district 9......its the same contract that they offered you a month ago.......</Msg><Username>ctmuscles</Username><Timestamp>1364858878357</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 19:27:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364862160498-63</Id><Topic><Title>White citizens about to be screwed, big time?</Title><Username>lavendarsen</Username><Timestamp>1364842296010</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 14:51:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Funny isn't how all the coloreds want to get into White nations.

He built a big office bldg. next to an airport that was 20 feet over the height limit. The FAA ordered him to lower it. The mayor at the time who was married to the same ilk as this oligarch pulled all the plugs trying to let this man violate the safety standards.
