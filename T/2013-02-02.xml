The first is the AT&amp;T Labs incorporating the latest technological innovations to the data transmission and the second being the value delivered to the shareholders in the form of dividends, or as Randall calls it "the owners of the company." Taken together, it even makes a far superior investment yet. It is important to note that today's AT&amp;T Labs is significantly different than the evil empire of the former Bell Labs which was highly instrumental in the destruction of the former AT&amp;T.</Msg><Username>convergent_series</Username><Timestamp>1359803624632</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 06:13:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359819902426-3</Id><Topic><Title>The last time T climbed to $40</Title><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1359485783660</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 13:56:23 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A positve T piece from the Motley Fool is extremely rare.

If you are talking about share price, what chart are you looking at? If you have a union ax to grind, at least get your story straight. My chart shows steady share price appreciation since the great recession of 2008 when every equity was hammered. T was no exception.

In March 2012, the United States federal government announced a lawsuit against AT&amp;T. The specific accusations state that AT&amp;T "violated the False Claims Act by facilitating and seeking federal payment for IP Relay calls by international callers who were ineligible for the service and sought to use it for fraudulent purposes. The complaint alleges that, out of fears that fraudulent call volume would drop after the registration deadline, AT&amp;T knowingly adopted a non-compliant registration system that did not verify whether the user was located within the United States. The complaint further contends that AT&amp;T continued to employ this system even with the knowledge that it facilitated use of IP Relay by fraudulent foreign callers, which accounted for up to 95 percent of AT&amp;T's call volume. The government's complaint alleges that AT&amp;T improperly billed the TRS Fund for reimbursement of these calls and received millions of dollars in federal payments as a result."[</Msg><Username>wledigmacsen</Username><Timestamp>1359827484027</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 12:51:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359834525814-7</Id><Topic><Title>Accusations of Fraud</Title><Username>wledigmacsen</Username><Timestamp>1359827484027</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 12:51:24 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>New one on me.
