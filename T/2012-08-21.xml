The Swift Boaters Are Back New political ads now blame President Obama for taking credit for killing Osama bin Laden and, allegedly, endangering American lives by leaking other secret military operations information. This is simply another “Swift Boat” attack of lies and deceit, utilizing former veterans as dupes for political propaganda. The group, “The Special Operations OPSEC Fund”, try to portray themselves as “nonpartisan and unconnected to any political party or presidential campaign.” Right! They expect you to believe they’re just a bunch of vets who somehow found a million dollars to create a 22 minute film bashing the President. They also say they want to release similar TV commercials in select states which are, not surprisingly, key battleground states in the upcoming election. But, remember, they also want you to believe that they’re not politically motivated. Here are some facts which belie that claim: In their claim that the President’s message tried to take credit for the Bin Laden raid, they intentionally edited out Obama giving, “thanks for the men that carried out this operation, for they exemplified the professionalism, patriotism and unparallel coverage of those who serve the country and part of a generation that is born the heaviest share of the burden since that September day.” The President of the group, Scott Taylor, certainly is politically involved, as he ran (unsuccessfully) for Congress with Tea Party backing in Virginia as a Republican in 2010. The legal counsel for the group, E. Mark Braden, is a former chief counsel for the Republican National Committee. The spokesman for the group, Fred Rustmann, is a former CIA officer, now a consultant who teaches companies how to spy on each other. He has been on Fox News with Sean Hannity, trying to defend the “outing” of Valerie Plame. How ironic that he’s now criticizing others about “outrageous leaks which endangered lives”. Chad Bolton now represents this group. He, likewise, insists the group’s purpose and message are non-political – but how can that possibly be? He was the national spokesperson for the Bush campaign in 2004. He is a former spokesman for John Boehner. And he works for HDMK, a consulting group of Republicans whose message states, “We have been active players in hundreds of public policy battles and know how to get results for our clients…our clients have access to a full war room of talent…” (Gee, that doesn’t sound like non-biased objectivity is really a goal, now does it? This new group incorporated in Delaware as a non-profit, both of which provide shields of secrecy about who’s actually behind it. When asked, a spokesman for the group refused to discuss its sources of funding. But where did the initial million dollars come from? I won’t speculate on that, BUT…the OPSEC organization even shares office space with a Republican consulting group in Alexandria, VA. But, trust them, there’s NO CONNECTION! I would suggest that rather than believe this flagrantly political propaganda from sources who are obviously hiding their true identities and intent, listen to the truth from Admiral Bill McRaven, the Commander of the Bin Laden raid, who said, "At the end of the day, make no mistake about it, it was the president of the United States that shouldered the burden for this operation, that made the hard decisions, that was instrumental in the planning process, because I pitched every plan to him." The bottom line is that this is just another example of the far right being so void of legitimate issues to debate, that they simply make stuff up hoping enough Americans are stupid enough to believe their lies. Blatantly unconscionable, flagrantly dishonest and extremely pathetic, but, apparently now standard operating procedure for those with ulterior motives …pretty much like this message board.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1345547743000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 07:15:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345551363000-3</Id><Topic><Title>The swiftobaters are back...</Title><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1345547743000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 07:15:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hey clown.

I would not put anything off limits to radical environmentalists.</Msg><Username>robfisk</Username><Timestamp>1345582817000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 17:00:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345583044000-66</Id><Topic><Title>Corn Prices up 23% world wide in July</Title><Username>robfisk</Username><Timestamp>1345252755000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 21:19:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In my few conversations with Obama supporters I have found that they not only don't know who he is but they don't want to know.

Denotative and connotative. Example: a Dumb person. Denotative: a person incapable of speaking. Connotatve: a stupid person. From the moment Mrs. Obama gave birth to her first child, she has been a Mother. Any subsequent (activities) would by denotative definition render her partner the aformentioned initials. You Liberals may have your own connotations for words and phrases, but you're not allowed to alter denotative definitions.

Today's CliffsNotes. This morning I asked the following: “Hey, win, rob, fake ricky, et. al….jon3retired called the President of the United States (yours and mine) a motherfocker this morning. Are all you guys okay with that?” The responses have included the following: Fake ricky (with the l instead of the 1) blamed it on Biden, Reverend Wright, the liberal playbook and suggested it was up to me to prove it wasn’t true. Winholder denied jon said that and blamed it on my dirty evil liberal mind. He didn’t offer any suggestions as to what jon meant by MFIC, the well known derogatory, military acronym for mofo-in-charge. Funny, as his alter-ego, Dale the airman, he knew everything about the military. Of course, we shouldn’t expect winholder to ever acknowledge any wrongdoing, as just earlier he offered this excuse for the recent, deceptive swiftboat attacks: “If this is what it takes to get rid of Obama, I am all for it.” t.bfine said he doesn’t care for the practice on any front, but said people here make it hard not to (without condemning jon) The other fake ricky (@ymai) at first ignored the question but asked me to list all of “MY’ leader’s (for once not referring to him as the “Kenyan”) accomplishments. He then said jon didn’t say that at all, but MF stands for Money Funder. Jon, himself, one of the latest (and least erudite) alias creations, came back with several responses. One suggested, “Master Fruitcake In Charge .. You're the one that chose to use your sinister mind to fill in the initials - smiles !!”, followed by delusional babble about landmines. He then called the President a coward, and then defined coward as follows: “blaming others for his bad deeds…one who is not ‘man enough’ to admit his errors.” This from the guy who just called our President a motherfocker, and then launched a series of denials or excuses. If all of this isn’t bad enough, one of the earliest responses was from Wilkes, who, even more disgustingly dragged the President’s mother into the mofo equation. This from the party who claims the monopoly on morality and patriotism and claims the religious high ground for themselves. I cannot believe that reasonable folks on either side consider calling the President of the United States a mother focker anything other than a childish and reprehensible act that seriously detracts from their party’s agenda and reputation. And the above non-responses and distractions from this pathetic group are something we’ve come to expect on this board.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1345585874000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 17:51:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345588754000-69</Id><Topic><Title>Hey, win, rob, fake ricky, et. al....</Title><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1345561818000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 11:10:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Are you about to cry?</Msg><Username>corninmycrap</Username><Timestamp>1345588754000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 18:39:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345589105000-70</Id><Topic><Title>Hey, win, rob, fake ricky, et. al....</Title><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1345561818000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 11:10:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>echo2165, I agree with all you said, and I deplore this board and my reading it.

Most people have never been tried so for many it is a matter of I do not think I am. Military honors are on recomendations in various situations. It comes down to Nationalism, and sort of the John Wayne image we have in our minds. It is very difficult to judge heroism, it is easier to judge cowardice. A hero and leader will say follow me to victory, many judge a coward as one who orders other to their posible death. Then their are those who take a chance ordering others into danger knowing that if they fail he himself will suffer repercusions.

He started in 1974, and was finally stopped in 2002. Nathan Starts In 1974, When He Was 17 Years-Old In 1974, Nathan pleads guilty to impersonating a policeman and assaulting an eight-year-old boy, for which he received one year of probation. This was the first time he was caught, but most suspect he was on the prowl since puberty. Nathan Attacks Two Boys In 1977 In 1977, Nathan kidnapped and choked two boys. He was convicted of attempted murder, and was sentenced to 20 years in prison. What did he do for the three years since his last arrest? A Zi_onist Psychiatrist Puts Him In A Mental Hospital Nathaniel Levi Bar-Jonah said he had fantasies involving murder and cannibalism, and he was transferred to the Bridgewater State Hospital for Sexual Predators. He was released in 1991. Another Assault Then on August 9th, 1991, Mr. Bar-Jonah is arrested for battery on a 7-year-old boy, during an incident outside an Oxford post office. He is sentenced to two years probation, on the condition he move to Montana with his mother. Moves To Montana In 1991 He moved to Great Falls in August 1991, to serve out a two-year sentence of probation. December 18, 1993 Bar-Jonah molests an 8-year-old boy he is babysitting in Great Falls, Montana. He is charged, but the case is later dropped when the mother refuses to let the boy testify. Feburary 6, 1996 Ten-year-old Zachary Ramsay disappears on his way to Whittier Elementary School in Great Falls. December 13, 1999 Nathaniel Bar-Jonah is arrested while lurking around the Lincoln Elementary School in Great Falls in the early morning dressed as a policeman. According to police, he is carrying a stun gun, a can of pepper spray, a fake police badge and a toy revolver. He quickly becomes the focus of the Ramsay investigation. December 17, 1999 Police search his apartment and find nude photos of him and young boys June 6, 2000 Police dig up a portion of Bar-Jonah's garage and recover a bunch of human bones. On December 18, 2000, Bar-Jonah is charged with the kidnapping and murder of Ramsay. Authorities contend Bar-Jonah ate the boy's remains. February 26, 2002 Nathan stands trial in Great Falls, Montana Evidence Police found 28 boxes of potential evidence that links Bar-Jonah to Zachary's disappearance. Investigators have found stun guns, knives, batons, a blue police-style coat, police badges. They also found a list of names, including Zachary, young relatives and children of friends. Police Found Recipes Police also found writings where Bar-Jonah allegedly makes references to "Little Boy Stew," "Little Kid Desert," "Little Boy Pot Pies". Authorities reveal that Bar-Jonah ate the boy's remains and also fed them to unwitting friends and family. Police Suspect More Victims Bar-Jonah kept a list of 27 names that police suspect could be his Massachusetts victims from 1963 to1977. The story sends law enforcement scrambling to find earlier atrocities the suspected serial killer may have committed. Their search includes Arkansas, Florida, Colorado, and into Canada. Nathan Was Convicted On Three Counts Nathan received the maximum sentence of 130 years without parole. Prison video. High-Priced Lawyers His attorneys appealed to the state supreme court and lost.
