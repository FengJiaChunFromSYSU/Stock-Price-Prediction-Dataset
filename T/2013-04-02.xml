This particular message was posted under the alias of lewcor. As I’m sure you know, there are countless posts made every day by multiple aliased posters advocating racial intolerance and hatred by numerous bigoted lunatics. When posts go over the line, as this one has, both Yahoo and the appropriate authorities need to intervene. Posted by lewcor, on the AT&amp;T Yahoo Finance message board, April 1st, at approximately 9:00 p.m. “Funny isn't (sic) how all the coloreds want to get into White nations. When there (sic) they start moaning about everythiong (sic) while living off of the welfare provided by Whites. I have one consolation. It's going to come to a screeching halt very soon. The real culprits in this mess will get their just desserts.” This is not the only post advocating violence by this poster and his other aliases. In the very next posts, he adds, “People are fools and deserve what's coming.” People following a stock message board have no need to be constantly threatened by ignorant bigots. Now that this is drawn to your attention, should this lunatic act upon his visions of “just desserts”, one would think some of the blame and liability would fall upon those who continued to let this poster make threats and encourage violence, or the authorities who failed to pay him a visit.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1364902483059</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 07:34:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364906162981-5</Id><Topic><Title>AT&amp;T Upgraded to STRONG BUY?</Title><Username>miguel.janis</Username><Timestamp>1364394934253</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-27 10:35:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>really nice report!</Msg><Username>dunnmorgan16</Username><Timestamp>1364906162981</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 08:36:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364908148143-6</Id><Topic><Title>Michelle and Barack are both hate-filled racists who occasionally slip up in public on open mic’s.

Obama is a low cost President compared to others, it's in the facts, why do you pick on him. Obama's had not that long ago paid off their student loans, now how is paying interest being given. Racism is not the excuse, it's what it is, like what you show here. It's your excuse to call racism an excuse. The Obama's were given less, worked harder, and got less credit for what they did. You don't want him in the white house at all, because he's black, and think you are entitled to tell others how to vote. Doesn't work that way. No problem for Christians to vote for a mormon cultist, but can't vote for a brown Christian, their brother in Christ, don't see me complaining about that, it's their vote. Bottom line is he was elected fair and square by the people, and he is President for four years.

You get called on it every time. At some point anyone with any self-respect would stop. Man, I think I would shoot myself if I was a cheap hack like you." Nice try, and very selective spin of the truth, but let's look at some facts: o "Fisker has hired Kirkland &amp; Ellis, a major bankruptcy law firm, to review the company’s options while it continues to seek investment partners." o "The automaker has been working for months to raise $500 million so it could restart production of the Karma, its only model, which is built in Finland." o "A bankruptcy liquidation or restructuring could leave the government about $192 million in the hole. That’s what Fisker borrowed under the credit line before funding was shut off." Bottom line: The American people will probably lose about $192 million on its investment in a Finnish company that has provided 500 green jobs for Finland. Again, thank you Mr. President for all that you do. "In your heart you know he is right."
