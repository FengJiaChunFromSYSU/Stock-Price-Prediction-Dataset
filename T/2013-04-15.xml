That they are incompetent and cannot identify causation in weather patterns? Yet this one particular report from them is not based on faith? This one which you (wrongly) think provides evidence against global warming they got right? All of their scientific conclusions are balderdash except this one report? Is that your argument here, Froggie? Global warming isn't real because of the conclusion of scientists who, with the exception of this one report, you believe are completely incompetent? Yeah, right. We know exactly what you are Froggie.

I've read countless articles by reputable sources and failed to see anyone willing to put that in print. Yet, the Trolls and other assorted Haters can't write such stupidity often enough. Let's see what today brings as the markets look to open lower. That should be good ammo for you Trollers. There is a story this morning about T, VZ and VOD regarding the ongoing rumors about a deal that still hasn't died. The number being mentioned is something like 225B. Its hard to believe that Tis in that conversation since they are bleeding to death and can't rub two nickels together according to some. VZ wants desperately to buy the wireless business from VOD, but doesn't want the foreign market. Only one company is big enough to ante up the dough to buy that piece of VOD. I'm sure that company has contacted Cash Call to arrange some potential financing.</Msg><Username>davemartin74575</Username><Timestamp>1366032594716</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 09:29:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366032970870-5</Id><Topic><Title>Now 1 in 6 Americans under Obama's failed leadership is living in poverty.

On the contrary, the agenda driven scientists have been very competent in their quest to persuade large numbers of people that the sky is falling.

Good question: I believe that NOAA is a government agency that is made up of many good and honest scientists who provide a great service to the American people. Having said that, I also believe that because NOAA is a government agency, there are many within the agency who do have a political agenda that requires them to make findings that are contrary to good science, and more in line with the consensus du jour. Bottom line: I believe that a reasonably mature person evaluates the facts and science from many sources. Draws his or her own conclusions, and Determines sources that can be trusted and those that can't. "In your heart you know he is right."

Are these the same scientists who you claimed just moments ago were "agenda driven scientists" who use dishonest tactics and questionable scientific methods and practices "to persuade large numbers of people that the sky is falling"? The same people who responsible for "the manipulation of the masses by the powerful, and bad science."? "Determines sources that can be trusted and those that can't." The NOAA can be trusted, as can the climate scientists who wrote the report you cited. The NOAA and those scientists, along with the overwhelming preponderance of the scientific community, have concluded that global warming is real and that it is man-made. "I believe that a reasonably mature person evaluates the facts and science from many sources." I believe that too, Froggie. What exactly do you believe you are? You are such a weasel.
