Dispite (sic) your attempt to distract and distort the purpose of the event is clear and simple. The HHS mandate is forcing a religious institution to do something that goes against its religious (sic) conscience, if this mandate if not reversed sets a president (sic) that will eventually impact all religions.” – the fake Geoff holt with spelling assistance from jonthehapless The only distortion going on here is by you. You know, if you are here to pimp for the health insurance industry, why not just say so? How can you attempt to justify your position when you have to lie about it? We’ve been over this many times. Churches and many religious organizations are already exempted, and you know that. Others, with some type of religious connection, but who serve and employ people of all faiths, are not. (Hospitals or Universities) If you choose to exempt people from laws because of a business owner’s personal convictions or beliefs, where does it end? Libertarians could refuse to pay taxes. Mormons could refuse health insurance for any illness caused by alcohol, tobacco or caffeine. Christian Scientists could refuse to provide ANY health insurance whatsoever. Once again, you seem to be arguing a point about which the vast majority of Americans of all faiths, including Catholics, disagree with you. Note below Dr. Philpott’s statistics. If you continue to go against about three-fourths of the electorate (71 to 77% in this case), this supposedly “close election” could well be a blow-out. And you really do need to stop lying about things you full well know are not true. The American public is no longer buying it, as you should be learning by the polling numbers. “I am troubled, however, by the Conference of Catholic Bishops’ attempt to seek an exemption from the contraceptive requirements of the Affordable Care Act. The Affordable Care Act already has an extensive conscience clause. Non-profit organizations that have a religious purpose, and that primarily employ and provide services to followers of that faith, are exempt from these requirements. The purpose of Catholic hospitals and colleges, however, is to provide health care and education. They do so without consideration of their patients’ and their students’ faith, and they employ a large number of both Catholic and non-Catholic workers. That is why they are not exempt, but this does not violate anyone’s religious liberties. While the Catholic Church is opposed to all forms of artificial contraception, most US Catholics are not. One study found that 98% of sexually active Catholic women, and 99% of all sexually active women in the US, have used some form of contraception banned by the Church. As Jodi Jacobson, Editor-in-Chief of the reproductive health and justice website RH Reality Check further notes: nothing in the Affordable Care Act requires the Catholic Church to dispense birth control. Nor does it require Catholic women to use birth control. It only requires that Catholic hospitals and institutions offer an insurance plan that covers it. Women working at large Catholic institutions should be entitled to the same preventive health services as those working for a secular company like Boeing or Google, and the public seems to agree. According to a recent survey 71% of all likely voters (and 77% of Catholic women voters) support the contraceptive coverage provision of the Affordable Care Act.” – Dr. Sean Philpott, Director of Research Ethics for the Bioethics Program of Union Graduate College-Mt. Sinai School of Medicine.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1348748823900</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 08:27:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348752473820-15</Id><Topic><Title>The Dictator</Title><Username>pinhighshot</Username><Timestamp>1348674712836</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 11:51:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ed Schultz Host, MSNBC's 'The Ed Show' Posted: March 23, 2011 05:30 PM Why I Support President Obama's Decision to Invade Libya "The president of the United States, Barack Obama, deserves the benefit of the doubt and our support in his decision to use military force in Libya."

They don't want a government or religions that accept homosexuality, promiscuity, public lewd behavior and all the other things that come with liberalism. They overreach in insisting that the government control all of these things, but they don't want them in their society. When you look at history, most failed dynasties failed as they became more and more liberal. The more they moved to accept previously shunned activities as now acceptable and allowed the people to do pretty much as they pleased, regardless of the complaints, they failed. We are failing and soon, with or without Obama will fall even farther, but with Obama we will simply reach to point of failure sooner.</Msg><Username>texlec</Username><Timestamp>1348754943780</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 10:09:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348757314282-17</Id><Topic><Title>Thank you President Obama, you have saved America !!!</Title><Username>jbhdallas2000</Username><Timestamp>1348715702143</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 23:15:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm president obama and I approve this message.

Previously shunned activities? You mean like slavery, women’s suffrage, poll taxes, child-labor, civil rights, etc.? So you’re saying that you don’t want people to do “pretty much as they please”? Again, do you mean like those pesky inalienable rights, like Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.

(One would think that should be billion, not trillion, but, hell, I’ve had about a gazillion over the years – they stopped coming when I kept saying, “Fock the comic book – where’s your Fuller Brushes.”) But, hey, think about this… if those people spent that 1.5 Trillion hours at minimum wage of around 7 bucks an hour, at 10 Trillion plus dollars, we’d knock out two-thirds of the National Dept just from the contributions of the Waitresses.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1348779589744</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 16:59:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348779904430-30</Id><Title>"...harvest them at a significant profit."...</Title><Msg>My, oh My, oh My!

Maybe he has new handlers. He's saying all the right things. On top of that Bami is being shown to be a real truth stretcher. His lies are unraveling on the Ambassador. Then, the simple, but very effective pic of da bomb+, from that Israeli dude. Barry is golfing, hanging, chilling, but doing very little important Presidente stuff. The stuff that we hired him to do. Even his poll number overinflation is coming back to bite him. It has caused Conservatives to kick it up a notch. I really respect that toe sucking dude, ex Clinton brain, Dick Morris. He thinks that Bami is 7 points down. Morris is smelling landslide, in Mitt's favor.

(???) Scary stuff from The Irish Festival of Potatoes ‘N’ Your Shorts “N” Desultory Fashion! Drivel - to talk stupidly and carelessly; to let saliva dribble from the mouth (drool; nonsense) Jon – if I’m not mistaken, the replacement refs, in a last bit of dignity, just whistled you, and the Far Right, for a double-drivel. Our ball, with the clock showing far less time than you need for a comeback. Remember, Dewey was the Republican. I witnessed the President yesterday in Kent. I’ve seen a lot of things, from The Beatles in a small venue (Forest Hills Tennis Stadium, August, ’64) to The Eagles in the 200 seat Oxford Polytechnic Gymnasium on their initial road trip to England, Fall of ’72…I’ve seen Preachers and Teachers, and for you angry folks, Leechers. I’ve seen birth and death and war and peace. It all matters little. It’s not where you’ve been…but where we’re goin’!” This guy is the real deal. The atmosphere was absolutely electric…the crowd totally psyched. Yeah, this IS Kent, but, we emanate a lot of learning from here…and a lot of healing. The President was as inspirational a person as I’ve ever witnessed, and I’ve witnessed my share. Then get to the plan…that’s where it’s at. If you think Mitt provides that type of inspiration to YOUR values, by all means, vote for him. I’m searching for a Romney campaign stop where he relates to real people. While I, personally, don’t see that, there’s no shame in voting your beliefs.
