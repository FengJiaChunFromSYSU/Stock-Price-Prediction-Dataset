As long as you live on the government plantation all rights, liberty and freedom will be endowed by the plantation owners in Washington D.C.. If you could just learn how to be a good slave, then the government will: o Give you free healthcare (because a healthy slave is a happy slave) o Give you free food o Give you free housing o Give you free education o Give you free protection from bad people o Give you your hearts desire All a good slave has to do is: o Give up the notion of individual freedom o Give up the notion of freedom that is endowed by our creator o Give up the notion of personal property o Give up the notion of free speech that is not sanctioned by the plantation owners o Give up the notion of family unless it meets the standards of the plantation owners o There are many more, but you get the point The real point is, life can be good on the government plantation if you will accept the inevitable, lay back and enjoy the fruits of being a good slave. If you persist in this outdated, obsolete notion of personal freedom and individual rights, then you will have to suffer the consequences. I know that now that I have accepted my "life among the lowly", I have a new appreciation of how great the plantation owners are, and how wonderful my life will be if I just give up a little freedom here and a little liberty there.

We are not talking about banning guns. We are talking about reasonable restrictions. What you need to explain is why reasonable restrictions on gambling or alcohol is fine, but a reasonable restriction on assault weapons, that you support, results what is best characterized as a hissy fit? The reason to ban assault rifles is simple: They have become the weapon of choice for mass shootings. They are being bought and diverted to drug cartels and criminal gangs in large quantities. Law enforcement agencies around the country have asked for this ban. The government of Mexico has asked for this ban. The usefulness of this weapon to citizens pales in comparison to its use by criminals and psychopaths.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1359473750280</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 10:35:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359473813954-10</Id><Topic><Title>Well folks it's official, the second amendment has been deemed obsolete</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1359433775667</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 23:29:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Your post is almost unbelievably biased.

Yes, there are regulations around many of the other things mentioned, but not a 'BAN' on their purchase or use. There is a difference, but apparently it is invisible to over reactive liberals.

You're a supporter of our current AG, why don't you trust that his department or even local justice departments can get to the truth. After all you and your loud mouth President have already told us that they know the system and which laws to prosecute and which to ignore, so surely something as simple as a shooting can be resolved equitably. Again, it is not about the type of weapon, but the RIGHT, by the Constitution to own a weapon. If that RIGHT is not permissible, then change the Constitution.

It would probably be fake anyway….if you still think that Obama's father was from Kenya…” – wilkes Oh, you can’t? I’m shocked! Oh, I get it. More birther nonsense from you losers. What a great strategy. You obviously learned nothing from the election. Perhaps you’ll show us something about the 450 million rounds of ammunition then…would that be okay? “However, his actions in supplying arms to the Brotherhood to overthrow Egypt, Libya, and Syria.” Really? So you were a big fan of Moammar Khadafi, Assad and Murabak, were you? Funny, their citizens seem to disagree with you, but, hey, your fellow citizens disagree with you here, also, and you could care less. “However, his actions in supplying arms to the Brotherhood to overthrow Egypt, Libya, and Syria makes me more than suspicious. The 450 million rounds of military ammunition that FEMA bought were undoubtedly siphoned off to the Brotherhood.” Oh, yes, the FEMA brown shirt emails and other conspiracy garbage. So, look here, wilkes. You nutballs have been here for some time now defending the NRA, as though they were the Gospel you follow. If I could show you what they have already said about your latest accusation about the 450 million rounds, would you kindly then #$%$ and go back under your rock, perhaps even, for once, admitting that you don’t know you’re a#s from your elbow – and that all you do is pass along silly, spammed, email #$%$ sent to gullible buffoons like you and jon? Okay, goofy, here you go, then: “DHS has indeed ordered hundreds of millions of rounds of ammunition. But there is less here than meets the eye. And that’s according to the National Rifle Association and the office of Republican Congressman Lynn Westmoreland of Georgia. The Department of Homeland Security recently contracted to buy up to 450 million rounds over the next five years. But DHS was making a first-time bulk order for all of its law enforcement agencies to save money. Those agencies include the Secret Service, the Transportation Security Administration and U.S. Customs and Border Enforcement, among many others. The NRA describes the assertion as ‘incendiary.’ It says the suggestion that the Obama administration is ‘preparing for a war with the American people’ displays ‘a lack of understanding of the law enforcement functions carried about by officers in small federal agencies.’ The NRA, which is no fan of the Democratic president, concludes that ‘there is no need to invent additional threats to our rights’.” That’s your beloved National Rifle Association calling your boorish behavior “incendiary” and telling you to shut up, grow up and man up. Is there anything else that you could do that would make you look any goofier? “Will 20 thumbs up on this post qualify me for the $100,000?” Well, no, but it WOULD go pretty far in convincing everyone that you’re simply a multi-aliased doofus with no life, who, incidentally, is not at all good as a cubicle message board troll. Debating ignorant folks like you is like shooting fish in a barrel – on full auto. So, all kidding aside - which charity gets your 10 bucks? Is that credit, debit or valuable ivory from jon’s stash? This board just gets wackier and wackier…</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1359485734273</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 13:55:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359485783660-30</Id><Title>The last time T climbed to $40</Title><Msg>It started from about this level near the end of February 2008 and reached $40 about the middle of May.

That is just routine business for AT&amp;T and could not cause a 2% rise in the stock price. I think it is programed trading resulting from the Stochastic turning up and the stock price moving above the 50 DMA. Many computer programs use these as buy triggers. There have been over a dozen trades in the 100,000 share range which indicates computers are involved.</Msg><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1359487365817</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 14:22:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359489436264-34</Id><Topic><Title>Well folks it's official, the second amendment has been deemed obsolete</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1359433775667</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 23:29:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"if you still think that Obama's father was from Kenya it is clear that you have not bothered to review the evidence" I'm still waiting to hear from Trump's people.

The rest of the stochastics and moving averages, Bollinger Bands, etc., etc, always have some bearing i suppose, but out of nowhere comes a big move. Not much to explain today's nice move. It's good for us investors who risk capital on the stock instead of playing the casino game that you seem to favor. Not meant disrespectfully, if that is your game Wilky. I just don't care to see gambling used to manipulate stock prices. You are small spuds in the contrivances of stock prices with futures anyway and I'm sure you get some kick out of your weekly contract betting. It's a nice hobby and beats Vegas odds as well with all your strategies. I just wish investing was done the old fashioned way. I put my money where my mouth is. I bought the actual stock and enjoy the decent dividend it gets. Fortunately, I don't need the div's and they are being used for other purposes and eventual inheritances. So if you single handedly screw things up with your weekly betting game, you mess up the future of my grandkids...</Msg><Username>davemartin74575</Username><Timestamp>1359489498583</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 14:58:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359490237039-36</Id><Title>The troll that everyone entertains</Title><Msg>Why in God's name would you respond to a troll and a lunatic named ecMO .His sole purpose is to instigate argument...not seek solutions .

What do you think? Every time some delegate from some county does something stupid somewhere in America it has to make the front page for a month? Only if he's a "lib dem", eh? This is simple. Morrissey will never be elected outside of his county. Sarah Palin was almost VP of the entire country. Todd Akin chaired the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology. See the difference? I don't expect there to be zero nutjobs in the world. The T message board provides ample evidence of that. I do expect the people elected to positions of national leadership to not be nutjobs.
