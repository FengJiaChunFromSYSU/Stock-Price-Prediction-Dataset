And why is socialism in quotation marks? And when are you going to buy a dictionary? And because you spell it “Barko-Lounger”, it looks like your puppy just relieved himself on your Barcalounger. (Is that the one with the built in beer cooler?) Okay, we get it. You’re a pistol-packin’, macho, gun-show-attending, nutball who insists the NRA and their anti-gun legislation stance is strictly to preserve your second amendment rights, with no other conflicts of interest guiding their motives (despite an overwhelming number of their own members disagreeing with them on the issue.) Okay, let’s take a look at The NRA and those fine folks running the show. “For much of its more than 140-year history, the National Rifle Association promoted gun ownership shooting, and hunting as good, clean, constitutionally-protected fun. That changed in the past four decades as the NRA transformed into a hardline group closely allied with the gun industry and the conservative establishment whose only solution to gun violence is ever more guns.” – Dave Giolson, 4/10/13 An ABC/Washington Post published in January revealed that 86 percent of gun-owning households support a law requiring background checks to close the “loopholes” so prevalent today. Remember these are gun owners, many of whom are actual members of the NRA. So what motivates NRA leaders to remain so out of step with their constituency, flatly rejecting any discussion of legal reform? Well, gee, let’s think about it. Oh, right, they have some serious connections to the nearly 12 billion dollar gun industry. If you don’t believe that, check out some of the insiders who are either on the Board of Directors, or on the nominating committee which controls who can be on the board. David Keene - The current NRA president is the former chairman of the American Conservative Union. In 2003, his son was sentenced to 10 years in prison for firing at another driver during a road rage incident. George K. Kollitides II – He’s the chief executive of Freedom Group – which made the Bushmaster military style assault rifle which was used in the Newton Massacre. And get this…he has previously failed to get elected to the Board of Directors several times, but he was appointed (no one will say how) to the nominating committee which controls who gets elected. Roger K. Bain - a licensed federal firearms dealer in Pennsylvania (also “appointed” to the nominating committee. Ronnie G. Barrett - Founder of Barrett Firearms, and inventor of the .50 sniper rifle, which can penetrate armor from more than 4,500 feet and is legal for civilian purchase in 49 states. Robert K. Brown – Founder of Soldiers of Fortune magazine, read by mercenaries and gunmen-for-hire world-wide. Then, you’ve also got public luminaries like the following upstanding citizens who are, as hard as it is to believe, also on the Board of Directors of The NRA: Larry Craig - The former Idaho senator sponsored a 2005 law protecting gun manufactures from liability in connection with their products being used by criminals. He is, of course, more famous for his stall escapade in a Minnesota Airport restroom. Ted Nugent – Nutball rock star, who at the NRA's 2012 annual conference announced, "If Barack Obama becomes the next president in November again, I will either be dead or in jail by this time next year," leading to an impromptu meeting with the Secret Service. Really, Ted, you need to grow up. Grover Norquist – President of Americans for Tax Reform, and originator of “the pledge”. After the Newton massacre, he stated, "We have got to calm down and not take tragedies like this, crimes like this, and use them for political purposes." Wayne A. Ross - In 2009, Sarah Palin nominated the former NRA vice president to be Alaska's attorney general, although he did not get the position because of homophobic and sexist comments. Oliver North – Iran Contra conspirator who should know something about arms from his illegal dealings in selling them to Iran to fund the Contras. He also diverted a million dollars to his pal, Manuel Noriega. Marion Hammer – Originator of Florida’s “Stand Your Ground” law. Jon, you’re well represented by some very like-minded individuals. Unfortunately, you’re all way out of step with most of America. And this from The Onion, in 2005: The Onion – 300th Anniversary Issue, June 22, 2056 (small headline on front page) "Grave robbers pry valuable rifle from Charlton Heston's cold, dead hands.” OMG, jon, they’re comin’ after your guns! You should be okay, because as I recall, you said you have about 18 of them in the household for just you and your dog. Didn’t they tell you when you bought your gun-dog, jon, that gun-dogs don’t really shoot the gun?</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1365774386588</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-12 09:46:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>17</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365774940960-10</Id><Topic><Title>LBGTQ</Title><Username>it_never_rains_in_oregon</Username><Timestamp>1365599336976</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 09:08:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sorry, I didn't know those dots belonged to you ..... hope you don't mind, I only took 15 (not counting the other 5 just now).</Msg><Username>it_never_rains_in_oregon</Username><Timestamp>1365774940960</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-12 09:55:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365775704290-11</Id><Topic><Title>The NRA !!</Title><Username>zonbac98</Username><Timestamp>1365726571507</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 20:29:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"and technological SAFETY advances of MODERN FIREARMS" Unfortunately those safety advances didn't prevent someone from spraying 154 rounds into elementary school classrooms in less than 2 minutes, as Adam Lanza did in Newton.

You seem to get off on tearing down what most people say because it didn’t come from some liberal source. Because it came from Fox News and typically several other sources, it is a falsehood generated by some evil Tea Party member or follower. If Obama or someone in his government or media fools didn’t say it is simply is not true, made up, distorted meant to mislead. That sounds a lot like the Obama administration.

While in theory, yours anyway, we should pass all sorts of stupid legislation without thinking through the process, the long-term viability of the laws, the cost of enforcement and its overall effectiveness, because you 'believe' that it might save one child's life. At the same time you insist that this country is run by majority rule. If Obama get two more votes than necessary or a bill in Congress gets one more vote than necessary for a majority, then it is the will of the people. Bullcrap and you know it. Change, simply for the sake of change or to accomplish the goal of just making changes does few any favors. If we can't take the time to think through what laws we pass, we shouldn't pass any. Of course this administration is all about passing laws to solve the latest self-created 'crisis' and we must do it right now! That is stupid governing, wasteful governing, and misleading, dishonest government.</Msg><Username>winholder</Username><Timestamp>1365776984550</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-12 10:29:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365777449946-16</Id><Topic><Title>AT&amp;T on SQUAWK BOX!</Title><Username>william_jean</Username><Timestamp>1365760942756</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-12 06:02:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks for sharing</Msg><Username>walkerbrenda562</Username><Timestamp>1365777449946</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-12 10:37:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365777596155-17</Id><Topic><Title>LBGTQ</Title><Username>it_never_rains_in_oregon</Username><Timestamp>1365599336976</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 09:08:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Of course I look down on people who get their psychology information from Fox.

Believe it or not, Jon, criminals do not have gun factories. They do not make their own guns. They are entirely dependent on gun manufacturers to make guns for them. If gun manufacturers make guns with these safety devices included, then the only new guns available will have these safety devices. Guns sold since the assault weapons ban ended would still be available, but buyback and efforts to confiscate these guns from criminals would quickly reduce the number available. One thing is clear to me. Having a shoot out with AR-15s in the middle of an elementary school is not a solution.

This North Dakota family had their children snatched within 3 day of arriving in FL and can not even see or visit them now. S C A R Y. excerpts per first coast news: JACKSONVILLE, Fla. -- A North Dakota family said coming to Jacksonville was the worst decision of their life after the Florida Department of Children and Families took custody of their three young children just days into their trip. The family said their little girl was seriously sick, and doctors in North Dakota couldn't figure out what was wrong with her. So they came to Jacksonville for the specialized care, but three days into her stay at Wolfson Children's Hospital, doctors there called DCF, suspecting abuse. She said since she was born in North Dakota, the baby has been sick and underweight. So she convinced her son and daughter-in-law to bring Adrina to Wolfson for specialized care. But just three days in to their stay, the Department of Children and Families took custody of Adrina and her older brother and sister. DCF got a court order to take custody of all three children, but Rehm said she still thought she could visit them. "We went up there. They called the police and had us removed. They wouldn't tell us if she was there, if she was in another hospital, if she was dead or alive, wouldn't tell us anything," she said.</Msg><Username>lavendarsen</Username><Timestamp>1365787051942</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-12 13:17:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365787099616-31</Id><Topic><Title>The NRA !!</Title><Username>zonbac98</Username><Timestamp>1365726571507</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 20:29:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What you are saying is IF we extend background checks to cover online sales and gun shows THEN the state will own everything?

He promised: 1.) That participation in the Program would be Completely voluntary, No longer Voluntary 2.) That the participants would only have to pay 1% of the first $1,400 of their annual incomes into the Program, Now 7.65% on the first $106,000 3.) That the money the participants elected to put into the Program would be deductible from their income for tax purposes each year, No longer tax deductible 4.) That the money the participants put into the independent 'Trust Fund' rather than into the general operating fund, and therefore, would only be used to fund the Social Security Retirement Program, and no other Government program... Under Johnson the money was moved to The General Fund and Spent 5.) That the annuity payments to the retirees would never be taxed as income. Under Clinton &amp; Gore Up to 85% of your Social Security can be Taxed Since many of us have paid into FICA for years and are now receiving a Social Security check every month -- and then finding that we are getting taxed on 85% of the money we paid to the Federal government to 'put away' -- you may be interested in the following: Q: Which Political Party took Social Security from the independent 'Trust Fund' and put it into the general fund so that Congress could spend it? A: It was Lyndon Johnson and the democratically controlled House and Senate. Q: Which Political Party eliminated the income tax deduction for Social Security (FICA) withholding? A: The Democratic Party. Q: Which Political Party started taxing Social Security annuities? A: The Democratic Party, with Al Gore casting the 'tie-breaking' deciding vote as President of the Senate, while he was Vice President of the US Q: Which Political Party decided to start giving annuity payments to immigrants? AND MY FAVORITE: A: That's right! Jimmy Carter and the Democratic Party. Immigrants moved into this country, and at age 65, began to receive Social Security payments! The Democratic Party gave these payments to them, even though they never paid a dime into it! Then, after violating the original contract (FICA), the Democrats turn around and tell you that the Republicans want to take your Social Security away!</Msg><Username>sheri0527</Username><Timestamp>1365787930671</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-12 13:32:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>14</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365788339024-34</Id><Topic><Title>A White N Dakota family`s visit to FL for medical treatment</Title><Username>lavendarsen</Username><Timestamp>1365787051942</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-12 13:17:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In case you are not aware of the many reports of evil done by such federal and state agencies in this country, under the pretense of protecting citizens, do an internet search for Georgia Senator Nancy Schaefer on CPS Corruption. I read about her nationwide crusade to expose these agencies and the harm they have done to families and children. I could hardly believe what I was reading. She said children were snatched in the middle of the night by law enforcement, taken from their beds to holding areas, then passed on to foster care and not allowed contact with any family member. Even when there were reliable family members who wanted custody. She said there were even reports of 'orders' made to CPS for certain types of kids, she had heard of an order for a blonde child for example. Do the search, learn about the many such agencies the colored illegal alien and associates will no doubt strengthen in his forced health care plan. As you search you will also learn that in 2010 Senator Schaefer and her husband were found dead in a reported murder suicide. It is claimed her husband shot her and then killed himself. ALMOST NO ONE BELIEVES THAT. We live in very scary times for White folks and their families. Prepare yourself for the future, if you are White, it will not be good, you can bet on that.

Chide me all you want for not seeing what you think I should, but I do look. You don't, so why should I value your opinion? Obama did make cuts--long-term cuts to Social Security and Medicare. His projected deficit is about the same in 10 years as in the budget Rand Paul proposed. The difference is Paul guts discretionary spending now, but does nothing to trim the major drivers of spending growth. Obama tackles the major drivers of spending growth. Most importantly, though, the cuts Obama proposed are politically achievable--not pie in the sky like Paul's. Obama'a budget is a concrete, moderate proposal to deal with our deficit for the long term. But these types of statements is why I don't think you, tbfine, Paul or any Tea Brain is really worried about spending or deficits. Unless it is a cut to education or infrastructure or other discretionary spending it's not a cut to you. Larger cuts to Soc. Sec. or Medicare don't seem to count or are attacked.

Especially with the criminals in government, the majority of whom are gonna sell Whites out for good if they pass laws to legalize illegal invader aliens, tens of millions of them. Those lawbreakers and their families should be deported not rewarded. They are already rewarded though, with access to all of our entitlement programs and free education and health care for their anchor babies and also non anchor babies. They go to college while many White kids don`t. The criminals in government are behaving as though the illegal invaders are their constituents, not we the people. I think the only solution will be for Whites to form their own country. If we don`t when we are minority we are going to be like White South African farmers - slaughtered in mass while the rest of the world ignores our slaughter and genocide. IMO, I think it is possible the criminals behind the massive floods of non White immigrants to this country may have been modeling a future U.S based on South Africa where A tiny White minority is being eliminated, sometimes brutally slaughtered, while the rest of the world yawns and turns it head, almost as if saying 'you deserve it, evil Whiteys'. Look at some of other similarities in S Africa and notice that they are occurring here also. For example, the fact that we have a non White occupying the White House( who most likely is not a citizen), and the many other positions Whites are being removed from in govt. business, education etc Non White violence against Whites is already epidemic in this country AND IT IS PRETTY MUCH IGNORED. Just a few days ago a mob( 10-15 Black 'youths') severely beat an elderly White man in Jacksonville Fl, in broad daylight. Chances are those 'youths' will not be caught. This is common throughout the U.S., yet most Whites do not realize it because it`s a secret, seldom reported.</Msg><Username>lavendarsen</Username><Timestamp>1365790098262</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-12 14:08:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365791990252-40</Id><Topic><Title>The NRA !!</Title><Username>zonbac98</Username><Timestamp>1365726571507</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 20:29:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That is a #$%$ poll!

Oh, and great Americans don’t threaten the life of the duly elected President of the United States. Nutty people like you do that. “Ted has spent a lifetime of good works.” While that’s not really a sentence, we’ll give you the benefit of being in the Tea Party. So, you admire this guy, huh? “…for all his tough guy, gunslinging rhetoric, the real Theodore Anthony Nugent is, above all things, a rank coward and draft dodger. Like the presidential candidate he has endorsed, Nugent managed to avoid service in Vietnam, employing both familiar rhetoric, and describing his clever plan, in a 2006 interview with the Rutland Herald, saying… ‘… if I would have gone over there, I’d have been killed, or I’d have killed, or I’d kill all the hippies in the foxholes … I would have killed everybody,’ he told the Detroit Free Press in an interview published July 15, 1990. Fortunately, for our hero, Ted didn’t go to Vietnam. And how Ted managed to avoid the draft makes President Bush look like a war hero. In that 1990 interview with the Free Press, Nugent told about how he avoided the draft: ‘He claims that 30 days before his Draft Board Physical, he stopped all forms of personal hygiene. The last 10 days he ingested nothing but junk food and Pepsi, and a week before his physical, he stopped using the bathroom altogether, virtually living inside his pants caked with excrement and urine. That spectacle won Nugent a deferment.’ That says volumes about the character of a man who calls himself the Motor City Madman. The Detroit native went out of his way to avoid the defining experience of his generation, then has the gall to talk about how eagerly he would have killed, ‘IF’ he had served. So the 64-year-old tough guy, who said he would be ’dead or in jail’ if Obama was re-elected (we’re waiting Ted) wasn’t man enough to answer his country’s call during the Vietnam draft. That’s so #$%$ Cheney…” Oh, and he’s a great family man, as well. He has had two wives and has eight children, including three out of wedlock in two liaisons almost 30 years apart, two of which he gave up for adoption. In 1978, 30 year old Nugent began a relationship with seventeen-year-old Hawaii native. Due to the age difference they could not marry so Nugent joined her parents in signing documents to make himself her legal guardian, an arrangement that Spin magazine ranked in October 2000 as #63 on their list of the ‘100 Sleaziest Moments in Rock.’ But of course, he’s an all around good American, and the arbiter of who is, and who isn’t, a patriot…” - – 2012 Reid Report I see why you like this guy so much. Classless and ignorant, he mirrors everything you stand for. And to paraphrase Lloyd Bentsen… I worked with musicians. I know musicians.
