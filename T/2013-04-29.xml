Obama didn't write the bill (the bill originated in the Republican House), didn't hide anything (the provision is well reported), there's been no bailout (some think the risk of pension failure is higher, which may lead a future Congress to fund a bailout) and Obama is not the Messiah. He is the President. But the provision is there. It basically lets Corporations put less money into pension funds. This leads to fewer tax deductions for pension contributions. This in turn leads to higher tax revenues being collected. Which, ultimately, funds the transportation bill without raising taxes. So that is the Republican plan. Increase revenue by stealing from your pension funds. Increase payroll taxes on workers. Force your kids &amp; grandkids to bail you out later. All to keep taxes on capital gains and the wealthy low.

There is no exemption for Congress or staff. Like all Americans they will be able to remain on their employer plans. If Americans do not have access to insurance through their employer they will be able to purchase subsidized insurance for an affordable price on the new exchange or, if they qualify, get on Medicaid. This also applies to Federal employees who may not have insurance for whatever reason. Henry Chao does hope the implementation of the law will allow us to avoid a third world experience. That's because our current system is a third world system and he believes the health law will improve it. Fake ricky is a liar.

Additionally, some small businesses will have access to SHOP exchanges should they choose to use them.

All together the law reduces the deficit. Compare that to the 2012 transportation bill which weakens pensions and the increased payroll tax pushed for by Tea Brains. Which group of policies do you think really puts additional burdens on the shoulders of the hard working middle class? The hard working middle class now has access to subsidized health insurance on the exchanges instead of being entirely reliant on employers. Which is why when 2014 hits you Tea Brains are going to have a harsh reckoning over these lies you've been telling. BTW, the outreach effort was funded in the original law. After the 2010 elections, House Republicans defunded all portions of the law they could in hopes of weakening it. Now that Romney lost and the law prevailed in the Supreme Court, they have begun to re-fund most of these provisions--with a loss of two of the years built into the law for implementation. The fact is alot of Democratic-led states have taken a proactive approach to implementing the ACA while others have tried to hamstring the law. Republican Governors have begun to realize they're under the gun, and when voters see the benefits of the law in Democratic states they'll turn against the Party of NO! So they are scrambling to catch up, and that (in part) means pushing for funding grants to states for outreach.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1367259710532</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 14:21:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367259997857-21</Id><Topic><Title>Obamacare key author calls it a train wreck and will quit</Title><Username>ricky1820l</Username><Timestamp>1367113843677</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-27 21:50:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Whatever tool. 2014 is just around the corner and there is nothing you can do to prevent this Democratic law from benefiting America (which is your real fear).

How will they have insurance if they can't afford to pay for it? If they can't pay for it who will? "Savings from Medicare are from fraud prevention and savings from changes in the way we pay hospitals and doctors." We don't need Obamacare to crack down on fraud. We have always had the opportunity to stop it. Democrats look the other way when it comes to stopping Medicare fraud. By savings from paying hospitals and doctors do you mean paying the much less than it cost them to provide the service causing less doctors who will not want to work for free?</Msg><Username>ricky1820l</Username><Timestamp>1367266920956</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 16:22:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367268759743-35</Id><Topic><Title>Obama: "I AM NOT the Strapping Young Muslim Socialist I Use to Be!</Title><Username>bouch84</Username><Timestamp>1367262630171</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 15:10:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That was Tina Fey on SNL, Dolt!</Msg><Username>bouch84</Username><Timestamp>1367268759743</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 16:52:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>13</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367269107086-36</Id><Topic><Title>There aint nothing going to stick to old "Mr. Slick"</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1367073026920</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-27 10:30:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I saw a poll out there.

But I will answer your questions because I think it will be helpful to others. 1. People who currently do not have access to affordable insurance will now have access to subsidized insurance and expanded Medicaid through the exchanges. This is paid for by the mechanisms listed above. 2. Fraud in Medicare and Medicaid has been a persistent, very expensive and well-documented problem that was largely ignored until the health reform act. You are correct that we do not need health reform to crack down on fraud. However, health reform was the mechanism used by Congress to hire agents (and analytics) to crack down on fraud. The expected savings are being used to offset the cost of subsidized insurance. It's really a win-win effort. 3. By savings I mean changing how we pay for services entirely. Instead of paying for each service (e.g., each hospital admission, each surgery, each prescription) we pay for the health system to keep you healthy. The idea is for health systems to get paid for keeping you healthy and out of the hospital instead of getting paid for when you are sick and in the hospital. Right now there is no incentive for doctors or hospitals to make or keep you healthy. Indeed, the worse job they do the more they can expect to see you, the more they get paid. So we are--slowly and carefully--changing that incentive.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1367269221031</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 17:00:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367269984589-38</Id><Topic><Title>There aint nothing going to stick to old "Mr. Slick"</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1367073026920</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-27 10:30:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I love real polls from legitimate sources--not some #$%$ you made up or some online poll on Glen Beck's website.
