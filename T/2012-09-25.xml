The Republicans have turned a blind eye to the problem for years so this country would have cheap labor. Do you not understand that cheap labor comes at a price? The reason the police only write reports on crime is the Republicans cut funding for "government ' employees so cities and counties are shorthanded. Not enough police and firemen is the result of "getting the government off our backs." Obama used stimilus money to keep police, firemen and teachers on the job or things would be much worse. It is unfortunate that idiots like you do not understand cause and effect.</Msg><Username>ellerbebil2</Username><Timestamp>1348572038714</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-25 07:20:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348573894920-2</Id><Topic><Title>UN Small Arms Treaty hangs in Election Balance.</Title><Username>robfisk</Username><Timestamp>1348536427588</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 21:27:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"It is unfortunate that idiots like you do not understand cause and effect."

It’s a measure of your intellectual capacity that you would repeat it here, suggesting originality on your part. Being ignorant, lame and unable to spell puts you in a special category, and makes you an excellent mouthpiece for the side you represent. Wow, you must be some kind of rocket surgeon!

Father Frank Pavone, Pro-life advocate and National Director of Priests for Life, the provider of photos of live and aborted fetuses for your viewing pleasure. While Father Frank has apparently been exonerated of the controversial charges about his financial dealings with Priests for Life, he remains, nevertheless, a controversial political figure. Going beyond the abortion issue, he dabbled in the far right’s views on euthanasia, when he was the spiritual advisor to the side of Terry Schiavo’s family who wanted to keep her alive, despite being brain dead. He called Schiavo's husband, his attorney and the Judge in the case, “Murderers” for having the feeding tube removed. Pavone also appears on EWTN (not to be confused with ESPN)... that’s the Eternal World Television Network – you know – the one started by Mother Mary Angelica of the Annunciation. If you aren’t familiar with her, she’s the former Rita Rizzo (no relation to Ratso, one would hope) of Canton, Ohio, who originated and used to appear on this obscure cable channel. She looks like a cross between Sheriff Joe Arpaio and Woody Hayes in a habit, although with her eye patch, she could be John Wayne in True Grit. And speaking of bad habits to get into, when The Vatican ordered an investigation of her network, she turned control of EWTN over to a board of governors composed exclusively of lay people to avoid ecclesiastical control, which we all know can be even worse than the Yahoo police. She also claimed to have met the child-Jesus several times in 1995 during her missionary travel in Columbia, where a life-sized statue of the Infant of Prague, dressed in pink robe came alive, smiled and spoke to her. If you or I claimed this, we’d be put in a drunk tank, but she parlayed it into making big bucks from the naively faithful. At any rate, with such an accommodating medium available to him, Father Frank Pavone, in a controversial homily delivered on EWTN, reportedly indicated that if a person does not take steps to make abortion illegal, God would not hear that person's prayers. That’s very odd to suggest that doing nothing can cancel your connection to God. But, wait, it gets better. Pavone has also made statements comparing pro-choice politicians to terrorists.” Fake Geoff Holt, you have every right to go and support these folks if you like. Everyone should understand, however, that this event isn’t really at all about an individual’s views on the abortion issue. It is simply an attempt to misguidedly convince people that the Affordable Care Act is a subversive plot to fund abortions. And we’ve gone over that numerous times here. “The health insurance reform legislation maintains the status quo of no federal funding for abortions, except in cases of rape, incest or when the life of the woman is endangered. A federal judge recently wrote ‘the express language of the [Affordable Care Act] does not provide for taxpayer funded abortion. That is a fact and it is clear on its face’.” So, geoff, when you get arrested next week, I’ll send you a cake in jail. What do you want inside of it...a hack-saw or a coat-hanger?</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1348579532773</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-25 09:25:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348579823441-5</Id><Title>Mitt speaking at Clinton Global Intitative</Title><Msg>We could not even stand 1 year of his preaching, on and on.
