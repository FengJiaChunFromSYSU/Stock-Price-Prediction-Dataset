Hey, Mister Macho/Tough Guy… I see that you’ve spent much of the last day posting apologies to various people for spreading false information, as usual, with no validity to what you’ve posted. At least you DID acknowledge, for once, that what you’ve said is nothing but a crock, like most of your made up nonsense. So, in keeping with that process, let’s discuss cammies versus camos. You Rambo wannabees with your overzealous fondness for guns as a Freudian extension of your personal shortcomings and prowess, who hang around gun shows dippin’ snuff and sippin’ Jack, while sweating profusely with excitement, can call them whatever you want to call them. But suggesting that cammies is not a normal term for them, does nothing but reveal what a know-nothing phony you are. Are you really as stupid as you consistently demonstrate, or do you simply enjoy making a complete fool out of yourself on a daily basis? Army Times 6/4/11: “Army, Marine Corps clashing over cammies” Military DC 12/8/10: “the Marine Corps has set into motion a program for commanders in Helmand and other AOs where leathernecks are fighting to pick from their desert MarPat cammies or their woodland variants” 8/10/10 “The Navy’s Divergent Vision for New Cammies” USMCBlues DC “Digital Cammies” “USMC Marpat Digital Desert Cammies” – for sale on line Wiki: “Marpat is a digital camouflage pattern in use with the USMC…It is also known as the ‘digital pattern’ or ‘digi-cammies’ The Journal Star January 11, 2012: New Cammies Coming to the Army?

My, oh, my, jonboy. That didn’t sound at all like an apology. “…always jumping to a search engine to find ‘facts’.” Ah, yes, jon…those pesky “facts” which folks seem to consistently find you lacking. It seems reminiscent of your side’s blowout campaign loss, when Romney’s shill, Neil Newhouse, said, “We’re not going to let our campaign be dictated by fact-checkers.” Just like you, they didn’t, and they lost. Likewise, you are a loser, as well. Most rational people want factual information, not made up nonsense that you continually post here. Why is it that you folks of the “take responsibility for your actions” mantra always try to lie your way out of things when you’re caught with your hand in the cookie jar? Your repeated, silly rants about cammies were flat out wrong. Real men apologize when they’re wrong, not resort to playground taunts of “put your head in a bucket of urine.” You are extremely childish…but, hey, that’s part of your job here. Still, you’re not supposed to be continuously caught in lies. “I'm checking today on other…shots…” Have you considered Penicillin?

George Ryan is no longer Governor, he is in the big house. Of course he was replaced by Rob Blajegovitch who is...that's right, also in the big house. And Representative Jesse Jackson Jr. resigned a couple of weeks ago. That is because he is fighting being sent to...that's right, the big house. When was the last Republican Mayor of Chicago? That would be William Hale Thompson, 1927-1931. The Land of Lincoln, where our governors make our license plates. But you know what?

Americans spend $36,000,000 at WalMart every hour of every day. 2. This works out to $20,928 profit every minute! 3. Wal-Mart will sell more from January 1 to St. Patrick's Day (March 17th) than Target sells all year. 4. Wal-Mart is bigger than Home Depot + Kroger + Target + Sears + Costco + K-Mart combined. 5. Wal-Mart employs 1.6 million people, is the world's largest private employer, and most speak English. 6. Wal-Mart is the largest company in the history of the world. 7. Wal-Mart now sells more food than Kroger and Safeway combined, and keep in mind they did this in only fifteen years. 8. During this same period, 31 big supermarket chains sought bankruptcy. 9. Wal-Mart now sells more food than any other store in the world. 10. Wal-Mart has approx 3,900 stores in the USA of which 1,906 are Super Centers; this is 1,000 more than it had five years ago. 11. This year 7.2 billion different purchasing experiences will occur at Wal-Mart stores. (Earth's population is Approximately 6.5 Billion.) 12. 90% of all Americans live within fifteen miles of a Wal-Mart. You may think that I am complaining, but I am really laying the ground work for suggesting that MAYBE we should hire the guys who run Wal-Mart to fix the economy. This should be read and understood by all Americans: Democrats, Republicans, EVERYONE!! To President Obama and all 535 voting members of the Legislature: It is now official that the majority of you are corrupt #$%$: A. The U.S. Postal Service was established in 1775. You have had 234 years to get it right and it is broke. B. Social Security was established in 1935. You have had 74 years to get it right and it is broke. C. Fannie Mae was established in 1938. You have had 71 years to get it right and it is broke. D. War on Poverty started in 1964. You have had 45 years to get it right. One $trillion of our money is confiscated each year and transferred to "the poor" and they only want more. E.. Medicare and Medicaid were established in 1965. You have had 44 years to get it right and they are broke. F.. Freddie Mac was established in 1970. You have had 39 years to get it right and it is broke. G.. The Department of Energy was created in 1977 to lessen our dependence on foreign oil. It has ballooned to 16,000 employees with a budget of $24 billion a year and we import more oil than ever before. You had 32 years to get it right and it is an abysmal failure. You have FAILED in every "government service" you have shoved down our throats while overspending our tax dollars and printing phony money which robs us of the value of our savings! AND YOU WANT AMERICANS TO BELIEVE YOU CAN BE TRUSTED WITH A GOVERNMENT-RUN HEALTH CARE SYSTEM?? Folks, keep this circulating. It is very well stated. Maybe it will end up in the e-mails of some of our "duly elected" (they never read anything but maybe their Staff will clue them in on how Americans feel.) AND I know what's wrong. We have lost our Minds to "Political Correctness" !!!!!! Someone please tell me what the HELL's wrong with all the people that run this country!!!!!! We're "broke" &amp; can't help our own Seniors, Veterans, Orphans, Homeless, etc.,??????? In the last months we have provided aid to Haiti, Pakistan, and Turkey ..And now we're rebuilding Egyptian mosques???!!! Literally, BILLIONS of DOLLARS wasted, to say nothing about the handouts to ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS!!! Our retired seniors living on a 'fixed income' receive no aid nor do they get any breaks. AMERICA : a country where we have homeless without shelter, children going to bed hungry, elderly going without 'needed' meds, and mentally ill without treatment, etc,etc. Imagine if the government got out of the charity "business, " left us our tax money and we re-established local charities with our own donations! We ARE responsible for our less fortunate brothers and sisters but not through an inefficient, corrupt and unresponsive government! Look at the mess FEMA has made out of Sandy in Staten Island! Another value we have allowed our elected officials of both parties to take from us!</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1357962210113</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 22:43:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357962274284-26</Id><Topic><Title>AHQ (2)...</Title><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1357960284445</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 22:11:24 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"IF YOU CAN'T FIX IT WITH A HAMMER, YOU’VE GOT AN ELECTRICAL PROBLEM" WRITTEN BY A 21 YEAR OLD FEMALE Wow, this girl has a great plan! This was written by a 21 yr old female who gets it. It's her future she's worried about and this is how she feels about the social welfare big government state that she's being forced to live in! These solutions are just common sense in her opinion. This was in the Waco Tribune Herald, Waco , TX , Nov 18, 2011 PUT ME IN CHARGE . . . Put me in charge of food stamps. I'd get rid of Lone Star cards; no cash for Ding Dongs or Ho Ho's, just money for 50-pound bags of rice and beans, blocks of cheese and all the powdered milk you can haul away. If you want steak and frozen pizza, then get a job. Put me in charge of Medicaid. The first thing I'd do is to get women Norplant birth control implants or tubal ligations. Then, we'll test recipients for drugs, alcohol, and nicotine. If you want to reproduce or use drugs, alcohol, or smoke, then get a job. Put me in charge of government housing. Ever live in a military barracks? You will maintain our property in a clean and good state of repair. Your home" will be subject to inspections anytime and possessions will be inventoried. If you want a plasma TV or Xbox 360, then get a job and your own place. In addition, you will either present a check stub from a job each week or you will report to a "government" job. It may be cleaning the roadways of trash, painting and repairing public housing, whatever we find for you. We will sell your 22 inch rims and low profile tires and your blasting stereo and speakers and put that money toward the "common good.." Before you write that I've violated someone's rights, realize that all of the above is voluntary. If you want our money, accept our rules. Before you say that this would be "demeaning" and ruin their "self esteem," consider that it wasn't that long ago that taking someone else's money for doing absolutely nothing was demeaning and lowered self esteem. If we are expected to pay for other people's mistakes we should at least attempt to make them learn from their bad choices. The current system rewards them for continuing to make bad choices. AND While you are on Gov't subsistence, you no longer can VOTE! Yes, that is correct. For you to vote would be a conflict of interest. You will voluntarily remove yourself from voting while you are receiving a Gov't welfare check. If you want to vote, then get a job.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1357962274284</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 22:44:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357962407951-27</Id><Topic><Title>AHQ (3)...</Title><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1357961091198</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 22:24:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why do supermarkets make the sick walk all the way to the back of the store to get their prescriptions while healthy people can buy cigarettes at the front. Why do people order double cheeseburgers, large fries, and a diet coke. Why do banks leave vault doors open and then chain the pens to the counters. Why do we leave cars worth thousands of pounds in our driveways and put our useless junk in the garage. EVER WONDER ... Why the sun lightens our hair, but darkens our skin? Why can't women put on mascara with their mouth closed? Why don't you ever see the headline 'Psychic Wins Lottery'? Why is 'abbreviated' such a long word? Why is it that doctors call what they do 'practice'? Why is lemon juice made with artificial flavouring, and dishwashing liquid made with real lemons? Why is the man who invests all your money called a broker? Why is the time of day with the slowest traffic called rush hour? Why isn't there mouse-flavored cat food? Why didn't Noah swat those two mosquitoes? Why do they sterilize the needle for lethal injections? You know that indestructible black box that is used on airplanes? Why don't they make the whole plane out of that stuff?! Why don't sheep shrink when it rains? Why are they called apartments when they are all stuck together? If flying is so safe, why do they call the airport the terminal? Now that you've smiled at least once, it's your turn to spread the stupidity and send this to someone you want to bring a smile to (maybe even a chuckle)...in other words, send it to everyone. We all need to smile every once in a while.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1357962407951</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 22:46:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357962477431-28</Id><Topic><Title>AHQ (final)...</Title><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1357961099977</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 22:24:59 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hillary takes on new mus.lim name terrorist activity has caused the democrats to take measures in order to protect their candidate for the 2016 presidency. for security reasons, they have suggested that hillary have a mus.lim name. so from now on, please refer to her by her new mus.lim name: seldom bin layed</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1357962477431</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 22:47:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357965341754-29</Id><Topic><Title>AHQ (final)...</Title><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1357961099977</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 22:24:59 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A knight and his men return to their castle after a long hard day of fighting. "How are we faring?" asks the king. "Sire," replies the knight, "I have been robbing and pillaging on your behalf all day, burning the towns of your enemies in the west." "What?!" shrieks the king. "I don't have any enemies to the west!" "Oh, no..." says the knight. "Well, you do now." ********************************************************* A woman meant to call a record store, but dialed the wrong number and got a private home instead. "Do you have 'Eyes of Blue' and 'A Love Supreme?'" she asked. "Well, no," answered the puzzled homeowner. "But I have a wife and eleven children." "Is that a record?" the caller inquired, puzzled in her turn. "I don't think so," replied the man, "but it's as close as I want to get." ****************************************** A man sued his wife for divorce. He told the judge,"Your honor, my wife is so immature, she barges in while I'm taking a bath and sinks all my boats!" ***************************************************************** A group of senior citizens were exchanging notes about their ailments. "My arm is so weak I can hardly hold this coffee cup." "Yes, I know. My cataracts are so bad I can't see to pour the coffee." "I can't turn my head because of the arthritis in my neck." "My blood pressure pills make my dizzy." "I guess that's the price we pay for getting old." "Well, it's not all bad. We should be thankful that we can still drive!" ******************************************************* I was trying to get my seventh-grade history class to under-stand how the Indians must have felt when they first encountered the Spanish explorers. "How would you feel,"I asked, "if someone showed up on your doorstep who looked very different, spoke a strange language and wore unusual and weird clothes? Wouldn't you be a bit scared?" "Nah," one boy answered,"I'd just figure it was my sister's date." ********************************************************************** Chiropractor Emerging from the chiropractor's treatment room, a young man said aloud in the crowded waiting room, "I feel like a new man!"

One evening, after the honeymoon, he was assembling some loads for an upcoming hunt. His wife was standing there at the bench watching him. After along period of silence she finally speaks. “Honey, I've been thinking, now that we are married I think it's time you quit hunting, shooting, hand loading, and fishing. Maybe you should sell your guns, boat &amp; airplane.” Tim gets this horrified look on his face.
