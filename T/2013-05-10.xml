I refer to the 25,000 documents that have been themselves released. I refer you to all of the evidence that has been presented and provided openly and transparently since this thing happenned. Keep in mind that Republicans in the House recently released a report claiming that every document written on State Dept letterhead, which bears Hilary Clinton's stamped signature, were documents personally signed by Clinton--a patently false lie. So many of the the things Republicans claim Clinton personally did she clearly did not. But, winholder, I will not go down a long and pointless road with you where we go over the massive volume of evidence out there only to have you deny it, as you and your ilk have done even regarding Obama's birthplace. Stop watching Fox news. Stop believing bu**sh**. Stop being such a dumba**. I cannot think for you . But what I really want to know is this. If you think Obama or Rice should be jailed for "lying" about Benghazi for what, 4 days?, then what do you think should happen to Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld and Colin Powell?

Second, you are reading too many headlines and outtakes and not paying much attention to the full story, only the MSM sound bites. I don't care what Hillary said, it is what Hillary can prove. As for as the stamped documents, it was made very clear in the CSPAN hearings that she does not sign every document on which her name appears. It was also admitted by State Department folks that some of those were actually personally approved by Hillary. There is also a significant amount of evidence that the State Department, at very high levels was asleep at the wheel before during and after this incident. No one in a position of authority has been called to task for these failures. It is still not clear who and why Rice was told to speak to things that were clearly known NOT to be the truth and with any competence, should never have been said. No one has taken responsibility for this either.</Msg><Username>winholder</Username><Timestamp>1368193740415</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 09:49:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368194107852-9</Id><Topic><Title>"What difference, at this point, does it make?"</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1367862161237</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 13:42:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What more could people want?

That was the assessment of the CIA. which was following a number of violent protests outside of US embassies throughout the Middle East--twenty to be exact. This was just one case of violence against US embassies that day, albeit the worst one by far. Secondly, Susan Rice clearly stated she was reporting a preliminary and when questions were raised about premeditation or Al-Queada involvement, she simply stated they had not yet determined that. And lastly, Rice's quote from Face the Nation: "...But soon after that spontaneous protest began outside of our consulate in Benghazi, we believe that it looks like extremist elements, individuals, joined in that effort with heavy weapons of the sort that are, unfortunately, readily now available in Libya post-revolution. And that it spun from there into something much, much more violent." "...I mean I think it's clear that there were extremist elements that joined in and escalated the violence. Whether they were al Qaeda affiliates, whether they were Libyan-based extremists or al Qaeda itself I think is one of the things we'll have to determine." What do you think she said that was a lie? More to the point, why on Earth would the Obama administration or anyone else lie about this? And, most importantly, are you going to go after Bush, Cheney, and Colin Powell for what was clearly an effort to deceive, with the intent of causing a war, over a long period of time, and with far more devastating consequences in lives and for our country?</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1368195071461</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 10:11:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368195298140-11</Id><Title>LOAD UP ON MARGIN!!!</Title><Msg>TO INFNITY AND BEYOND!!!!!</Msg><Username>marketeer1001</Username><Timestamp>1368195298140</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 10:14:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368195328964-12</Id><Topic><Title>How about this.....</Title><Username>freakedout35</Username><Timestamp>1368047080740</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 17:04:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The hearing was a farce, winholder.

Obviously the answer about calling those responsible for the attack to justice is available to you, but it’s not the one you want to hear. You want to blame this tragic loss of life on any and everyone involved with the administration. You have no interest whatsoever in the truth, only in pandering another swift boat attack to your legions of like-minded zealots. Your phony patronizing patriotism disgusts Middle America, and you and Darrel Issa’s band of clowns should be ashamed of yourselves. Below is the answer to your question about taking action against who was responsible. Now, would you kindly answer ricky’s question? It’s a fair and easily understood inquiry about your opinion on what happened at Benghazi…why must you always be so cowardly when challenged?

U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens and three other Americans died in the nighttime assault. T he FBI, working with a number of U.S. and foreign agencies, has identified about 45 persons suspected of involvement in the attack, according to law enforcement sources who spoke with NBC News on condition of anonymity. Of those 45 about 25 have been identified, they said. “We are seeking information about three individuals who were on the grounds of the U.S. Special Mission when it was attacked,” it said in a short post accompanying the photos. “These individuals may be able to provide information to help in the investigation.”</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1368202029194</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 12:07:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368202783622-18</Id><Topic><Title>The ONE Nasty T-board TROLL !!</Title><Username>echo.2l65</Username><Timestamp>1368155388152</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 23:09:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Are you hungover, embarrassed or both?

He wasn't exactly known for his zest for oversight By Anthony Clark (See complete story at Salon, Thursday, May 9th, 2013 How seriously should Americans take Issa’s hearing and claims? For almost four years, I worked in close proximity to him, first on the Democratic staff of the Oversight Committee (when he was ranking member) and then as legislative director for a senior member of the committee, when he was chairman. Here’s what I learned: If Darrell Issa says something – based on the record, his statements and my personal observations of him up-close – there is a strong likelihood it will be baseless and easily disproven. Others have covered many aspects of his story. They have written about his alleged misdeeds, before and after he entered Congress. They have ably discussed Issa’s illegal disclosure of wiretaps; his irresponsible release of sensitive unredacted State Department documents; his political misuse of official funds; his use of his public office for personal gain; his inability to be honest about his own military service record; his treatment of his private business partners; his youthful (and not-so-youthful) experimentations with borrowing other people’s cars without permission; his failed attempt to recall and succeed Gray Davis as governor of California (and his Boehner-esque acceptance of his failure); his characterization of the Sept. 11 attacks as “simply a plane crash”; and his disregard for tradition, House rules and plain decency in the selection of Democratic Minority witnesses… …Observing him, it quickly became clear that, like all bullies, Issa is not prepared to fight. He counts on his opponents to back down. His M.O. is to make outrageous, unsubstantiated claims, follow them with a lot of bluster, and then quietly fold at the first sign of being challenged. And here’s his “tell”: The more bombastic he is, the more he hungrily seeks out the cameras, the more he promises “explosive revelations,” the less he actually has. Bullies don’t win fights; they win defaults. Push back just the tiniest bit, and it’s all over.

A reporter, from ABC, if I recall correctly, has copies of many previous drafts of the now infamous talking points and with notes by State Department staff about some of the reason for the rewrites. It is not looking good for this administration. Still no one will share any comment about the physical whereabouts of the President during all of this, but considering that the SOS does not have the authority to move the military around and someone twice gave 'stand down' orders to the military. A bit strange don't you think? More will come out of this but unfortunately they will circle the wagons and the only consequence to anyone will be some loss of momentum for Hillary's 2016 bid for office. Not much a sacrifice for the loss to four lives and the political embarrassment to the US. Echo, if slamming statements for a 'former' staff member is the most damaging thing you can find, you're not looking very hard and certainly not looking at the records, comments and acts of dishonesty and shameless stupidity committed by so many other members of Congress. Nice try but this bit of political deflection won't fly.</Msg><Username>winholder</Username><Timestamp>1368209262403</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 14:07:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368209381074-30</Id><Topic><Title>Darrell Issa Nutball...</Title><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1368203030221</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 12:23:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This is a witch hunt and the witch is Hillary Clinton.

And tell your pal wilkes, that I did not attack Issa, but merely passed on words from someone who knew him well. I will, if you like, however. Mr. Issa, who has been charged with car theft, not once but twice, is now the richest man in Congress. He also was a high school dropout who later got his GED, and eventually a degree from a satellite campus of Kent in Stark County. Even with all his money, Issa couldn’t buy a Senate seat, so he settled for the House, where he’s undergone several ethics complaints. You guys really know how to pick guys to represent you.

We’re hearing that the Libyans have arrested people. They’re saying that some people involved were from outside the country, that there might have even been Al Qaida ties. What’s the latest information? MS. RICE: Well, Jake, first of all, it’s important to know that there’s an FBI investigation that has begun and will take some time to be completed. That will tell us with certainty what transpired. But our current best assessment, based on the information that we have at present, IS THAT IN “FACT”, WHAT THIS BEGAN AS, IT WAS SPONTANEOUS — not a premeditated — response to what had transpired in Cairo. In Cairo, as you know, a few hours earlier, there was a violent protest that was undertaken in reaction to this very offensive video that was disseminated. CBS’s “Face the Nation” MS. RICE: So we’ll want to see the results of that [FBI] investigation to draw any definitive conclusions. But based on the best information we have to date, WHAT OUR ASSESSMENT IS AS OF THE PRESENT IS IN “FACT” WHAT BEGAN SPONTANEOUSLY IN BENGHAZI as a reaction to what had transpired some hours earlier in Cairo where, of course, as you know, there was a violent protest outside of our embassy– –sparked by this hateful video. But soon after that spontaneous protest began outside of our consulate in Benghazi, we believe that it looks like extremist elements, individuals, joined in that– in that effort with heavy weapons of the sort that are, unfortunately, readily now available in Libya post-revolution. And that it spun from there into something much, much more violent.</Msg><Username>winholder</Username><Timestamp>1368214175089</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 15:29:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368215206584-46</Id><Topic><Title>Darrell Issa Nutball...</Title><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1368203030221</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 12:23:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"But our current best assessment, based on the information that we have at present, IS THAT IN “FACT”, WHAT THIS BEGAN AS, IT WAS SPONTANEOUS" You have got to be #$%$ kidding me.

Yes now we find out that the changes to the so called "talking points" were not made for the purpose of security, or clarity as we were told. No the real reason was expressed IMHO best in an email to officials at the White House and the intelligence agencies from State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland when she took issue with including information about the real reasons and causes for the attacks was because it “could be abused by members [of Congress] to beat up the State Department for not paying attention to warnings, so why would we want to feed that either? Concerned …” And there you have it, the true enemies (according to Ms. Nuland) are the congressional members and that is why the real reasons and real perpetrators must be hidden from the American people (at least and until after the presidential election in November). Most historians agree that the real reason that President Nixon had to leave office had little to do the Watergate break in, and more to do with the cover up that occurred after the break in.
