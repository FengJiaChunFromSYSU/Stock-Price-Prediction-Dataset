What!?! You jump from a discussion about language to race? What does language have to do with race? Sheesh, you are such a racist and you don't even know it. "Throughout history, liberalism has lead to the downfall of many empires and great civilizations as it will the United States and democracy if we continue present trends. Our current leader is a narcissist that thinks he was sent to save the world, not just the U.S. while not having the leadership skills to run a mid-sized company, let alone a nation. His desire is to fundamentally change this country if we want it or not because he has a vision of 'fairness' that is incompatible with reality." And I rest my case. Orwell did not write about grammar. He wrote about the passive voice, banality and buzzwords. There is not one meaningful statement in that entire paragraph. It is precisely the style of writing and thinking Orwell condemned. Read the essay. It is called "Politics and the English Language," George Orwell, 1946. It is freely available on the internet.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1356702715587</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-28 08:51:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356703858564-4</Id><Topic><Title>Why is Obama Giving 17 Fighter Jets to the brotherhood?</Title><Username>robfisk</Username><Timestamp>1356619460727</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 09:44:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"W decreases taxes, mostly for the rich," Really!

Conservative bloggers use these phrases to dull your thinking. Who are the D.C. 1 percent? Boehner? Who was the D.C. 1 percent 5 years ago? Karl Rove &amp; K-Street? Yes, the wealthy of D.C. send their children to expensive private schools. As you noted, Sidwell Friends School does not discriminate by political affiliation. Bloggers use the D.C. 1 percent to obscure the fact that Romney and his staff would have sent many of their children to this Quaker school as well. Who are the great unwashed? American voters. But you don't want people to realize that is who you are talking about, do you? I can spot BS like this because I have, over the years, demanded precision in thinking and language. Once you begin to think about obtuse phrasing it is easy to spot. This is also why I did not see the point to your post. Rich people send their kids to private schools. So what? You *thought* your words had more meaning than they did. If you mean liberals, then say liberals. Now, compare what you wrote to Echo's post on the Barry Goldwater quote. It is as precise as it comes. What is a landslide? 61% to 38%. He only won his home state and the deep south. What does extremist mean? Even Goldwater, who's slogan you've adopted, rejects the Tea Party as too extreme. Even though he uses some language that could be used to obscure (landslide, extremist), he backs it up with precisely what he means. This is clear thinking and clear writing. Do you see the difference? Again, your intelligence or your ability to string together a bunch of fancy words in long, complex sentences are not a concern. You should think precisely and express your thoughts precisely using language of your own choosing. Even the slow and people who do not speak Ivy League English can do this. You should not merely string together a bunch of hackneyed, grand-sounding phrases you've picked up from email forwards and blogs. To wit: "Throughout history, liberalism has lead to the downfall of many empires and great civilizations as it will the United States and democracy if we continue present trends. Our current leader is a narcissist that thinks he was sent to save the world, not just the U.S. while not having the leadership skills to run a mid-sized company, let alone a nation. His desire is to fundamentally change this country if we want it or not because he has a vision of 'fairness' that is incompatible with reality." Replace the world "liberalism" with any appropriate "-ism" and that entire paragraph could be adopted by the opponents of every president since Washington without changing another syllable. It could apply to the writer himself with a few more changes. It is a completely meaningless paragraph. The mind that writes that paragraph boggles me. But it sure does sound fancy, don't it?</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1356712380719</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-28 11:33:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356714593233-12</Id><Topic><Title>Sidwell Friends School sounds like a very safe place for children</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1356558043024</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-26 16:40:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ricky, your statement "I can spot BS like this because I have, over the years, demanded precision in thinking" is laughable unless you were excluding your own thinking.

The tax cuts did affect the middle class and the increase in the earned income tax credit did affect the poor. But the marginal rate cuts and the capital gains &amp; dividend cuts mostly favored the wealthy. The deals on the table now would preserve the smaller cuts for the middle class and repeal the large cuts for the wealthy. The gold for the wealthy, peanuts for the poor tax cuts are a familiar theme in Republican tax policy. Romney's plan to lower capital gains &amp; dividend taxes to zero for those with up to $200,000 in income is a case in point. The middle class would have gotten a pittance, the wealthy a windfall.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1356716426207</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-28 12:40:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356716551675-16</Id><Topic><Title>Why is Obama Giving 17 Fighter Jets to the brotherhood?</Title><Username>robfisk</Username><Timestamp>1356619460727</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 09:44:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thank you for your service.

Never said it. You're deflecting again. I only pointed out the hypocrisy of the wealthy saying it is good to have armed guards at the schools their children attend while demeaning the idea at other schools. Please stick to the subject at hand, is that too much to ask! "Get the guns off the streets. Stop the shooting. Stop the killing." Great idea! Sell that one to the criminals. I have guns, I know many others that have guns; they aren't on the streets and they are killing people. Why? We are not that kind of people. "A giant prison population? Gotta have that. It is reflective of everything that is wrong with your way of thinking." Don't look now but it is the government that puts people in prison, they also started the war on drugs. What is your solution, set them all free because there are too many of them breaking the laws written by Congress, state and local governments? You once admonished me for saying government was the problem, not the solution. "I question the priorities of people who are willing to pay to bring guns into schools but not teachers." I too would mistrust such priorities, but they aren't mine and I never mentioned that they were. You were looking for excuses to get on your soapbox and rant, regardless of the subject being written about.

Adding in the Obamacare surcharge, therefore, if current law is enacted, this will result in an astounding tax hike on qualified dividends from 15% to 43.4%. What this means is that well-off Americans who are collecting, say, $100,000 a year in gross dividend income will keep about $57,000 next year versus $85,000 this year, a drop of 33%."

Again, winholder, I have to question the priorities of someone who looks at the privilege wealth buys in education and focuses on access to armed guards over quality education. The simple fact that you look at this situation and focus on guns is the story here. The Tea Brains supporting a program to put armed guards in every school is the hypocrisy here. Additionally, "the wealthy" are not saying anything of the sort. I assure you, Wayne LaPierre is wealthy and he said quite the opposite. David Gregory, the man, never said local school districts should not have armed guards if it meets their needs--and many do have armed guards. A program to fund an armed guard in every public school in America, however, is not a solution to the problem posed by society-wide easy access to assault rifles. Are you going to put an armed guard in every daycare too? Every showing of a Disney film? It is hard for me to view this as a serious response from the NRA. The only way to make it work is to have everyone armed everywhere and hope "the good guys" (whoever they are) are better shots and have more firepower than "the bad guys" (whoever they are). Now this is the last time I will say this. I question the priorities of people who look at inequality in our school systems and focus on access to guns. I question the priorities of people who want to cut funding for education, but will pay to put armed guards in every school. I question the priorities of people who look at our social ills and think the solution is more guns, more law enforcement and more prisons. This tragedy, and the reaction of the NRA and the Tea Brains to it, has clarified what they are all about. .</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1356729300805</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-28 16:15:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356729458802-32</Id><Topic><Title>Why is Obama Giving 17 Fighter Jets to the brotherhood?</Title><Username>robfisk</Username><Timestamp>1356619460727</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 09:44:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Communism is not coming to America through Obama, but your tone sounds a lot like fascism. Obama is a great and patriotic American, and was taught by his grandpa about values, who was a real WWII vet. Not some internet poser.Your ignorance is overwhelming, but since you know exactly what happened in Benghazi you should go up to the Pentagon and tell them. Where do these Muslim Communists live, China? Is their life any of your business? Did you "serve" to protect American freedom of religion and speech, or just your own half baked ideas of it? What's it your business what religion people like? That's how it is supposed to be in America, freedom of religion. Stop imposing your ideas on others and understand American values.</Msg><Username>peppeek</Username><Timestamp>1356729458802</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-28 16:17:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356737065305-33</Id><Topic><Title>Sidwell Friends School sounds like a very safe place for children</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1356558043024</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-26 16:40:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>... “Ok, Ricky, you're putting words in play that I never wrote, again;… When and where did I ever say such a thing?” - winholder “Oh yes, I almost forgot...yes, I think doing away with the Department of Energy is an excellent idea, along with the Department of Education and the Housing and Urban Development just for starters.” – winholder, April 20, 2012, 5:45 p.m.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1356737065305</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-28 18:24:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356742395255-34</Id><Title>What Hitler would do with Congress.....</Title><Msg>Shoot them all.
