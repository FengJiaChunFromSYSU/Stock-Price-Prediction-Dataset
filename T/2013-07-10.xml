Something might be gaining on you.”</Title><Msg>And with that we have the federal government's "Insider Threat" program where all federal employees (regardless of agency) are directed (under penalty of law for failure to comply) " to report suspicious actions of their colleagues based on behavioral profiling techniques ..." This program was mandated in an October 2011 executive order after the famous "Wiki Leaks" affair. So let me get this straight, we have Jane who works for the "endangered microbes" section of the environmental protection agency, spending a good portion of her day watching, documenting and reporting suspicious actions of her colleagues based on a behavioral profile list provided to her by her boss, and if she fails to report her colleagues based on this behavioral profile list provided to her by her boss, she will go to jail. Now some may say that this is a bad thing, but I am not one, because you see, as long as Jane is busy watching, documenting and reporting suspicious actions of her colleagues based on a behavioral profile list provided to her by her boss, she will have less time to be involved with the regulating of the lives of regular citizens, and for that I think we can all be grateful. So I for one would like to offer my thanks to our "dear leader" who truly is the gift that keeps on giving. "In your heart you know he is right."
