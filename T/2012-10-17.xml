Hey, jon, that was quite some running commentary you gave us last night. What exactly were you watching…WrestleMania? It certainly wasn’t the debate. “…all the talk is about Obama's performance being more aggressive (sic) than last time .. aggressiveness (sic) doesn't win debates .. truth &amp; believability does !!” Oh, the irony! That’s precisely (well, except for the poor spelling) what was being said about Mr. Romney after the first debate. Thanks for the Etch-a-Sketch review about your Etch-a-Sketch candidate. (Remember, that comment was courtesy of Romney's own senior campaign adviser, Eric Fehrnstrom. When asked if Romney had been forced to adopt conservative positions in the rugged race that could hurt his standing with moderates in November's general election, Fehrnstrom replied, "I think you hit a reset button for the fall campaign. Everything changes. It's almost like an Etch A Sketch. You can kind of shake it up, and we start all over again.”) Uh, sorry guys – no you can’t. It doesn’t work that way. You are what you are, and chameleons don’t win elections.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1350478657446</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 08:57:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350478984700-8</Id><Topic><Title>For Every Person Added to Labor Force, 10 Added to Those unemployed</Title><Username>geoff_holt_2001</Username><Timestamp>1350358115664</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 23:28:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>“I`ll NEVER eat at Olive Garden again” – lavender, complaining about race mixing.

Former aide to President Barack Obama Neera Tanden said that the president “really doesn’t like people” Politico reports. Tanden, now president of the Center for American Progress, told New York magazine in an article published on Sunday that Obama did not call former President Bill Clinton the first two years of his term because: “People say the reason Obama wouldn’t call Clinton is because he doesn’t like him. The truth is, Obama doesn’t call anyone, and he’s not close to almost anyone. “It’s stunning that he’s in politics, because he really doesn’t like people,” Tanden said in her interview with the magazine. “My analogy is that it’s like becoming Bill Gates without liking computers.” She said Obama renewed his ties with Clinton, who has been actively campaigning for the president, out of political expediency. “Obama engineered this reconciliation, and I think the whole time he was, like, ‘Why do I have to do this?’ ” Tanden said in the interview. “</Msg><Username>ricky1820l</Username><Timestamp>1350486616901</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 11:10:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350487132012-18</Id><Title>Spanked!</Title><Msg>Poor Mr. Magic Pants.

Yes they are. Just look at the fools they continue to send back to Congress. Congress is the real culprit in spending this country into history as the next big failure. Presidents often have stupid ideas and little clue about what the real cost of their dreams are, but Congress will pass even more stupid laws and spending on foolishness and pork that will keep this country broke for the next century. "Better to go with the devil we know and who cares than the devil who says "trust me" and will not detail any plans." The devil we have said the same things four years ago. He said we needed to join him in changing the greatest country on the planet. He made many of his changes and all you need to do is go back and look at the results. He can no longer blame Bush. This is his watch. He had full Party control of Congress for the first two years and still has the Senate but has accomplished little that has been good for the American people. "His performance last night demonstrated his lack of and could care less attitude on women's issues." Neither Presidents concern nor expectations from a TV debate for women’s issues will win or lose this election and it won't change this country or come anywhere near to solving any of our biggest problems. It is smoke that the Democrats are throwing up to hide the facts of this failed economy. How can women expect to be paid more if they can't find a job in the first place? "The debates displayed a rich guy who thinks he can buy and shout his way into an office he is so ill equip to handle." Romney has more knowledge of fiscal matters and budgets, government processes and understanding of an economy than Obama had coming into office or still has. Obama has had so many episodes of stupidity that he has had to walk back in the last three years it borders on ridiculous. He has so many failures in his administration full of tax cheats and lobbyists that he has become a joke.</Msg><Username>winholder</Username><Timestamp>1350487618283</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 11:26:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350487788467-20</Id><Topic><Title>Obama does not like people according to a former aide</Title><Username>ricky1820l</Username><Timestamp>1350486616901</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 11:10:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The debates have shown that Obama is a sour, sullen fellow</Msg><Username>geoff_holt_2001</Username><Timestamp>1350487788467</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 11:29:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350488318385-21</Id><Topic><Title>..

Yes, she is more directly responsible than the President is for day-to-day processes within the State Department but he is ultimately responsible and has yet to accept that responsibility and say, we lied, we screwed up and we didn't manage this situation well at all either before or after. I thought Billary might bail on Obama when this started. She surely doesn't want to be tied to this mess and have to explain it all again when she runs in 2016. She might have been able to save her political career had she simply said 'I cannot condone what this President is doing internationally and therefore must leave.' They have screwed this up from the start. First you don't send people into harm’s way without a way to be protected. Second, if you have, admit it, apologize, and fire those directly responsible for the screw up. Third, the buck stops at his desk even for the stupid comments and/or lies by our UN ambassador. If the intelligence apparatus was so poor that her information and the Presidents was this weak for over a week, then why hasn't someone in that chain of command been fired? Why? Because if they did fire them, they run the risk of those persons telling the truth to the media.</Msg><Username>winholder</Username><Timestamp>1350488318385</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 11:38:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350488627906-22</Id><Topic><Title>WE CANNOT AFFORD 4 MORE YEARS OF OBAMA.</Title><Username>penma1</Username><Timestamp>1350447303318</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 00:15:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>All of the major candidates for many years are beholden to or part of the NWO gang that is intent on destroying this country.

Tax free income for the wealthy!! Isn't that a grand plan! Is that your idea of tax fairness? Is that your idea of expanding the tax base? What impact will that have on the 47% who pay no tax--the people you all despise so much? This, like so many things Romney, is a plan that screws working people and the middle class. It is a tax subsidy not to the people who are building this economy through work or entrepreneurship, but to the ultra rich who squirrel their money away in offshore accounts and rest on their laurels.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1350495294952</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 13:34:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350496051701-33</Id><Topic><Title>T Yahoo Finance charts - all on one screen - for free</Title><Username>kevininthecity72</Username><Timestamp>1350486499221</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 11:08:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ok so as far as I can see this is free. i just tried it and it works pretty well</Msg><Username>itsacalabreeze</Username><Timestamp>1350496051701</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 13:47:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350496566914-34</Id><Topic><Title>WOW Awesome Romeny would not tax dividends</Title><Username>ricky1820l</Username><Timestamp>1350492924834</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 12:55:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why are you here?

With the Romney plan those making less than 200k would pay no tax on investment income. So are you saying those making less than 200K are rich? Romney’s plan would let households earning less than $200,000 a year collect capital gains, dividends and interest tax-free. That would encourage more Americans to build cash nest eggs and to own stocks and bonds above and beyond their retirement plans. Obama is going to raise taxes on everyone and every small business you can count on it. Obama is not a numbers guy and does not understand even the most elementary fundamentals of economics as evidenced in last night's debate.</Msg><Username>ricky1820l</Username><Timestamp>1350497070325</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 14:04:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350498634622-36</Id><Topic><Title>first lady</Title><Username>georgepag2001</Username><Timestamp>1350478044636</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 08:47:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>... “Sic hic old crow etc. …and the ‘H’ key is only the 5th key to the right of the ‘S’ key” – jon, fresh from his Mensa meeting Besides your efforts at humor being akin to the Ebola virus in an orphanage, you once again reveal your dim-wittedness.

How on earth do you think that helps people who earn money from work or small business profits? If Romney wants to help ME grow a nest egg, cut MY taxes. Don't lower them for the wealthy and get rid of my deductions. If you make more that $200,000 in dividends, do you get 0% tax on the first $200,000 as well?

No retained earnings.</Msg><Username>lewcor</Username><Timestamp>1350524952345</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 21:49:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350525432522-62</Id><Topic><Title>first lady</Title><Username>georgepag2001</Username><Timestamp>1350478044636</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 08:47:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ever hear what the Kenyan pays in percentage of income? Doubt it, as it is probably less than Romney. I understand his net worth now is 14 million. It took a million to get in the top 5% a few years back. What percent would you be in with 14 million? Wonder how much George Soros, the Kenyan's "massa", pays on his 5 billion he got by international currency manipulation. Wonder what Teddy "Boy" Kennedy paid on his 700 million. Doubt he paid much as most was in real estate. Must be nice to have a bootlegging father and market manipulater leave you all that money. Billionaire Democrats have it Soooonice.</Msg><Username>lewcor</Username><Timestamp>1350525432522</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 21:57:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350528588928-63</Id><Title>I'm voting for Romney</Title><Msg>My CEO told me I had to or else I would lose my job, oh well.</Msg><Username>fatty_arbukkle</Username><Timestamp>1350528588928</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 22:49:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350529698893-64</Id><Topic><Title>I'm voting for Romney</Title><Username>fatty_arbukkle</Username><Timestamp>1350528588928</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 22:49:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You are not alone, many compaines are telling their employees if Obama wins they have no choice but to lay people off in order to survive, it is the right thing to do so people can prepare and not make major purchases, much better than walking one day and be handed a pink slip. As everyone knows your vote is secret there is no way employers would know how you voted unless you let it be known. Employers are not telling their people how to vote but just letting them know what is likely to happen. You just have to look what happened the last time Obama won. In between the time it was known Obama would win and when he took office millions lost their jobs and it hasn't stopped.</Msg><Username>ricky1820l</Username><Timestamp>1350529698893</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 23:08:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
