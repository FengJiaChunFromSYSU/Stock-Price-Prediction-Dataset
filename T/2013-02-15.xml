The number of unemployed (and the unemployment rate) is estimated using the Current Population Survey. This is a survey of households. It, basically, asks individuals what they're doing with their time. The second is the Current Establishment Survey. As you may guess, it surveys establishments (businesses, non profits, schools, government agencies, etc.). This survey asks establishments to report the number of employees, hours worked, etc. It is important to note that the Current Establishment Survey ONLY captures *payroll* jobs. If you are a lawyer, consultant, sole proprietor, etc, you are not on a payroll job, so you can be employed but not show up in the payroll jobs numbers. Or vice versa. The reason the payroll jobs figure is often adjusted is because smaller establishments tend to be slower at returning responses. You can gauge how small businesses are doing compared to larger establishments by looking at the adjustments. Also, neither survey counts the institutionalized population which includes the military. So if there is a military drawdown, those don't count as payroll jobs lost but will show up as people entering the civilian workforce. Same with people going in and out of jail. So these are separate *indicators* of how the labor market is faring. They are not directly compatible measures. They work very well as indicators and estimates but are not direct measures. We expect them to move together over time--which they do--but on any given month there may be some statistical noise. The best measure we have of unemployment is the CPS. The best measure we have of payroll jobs is the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages. The QCEW is based on information provided to state UI programs but isn't available for up to a year. Historical payroll job data is updated every Feb for the year prior. A few weeks ago the data for 2011 was updated, and 2011 was a much better year for payroll job creation than the CES indicated. I hope this answers your questions. That will be $150 unless you would like to put me on retainer.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1360939529016</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 09:45:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360941722658-4</Id><Topic><Title>Unemployment statistics</Title><Username>ciscokid_1st</Username><Timestamp>1360926259345</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 06:04:19 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If that is a "simple answer" I would hate to see your complicated answer.

This is big boy stuff. You're trying to gain an overall picture of the economy, something that exists in the real world, with a usefully small group of statistics. It does not lend itself to simplicity. Look at the myriad of key statistics yahoo posts for a single stock. If you do not know the precise definitions and methods behind each statistic you could be in for a world of hurt. An entire economy is much more complex. These statistics are very reliable, but you have to understand them to use them beyond a superficial level. All you really need to know is that when the unemployment rate goes up, the labor market is bad, when it goes down, it's good. Right now, the labor market is good but has been slowly improving. Your problem comes when you try to do more, without the knowledge or capacity, or even the interest, to get a true bearing on what the numbers actually mean. It makes you prone to manipulation by hacks. Never trust anyone who tries to make the complex sound simple. It is not simple and it takes work to research and understand it.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1360943812348</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 10:56:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360944516176-12</Id><Topic><Title>The borders have "never been stronger"</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1360855760962</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 10:29:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And then there's this! The man tasked with enforcing the nation’s immigration laws should resign, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) said at a Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday. Sessions called for ICE Director John Morton’s resignation following the testimony of Chris Crane, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement deportation officer who said the Obama administration’s policies prohibit the arrest of aliens who are in the country illegally or who have overstayed their visa. “I think we’ve got a problem here,” Sessions said. “We have, as Mr. Crane has dramatically indicated, a serious unwillingness to enforce even the most basic laws.” “I think most Americans assume that ICE agents and officers are empowered by the government to enforce the law,” Crane testified. “Nothing could be further from the truth.” “With 11 million illegal aliens in the U.S., ICE agents are now prohibited from arresting illegal aliens solely on charges of illegal entry or visa overstay – the two most frequently violated sections of U.S. immigration law,” Crane said Sessions asked Crane if anyone in the Obama administration, including President Barack Obama and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, had invited ICE officers and agents to discussions on immigration enforcement and policy. When Crane said his union members had been “shut out” of discussions, Sessions called for ICE Director John Morton’s resignation. “I call for Mr. Morton to resign,” Sessions said. “I think he’s failed his fundamental duty to enforce the law and maintain the morale of the people we pay to do that job every day.” In June 2010, the National Immigration and Customs Enforcement Council 118, of which Crane is the president, and its affiliated council leaders across the country, cast a unanimous 259-0 vote of no confidence in Morton.</Msg><Username>bouch84</Username><Timestamp>1360944516176</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 11:08:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360944991549-13</Id><Topic><Title>The borders have "never been stronger"</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1360855760962</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 10:29:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>When was the last time you were out of your basement?

The condition is that there are still more people out of work than when Obama took office. There are new people entering the employment-desired world daily, yet those who lost jobs before those folks even entered the job market are still unemployed. The rate at which this administration claims it is 'creating' new jobs isn't keeping up with a pace of reemploying those put out of work let alone any new entrants to the job market. The work force is shrinking due to a lack of job opportunities. The job market is shrinking even faster, particularly when you consider the new entrants. In reality the only jobs government can ‘create’ are government jobs and the measurements are in large measure those of private industry jobs. There are more people out of work on a percentage basis than even in our recent history, but when you don't count those out of work past their benefits, the number don't appear as frightening as they really are.</Msg><Username>winholder</Username><Timestamp>1360945680137</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 11:28:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360946038474-15</Id><Title>Maybe it's time for the US to embrace and enact immigration laws that mirror those of Mexico</Title><Msg>After a brief review of the progressive immigration laws of Mexico. IMHO most US citizens would probably say that if US laws were similar and enforced there would not be an issue between the two countries or its citizens. Just a little summary: o As of November 9, 2012 no one will be granted residency from within the country of Mexico. This means that if a non-citizen wants a residency status (i.e., temporary or permanent residency) he or she will need to apply at a Mexican consulate outside of the country of Mexico. o Temporary Resident - The Temporary Resident document will be issued for periods from 1-4 years, based on the decision of the immigration authority. o Permanent Resident - Permanent Resident status includes expressed permission to work in Mexico, but changes in employer and updates of activities are required. o Eligibility for either of these resident status types requires the applicant to meet various criteria (as identified by the Mexican government) before entering the country. o Penalties - If you are caught performing unauthorized activities your document can be cancelled and you can be asked to leave the country I know that there are a lot more details in the actual regulations, but again IMHO, if the US would enact similar laws and enforce them (like the Mexican government does), then there should not be an issue between our two countries or their citizens.

To determine the Obama impact the calculations should be from Obama's first day in office to your last counting day. Depending upon the utilization of private and public sector jobs the individual doing the counting will come up with either 1.2 or 1.9 million jobs gained. Factually that is not a full indicator of unemployment, or what economists would call real unemployment. Add the people discouraged from seeking work and new entrants, and the wage differential between jobs gained and lost, one finds the picture a bit bleak. Further take presidential positions out of it and look to the real generators, or losers - Congress and one sees a far different picture. Obama and the Democrats have not been good for the country over the last four years, and neither have the Republicans. little ricky spins the demo lobbyist tags. Anyone looking at the full picture has nothing to brag about. Obama is a failed leader as are the Repubs. Those blaming a significant minority - the tea party - are trying to cover up both parties failures.</Msg><Username>dan2003hr</Username><Timestamp>1360954747322</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 13:59:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360954791900-22</Id><Topic><Title>The borders have "never been stronger"</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1360855760962</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 10:29:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You mean we should just do whatever Chris Crane say?

We can’t change the effects of the inattention and outright corruption of past poor governmental actions, but surely with all the education and intelligence in this country, we can prevent history from repeating itself almost immediately.

You simply entered the country using paperwork you know was obtained illegally. And now you can add conspiracy to the list of charges. It doesn't matter what the US State Dept. thinks.
