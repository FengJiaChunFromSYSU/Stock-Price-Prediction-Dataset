Combine that with a 5% dividend and an investor is getting greater than a 10% return projected to year end. Performance seems pretty solid to me as an investor.

So glad I bought it thanks. We, thanks to the dems here will soon have the highest gas tax in America. This is an embarassing day for America. Obama. despite the aquittal of George will not give him his gun back. Also, there is a snitch line being established to get the goods on Zim. Obama knows it will go nowhere, but he and Holder have to do something besides telling more lies. Obama is about to go to Martha's Vineyard, and they can kill young black men till the sun don't shine, but nothing will stop him &amp; Mouchelle from living large off of the taxpayer. So when Bami stirred the pot today, he lowered the Office of the Presidenct a little lower, saying 35 years ago he could have been Travon. Bami makes this thug seem so innocent. Barrack knows all this from that communication recording agency he has on Tray. He knows that Tray had a facebook page where he detailed his life of crime, that has since been taken down. So these lies serve one purpose to silence my Brother Travis Smiley. You are right Travis, this guy despite being the first Black President has hurt our people. Just wait till he is successful in legalizing all the illegals. Obummer should be impeeched Monday morning for trying to incite an uprising. We must end the civils rights industry that is being hawked by Jessie &amp; Al.</Msg><Username>robfisk</Username><Timestamp>1374268524040</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 17:15:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374277823152-18</Id><Topic><Title>Zimmerman Acquitted</Title><Username>geoff_holt_2000</Username><Timestamp>1373769095727</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 22:31:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Which Corner "Drunk Store" do you keep your 'ghetto trailer' parked behind ??

One of those 4 kids that robbed me when I was 13, did kinda look like Obama. At a local park, I was cleaning a fish .. they were very friendly at first. One asked if I had a nickel.. I replied "No, I only have a quarter" (BIG MISTAKE) .. one grabbed me from the side, one grabbed me from the back .. pinning me on a picnic table and relieving me of 75 cents and a 2 blade Boker pocket knife .. and the kid going thru my pockets looked to be about 6 or 7 yrs old. So nothing has changed since then, their peers are still teaching them young BTW, if you haven't heard .. in Ca. they're now having "BASH Mobs" in T.M's name.
