Romney is NOT generous. He is a ruthless businessman who put many people out of work. Right at the last election in Illinois he did it. While Obama saved 1000 jobs in the same town. He donates to get tax deductions, and to his Mormaon church, who don't have to pay taxes on the donations.No one ever saw Romneys full tax return for 2011, and by now it has been amended to the truth. He was afraid to show it. Solyndra started of course under Bush, and the reason it failed was Chinese dumping of solar panels. It had new superior technology destroyed by the Chinese manufacturing machine.

There's also evidence his administration specifically prioritized Solyndra manufactured unique solar panels based on cylindrical cells. In 2009, the Obama administration approved a $535 million loan guarantee that helped the company build a new factory in Fremont, Calif. It became a poster child for Obama.s stimulus efforts. But in August 2011, the factory suddenly closed, and by September the company had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The company's failure prompted an FBI raid, a congressional investigation because a major Solyndra investor was connected to a billionaire who had raised campaign cash for Obama. "No one ever saw Romney's full tax return for 2011" Maybe you never saw it but everyone else did. On Sept. 12 2012 Romney posted his full tax return on his website The complete 2011 tax return, with full schedules, statements, and attachments. It is pitiful the Obama's an Biden gave so little. They have lived their entire lives off the American Tax payer and give back so little.

What is called the "tithe" was actually a tax. The Levites were civil servants. A very few were in the temple. Little of the tithe actually went for religious purposes. The tax was based on "increase". Very similar to a capital gains tax. It had an odd variable nature from year to year but came to about 13% of "increase."</Msg><Username>lewcor</Username><Timestamp>1371179490463</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 23:11:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
