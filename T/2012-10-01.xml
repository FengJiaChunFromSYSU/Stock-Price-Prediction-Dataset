It taxed "increase". Nothing else was taxed. It is like a capital gains tax and was the same for all. They had an odd arrangement and it actually came to about 13% per year over a seven year span. The Temple only got a small part of that money. The rest went for government and military. No sales tax, no excise taxes, etc. etc, Farmland could not be bought or sold and stayed in the family. (See "Ruth") Only city property could be bought and sold. Debts could be accumulated but only ran 7 years with NO USURY. Any farm property that had been taken for debt had to be returned to the family in the Jubilee Year which came every fifty years. Interesting side. The Amish keep land in the family and have the most productive farms in the world without using any powered equipment and with natural fertilizers. Fifty years ago I read their average income from farming was $40,000 per year. They have been exempted from SS because they take care of their own and take no benefits.</Msg><Username>lewcor</Username><Timestamp>1349105464336</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 11:31:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349106009772-12</Id><Topic><Title>How Much Should The Rich Pay In Taxes ??</Title><Username>jon3retired</Username><Timestamp>1348871759337</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 18:35:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Jon, How low do you want Oprah's tax rate to be?</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1349106009772</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 11:40:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349106521927-13</Id><Topic><Title>How Much Should The Rich Pay In Taxes ??</Title><Username>jon3retired</Username><Timestamp>1348871759337</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 18:35:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So we have as our Republican proposals: 1.

THE WASHINGTON POST HITS OBAMA! Finally, the Washington Post speaks out on Obama! This is very brutal, timely though. As I'm sure you know, the Washington Post newspaper has a reputation for being extremely liberal. So the fact that its editor saw fit to print the following article about Obama in its newspaper makes this a truly amazing event and a news story in and of itself. At last, the truth about our President and his obvious socialist agenda are starting to trickle through the “protective wall” built around him by our liberal media. I too have become disillusioned. By Matt Patterson (columnist - Washington Post, New York Post, San Francisco Examiner) Years from now, historians may regard the 2008 election of Barack Obama as an inscrutable and disturbing phenomenon, the result of a baffling breed of mass hysteria akin perhaps to the witch craze of the Middle Ages. How, they will wonder, did a man so devoid of professional accomplishment beguile so many into thinking he could manage the world's largest economy, direct the world's most powerful military, execute the world's most consequential job? Imagine a future historian examining Obama's pre-presidential life: ushered into and through the Ivy League despite unremarkable grades and test scores along the way; a cushy non-job as a "community organizer"; a brief career as a state legislator devoid of legislative achievement (and in fact nearly devoid of his attention, so often did he vote "present"); and finally an unaccomplished single term in the United States Senate, the entirety of which was devoted to his presidential ambitions. He left no academic legacy in academia, authored no signature legislation as a legislator. And then there is the matter of his troubling associations: the white-hating, America-loathing preacher who for decades served as Obama's "spiritual mentor"; a real-life, actual terrorist who served as Obama's colleague and political sponsor. It is easy to imagine a future historian looking at it all and asking: how on Earth was such a man elected president? Not content to wait for history, the incomparable Norman Podhoretz addressed the question recently in the Wall Street Journal: To be sure, no white candidate who had close associations with an outspoken hater of America like Jeremiah Wright and an unrepentant terrorist like Bill Ayers, would have lasted a single day. But because Mr. Obama was black, and therefore entitled in the eyes of liberal Dom to have hung out with protesters against various American injustices, even if they were a bit extreme, he was given a pass. Let that sink in: Obama was given a pass - held to a lower standard - because of the color of his skin. Podhoretz continues: And in any case, what did such ancient history matter when he was also so articulate and elegant and (as he himself had said) "non-threatening," all of which gave him a fighting chance to become the first black president and thereby to lay the curse of racism to rest? Podhoretz puts his finger, I think, on the animating pulse of the Obama phenomenon - affirmative action. Not in the legal sense, of course. But certainly in the motivating sentiment behind all affirmative action laws and regulations, which are designed primarily to make white people, and especially white liberals, feel good about themselves. Unfortunately, minorities often suffer so that whites can pat themselves on the back. Liberals routinely admit minorities to schools for which they are not qualified, yet take no responsibility for the inevitable poor performance and high drop-out rates which follow. Liberals don't care if these minority students fail; liberals aren't around to witness the emotional devastation and deflated self-esteem resulting from the racist policy that is affirmative action. Yes, racist. Holding someone to a separate standard merely because of the color of his skin - that's affirmative action in a nutshell, and if that isn't racism, then nothing is. And that is what America did to Obama. True, Obama himself was never troubled by his lack of achievements, but why would he be? As many have noted, Obama was told he was good enough for Columbia despite undistinguished grades at Occidental; he was told he was good enough for the US Senate despite a mediocre record in Illinois ; he was told he was good enough to be president despite no record at all in the Senate. All his life, every step of the way, Obama was told he was good enough for the next step, in spite of ample evidence to the contrary. What could this breed if not the sort of empty narcissism on display every time Obama speaks? In 2008, many who agreed that he lacked executive qualifications nonetheless raved about Obama's oratory skills, intellect, and cool character. Those people - conservatives included - ought now to be deeply embarrassed. The man thinks and speaks in the hoariest of clichés, and that's when he has his teleprompters in front of him; but when the prompter is absent he can barely think or speak at all. Not one original idea has ever issued from his mouth - it's all warmed-over Marxism of the kind that has failed over and over again for 100 years. And what about his character? Obama is constantly blaming anything and everything else for his troubles. Bush did it; it was bad luck; I inherited this mess. It is embarrassing to see a president so willing to advertise his own powerlessness, so comfortable with his own incompetence. But really, what were we to expect? The man has never been responsible for anything, so how do we expect him to act responsibly? In short: our president is a small and small-minded man, with neither the temperament nor the intellect to handle his job. When you understand that, and only when you understand that, will the current erosion of liberty and prosperity make sense. It could not have gone otherwise with such a man in the Oval Office.</Msg><Username>winholder</Username><Timestamp>1349110163186</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 12:49:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349110267271-18</Id><Topic><Title>God Bless Our Christian Brother, President Obama Saved America!!!</Title><Username>jbhdallas2000</Username><Timestamp>1348889183078</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 23:26:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Best quote I have read all week...'If Senator Obama of 2008 were running against President Obama of 2012 and his record, Senator Obama would win.'</Msg><Username>winholder</Username><Timestamp>1349110267271</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 12:51:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349111241822-19</Id><Topic><Title>How Much Should The Rich Pay In Taxes ??</Title><Username>jon3retired</Username><Timestamp>1348871759337</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 18:35:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There are many charts out on the Internet, many of them issued by the government that will show that Congress has soiled this situation so badly that there is no recovery. If we raised the tax level to 80% on every one and cut spending by 40%, we could not pay our way out of the hole Congress has spent us into in the next twenty years. We can however begin to improve things, but not with this Congress or any other Congress that will not budget and will not adhere to any budget they pass. Numbers don't lie when accurately presented and analyzed. Congress ignores facts and deals in political fantasy and have high expectations that the voting public will join them...and we do. Congress seldom does a realistic review of the past or current performance of the programs they have invented; they don't do an honest job of projecting the real over-time costs. They have the collective attention span of a gnat. They are in it for what they can win today and how those actions impact their likelihood of reelection or a post election career from someone they helped while in office. Until we can cure the rampant corruption and dishonestly in Congress, it doesn't really matter who is President unless we make the foolish mistake of putting the President's Party in charge of Congress at the same time.</Msg><Username>winholder</Username><Timestamp>1349111241822</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 13:07:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349112157325-20</Id><Topic><Title>How Much Should The Rich Pay In Taxes ??</Title><Username>jon3retired</Username><Timestamp>1348871759337</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 18:35:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Oprah &amp; Romney created their industries .. which created jobs ,, which created "payroll taxes"."

Romney &amp; other bankers, financiers, etc, only pay the capital gains tax. They pay a rate much lower than the marginal tax rate, and they do not pay payroll taxes. That's how Romney gets to pay 14%. The rest of us pay the marginal tax rate, plus the payroll tax rate, on earned income. The capital gains rate was 20% under Reagan. If we allow the Bush tax cuts to expire as Obama proposes, the rate will be 20% again. Republicans want to keep this rate in place, and want to let the payroll tax cuts from the Stimulus expire. If Republicans get their way, Romney will pay his 14%, and us working stiffs will pay 33.9% (including payroll, at $50,000 per year) AND we will lose things like the mortgage interest deduction, student loan deduction, EITC, etc. If Obama gets his way, Romney will pay 20%, and us working stiffs will pay 36.9%, and middle-class oriented deductions will stay in place. (For this tax proposal, Obama is accused of class war and hating the rich. Nutty). So the question I have been asking for a week now is, how low do you think the tax on unearned income should be? 10%? 5%? 1%? 0? My answer is 20%, the rate that Reagan pushed for and got.

If you make a billion $$ or $20,000 - a straight 10% across the board. No loopholes, no deductions - period (a "postcard" tax return). And keep capital gains and dividend taxes where they are for all. This would get the 50% that pay nothing to contribute fairly without it being punitive to anyone. Combine this with a drastic overhaul of all entitlement programs (NOT SS and Medicare) and we'll be well on our way to being a great country again. Of course this will never happen but your question was hypothetical.</Msg><Username>mikerego19</Username><Timestamp>1349117315746</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 14:48:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349119304883-27</Id><Topic><Title>T Is Looking Good!</Title><Username>isidroharrison649</Username><Timestamp>1349095218522</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 08:40:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You can count on your money by investing in the stock market for better future returns.</Msg><Username>dickersonh73</Username><Timestamp>1349119304883</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 15:21:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349124097813-28</Id><Topic><Title>How Much Should The Rich Pay In Taxes ??</Title><Username>jon3retired</Username><Timestamp>1348871759337</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 18:35:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Oh, now I get it, sure, first IMHO it is helpful to understand why taxes are needed. In both conservative and progressive governing systems there is some agreement that taxes are required to provide funds to operate the government and to some extent perform social engineering. In the case of social engineering there is a basic rule that simply states that if you want more of a behavior or activity then it should be subsidized, and the converse, if you want less then it should be taxed. For example if you want more housing, you provide housing related deductions that will cause the masses to put money into housing; if you want your population to grow and have families, then you provide deductions for dependents and child care expenses. On the other hand if you want less of a behavior or activity like smoking or drinking you tax it, or if you want to punish people for participating in an activity (like buying a boat that cost over $100K) you fine them say 10% and call it a tax. Having said that, if you ask a conservative how high should dividend and capital gains taxes be, the answer would be closer to 0% for both, since the conservative believes that government should be promoting investment in the private sector not punishing people for risking money that they have already paid taxes on through the income tax. On the other hand since the progressive believes that the job of government is to ensure an equitable distribution of wealth among the masses, then the answer is closer to 100%. Just two different governing philosophies, and I guess on November seventh we will find out which one the American people want to live with for the next four years.

The Obama administration was caught in a coverup of the program and Uninvision is asking the tough questions the liberal press won't. The Mexican disclosures came after Spanish-language TV station Univision demanded documents under Mexico’s Freedom of Information Act listing 100,000 weapons recovered in that country in 2009 and 2010. Univision says 57 of those weapons were bought under the Fast and Furious scheme in which officers from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) were ordered to stand by and allow guns to be bought in the United States and walked across the border. Agents were supposed to track the weapons in the hope they would lead them to drug cartel kingpins, however nearly all were lost. U.S. Border guard Brian Terry and immigration official Jaime Zapata were killed with weapons linked to the scheme. Univision said in a report that aired Sunday that a massacre in the border town of Juarez was linked to Fast and Furious, in which 16 people were killed when gunmen attacked a birthday party, were linked to Fast and Furious. Another mass killing, in which 18 people died at a rehabilitation center in Juarez, also involved three weapons bought under an ATF scheme, although the Mexican Army paperwork did not specifically say it was Fast and Furious. Gerardo Reyes, the head of Univision’s investigative unit says relatives of those slain in Juarez are demanding answers. "They want to know what happened. And why they didn't stop these guns from leaving the U.S. and ending up in these crimes?" he said. "They feel helpless, They don't know what to do. Terry’s family is currently pursuing a wrongful death suit against the federal government. If successful it could open the way to more suits from these family members, Fox News reports. As attorney general, Holder’s Justice Department has ultimate responsibility for the actions of ATF.</Msg><Username>ricky1820l</Username><Timestamp>1349138058892</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 20:34:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349139815394-35</Id><Title>Obama begins policy to deny care to elderly</Title><Msg>If a medicare patient needs to be readmitted to a hosipital within 30 days after being discharged the hospital will now be fined at a rate that increases each year. Hospitals will now refer patients to end of life couseling instead of readmitting them to avoid being fined. If you or an elderly relative have been hospitalized recently and noticed extra attention when the time came to be discharged, there's more to it than good customer service. As of Monday, Medicare will start fining hospitals that have too many patients readmitted within 30 days of discharge due to complications. The penalties are part of President Barack Obama's health care law. About two-thirds of the hospitals serving Medicare patients, or some 2,200 facilities, will be hit with penalties averaging around $125,000 per facility this coming year, according to government estimates. Industry officials say they have misgivings about being held liable for circumstances beyond their control. They also complain that facilities serving low-income people, including many major teaching hopitals, are much more likely to be fined, raising questions of fairness. Under the health care law, the penalties gradually will rise.</Msg><Username>ricky1820l</Username><Timestamp>1349139815394</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 21:03:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349140140026-36</Id><Topic><Title>Obama begins policy to deny care to elderly</Title><Username>ricky1820l</Username><Timestamp>1349139815394</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 21:03:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>We have to approve it to find out what's in it.
