They say they have 4G speed but at those speeds you can max out your plan in 2 hours watching 1 movie. The customers are not stupid, they can see they pay way more than prepaid unlimited service. $150 vs $42.00 (adjusted for taxes) 3G is faster than my home internet connection. Why do I need a bigger pipe? To work with poorly optimized SAAS, or to pay data overages if you ever use the thing? $50 for 5G after adding $70 for unlimited is ridiculous. $120 a month is far too much. They can't compete with sprint on price. Sprint can't make any money, but attrition is starting to work for them.

This is highly unusual in these types of cases. Media outlets have already covered many of the serious flaws of the report. For instance, they cite documents "signed" by Clinton, but every document sent to diplomatic offices bears a robo-signature from the Sec. of State.

It also doesn't mean to stay away from sharp objects. To say this is the end of the world doesn't play either. Maybe the report didn't set well with some investors. Less than 24 hours ago, some buyers saw fit to plunk down 39.00 a share. There is no way in hell the earnings (or lack of) report warrants this kind of selling pressure. But it is what it is. How does anyone explain a company take a 4 Billion dollar hit and barely blink...then take a 5% hit for a report that hardly can be described as lackluster? One thing I won't write is this is a "buying opportunity". In a sense it is, but we would have preferred upside movement rather than a jolt like this. Once things settle down and investors come to their senses, they will seek the respectable dividend and look forward to T re-starting where we left off at last nights close. Profit taking was inevitable. The report gave the profiteers the opportunity to cash in. T will get it together and continue its modest price appreciation and continue paying the nice dividend we are accustomed to. Trollers, shorters and the haters will say "told you so". Don't concern yourself with them or the current circumstances. Tomorrow will probably rebound some and in a month or two, today will be forgotten.</Msg><Username>davemartin74575</Username><Timestamp>1366813869908</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 10:31:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366813908511-28</Id><Title>Analyst manipulators at work again!!!!</Title><Msg>Two of the worst of the worst , Morgan Stanley ,( isn't that lead by sleazeball Jamie Diamond? ) and Citigroup whose own financial status is a house of cards downgrade T today.

We CANNOT change these rules until we have the borders secured. Not because we don't like Mexican's because a good many of those crossing aren't from Mexico. They are from other Central American countries, Asia and the Middle East. We have no idea how many are crossing to work and better their lives or how many are joining sleeper cells or with plans to blow something/somebody up. There may not be a great many terrorist crossing from Mexico, but the key is that WE DON'T KNOW!

Then, all hell broke loose. The price soared to 39 and today has collapsed to the 36's. All that volatility has to have an affect on your plays. So with all the price gyrations, where do you stand now? Have you changed your strategy? I know your a shorter at heart, but I'd like to know what your counter punch is to the earnings report down slide. You may have gotten caught in the run up...then again, maybe the losses today made money for you. Can't figure out where you stand now. Please fill us (me) in.

"to obtain ethanol you must burn fossil fuels" Fine. No ethanol. I'm with you. So are most environmentalists.

This sort of thing has happened before. It will happen again. You both make excellent points, yet free-fall occurred. So the report had some minor shortages. Profit taking was due as well. I say take it in stride. Recovery will take place once things settle down. Most likely sooner than later. Patient long term owners will continue collecting a nice dividend. By the next report, today will be a distant memory. For those that are worried about today's slide...sell. I'm here for the long haul and have no intention to panic sell as Wilkie suggested.

NO. Internal forecasts should have seen this. Having said that, he should have lowered expectations significantly, much more so than he did. It remains to be seen what the company will do when the credit downgrade is announced. It is given that the borrowing costs will rise of which will impact the earnings, cash flow and so on. The insiders heavy selling is beginning to make dollars and sense.

If you want price and growth action, you would be better off elsewhere. There are many factors to consider and you don't state your objectives, so it is difficult to assess what your objective is. Reading your analysis of T, I understand your concern. Saturation of smart phones is at hand. That's one reason why T is seeking other avenues to make money. Tablets, increasing spectrum, overseas markets, new phone products (without the onerous subsidy they pay Aapl), network upgrades are all on the table. Both now and in the future. T mobile failed, but they tried to get bigger by acquisition. Who knows what's next. I'm in for the long term. However, I know how to read writing on the wall and would sell without giving it a second thought if red flags appear. Fortunately, i don't see any writing yet. But should that occur, I'd move on and find a suitable replacement. I suggest patience. Keep abreast of anything pertinent to T that might be adverse and follow your instincts. Otherwise, enjoy a very nice dividend for quite some time.</Msg><Username>davemartin74575</Username><Timestamp>1366847581707</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 19:53:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366848104792-113</Id><Topic><Title>price</Title><Username>jimdavis33</Username><Timestamp>1366836760187</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 16:52:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You're absolutely right Blair.

Investors that are coming back to the equity market are looking to buy stable large caps that pay a nice dividend (3%+) as they just can't get any yield at the local bank or from bonds. This company offers an exceptional yield for those that want to diversify away from MLP's, REITs, and closed end high yield funds, and they really don't care what the rev growth is as long as it is positive and EPS is also climbing. Given that, one can assume they will always have a chance to get out of it at a profit in the longer term, while collecting a great comparable yield. Give it a couple of days and it will begin moving right back up as other large caps have after missing their revenue number.</Msg><Username>wcsg122</Username><Timestamp>1366851879361</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 21:04:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366852326040-117</Id><Topic><Title>Wouldn't this be an opportune time to buy back the stock that T promised?</Title><Username>whopperkaraoke</Username><Timestamp>1366813241737</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 10:20:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>RAGING BULL</Msg><Username>rogertheharborrat</Username><Timestamp>1366852326040</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 21:12:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366852425923-118</Id><Topic><Title>Wouldn't this be an opportune time to buy back the stock that T promised?</Title><Username>whopperkaraoke</Username><Timestamp>1366813241737</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 10:20:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That's all you can do Whop.

AT&amp;T would do well if they offered the stock they are buying back to their employees who choose to do so, to take up to 20% of their pay in company stock. Not only would it improve cash flow, it would also improve moral and eventually replace the unions. Just imagine employees and management being on the same team. It is working well for WINCO in the grocery business. They are not even listed on a stock exchange because all of their stock is owned by employees and they choose the board of directors. Travelers Insurance is also involved in some way.</Msg><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1366856090677</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 22:14:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366856454402-123</Id><Topic><Title>Union entitlements are constraining ATT</Title><Username>hubcap1234_00</Username><Timestamp>1366842955734</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 18:35:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Dave: What is your view of employee ownership of a company?
