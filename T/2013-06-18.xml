Banning armed robberies does not prevent armed robberies, but it does reduce the number of them. Banning the dumping of toxic waste in our drinking water supply does not prevent some idiots from doing so, but it does reduce the number of incidents by responsible, thinking people.

This stock is dead meat after missing revenues last quarter and warning for this quarter. After ex-div this will be $33-$34. After earnings $29-$30 (Sorry Beau - I know you were the one that bought at $39!). $30 gives a 6% dividend. That may offer some support from old ladies and orphans - but maybe not. What good is a high dividend when the stock is tanking due to constant poor earnings reports?
