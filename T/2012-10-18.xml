However, most executives still utilizing binders in today’s world of information technology are similarly minded Neanderthals who also believe that Ozzie &amp; Harriet are the model for today’s electorate family, the earth is only 6000 years old, women should be paid less than men, The President is a Marxist/Socialist/Muslim, global warming is a hoax, ObamaCare’s Death Panels are coming after your elderly grandmother, if your wife is raped and wants an abortion SHE’S the criminal (not the rapist) and have a perplexing and fearful idea that education is for losers. You also have terminal xenophobia and a pathological fear of our own government, are completely immune to facts, science and progress, intolerant of dissent, subscribe to a fundamentalist belief that god is on your side only, and that anyone with even a slight variation of your personal religious views are demonic enemies, believe that you have an inalienable right to the control of women’s bodies, can start wars with preemptive strikes at your whim, and in general, feel that you have the monopoly on patriotism and morality, while being totally hypocritical of most of the great ideals on which our Democracy was formed. And your multiple posts of last night, under the usual aliases, are most indicative of the overall message you promote through lies, deception and fear mongering…not standing FOR something, mind you…but merely being AGAINST something…the duly elected President of the United States and the overwhelming majority of all Americans he represents, except the top 2% whom you clandestinely represent. I’m thinkin’ “binders” might be the wrong word. Perhaps you meant “Blinders”.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1350564007167</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 08:40:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350566538606-17</Id><Topic><Title>NOV 7</Title><Username>bob.beachin</Username><Timestamp>1350516691454</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 19:31:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>it's about about getting rid of urban lines and selling them</Msg><Username>spe754</Username><Timestamp>1350566538606</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 09:22:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350567416179-18</Id><Topic><Title>Technical Take</Title><Username>guilty_trader</Username><Timestamp>1350313639361</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 11:07:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>... &amp; the upside technical bounce extends above $36.00 this morning! hope you longs with me are enjoying the ride. good trading!</Msg><Username>erikpaulleff</Username><Timestamp>1350567416179</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 09:36:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350567670001-19</Id><Topic><Title>first lady</Title><Username>georgepag2001</Username><Timestamp>1350478044636</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 08:47:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>why do you lie ?</Msg><Username>tiglet2l</Username><Timestamp>1350567670001</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 09:41:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350567689140-20</Id><Topic><Title>first lady</Title><Username>georgepag2001</Username><Timestamp>1350478044636</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 08:47:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>okay, birth where?</Msg><Username>tiglet2l</Username><Timestamp>1350567689140</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 09:41:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350568827793-21</Id><Topic><Title>WOW Awesome Romeny would not tax dividends</Title><Username>ricky1820l</Username><Timestamp>1350492924834</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 12:55:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>flat tax is not fair to all.</Msg><Username>tiglet2l</Username><Timestamp>1350568827793</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 10:00:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350568938957-22</Id><Topic><Title>WOW Awesome Romeny would not tax dividends</Title><Username>ricky1820l</Username><Timestamp>1350492924834</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 12:55:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>cisco_yk2, yeah cause running up 16T in debt is a great idea, right?

He does not say either way. Normally we have marginal rates, not threshold rates. Either way, is it fair to someone earning $50,000 a year working to pay the full rate, while someone who earns $50,000 a year in dividends (or $200,000) pays zero (zero!) taxes. Absolutely not. We should not subsidize people simply for sitting on large amounts of assets. We should encourage people to work and to build their businesses. We should not punish work with higher rates, and incentivize small business owners to take money out of their business and put it in corporate stocks. This is nothing but handing money to wealthy people. It is a punch in the gut to people who go to work everyday.

Absolutely wrong, both of you. Obama noted that oil prices, like the prices of all commodities, collapsed during the financial crisis and the recession. The financial crisis was the cause of low oil prices, and thus low gas prices. Gas prices were pushing $4 before the crisis, and they're pushing $4 after. The trend is to higher commodity prices overall due to burgeoning demand from emerging markets. Obama's solution: efficient use of scarce resources. Romney's solution: subsidize oil production with taxpayer dollars. You can argue around the edges, but we are already producing more oil in this country than ever before. How long do you think we can beat that horse? Obama's solutions are working. With the new CAFE standards, Americans are using far less gas than they were before. You have a wide variety of fuel efficient vehicles to choose from--some with twice the mpg of vehicles in the same class just a few years ago. That means that no matter what the price of gas at the pump, you are paying half as much as you would be without Obama. Romney wants to get rid of CAFE standards. Still confused? I'm not. I am lucid and I know exactly what I am talking about. A vote for Obama is a vote for truth, justice and the American way. Let the Froggies and other confused Tea Partiers move to China if they think its better there.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1350576152216</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 12:02:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>16</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350576240045-47</Id><Topic><Title>Jobless claims hit an unexpected 4 month high</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1350572391490</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 10:59:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And, btw, despite the one-week spike, the moving average in initial jobless claims is continuing to decline.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1350576240045</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 12:04:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350576932390-48</Id><Topic><Title>Jobless claims hit an unexpected 4 month high</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1350572391490</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 10:59:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There's no koolaid left.

Wow, Tagg, why not enlist and go see some exciting foreign countries where you can release your hostilities and aggression. Perhaps he learned this conflict resolution technique from his Dad, The Prep School Bully. Back in 1965, when Mitt attended the tony Cranbrook School, the all male, private preparatory school in Bloomington Hills Michigan, he suspected a younger classmate of being gay because of his hair style. Romney, tough guy that he is, organized a “prep-school posse”, who then proceeded to gang-tackle the kid and hold him down while Romney cut his hair with scissors. That’s about as close to combat (or service, for that matter) as Mitt or any of his sons has come. Perhaps he missed his calling in life…Maybe hair styling or cosmetology is still in his future. Or maybe he and his kid can join the WWF as a Tag(g) Team – The Bain Bullies. More macho bluster from the right. This will make for great foreign policy.

You need to begin every post like that, because you are confused. Why on earth would you think more efficient use of energy resources would result in higher prices? With Obama, you not only get the lowest gas prices possible considering the global market and supply restrictions, you need to use less gas. With Romney, you get your head in the sand. We have a problem. Obama has a solution and it is working. Romney is depending on your confusion. It is not my problem that you are confused. Just get out of the way of those with the solutions.

What we have seen is oil production in this country rise to record levels and gas prices rise concurrently. We have a demand problem that cannot be adequately addressed with domestic supply. Obama is effectively addressing the demand problem. When my wife and I were driving 1-hour one way to work in 2007, we were spending over $500 a month on gas. We didn't sit there and demand that Bush somehow increase the supply of oil and lower gas prices for us. We moved, bought fuel efficient cars, and use less gas. Now we spend about $50 a month on gas. That is a demand side solution. It is effective. Not everything is a supply side solution.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1350584050734</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 14:14:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350584100788-82</Id><Topic><Title>Jobless claims hit an unexpected 4 month high</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1350572391490</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 10:59:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"did not include California" Again, that is another lie.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1350584100788</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 14:15:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>13</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350584737079-83</Id><Topic><Title>Profit by examinging these guys right now.</Title><Username>bpatrick115</Username><Timestamp>1350580974806</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 13:22:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>man exactly why did not i read through this early on, i missed out on all this bucks.</Msg><Username>franklinangel37</Username><Timestamp>1350584737079</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 14:25:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350585307192-84</Id><Topic><Title>New Info in T</Title><Username>shantelduusw444381</Username><Timestamp>1350050460805</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 10:01:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I love free reports.

The problem is the slippery slope that this would start on a slide. Once they, they being Congress and primarily liberals, are allowed to ban any sort of gun, they won't stop. I hunt, I target shoot and I own 7 different kinds of guns, none of which are the automatic, assault weapon type. If I need a fully automatic weapon to shoot a bird, deer, elk, or much of anything else, I likely should not be allowed to shoot a gun at all.

No, they are not working. The economy is a wreck; the U.S. foreign policy is in shambles and confusing the rest of the world. His Justice Department is about as corrupt as it can get. The leader of his Treasury Department is in lala land and should likely be in jail, but he doesn't care because as soon as Obama loses he will go back to work on Wall Street. He can't lead from the back or the front.

Invest in GreenShift(GERS): We develop and commercialize clean technologies that facilitate the more efficient use of natural resources. We are focused on doing so today in the U.S. ethanol industry, where we innovate and offer technologies that improve the profitability of licensed ethanol producers. We invented, developed, commercialized, perfected, and patented new technologies that integrate into the back-end of existing dry mill corn ethanol plants to tap into a new reserve of inedible crude corn oil with an estimated industry-wide output of more than 800 MMGY, an amount capable of offsetting more than about 20 million barrels of fossil fuel-derived crude oil per year. This corn oil is a valuable feedstock for use in the production of advanced carbon-neutral liquid fuels and other biomass-derived alternatives to fossil fuel-based products. Bio-Diesel plants need to be made. Diesels last longer, have better fuel economy and heady duty parts. Investing will create plants, creating jobs, making this economy greener, save you money, get our kids the future they deserve. OBAMAS FAILED ATTEMPT AT ELECRIC, SOLAR GREEN ENERGYS- Update: 7/19/12: The Amonix Solar: FAIL! – manufacturing plant in North Las Vegas, subsidized by more than $20 million in federal tax credits and grants given by Obama Administration, has closed its 214,000 square foot facility a year after it opened. Solar Trust of America: FAIL! - Filed Bankruptcy in Oakland, CA, April 3, 2012 Bright Source: FAIL! - Bright Source warned Obama’s Energy Department officials in March 2011 that delays in approving a $1.6 billion U.S. loan guarantee would embarrass the White House and force the solar-energy company to close. Bright Source lost billions of dollars but is getting more money to keep trying. Can you say, “This isn’t working Mr. President?” Solyndra: FAIL! - Obama gave $500,000,000 (that’s a HALF BILLION!) in taxpayer money to Solyndra who shut its doors and laid off 1100 workers in August 2011 after billions in losses due to failure to make a solar product that works! Barack Obama was not vetted before being elected President and neither was Solyndra before Mr. Obama threw that taxpayer money down the drain of unproven technology. LSP Energy: FAIL! - LSPEnergy LP filed bankruptcy protection and a sale of its assets in Feb 2012 Energy Conversion Devices: FAIL! – On February 14, 2012 Energy Conversion Devices, Inc. and its subsidiaries filed for bankruptcy Abound Solar: FAIL! - Abound Solar received a $400 million loan guarantee from Barack Obama then announced in June, 2012 that it would file for bankruptcy. Many of these failed corporations, such as Abound, donated MILLIONS and continue to donate to Barack Obama’s campaign. Can you say, “Democrat Slush Fund”? Yes this is illegal. But Democrats are being protected from being prosecuted, for now. SunPower: FAIL! - SunPower stopped producing solar cells in 2011 at near bankruptcy then restructured with the help of, get this, oil giant TOTAL, Inc. who owns 60% stake in SunPower. Irony? The company is still struggling. Beacon Power: FAIL! – Beacon Power Corp filed for bankruptcy protection in October, 2011 just a year after Obama approved a $43 million Government loan guarantee. They remain barely in business, still struggling to make energy that makes sense or that works at all. Ecotality: FAIL! - ECOtality, a San Francisco green-tech company that never earned any money and remains on the verge of bankruptcy after receiving roughly $115 million in two loan guarantees from President Obama, who wants to do some more of this kind of Democrat Slush Fund Guarantees after he is elected to a 2nd term. A123 Solar: FAIL! - A123 Solar received $279 million from taxpayers thanks to President Obama’s Department of Energy loan guarantees even after the Solyndra bankruptcy and is getting another $500M from Obama after a loss of $400M. UniSolar: FAIL! - Uni-Solar filed for Ch 11 bankruptcy in June 20, 2012 after laying off hundreds of workers. UniSolar received even more Obama money after showing now progress, no profits and is still failing… yet they still remain in business with Obama’s help. Azure Dynamics: FAIL! - Azure Dynamics filed for bankruptcy in June , 2012 wasting millions in Obama “Stimulus” money and received abatement on taxes owed and and several tax credits. Azure Dynamics LLC filed for bankruptcy protection in Canada and the US. Azure laid off 120 of its 160 employees in Oak Park; Boston; Vancouver, British Columbia; and the UK. Evergreen Solar: FAIL! - Evergreen Solar received $527 Million in Taxpayer money from Obama and filed bankruptcy in late 2011. Evergreen, which closed its taxpayer-supported Devens factory in March, 2011 cut more than 1800 jobs. Evergreen’s $450 million factory, turned out to be a colossal “waste” of taxpayer money. Ener1: FAIL! Ener1 Inc. received a $118 million U.S. Energy Department grant from President Obama to make electric-car batteries but filed for bankruptcy protection January 2012 after defaulting on bond debt WHY A DIESEL? One of the biggest advantages of choosing a diesel car or truck is fuel economy. A diesel's extra 20 to 30 percent of fuel efficiency makes a difference. You'll use less fuel as you drive and fill up your tank less often. Fewer trips to the pump means more money stays in your wallet. Just ask any diesel driver. So even if you only owned your turbo diesel for three years, you'd save $1,149 in fuel costs and pick up an extra $300 when you sold the car. Your total savings for going diesel after just three years is $1,449, which more than makes up for the extra $1,020 you paid for the engine. with diesel engines tend to last longer because the explosive force of a diesel engine requires much more heavy-duty materials that do not break down as easily over time. In addition, diesel fuel is a lubricant, which can help extend engine life Disadvantages-smelling like fries? And buying a little more oil.</Msg><Username>alexyozan</Username><Timestamp>1350605162504</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 20:06:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350606328953-116</Id><Topic><Title>Obama will ban guns in his second term!!</Title><Username>bouch84</Username><Timestamp>1350575258049</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 11:47:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If he is relected I hope he trys banning guns.
