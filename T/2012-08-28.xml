Did I not post Cantor's comments on the cuts HE demanded last summer? He's against them all now. It's easy to talk about cuts in a non-binding resolution, and we all know they love doing that, but when it comes to real cuts they return to form. They had a chance last year with the grand bargain and they blew it. They blew it for all of us.

Truth is not attained by balancing the ravings of crazy people against each other. Nor is moderation attained by balancing the thoughts of a moderate with the thoughts of an extremist.

I can't stand Bill Maher. They're too out there. Do you think "balancing" them with an hour of Rush is a good way to learn about the world?

It continued with his calling out of the Supreme Court, with his hidden racism which first jumped out with the ‘the police were stupid’ comments. It is continuing with his going around Congress to make changes in laws he couldn't otherwise accomplish with Democratic support that is the root cause the lack of respect he has brought upon the office of President.

How come our Dem Governor, Martin O'Malley isn't trying to provide for our citizens. Illegals shouldn't be given business permits. This guys aren't paying taxes, and they are putting legitimate concerns out of business.</Msg><Username>robfisk</Username><Timestamp>1346200411000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 20:33:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346200688000-68</Id><Topic><Title>Amazing !!!</Title><Username>daridkc51762</Username><Timestamp>1346158803000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 09:00:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I love this site.</Msg><Username>asia_jasmine18</Username><Timestamp>1346200688000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 20:38:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346201792000-69</Id><Title>Feinstein Complains Gas Too High?</Title><Msg>Surely she jests. It must be election time. Have you been living in a cave? Barry has said many times he would like our gas prices to approach those of Europe. That would mean gas would be $9, to $11 a gallon. I'm convinced he wants to see all Black folks taking the bus. Between the price of gas, and the redlight/speed cameras that saturate Baltimore's Black communities, I noticing more, and more folks signalling they need a ride. Did you know the Dem enablers have some red light cams in LA, that spits out $450 tickets? Besides, without high gas, Barry would have trouble selling those Volts over at Government Motors.</Msg><Username>robfisk</Username><Timestamp>1346201792000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 20:56:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346203552000-70</Id><Topic><Title>Feinstein Complains Gas Too High?</Title><Username>robfisk</Username><Timestamp>1346201792000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 20:56:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And she is against drilling in CA and she is against new refinery's.

I wrote that the problem did not seem to exist during the first Bush presidency. Okay, my apologies, that was imprecise; I meant the first "W" presidency, not that of his father. Is that your recollection as well, or was I sleeping the second four years? Was it really all sunshine and roses until the country lost its direction and elected a (shudder) black man president? Regarding the self-fulfilling nature of my handle, are you laboring under the misapprehension that I chose it accidentally? By the way, last time I checked, it was "prophecy", not "prophesy". The idiocracy is in the ascendant - at least on this board.</Msg><Username>yourenohelp</Username><Timestamp>1346212084000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 23:48:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
