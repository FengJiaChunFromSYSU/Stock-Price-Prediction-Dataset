I have been wondering about this for several years. With so many businesses failing and with so many people having lost their jobs under Obama where is the demand for T services coming from. I heard the gov. was using stimulus money to buy stock, not sure if it is true or not, but it would explain how Obama is artificially able to keep the market at a level that makes no sense given the poor economy.</Msg><Username>ricky1820l</Username><Timestamp>1365352099217</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-07 12:28:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365355561256-3</Id><Topic><Title>AT&amp;T Upgraded to STRONG BUY?</Title><Username>miguel.janis</Username><Timestamp>1364394934253</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-27 10:35:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>thanks a lot</Msg><Username>eddie_brochu</Username><Timestamp>1365355561256</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-07 13:26:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365359608674-4</Id><Topic><Title>AT&amp;T Upgraded to STRONG BUY?</Title><Username>miguel.janis</Username><Timestamp>1364394934253</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-27 10:35:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>very good report!</Msg><Username>taylormichael528</Username><Timestamp>1365359608674</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-07 14:33:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365359617501-5</Id><Topic><Title>Michelle and Barack are both hate-filled racists who occasionally slip up in public on open mic’s.

Excerpts from the Daily Mail. This is an example, imo, of the new non White, colored controlled SOUTH - PUKE. Only feminine subservient White men are allowed in govt in the South.(ex.Graham Flake all of FL) A black member of the Alabama legislature uncorked a racist tirade in an email this week to a constituent who urged him not to embrace new gun control laws Joseph Mitchell, a Democrat who has represented parts of the city of Mobile since 1994 and ran for re-election unopposed in 2010 and 2006, castigated a voter named Eddie Maxwell, a Jefferson County man whom he correctly presumed was white. 'Hey man,' Mitchell wrote. 'Your folk never used all this #$%$ [sic] to protect my folk from your slave-holding, murdering, adulterous, baby-raping, incestuous, snaggle-toothed, backward-a**ed, inbreed [sic], imported criminal-minded kin folk.' Mitchell's reply also suggested that he favored arming black Alabamians before enforcing new gun-control measures, in case they needed to defend themselves from racist white southerners. `You can keep sending me stuff like you have however,' he wrote, 'because it helps me explain to my constituents why they should protect that 2nd amendment thing AFTER we [blacks] finish stocking up on spare parts, munitions and the like.'</Msg><Username>lavendarsen</Username><Timestamp>1365359617501</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-07 14:33:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365360570973-6</Id><Topic><Title>Michelle and Barack are both hate-filled racists who occasionally slip up in public on open mic’s.

Most Whites in government appear to feel that way also. They appear to be getting ready to screw Whites big time, by voting to reward tens of millions of colored illegal alien lawbreakers with citizenship, for breaking the laws of our country. To once and for all do away with the White majority. Of course they started that process long ago when they legalized ANCHOR BABIES. The White traitors think they are so smart(those of European descent). However, unless they or their children are in mixed race relationships, and their descendents are mixed race, they are also screwing their children, grandchildren, all future descendants. When did psychopaths ever care about such things, though?</Msg><Username>lavendarsen</Username><Timestamp>1365360570973</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-07 14:49:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365362561680-7</Id><Topic><Title>AT&amp;T Upgraded to STRONG BUY?</Title><Username>miguel.janis</Username><Timestamp>1364394934253</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-27 10:35:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thank you very much!</Msg><Username>martinfranicsco</Username><Timestamp>1365362561680</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-07 15:22:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365363688776-8</Id><Topic><Title>AT&amp;T Upgraded to STRONG BUY?</Title><Username>miguel.janis</Username><Timestamp>1364394934253</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-27 10:35:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks for sharing !</Msg><Username>lesterdavid714</Username><Timestamp>1365363688776</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-07 15:41:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365364748148-9</Id><Title>AT&amp;T network outrage in my area.
