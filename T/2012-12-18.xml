Or easily concealed handguns like we do sawed off shotguns? "compare your list to the number of automobile related deaths" You make my argument for me. We very much do have automobile control. We restrict all sorts of behavior to minimize those risks. And since the 1970's, deaths per mile traveled have diminished specifically because the government puts very tight controls on what type of vehicles can be sold and driven and even requires persons buy particular equipment such as child safety seats and helmets. We have arms control as well. BTW, threatening to kill me or law enforcement officers with your AR-15, which is what you implied with your "big boy pants" comment, may not be the best way to convince people you're a responsible gun owner who should have ready access to assault rifles. This is why people don't want you to have an assault rifle. You cannot be both a law-abiding citizen and a person who kills law enforcement officers if the law doesn't turn out the way you want it.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1355841190157</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 09:33:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355841236732-5</Id><Topic><Title>AHQ (final)...</Title><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1355537341551</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-14 21:09:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"With your lack of mental capacity to rationaliz" I don't think you know what rationalize means.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1355841236732</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 09:33:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355842181669-6</Id><Topic><Title>Many that commit this sort of act have had their brains fried on various types of dope.</Title><Username>geoff_holt_2000</Username><Timestamp>1355562036359</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-15 04:00:36 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Interesting.

Only the sickest of individuals would vocalize such nonsense. When called out, and asked to take his views to Newton to see how the grieving parents and families would react to his malignant and insidious suggestion, he reacts in his typical fashion – “dance til your balls fall off” and tales of “man-bras” - all very mature responses to a legitimate question of his boorish insensitivity. Frankly, I’m quite surprised he didn’t come back with his equally juvenile and often used retort about having potatoes in his underwear. (Note, he also mentioned the “digital camo trousers I got at Ft Belvoir”, despite his claiming to be a Vietnam era draftee, some 30 years prior to the introduction of digital cammies in the 90’s) What you really mean is that you and the other drop-outs buy them at the Army-Navy store to wear to the gun shows you brag about. You know, jon, I am so tired of having ignorant folks like you be any symbol of what America is all about. I am equally glad that everything you have said here, and all that you represent, was so overwhelmingly defeated in this past election, and that the America I know, love and have defended, rejects everything about you. If someone wants some fun, go back and read your idiotic posts and political predictions, all of which have been wrong. And yet you persist. We voted for change, and we’re about to get it. It’s unfortunate that your kind can’t accept that. Take a look at what the rest of the world thinks about America’s preoccupation with guns, because of fools like you. I know your kind – the wimpy, wanna-be macho man who can’t defend himself and is afraid to go out in public without a concealed carry. Don’t look now, jon, but the time’s are a-changin’. Editorials from around the world: Canada: “It’s time the U.S. cured its gun sickness.” Great Britain: “Mad men with guns will always be a danger, whatever the gun laws. But modern America still seems to lack the will to make even modest regulatory changes.” Germany: “Their opposition to almost any kind of gun control borders on political complicity in murder and manslaughter…” Germany: “The U.S. Constitution guarantees every American the right to move about in public as though he or she is John Wayne in person. One can see it as a national tradition. But this martial approach to liberty is also a relic of the past and one that is out of step with the times…” Australia: “ (the) task for American is to become a gentler, more trusting society, so that school children do not have to be drilled in cowering in store rooms. Israel: “America is not ready to talk about how it is easier to get a handgun than it is to see a doctor, not ready to speak about the video games that have extreme violence. It is just willing to sweep up everything under the carpet of tears.” India: “For those griping about the American right to bear arms, wake up. This is the 21st century and America's a settled state, not the rough-edged, wide open spaces of the 1780s when the Constitution was framed and everything, from land to liberty, was based on violent contests. Bearing arms then might have made sense — doing so today is swallowing the nonsense posed as liberty by commercial lobbies. Some argue weapons empower victims against aggressors. If so, should second-graders pack pistols in their schoolbags? Such shaky logic simply intensifies dangerous situations.” LeSotho: “Jon is an imbecilic boob, who in his first and only encounter with any type of firearm, is the only know person on record, despite what your Mom told you, to have actually put his eye out with a Daisy B-B Gun.”</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1355859212564</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 14:33:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355863697702-9</Id><Title>Typical day for T...</Title><Msg>Bump up early and spend the rest of the day getting back to even or lower - you can set your watch by this pattern.</Msg><Username>mikerego19</Username><Timestamp>1355863697702</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 15:48:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355864821464-10</Id><Topic><Title>Typical day for T...</Title><Username>mikerego19</Username><Timestamp>1355863697702</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 15:48:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Which means that you can trade to it.</Msg><Username>geoff_holt_2000</Username><Timestamp>1355864821464</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 16:07:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355867484286-11</Id><Topic><Title>Wack job, jon...</Title><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1355782175162</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 17:09:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There are always a couple like this jon, the only place they can hide behind their weakness, on a message board.

The right and power to rebel should be retained by the states, as it is in state control of the National Guard. This, I think, should be in the Constitution. Individuals do not have the right to rebel on their own, nor the power. The things that make up a well regulated militia necessary to the security of a free state simply are not the same things today as they were in 1789. States provide a credible check on Federal power and have the capacity to responsibly manage modern weaponry.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1355868902630</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 17:15:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355879948815-14</Id><Topic><Title>Wack job, jon...</Title><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1355782175162</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 17:09:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>...States rights matter, but thinking "modern weaponry" is even known by the States is wishful, at best.
