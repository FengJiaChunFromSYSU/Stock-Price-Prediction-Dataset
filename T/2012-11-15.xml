If you're rich and don't pay taxes, you're tax neutral. If you're middle class or poor and don't pay taxes you're a parasite. Is that really what you're trying to say here, emil? Even assuming that these wealthy "tax neutral" people don't get some form of subsidy, you don't think they get anything of value from government that would make them "tax takers"? Perhaps you'd like to be the one to advise our soldiers in the field that wealthy people don't get anything of value from their service and thus shouldn't have to contribute. . .

Typical of Democrats is to force a 'compromise', their word for giving up, and get the tax increases then not pass or stick to any spending cuts. You can't have one without the other and be successful at controlling this economy for the better. Any compromise has to have each side giving up something of value to them and sticking to the deal. If that doesn’t happen, you can’t call it a compromise for either side. The Republicans giving up and allowing the Democrats to do whatever they desire is not a compromise, it is surrender. The Democrats do not have all the answers, they need to listen to the other side as well.

Some are saying it is a buying opportunity, but not if you're buying into a continually sinking market. It Obama and buddies don't get something passed to solve the immediate tax and spend problems; anything you just bought will be near worthless soon.

Does that sound like an economic decision which will create a stock market in which you want to participate?

Obama, and prior Presidents, miss being at many security council meetings. Since the meetings are held daily, if the President has prior committments, is travelling, or meeting with other leaders he will not attend. However, you do know that the government even has portable phones and all kinds of exotic ways for the President to get information without attending the meetings in person, right? In fact, believe it or not, the President is briefed constantly about events as they occur during the day, so most meetings are just recaps of events of which he is already aware. However, the meeting that McCain missed was requested by senior leaders, including McCain. At these meetings folks testify and answer questions posed by these leaders. This is how Congress investigates happenings. I can see your wrinkled forehead and gutteral sounds coming from your throat that you don't get it. Tomorrow ask the Mexican that repairs your roof or the black guy who cuts your yard to expain it to you. They understand it. Maybe they can explain it better than I. By the way, McCain is off the hook. Rep. DesJarlais ( Republican from Tennessee ) just took over the lead news headline for the day. McCain is now Republican dumba** number two.
