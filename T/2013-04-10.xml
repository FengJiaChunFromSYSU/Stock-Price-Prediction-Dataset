First, nearly all involved admit that is the law they want passed had been in place at the time of Sandy Hook and the CO shooting, the law would in all likelihood not prevented either incident. The obvious question then becomes why do it now? Second while having no issues with gun buyers needing to pass a background check, there are some logistical issue that have not been highlighted by those in support of expanding these checks. In the case of individual purchases/sales, who does the background check? Who approves the check and blesses or denies the sale? Who has access to the critical data? Where is this data and who is responsible for its accuracy and timeliness? Who pays for the background checks and who do they pay and how? The next issue is that this bill as suggested would basically alter the second amendment. By law you cannot change the Constitution without Congressional action to present an amendment bill that has to be voted on by the citizens of the U. S. This bill does not accomplish that requirement. While I have no problems with a background check being a requirement or that there might even be some restrictions on the type of weapons allowed to the general public, there are way to develop rational, effective, and reasonable processes to accomplish this. Illegally amending the Constitution and a knee jerk reaction for the sake of political gain and publicity should not be accepted as the solution. "God forbid that reason should prevail and government actually do something for a change." Yes, and wouldn't it nice if this same government did something effective, reasonable and for the right reasons, not just for the sake of change and to further their individual careers?</Msg><Username>winholder</Username><Timestamp>1365606699475</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 11:11:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>11</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365607315743-14</Id><Topic><Title>How many "green jobs" will $529 million buy?</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1364925284704</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 13:54:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>“You also had abundant, cheap, domestically produced oil and a very poor and expensive electric grid.” And in relative terms we have the same condition today. We have grid issues all across this country, electricity prices are rising every year even as they move to production using less expensive NG as fuel. Production in many areas is already lagging demand or the projected increases in demand and the permits for new production facilities are being tightened and denied in many areas. As the demand for power increases, without the advent of millions of electric cars and trucks, where will this demand be met? How will people that barely afford their home power today find resources to pay for this increased cost of power? Cleaning up the air is always a good thing, breaking the bank to accomplish that goal seems a bit counterproductive. The President demands that we drastically reduce out use and reliance on oil, but he offers few if any cost effective methods toward that end, just pie in the sky wishes and hopes. He seems to rely on hope for a lot of his thinking.</Msg><Username>winholder</Username><Timestamp>1365607315743</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 11:21:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365607539984-15</Id><Topic><Title>How many "green jobs" will $529 million buy?</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1364925284704</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 13:54:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The problem with China is that it has a totalitarian one-party state.

Fine winholder. Buy yourself a gas generator and go off the grid. "As the demand for power increases, without the advent of millions of electric cars and trucks, where will this demand be met?" Are you saying how will the demand for energy be met? Production and distribution. Whether a power plant and transmission lines or tar sands and pipelines that's how its done. The advantage of electricity is that it is produced using just about any fuel source. Regardless of environmental concerns you can pick the cheapest available. Again, the goal is not to force everyone to use plug-ins. But with the technology developed and the industry matured it should be a viable option for people. The ability to choose between multiple, similar products based on needs and price is what makes markets work.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1365608576267</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 11:42:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365608672688-19</Id><Title>Do some DD on STBV.
