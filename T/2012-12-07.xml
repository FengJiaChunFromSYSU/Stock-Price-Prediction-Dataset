U.S. Added 146,000 Jobs in November; Unemployment at 7.7% The government said Friday that the economy added 146,000 jobs in November, a sharper gain than expected in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy. The unemployment rate dropped to 7.7 percent. It was the third month in a row that the jobless rate was below 8 percent. But the Labor Department report also revised previous job gains for September and October downward. And today the numbers for the past few reports were in fact altered downward. It was also reported that several hundred thousand were removed from the statistics because they have been out of work long enough that their benefits have run out and they are no longer considered part of the work forces and shouldn't be counted. But no, the government doesn't play games with the numbers of the timing of the release of numbers...never happen. Yeah right. But donâ€™t forget, the economy is improving, jobs are being created. The highest increase in new jobs over the past three months has been in government jobs. The people we are paying for, the folks that we will contribute to their retirements even when many of those paying for them have neither. This is a great administration.</Msg><Username>pinhighshot</Username><Timestamp>1354906944555</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 14:02:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354907655239-12</Id><Topic><Title>Will our Enemies Launch a Sneak Attack?</Title><Username>robfisk</Username><Timestamp>1354332244349</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 22:24:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"It was also reported that several hundred thousand were removed from the statistics because they have been out of work long enough that their benefits have run out" Absolutely not. The unemployment rate has absolutely nothing to do with benefits. People are counted as unemployed if they are not working and have looked for work in the past four weeks. As long as an unemployed person wants to return to work, that person is counted as unemployed. "The highest increase in new jobs over the past three months has been in government jobs." Absolutely not. In the past three months government payrolls have declined from 22,014,000 to 21,962,000. The number of people working in government has been declining almost since Obama took office. Government employment peaked at 22,626,000 in May 2009. Don't let these Tea Brains lie to you. If they actually cared about the things they claimed to care about they'd be glad private employment is making gains while public employment is dropping. That's they're goal, isn't it? But that's not what they care about. They're just partisan hacks.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1354907655239</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 14:14:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354907790120-13</Id><Topic><Title>Election explained</Title><Username>windyfrostt</Username><Timestamp>1352655544210</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-11 12:39:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Old white people tend to vote in higher numbers than every other constituency.
