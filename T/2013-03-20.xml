President of the Harvard law Review means Pres Obama did well. He needs to show nothing. Are you asking for Romney's Harvard law school records? How about his anti draft records?

Personally, I think he was granted access to scholarships because of his color and suspect that many of his grades didn't pass muster until the 'black' leverage was applied. Obama is not the only black to have been given preferential treatment by a college, particularly as you point out; a college that strives for 'diversity' populations regardless of it is achieved. This not necessarily a racist statement just a fact of life in America. Obama is not the first, won’t be the last to enjoy special benefits because of his color. He was elected because most black voters voted for him because of his color and admitted doing so.</Msg><Username>ssdependent</Username><Timestamp>1363813166265</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 16:59:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363814473418-22</Id><Topic><Title>Where will AT&amp;T Bounce?</Title><Username>bettinarosado</Username><Timestamp>1363622972570</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 12:09:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>great report, thanks!</Msg><Username>hardytodd859</Username><Timestamp>1363814473418</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 17:21:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363816233421-23</Id><Topic><Title>It looks like Obama wants to bankrupt America</Title><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1362778576708</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 16:36:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In case you didn't notice, Bush already did that.
