So what? Do you think because forest fires often occur naturally they cannot also be caused by man? Do you think because forest fires often occur naturally we shouldn't try to prevent those caused by man? Additionally, man-caused global warming is categorically different than natural epochs. First, the temperature is changing much faster. Second, we are continuing to pump greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. As long as we do that the temperature will continue to rise at an accelerating rate. So while the Medieval Warm Epoch created a global temperature rise of about 1 to 2 degrees C and lasted about 15 years, this man-made warming period will approach 2 degrees in a few decades and continue rise faster and faster so long as we add CO2 to the atmosphere. "A consensus is not necessarily the same at CORRECT!" It's far better than the politically-motivated denial we see from the likes of you. You trust every other bit of science, except this one thing.

To be honest with you, my little bit of fiction came from words and phrases used by administration representatives, MSM people, congressional representative, and senators during the days after the "man caused disaster". My primary inspiration for my little bit of satire was an article that appeared in Salon titled “Let’s hope the Boston Marathon bomber is a white American,” by David Sirota. But what I find truly amazing is a little story from last week about your beloved secretary: Soon after the bombing we learned about a Saudi national (Abdulrahman Ali Al-Harbi) being held for questioning. Then we learned about two closed door meetings between the Saudi Minister and the Secretary of State on Tuesday and the President on Wednesday. After the meeting on Wednesday we learned that the Saudi national was being deported. On Thursday when the DHS secretary appeared before congress she testified: “I am unaware of anyone who is being deported for national security concerns at all related to Boston. I don’t know where that rumor came from.” Then when the Congressman Duncan pushed the secretary she retorted: “I am not going to answer that question, it is so full of misstatements and misapprehensions, that it is just not worthy of an answer....there has been so much reported on this that has been wrong, I can’t even begin to tell you, congressman.” And finally we learn (after her testimony on Thursday) that the deportation order had been altered the night before, and his status had been changed from suspect to witness. And you call me a liar. "In your heart you know he is right."

What I know is that you think that YOU know better than the collective judgement of the entire scientific community, which has reached broad consensus on this matter. Are you so clever as be a better judge of climate science than the entire scientific community? "Do you believe that 100% of scientists agreed on the global cooling nonsense of the 1970's?" Of course not. It was conjecture reported in the popular media with little scientific support. In fact, there were far, far more scientists at the time talking about global warming than cooling. Do you think the unscientific conjecture of clever people in the 1970's has any bearing on the scientific consensus today? I don't think so. So let's be clear on the science: The Earth is 4.54 Billion years old. Humans evolved from monkeys. Human sexuality is not a choice. Women can't "shut that thing down." Global warming is occurring and it is man-made.

I claimed no such thing. I said you claim to know more than the entire scientific community, who have clearly reached scientific consensus on this matter. That does not imply unanimity. For instance, the force of the scientific consensus about female reproduction is not diminished because Todd Akin found a doctor who thinks women can "shut that thing down." "Your list beginning with the age of the earth is laughable and irrelevant." I don't think it is. Many of you claim to question the science on global warming. It is good to know when those people actually don't believe science at all. From your monkey comment, that appears to be the case with you. "not to read off topic drivel." Then don't read it.

You’re once again making a fool out of yourself. Conservative sites have been abuzz over claims that the Saudi student is to be deported. FALSE It’s hogwash, federal officials counter, prompting at least some websites to back off claims. Conservative circles are abuzz over the injured Saudi national who was questioned in the hospital and ruled out as a suspect in the aftermath of the Boston Marathon explosions. A guest on Sean Hannity’s show on Fox said recently that Abdul Rahman Ali Alharbi is set to be deported on national security grounds, a move seen as unusual and hasty. Alharbi isn’t being deported. At least some conservative sites are backing off their claims. Examples: A senior law enforcement official told The Daily Caller Examples: A senior law enforcement official told The Blaze has backed off its original report, which also is posted at Glenn Beck. A senior immigration law enforcement official told The Blaze it’s "categorically false" that authorities were deporting the young man, whom news reports and web sites describe as a student. "The person we have in custody is not Alharabi, is not being deported, and is not connected at all to the Boston attack," the senior law enforcement official told The Blaze. You know, Frogg, there’s a big difference between the stupid people who are influenced by this type of nonsense (as well as birther garbage, gun control lies, climate change denial, etc.) and the people like you who intentionally spread these malicious lies for the special interests whose positions are so indefensible that they can only lie about them. You must be an extremely pathetic individual. (Then again, who else relies on a quote from the losing side in the biggest debacle in American election history? In your heart you know the Frogg, like Goldwater, is a huge loser who’s rejected by all sane people. Would you be impressed if I started quoting George McGovern? (Didn’t think so,,,although I’m proud to say I voted for him…can’t win ‘em all.)</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1366662672936</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-22 16:31:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366666058224-38</Id><Topic><Title>ANY Pensioners missed a check yet?</Title><Username>davemartin74575</Username><Timestamp>1366636001125</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-22 09:06:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Dave pensioners won't miss a check.
