Estimates show EPS well over $2.50 a year for 2013-2014. Dividend payout is currently at $1.80 a share. Did you fail 3rd grade math?

Not the type of posts that will likely get honest or friendly advice from this board. One of your responses says that you're looking to invest $40k and by purchasing $40k in stock it might increase the stock price. So my first thought is this, why do you think that purchasing 1000 shares of a stock that trades an average of 20,000,000 shares a day is going to move this stock up or down? It won't. So you are doing nobody else a favor by investing. The second thing that comes to mind is, you say that you like to buy stocks that you can hold on to for decades ( like AXP ), so my "friendly" advice to you is to pick a stock that is always moving forward and can support its dividends. If you have the slightest doubt ( like you do with AT&amp;T ) then there are at least 500 could top companies that have been in business for over 100 years like AT&amp;T that you can look at. But the last thing in the world to do is ASK this board for advice. You never know who is on the other end of these posts. For all we really know, you are a 14 year old teenager getting your toes wet in the shallow end of the pool. For myself, I believe in AT&amp;Ts commitment to the share holder because the stock has been good to me for 30 years. Good Luck.</Msg><Username>whopperkaraoke</Username><Timestamp>1365857531692</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-13 08:52:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365866656934-3</Id><Title>Oh no say it isn't so!</Title><Msg>A federal study by NOAA has revealed that last years "extreme drought" was not caused by "global warming". Oh my! Oh dear! What are we to do! Something that every school child knows to be true (i.e., everything is caused by "global warming") has now been determined to be false. Quick hide this news story, and never let it see the light of day. Fire those idiots at NOAA, and banish them to a penal colony somewhere in Kansas.

Sorry to say, I'm not sure what your result is. You bought a property did some land parcelling, built something with closets, etc., I'm lost. Not sure what any of it meant. No disrespect intended. When I said RE is as vital as telecom and energy, I meant for typical existing homes sales. Not the scenario you wrote about. Here's my definition of RE. I helped our son purchase a home in south O.C., Ca. It cost 475K. He got a re-write mortgage offer 8 months later lowering his rate 1/2% with no closing costs. He took the offer. The home was re-appraised at 525K as required to re-write the new loan. That's the kind of RE I was referring to. Not chopping up land parcels and doing the things you described. For the life of me, I can't figure out what you meant by your property "deteriorated" as well. How did that happen? Don't you maintain your investment? Anyway, I hope I clarified my definition of the RE market "settling down". I was referring to typical retail purchases and sales only. I hope you get my response here and explain a little more of how what you did applies to buying/selling homes. I know this strays from my policy of T topics, but RE and the economy are somewhat relevant. Also, maybe you can prod Wilky to update his average daily profit as I requested. He was non-responsive. The last update he published, came down from 300 (all time high) to 47 bucks a day. I think he likes you better, because he dodges most of my questions about his dealings and opens up to you.</Msg><Username>davemartin74575</Username><Timestamp>1365870805873</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-13 12:33:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365872663696-5</Id><Topic><Title>Oh no say it isn't so!</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1365866656934</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-13 11:24:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I know, I guess it is time to have pity on our poor misguided friends on the left since: o Their religion of man caused global warming has now been proven to be a fake o Their leadership over the last six years (starting January 3, 2007 when they took over congress and the senate) has led to the near bankruptcy of our once great country o Record numbers of American citizens are now on food stamps o Most of the promises made by our "Imperial president" have been broken Maybe it is time to show pity on the poor fools and pray that they just move to Cuba or Venezuela where they can achieve true happiness under a like minded dictator of their choosing.

(named after the man that did it) you will find the major cause of weather changes is our variable star, the Sun. It was published in National Geographic some years back. He studied cores taken from Bristlecone Pines in the White Mountains of California. They are 4,500 years old. The cores picked up certain isotopes related to Solar activity. They tie in closely with hot and cold, wet and dry cycles. But, the boobs would rather believe those trying to make billions off of their lies while putting dictatorial controls on us all.</Msg><Username>lewcor</Username><Timestamp>1365874026598</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-13 13:27:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>14</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365876965869-7</Id><Topic><Title>ATT eps less than dividend</Title><Username>crewface</Username><Timestamp>1365780926962</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-12 11:35:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I was thinking more like a 12 year old...but whatever.</Msg><Username>mikerego19</Username><Timestamp>1365876965869</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-13 14:16:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365877020021-8</Id><Topic><Title>ATT eps less than dividend</Title><Username>crewface</Username><Timestamp>1365780926962</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-12 11:35:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Maybe didn't get to 3rd grade yet?</Msg><Username>mikerego19</Username><Timestamp>1365877020021</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-13 14:17:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365888223438-9</Id><Topic><Title>Oh no say it isn't so!</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1365866656934</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-13 11:24:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>...Oh, great…jon has now teamed up with lew, the noted racist, conspiracy crackpot…what a dynamic duo to be representing the views on any subject of science, much less global warming. You guys are like a couple of kids on the playground just shouting nonsense with no clue whatsoever… (BTW, jon, thanks so much for sharing your fascinating tale of big time real estate transactions. Did I get this right…you were living in a pole barn and you upgraded to a garage?) Okay, lew, here’s the lowdown. You brought up The Eddy Maunder Minimum. Jon, who’s dumber than his puppy, chimed in claiming to be an expert on the subject, but only because he thought you said Eddy Munster. And jon has reason to believe that werewolves are the main cause of climate change, and, thus, every household should have 18 fully automatic guns with unlimited capacity magazines, to kill werewolves, thereby reducing global warming. The Maunder Minimum and Climate Change: Have Historical Records Aided Current Research? John E. Beckman, and Terence J. Mahoney Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias, E-38200 La Laguna, Tenerife, Spain The vested interests on both sides of the argument between the ``greenhouse'' party and the ``solar warming'' party are obvious…In addition, the debate is conditioned by more powerful vested-interest groups. The oil industry in all its guises would obviously like to believe, and would like the public to believe, that greenhouse warming has been greatly exaggerated, and exploits any genuine scientific differences to undermine the credibility of the climatologists. Solar physics has been losing ground steadily…and there is indeed much work to be done in the field, but one should be aware of the political background to this delicate issue, and not fall into the trap of using possible solar warming as an excuse for delay in reducing man-made emissions of greenhouse gases. Whatever the magnitude of the effects of these in the long term, there is no doubt that their concentration has increased dramatically in the past 30 years, and that for many reasons this is not a desirable path to follow.” …unless you’re jon or lew.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1365888223438</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-13 17:23:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>15</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365895461824-10</Id><Topic><Title>Oh no say it isn't so!</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1365866656934</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-13 11:24:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And there you have it, one little pitiful response from the "environmental socialist" religious group. Maybe they are learning that the science for man caused global warming is just not there. Never fear though, because just when you think that most educated people would have come to the correct conclusion regarding man caused global warming, one of the man caused global warming shamans will appear waving a bone in the air and shouting "see we told you a virgin needs to be sacrificed at the altar of Al Gore's manbearpig". Hopefully there are enough real climate scientist now, who can come to our rescue and points out the fallacy of their argument, and we can all say with some certainty that the manbearpig is dead once and for all.
