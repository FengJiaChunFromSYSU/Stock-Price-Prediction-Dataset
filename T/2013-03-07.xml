Therein lies a good part of the problem...'he didn't roll over you'. That is his philosophy, roll over anyone that gets in the way of his ideology. Don't work with them to find a common purpose and meaningful result, don't negotiate...after all he won He does not have the courage or the skills to sit with his detractors or just those that simply disagree with his approach to what he calls governing and work things out. He has to ignore the situation until it is a crisis and then cry that no one will work with him. The members of Congress can't call him into a meeting to resolve differences, protocol says it has to be the other way around and that simply isn't happening and hasn't at any time during his term. That phony, 'public' debate over health care was a joke from the opening gavel and all that happened was him making another speech. One side offering a different opinion or stance on governmental issue is what this style of government is about. The problem is that in Obama's view the perfect government is a ONE PARTY government doing as they are told...by him. You and those that think like you can’t see the forest for the trees and don’t want to consider moving to a place with a more responsible and clear vision. Those that differ from you are in our opinion just stupid, lazy and ignorant...exactly the Presidents opinion of the American people.</Msg><Username>winholder</Username><Timestamp>1362668083451</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-07 09:54:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362668181123-18</Id><Topic><Title>Frewfrewwillie AKA jon3retiree !!</Title><Username>zonbac98</Username><Timestamp>1362601117251</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-06 15:18:37 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You're right Echo, finally.

I own three houses without mortgages and i didn't inherit any of it. I must admit that I owe much of it to the GI Bill that got me through the last two years of college. I also owe a lot to my dad who lost all but one of his 32 rental houses in the great depression and never complained but went to work mowing lawns for 50 cents an hour to feed our family of 5. We didn't even know we were poor and never asked for welfare. By what stretch of your imagination did you come up with "forcing the US Government into default when it has the ability to pay its bills," The lack of the ability to pay its bills is what the conservative complaint is all about. The ability to borrow and print money is outside the conservative definition because it is not sustainable. Liberals are all concerned about sustainable energy sources except when it comes to money.</Msg><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1362681576035</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-07 13:39:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362681886564-39</Id><Topic><Title>Top Analyst UPGRADES AT&amp;T</Title><Username>whitlockjohn510</Username><Timestamp>1361876686315</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 06:04:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>useful info</Msg><Username>johnmorrill470</Username><Timestamp>1362681886564</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-07 13:44:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362682175721-40</Id><Topic><Title>OOPS!

Oh I forgot, Obama did, and he just wants more taxes and then more taxes on top of those. I say 'they' because I am not a Tea Party member or supporter, but at least they want to do SOMETHING, which is more than Harry and Nancy want to do. They, meaning the useless Democrats, wait for Obama to say he wants something and for conservatives to protest it and hold a press conference saying that nothing is being done because of Republicans. In the mean time, neither will attempt to get a budget up for a vote or anything else as far as that goes. Again, you can’t see the forest for the trees or better yet the lack of concern and ability for all the press conferences…that accomplish exactly zero! Good job.

It is because Glass-Steagal and other financial regulations prevented another Depression until the 2000's and TARP and Obama's stimulus prevented a complete Depression in 2009. If it wasn't for those things you'd be mowing lawns too. Throw in some GI Bill and its pretty clear you need to pay for your stuff. Think you're right all you want, I don't care. What Das Tea Brain needs to understand is that no one agrees with you. Not economists, not the American people, not even most Republicans. So you don't get to decide what the only acceptable policy is. You think defaulting on our debt, lowering our credit rating, and making everything from mortgages to student loans cost more is better than borrowing or (god forbid) paying for your stuff? The rest of us do not.

Seeing as our President is your main enemy, I suppose your answer would be our own Armed Forces. Despite increase pockets of you ignorant, hillbilly, Rambo wannabe’s, you are vastly outgunned in both brains and power. Go back outside and play paintball with your toothless friend, Ceephus. “The T-Party does not consider disarming American citizens…” More 2nd Amendment scare tactics from ignorant folks like you, aroused by the spokesman for the arms industry, The NRA’s Wayne (‘I know my comb-over makes me look like Hitler…that’s the point – to impress gomers like you’) Pierre. I’ll repost a multitude of quotes from the President trying to assure the lunatic fringe that he’s “not coming after your guns”, if you’ll post even one where he said he was. Or just continue lying, as normal “The T-Party does not consider killing American citizens without a trial…” Hey, Bodean...this from The Wall Street Journal. “...the Obama administration is well within its rights to kill enemies of the country, wherever they may be.” If they’d have been tracking Timothy McVeigh as he pulled up to the Federal Bldg. In Oklahoma City, I’d have certainly hoped they’d have droned his #$%$ a#s. Oh, my, oh, my! It would appear that the reign of terror on the GOP from the Tea Party is showing even further evidence of crumbling. Gee, it’s taken four months after the election for Republicans to start acknowledging that it is crackpots like you that led to their humiliating loss. Their regrouping efforts are now concentrating on silencing you extremists, and heading back to the center, knowing they have no other recourse. Cantor is not the only one on the right to start seeing the error of his ways. Rand (who apparently thinks he’s Pope) Paul, further embarrassed your like-minded Apostles of the Stupid yesterday, with his buffoonish antics while wasting legislators’ time for his own shameless face-time. Here’s JohnMcCain (you remember him, don’t you?...the guy you nominated 4 years ago, then castigated for not being far enough to the right when he lost). This just in...Sara Palin announced today she disagrees with Rand Paul, and thinks droning of moose and drone-clubbing of baby seal pups is guaranteed under the 2nd Amendment. “Golly, gee wilikers...my son Track could even drone the Russians from our front porch,” she added. “Quoting extensively from a Wall Street Journal that mocked Rand Paul, McCain also argued that Paul had belittled the growing use of drones to kill terrorism suspects by invoking the name of Jane Fonda and suggesting a drone could have killed her when she was a Vietnam War protester. ‘I must say that the use of Jane Fonda's name does evoke certain memories with me, and I must say that she is not my favorite American. But I also believe that, as odious as it was, Ms. Fonda acted within her constitutional rights, and to somehow say that someone who disagrees with American policy -- and even may demonstrate against it -- is somehow a member of an organization which makes that individual an enemy combatant is simply false,’ McCain said, hitting his lectern for emphasis. ‘IT IS SIMPLY FALSE’!” Better yet, Paul’s pathetic attempt to seem even more ridiculous than Strom Thurmond’s (Rep., S.C.) 1957 24 hour filibuster trying to block The Civil Rights Act, incurred the wrath of another South Carolina Republican, Lindsey Graham "I was going to vote against him until the filibuster, so he picked up one vote," Graham said, laughing to reporters in the Capitol. “Where were all these people (tea party dirtballs, emphasis added) during the Bush administration? I never remember anybody accusing President Bush of 'We're going to kill someone in a cafe’.”Graham said. You guys are finished. What to do? Oh, maybe create some more silly aliases...we’re all really fooled. You guys just get wackier and wackier, and in your heart, you know you’re (way too far) right.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1362684485630</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-07 14:28:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362686806199-47</Id><Topic><Title>Detailed AT&amp;T Research Report !!!</Title><Username>ashleyjones221</Username><Timestamp>1362156250127</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 11:44:10 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>thanks a lot</Msg><Username>shirley_lock</Username><Timestamp>1362686806199</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-07 15:06:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362687012110-48</Id><Topic><Title>AT&amp;T Upgraded to STRONG BUY !</Title><Username>marymitchell773</Username><Timestamp>1362510364800</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 14:06:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>thanks a lot</Msg><Username>shirley_lock</Username><Timestamp>1362687012110</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-07 15:10:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362689615401-49</Id><Topic><Title>Top Analyst UPGRADES AT&amp;T</Title><Username>whitlockjohn510</Username><Timestamp>1361876686315</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 06:04:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good news</Msg><Username>bryantmicheal280</Username><Timestamp>1362689615401</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-07 15:53:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362690653643-50</Id><Topic><Title>$ T Featured on MAD MONEY</Title><Username>kevinlee899</Username><Timestamp>1361805521276</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 10:18:41 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>These people always right</Msg><Username>carsonboston</Username><Timestamp>1362690653643</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-07 16:10:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362690976328-51</Id><Topic><Title>Detailed AT&amp;T Research Report !!!</Title><Username>ashleyjones221</Username><Timestamp>1362156250127</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 11:44:10 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>good report!</Msg><Username>wlarson203</Username><Timestamp>1362690976328</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-07 16:16:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362690981877-52</Id><Topic><Title>AT&amp;T Insiders SELLING?!

AND I found myself trying to comprehend a "foreign accent", and she was reading from a script (oh geez). Well, she said the earliest she could sched. someone was 'Saturday', then asked if someone would be at home 'all day' between 9 am. &amp; 7 pm. so the "tech" could get in the house? Since I knew the trouble was outside ... I kinda did a little chain jerking .. (chuckles) My response threw her a curve when I told her "NO" ... because I'm a single home owner, I'm rural, I have errands to run on Saturdays, and she will have to be more specific than to monopolize my entire day !! I started negotiating for a 3 hour time window, AND for an earlier day than Saturday !! I had her all befuddled ... then I finally told her that I don't have the "in-house service plan", so the tech doesn't need to get in ... and also, that it was a group of houses in my area that had no service, it was probably.storm related &amp; I didn't need to have an apointment (but she still tried, bless her heart ?) .. smiles !! Mmm, I really didn't realize that VZ had opened 'call centers abroad' ... and they're 'reading from a script' - OH I just couldn't resist that moment (LOL) Sooo, my landline was back on about 8 am this morning .. and I didn't even have open my interface, or get my handset out ... :-)</Msg><Username>coolin_out47</Username><Timestamp>1362702769868</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-07 19:32:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362708981308-60</Id><Topic><Title>AT&amp;T SUCKS!
