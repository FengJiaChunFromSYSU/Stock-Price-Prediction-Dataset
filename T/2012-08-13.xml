How do you pretend to lecture people when you can’t even spell a former President’s name? You are a moron, whose only experience is that of a multi-aliased, message board, boiler room clown. I think it’s high time you move on to a career upgrade.

He was considered the FBI’s top man on terrorism. In the late 1990’s, he became very attuned to Is_rael’s involvement in many terror operations. The 1993 Bombing At The World Trade Center Following the bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993, he had become the foremost expert on the global threat from terrorism John O'Neill Suspected The Is_raeli Agent, Abu Nidal Abu Nidal was the leader of the infamous Black September terror organization, and spent 30 years hijacking jets and planting bombs for Is_rael intelligence. O'Neill suspected Abu Nidal was a Mossad operative and talked openly about it with other field agents. O'Neill Was Sent To Investigate the USS Cole Attack He took a team of FBI agents to Yemen, where his investigation pointed to Is_raeli involvement. Barbara Bodine - Ambassador to Yemen During USS Cole Attack Bodine, who is Je_wish, was the Ambassador to Yemen. When the USS Cole was attacked, the FBI sent a team led by John O’Neill who immediately suspected Is_raeli involvement. Bodine started an intense political battle to oust O’Neill. Bodine wanted to control the investigation, and resented the fact that suddenly there were hundreds of FBI personnel in the country. Albright provided a handful of State Department personnel to watch the investigation. Albright and Bodine Panic as O’Neill Investigation Points to Is_rael Albright complains to upper echelons of the FBI about O'Neill. Bodine wanted O'Neill to drop his bodyguards and he became suspicious of Mossad assassination. Bodine and Madeleine Albright finally went to the Zi_onist Je_wish FBI Director, Louis Freeh, to remove John O'Neill from Yemen. Then January 2001 came, and O'Neill wanted to go back to Yemen. But, Ambassador Bodine wouldn't give him clearance. In July 2001, O’Neill resigned from the FBI. Larry Silverstein Offered Him a Job In September of 2001, mere days before 9/11, he got a job offer from Larry Silverstein (owner of WTC). Oddly, O'Neill was missing for two days before 9/11 –miraculously his body was discovered in tact in the WTC ruins.</Msg><Username>mel_gibson_101</Username><Timestamp>1344875830000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 12:37:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344877492000-18</Id><Topic><Title>Strike in DIST 9?</Title><Username>josieinib</Username><Timestamp>1344298108000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 20:08:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Speaking of Dumb...</Msg><Username>lv66vette</Username><Timestamp>1344877492000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 13:04:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344878020000-19</Id><Topic><Title>Economic Fairness in Obummer's 2nd Term</Title><Username>robfisk</Username><Timestamp>1344517169000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-09 08:59:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You mean the Ryan that only sponsored 2 bills in 13 years in Congress?
