I suggest a shotgun. Try not to lose any fingers (especially you, robfisk).. But I don't think turning our schools into armed camps is any type of solution for anything. You want to see more kids get shot? Put guns in the schools. After all, why make the shooter actually purchase and bring a gun into the school? That's inefficient.

The story goes, some repairman, meter reader, had to get in the basement. The wife let him go down there to check on something. The poor guy was down there with his flashlight, looking at the meter, and he felt someone/some thing put a hand on his shoulder. He turned, flashed the light on the ape's face.
