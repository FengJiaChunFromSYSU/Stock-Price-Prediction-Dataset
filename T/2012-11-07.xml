This next four years won't be about the American people or their problems but his ego. Sad commentary when the majority of the people polled said the economy was the number one issue and they felt Romney would handle the economic problems better but the free loaders outvoted common sense. Too many politicians and business leaders in the country are caught up in today so deeply they can't see tomorrow. We should hold a wake today. This is the death of our country as we know it, it died today and the cause of death is liberalism...the same things that history tells us killed all the great empires. The so-called have not’s still don’t have it and won’t get it.

Dividend growth also adds to the overall valuation of the stock and investments to the assets.

Perhaps there is hope for us after all. DIVORCE AGREEMENT THIS IS SO INCREDIBLY WELL PUT AND I CAN HARDLY BELIEVE IT'S BY A YOUNG PERSON, A STUDENT!!! WHATEVER HE RUNS FOR, I'LL VOTE FOR HIM. Dear American liberals, leftists, social progressives, socialists, Marxists and Obama supporters, et al: We have stuck together since the late 1950's for the sake of the kids, but the whole of this latest election process has made me realize that I want a divorce. I know we tolerated each other for many years for the sake of future generations, but sadly, this relationship has clearly run its course. Our two ideological sides of America cannot and will not ever agree on what is right for us all, so let's just end it on friendly terms. We can smile and chalk it up to irreconcilable differences and go our own way. Here is a our separation agreement: --Our two groups can equitably divide up the country by landmass each taking a similar portion. That will be the difficult part, but I am sure our two sides can come to a friendly agreement. After that, it should be relatively easy! Our respective representatives can effortlessly divide other assets since both sides have such distinct and disparate tastes. --We don't like redistributive taxes so you can keep them. --You are welcome to the liberal judges and the ACLU. --Since you hate guns and war, we'll take our firearms, the cops, the NRA and the military. --We'll take the nasty, smelly oil industry and the coal mines, and you can go with wind, solar and biodiesel. --You can keep Oprah, Michael Moore and Rosie O'Donnell. You are, however, responsible for finding a bio-diesel vehicle big enough to move all three of them. --We'll keep capitalism, greedy corporations, pharmaceutical companies, Wal-Mart and Wall Street. --You can have your beloved lifelong welfare dwellers, food stamps, homeless, homeboys, hippies, druggies and illegal aliens. --We'll keep the hot Alaskan hockey moms, greedy CEO's and rednecks --We'll keep Bill O?Reilly, and Bibles and give you NBC and Hollywood . --You can make nice with Iran and Palestine and we'll retain the right to invade and hammer places that threaten us. --You can have the peaceniks and war protesters. When our allies or our way of life are under assault, we'll help provide them security. --We'll keep our Judeo-Christian values. --You are welcome to Islam, Scientology, Humanism, political correctness and Shirley McClain. You can also have the U.N. but we will no longer be paying the bill. --We'll keep the SUV's, pickup trucks and oversized luxury cars. You can take every Volt and Leaf you can find. --You can give everyone healthcare if you can find any practicing doctors. --We'll continue to believe healthcare is a luxury and not a right. --We'll keep "The Battle Hymn of the Republic" and "The National Anthem." --I'm sure you'll be happy to substitute "Imagine", "I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing", "Kum Ba Ya" or "We Are the World". --We'll practice trickle-down economics and you can continue to give trickle up poverty your best shot. --Since it often so offends you, we'll keep our history, our name and our flag. Would you agree to this? If so, please pass it along to other like-minded liberal and conservative patriots and if you do not agree, just hit delete. In the spirit of friendly parting, I'll bet you might think about which one of us will need whose help in 15 years.

I cannot believe you even show up here.. you should be home licking your wounds, apologizing to family and friends for making such a fool out of yourself all these years. And if you did stop by, you might at least acknowledge that you were wrong on all accounts. But not you…it’s not your fault that everybody else sees the world differently than you. I’m not normally one to throw salt in the wounds, and I had no intention of coming here to gloat today. But when people like you keep attempting to subvert the truth for the gain of the select few, it seems you need something more than reality to smack you upside the head. Of the nine battleground states, you only won ONE of them –North Carolina. You couldn’t even win your VP’s home state of Wisconsin, or four out of the five states where Romney has houses…but, hey, at least the brethren in Utah stuck by him. “Let's see how you feel when Congress remains deadlocked because there is no compromise on the left” “I don’t think he should expect much cooperation” Unbelievable…yesterday’s results show everyone else that America is fed up with the originators of “no compromise”…the Tea Party, Grover Norquist and insipid little creatures like you who speak for them. But somehow, YOU didn’t understand that, and you’re back trying to rearrange the facts, even in the face of an overwhelming defeat. You got your butts kicked…what don’t you understand about that? “Let's see how you feel when the terrorist figure out that our President won't attack them…” Let’s see how YOU feel when YOU figure out that the American people have spoken…they do not want goofy, jingoistic, gun-slinger-chicken hawks like you, Bush, Cheney and Mitt threatening civilization…and neither does the rest of the world (which, incidentally, is rejoicing at yesterday’s events.) Oh, that’s right, you don’t care about the rest of the world, the middle class, or anyone other than yourself…because in your own perverted view, you represent the ugly American of a bygone era who thinks they are the custodians of humanity and the planet – the “I’ve got mine and screw my neighbors” crowd of bitter, old, narrow-minded, intolerant white guys, afraid of any type of change to the good ol’ boy status quo. Hey, you wanna’ start a war with Iran…go have at it…and take jon, dale, et. al. with you…but don’t claim to be representing the United States…because you don’t. Good grief, you guys can’t even win your War on Women, and you want to take on the world. You’re the angry and ignorant drunk at the party of mankind pickin’ fights with little people. “Sad commentary when the majority of the people polled said blah, blah, blah…” I believe polling is over, my friend, isn’t it? Didn’t you say something to the effect of “the polls don’t matter…anybody can get the polling results they want…what matters is what happens on election day”? To be back here today with the same tired refrain is absolutely pathetic. If it’s not the media’s fault, it’s the 47%, or government regulators, or environmentalists, or the atheists, or the Kenyan’s or anybody but you. And you are an absolute coward to be here today whining that everybody but you is wrong. What’s wrong is when people lose a fair, democratic election, and instead of manning up and moving forward, continue to harp that they lost to the freeloading masses of the impoverished. You have a great front man in Donald Trump, who like you, is crying like a spoiled brat. You lost alright, but it wasn’t to those you want to blame…it was to the majority of Americans who do not agree with anything that you represent. And you didn’t just lose…you got your collective clocks cleaned. So go ahead and start making excuses and tell us how the House is going to cause an economic melt-down rather than compromise. Try that, and you’ll see some real House, housecleaning in ’14. You’re a lying, deceitful coward. Having said that, it’s been just peachy debating with you. It’s been like discussing philosophy with Honey Boo Boo. Give my best to Dale. And buy jon a dictionary. Oh! Did I mention…? You LOST.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1352323400653</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 16:23:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352323720660-91</Id><Topic><Title>T going back down like all dividend stocks, going a lot lower tax hikes on dividends not priced in yet, Dividend we need to be close to 7% before T hits bottom</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1352312606134</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 13:23:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ok fine - buy PG?
