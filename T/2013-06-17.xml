The actions of the President and Congress are to be first and foremost in the best interests of the United States of America. If these trips have benefited the U.S. in some economic fashion such as increased trade, it can be measured. If it is simply a political trip that will do nothing more than create a desire for more of these local resident to immigrate here, we likely have all we can use thank you. A good number of these African countries are Islamic majorities; most Islamic saturated nations hate us and will after such an expensive trip. Invite the leaders of their countries to visit here. That will not only be significantly less expensive, but it will give them first hand information on what America is really like. If we want them to trade with us, they only need to know the economic advantages for their country to make a decision. These trips were and will be a complete waste of taxpayer dollars, time, and energy. This country's economy still needs significant improvements, our jobs totals need to increase dramatically.

I "did not" run to Canada in July of 1966 .. and I was "honorably discharged" in July 1968 - after serving in Germany &amp; Viet Nam ... fullfiling my 6 yr obligation of being born an American Male ... Thank you for your service in "The Corps" - (not the Obama corpse) So gently shove your "freaked out" presumption where your freaked out 'sun don't shine' - ya freaked out 'obozmo brown-noser' It's very funny .. what I witnessed in Viet Nam was idiots (perhaps like you) that wanted to " r i o t " .. when MLK was assinated ... but you nor 'obozmo" want to live by MLK's preachings !! Are you one that just enjoys playing a "race card" (??) as those soldiers in Viet Nam did .. and NOW board racist do, and all following in your sacred EL BONGO's footsteps ?? SO don't you worry YOUR little bobble-head about my "free speech" .. and don't freak out .. just have a nice day - smiles !!</Msg><Username>echo.2l65</Username><Timestamp>1371506449578</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 18:00:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371506927403-40</Id><Topic><Title>THIS IS A TEST</Title><Username>zbgb952</Username><Timestamp>1371487424663</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 12:43:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>For another one of your Aliase's</Msg><Username>bshipleyinsurance</Username><Timestamp>1371506927403</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 18:08:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371506940206-41</Id><Topic><Title>Obama admin denies aid to West Texas blast victims</Title><Username>ricky1820l</Username><Timestamp>1371228218990</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 12:43:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thank goodness Obama was not in office on when terrorists flew planes into the WTC that was not a natural disaster either and he probably would have denied aid for those impacted in that event as well.</Msg><Username>geoff_holt_2001</Username><Timestamp>1371506940206</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 18:09:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371506992078-42</Id><Topic><Title>What a great country we live in.</Title><Username>usmc_1964</Username><Timestamp>1371501191577</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 16:33:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>OOPS .. no disrespect intended on my mis-spell "assassinated"</Msg><Username>echo.2l65</Username><Timestamp>1371506992078</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 18:09:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371507905759-43</Id><Topic><Title>Interesting item regarding pay for volunteer fire fighters.</Title><Username>lewcor</Username><Timestamp>1371320958123</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 14:29:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Volunteers, volunteer to give up days, nights and weekends to remain near the fire station to be available if a call comes in for which they then get paid to respond to the station and the incident as opposed to full time fire fighters who get paid to sit and sleep at the station waiting for calls.</Msg><Username>emil_chesibilski</Username><Timestamp>1371507905759</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 18:25:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371508761484-44</Id><Topic><Title>Obama admin denies aid to West Texas blast victims</Title><Username>ricky1820l</Username><Timestamp>1371228218990</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 12:43:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And after President spoke those words of support and readiness for "support" at the "memorial photo-op" - and after the cameras were gone .. he turned to his staff and said ..
