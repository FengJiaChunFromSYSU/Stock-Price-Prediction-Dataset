Ending overpayments to Medicare Advantage insurers: We currently pay private insurers 17% more to insure a Medicare beneficiary than the public program does. These overpayments were done to encourage start ups. But like many things, they were never repealed. It is time for private Medicare Advantage programs to do what they promised: provide insurance more efficiently than the government. These cuts have already been made, and in the first year we saw lower premiums and higher enrollment for Medicare Advantage. 2. Lower hospital reimbursement rates: Hospitals agreed to this because they will see less unreimbursed care in their emergency rooms. We currently subsidize unreimbursed hospital care through Medicare overpayments. This was a key part of Romneycare. 3. Everything else: Fraud enforcement. Lower payments to less efficient programs. Savings from Accountable Care Organizations. Savings from better prevention. The things to remember are: 1. There is no cut to benefits--your benefits are the same and guaranteed. 2. There is no increase in Medicare premiums. 3. Savings are used to close the prescription drug doughnut hole and fund free preventive visits, among other things. 4. Romney/Ryan include these savings in their budget proposals. 5. The Romney/Ryan voucher plan does not guarantee your benefits (that's left to the market). 6. The Romney/Ryan voucher plan will cut even more from Medicare payments (limits spending Medicare Spending to CPI+1% per year, far below historical trends). 7. The Romney/Ryan plan does not place any limits on what insurers charges, meaning they can raise prices far beyond the value of the voucher. Like I said, these Medicare savings are common sense spending cuts. If you can't get behind these, what cuts can you get behind? Other than cutting Elmo, that is?</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1349443581389</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 09:26:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349443814710-7</Id><Topic><Title>Obama begins policy to deny care to elderly</Title><Username>ricky1820l</Username><Timestamp>1349139815394</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 21:03:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"And you're messiah has been balking us for 4 years now" Really?

Why are you quoting me data from 2007 and 2008? We lost 3.6 million payroll jobs in 2008. In January of 2009 we lost 818,000 payroll jobs--that is a 9.8 million annualized rate. Now we are gaining jobs. Quite a few. In fact, we are gaining a million more jobs a month than we were when Obama took office, aren't we? It takes some time to get that sort of devastation turned around. The CPS shows 2.9 million jobs added over the past 12 months, 3.6 over the past 24 months. The CES shows 1.8 million payroll jobs added of the past 12 months, 3.6 million in the past 24. The BLS has already reported early QCEW numbers, which indicate CES will be adjusted UP to match CPS for the past 12 months, when the annual matching to state UI databases occurs. But I think the most important thing to learn here is the consistency you tea party types display. Even in a thread in which you have been called out on it, you call BLS numbers a lie when you think they go against your partisan slant, and then cite them when you think they support your partisan slant.

However, little Justin was being uncharacteristically quiet, so when the teacher prodded him about his father, he replied, "My father's an exotic dancer in a gay cabaret and takes off all his clothes to music in front of other men and they put money in his underwear. Sometimes, if the offer is really good, he will go home with some guy and stay with him all night for money." The teacher, obviously shaken by this statement, hurriedly set the other children to work on some exercises and took little Justin aside."Is that really true about your father?" "No," the boy said, "He works for the Democratic National Committee and is helping to get Obama re-elected, but it's too embarrassing to say that in front of the other kids."</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1349464167458</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 15:09:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349466399665-32</Id><Topic><Title>Is this our October surprise?</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1349442725837</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 09:12:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ricky, couple of points: o I never said that I doubted the numbers that come from the BLS o The two dates picked were the two peak dates for the CES and the CPS Based upon your logic one would need to deduce that no one has been added to the work force since the current occupier of the white house took office. On the contrary in mid 2009 the population of the United States was about 307 million, today the current population is 314.5 million, and I would be inclined to believe that some of those 7.5 million people have been added to the work force. My real point is that the pool of people available for employment has increased since 2009 yet the total number employed has decreased since then, and this has been considered an example of success by some.

However, you are not the sharpest pencil in the drawer if this is where you go for stock information. Serious investors have serious information about the market. This is just plain old people who have opinions, ideas, and a little info here and there; serious info by someone with credentials would be severely fined if they were found here giving advice on this or any other stock, commodity, bond, derivative, etc. Brain dead.....hey, you'll fit right in here.

If you want MSNBC, the Obama government channel....heck, there might be a few who are left-winged individuals here with whom you can bond.Now echo.....naw, he's kind of down the middle........he likes the debate and the ability to show his refined superiority of the written word. If you're looking for relevant information about T, you need to seek out a relevant sight that provides paid information, or go to relevant stock financials. What you're looking for is illegal on any of these free talk boards. Sorry. However, if stock opinion is what you're looking for, I can offer up my right wing, very pro-American opinion........all stocks are high, no one actually knows why, there are no statistics to say why this market has moved so high, only speculation.It follows no basic patterns. However, it is widely perceived extreme caution should be taken at this time. Earnings season is close and historically, you should already know this......the market usually has a good size correction......that is not a given, just historical. There are no absolutes in this market because it makes no sense to those who normally make sense of the market. When I have a good earnings, I take profits in this environment. I am a gold holder, but I would not buy at these levels, though it is predicted to go much higher and the Fed is burning the midnight oil on the printing presses diluting the dollar. We are in inflation, though the govt says no, my grocery bill and other bills say otherwise. I've seen this before and nobody tells you the status of the economy until you're out of it. Don't expect anyone to give you the answer, you have money, spend it, so you already have an idea about how much money you have spent in the past to the money you spend now. You have a brain so you use it. You do not need anyone to tell you what the condition of the condition is.

I had to eliminate a great deal of information. Those people I'm reporting took me for almost 600.00 before I noticed it on my credit card. It's very cleverly hidden unless you look very carefully. My credit card company made my money good by taking those charges off that go way back to November, 2011. I ordered my granddaughter a "pillow pet" from an infomercial, and that's where I tracked it back. I'm not saying these people did it, but my card information was picked up by that transaction. I save all my bills. I also got sick about that time and just managed to pay the bills in pain, and didn't pay attention. When I did realize it, I went back and found where not only me, but others are being scammed by these people and the money is going out of the country, do not know which country. It's been a headache to straighten out, but the FBI has been great and so has my credit card company. Couldn't ask for better co-operation from both of them. However, it did take time and aggravation to get the information to everybody who needed it. I will be doing things differently in the future.
