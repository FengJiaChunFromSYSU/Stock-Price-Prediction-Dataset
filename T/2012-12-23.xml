Frequent, excusable mistake, but as the mistakes pile up in your posts they diminish the impact and legitimacy of whatever message it is you think you're trying to get across, which, in many cases, I'm not convinced anyone other than you understands or cares about. A 4 y/o dog is not a "puppy"; you should try to keep both it and yourself out of the middle of the road no matter what you are each doing with your respective or conjoined "parts".</Msg><Username>geoff_holt_2000</Username><Timestamp>1356239742252</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 00:15:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356239949546-3</Id><Topic><Title>Cars versus guns...</Title><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1355946081474</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 14:41:21 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ah, Terrel, there's the old Christian spirit.
