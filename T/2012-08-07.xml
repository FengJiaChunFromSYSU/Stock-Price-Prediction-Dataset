Definitely possible, especially if they are stationed overseas. The military doesn't really make soldiers available for public opinion polls and the military discourages soldiers from expressing political positions. So always take these polls with a grain of salt. Pollster tend to come at the opinion of military personnel from different angles, including polls of military families and recent vets. When these two things converge, you can kind of triangulate military positions. Throw in the fundraising edge from military personnel going to Obama, and you get confirmation. The issue seems to be dissatisfaction with Republican adventurism. Ron Paul had the edge in the primaries. Once he was out, military support went to Obama. And why not? His foreign policy has been aggressive, subtle and effective but not warmongering. And the military is predominantly made up of young Americans. Throw in the sequestration debacle and why would anyone in the military support Republicans? &gt;&gt;&gt;he wouldn't try to make it more difficult for military from Ohio to vote. So you've said. I'll throw that claim in with his secret commie father.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1344359171000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 13:06:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344359663000-24</Id><Topic><Title>T looks dead for now...</Title><Username>mikerego19</Username><Timestamp>1344358903000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 13:01:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It is probably a good time to sell covered calls.

The presidential campaign for presumptive GOP nominee Mitt Romney asked the state board to look into whether the Washington, D.C.-based group committed voter fraud by using magazine subscription lists to mail registration forms to children, dead people and household pets, as first reported in the Richmond Times-Dispatch. After the state board declined to investigate, the Voter Participation Center posted a news release on its website, saying: “This is a win for the citizens of Virginia who want to participate in the democratic process and an affirmation that the VPC program is legal, helpful and essential.” - end So you castigate grass roots political initiatives to get citizens involved in the political process, while you’re secretly working to deny them those rights.

This is going to end with with all of our children working for Walmart (min wage and no benefits) if people don't wise up and start supporting each other.. 22,000 AT&amp;T workers are on strike right now because they don't want their pensions robbed and their healthcare gutted. The company makes billions in profit and the CEO's salary is 25 million dollars a year. Caterpillar is a prosperous company, The stock is surging --- but that does not seem to stop the corporate suits from demanding major givebacks of the employees. Pay freezes, pension freezes, it's all fair game. The Caterpillar employees are on strike right now rather than sell future generations down the river. There was just a one month lockout at Con Edison, another prosperous company, where the 11 million dollar a year CEO locked out 8500 employees and immediately canceled their health insurance! Their stock was at an all time high but the executives still wanted givebacks related to pensions, healthcare, and other things.. Governor Cuomo had to step into the negotiations to get them back to work. Verizon is reportedly very close to locking out it's 45,000 employees.The company is a money making machine. The top 5 executives have been paid 350 million dollars over the past 5 years yet they are demanding everything under the sun back from the employees. Pensions, healthcare, sicktime, overtime etc.... And they are sending lots of American jobs to India and the Philippines. Seems to me profitable corporations are doing their best to kill the American middle class even as they enjoy tax breaks and get favorable legislation from the politicians that are supposed to be representing "the people".
