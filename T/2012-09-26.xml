I had a used car dealer beat me out of a small deposit I made on a car. I was 17 and my dad wouldn't okay me buying it. I went back one night and used a spike to scratch every car in the lot from front to back. I won't let people get away with that sort of thing… Only problem was, the security cameras caught the whole thing. I’m not too smart now, but I was REALLY stupid back then. Remember, I did about $400,000 in damage to all those cars, which I figured was justifiable. I mean, after all, I had put $35 bucks down on that used Ford Pinto. The cops called my dad, who took me out back and beat the crap out of me for two hours. He then marched me over to the car dealer, a 72 year old, who weighed about 112 pounds. HE then beat the crap out of me again. The guy’s disabled wife got out of her wheelchair and b #tch-slapped me with a hubcap. Then their three kids, all less than 12, pantsed me, tied me up, yanked out all my nose hairs, tarred and feathered me, and put me on display in the showroom for the whole weekend as the hood ornament on a Mustang, while they marched all my Junior High classmates (I know I was 17, but I was held back, like 5 times – plus I was sickly) around me to teach them a lesson. Man, next to working this cubicle now, that’s probably been my most embarrassing moment. If that wasn’t bad enough, my Dad had to sell our house and all of our personal belongings, which paid only a portion of the damage I did. My parents got divorced, my dad’s girlfriend dumped him, my one brother lost his job with the Sanitation Department, my other brother who had driven me to the Dealership was busted for a parole violation and went back to the slammer, my one sister got fired from the shrimp boat, the other one had to go to double-shifts at the brothel, and all of our family and relatives were forced into indentured servitude washing cars at the Ford Dealer for about a decade. Yep, it was a bum deal, but I figure it was well worth it. Taking the law into your own hands can be pretty gratifying. Later I’ll tell you the story about how, when the library charged me an extra day’s fine, I torched the Rare Books Collection, shot silly-string over the entire Reference Section, rearranged all the Dewey Decimal numbers and gave the librarian a wedgie. Unfortunately, she beat me like a seal pup with an 8-pound Unabridged Dictionary and called the cops. I did two years in Juvie for that one, where I had numerous opportunities to get my GED, and was fairly close on one attempt…not REAL close, but, hey… At any rate, I learned my lesson. First, don’t hang around in libraries (which isn’t really a problem for me). And second, next time, I’ll knock out the security cameras first thing.”</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1348661843556</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 08:17:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348665612034-3</Id><Topic><Title>Detained for paying by cash at FL toll booth</Title><Username>lavendersin</Username><Timestamp>1348509904633</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 14:05:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Your not forced to live anywhere, Lavendar.

Now almost everyone admits it was a planned attack. He has been quoted as saying that if unemployment is still above 8%, he would probably not be reelected. It is still above 8% and there are millions that have stopped collecting UE because they have been out of work too long. The government says they have stopped looking for work. No they haven’t; they are still looking and not finding work but Obama doesn’t count them any longer because they are not collecting UE benefits, instead they are collecting SS disability and/or food stamps. They are still unemployed even if they aren’t counted. He promised to fix the economy. He failed, miserably. He promised not to allow lobbyist or former lobbyist to be part of his administration. He failed miserably. He promised to have open dialogue with the leaders of countries that hated us and to create a new, gentler relationship with those leaders. They would trust him and learn to trust the US. He failed miserably. He over invested in green energy companies that failed. He won’t allow some banks to pay back their stimulus money, he made some accept it even if they didn’t want or need it. He is corrupt. His would be the most open and sharing administration in decades he promised. He would post bill that were passed and he would sign on the Internet for days before he actually signed them. He failed miserably. He has appointed staff that are admitted socialists and Communists. He has an adviser that is not a cabinet member that has been afforded Secret Service protection. He called the police stupid and ignorant before he even knew all the facts. His Sec. of Treasury cheated on his taxes, lied about it, and is a former WS executive. He spends more time on the golf course and vacation at times when his attention is needed on the country’s business. He is a racist. He needs to be gone. He is a failure.</Msg><Username>winholder</Username><Timestamp>1348673343672</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 11:29:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348674091962-6</Id><Topic><Title>Dem Polls aren't what they Seem</Title><Username>robfisk</Username><Timestamp>1348445228622</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-23 20:07:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Polls don't or shouldn't elect anyone. The problem is that the large population of voters that listen to the MSM, the polls numbers released and make a decision to vote based on very little information about the candidates or what they plan to do to or for this country. Obama caters to the masses of the uneducated, unsophisticated, government dependent or wanting to be dependent for support. He is buying their votes with what Washington refers to as government money. It is not government money, it is our money, but he and Congress no longer care about that distinction. The welfare crowd, the habitual food stamp collectors, the black, the illegal’s, and/or their families, the Hollywood rich and the morally defunct liberal elitist are his supporters. He has not kept his campaign promises and many of them he hasn’t even attempted to keep. He had complete control of Congress for the first two years and all he used that power for was to give away money, put us deeper in debt, and create a healthcare program that will inflate the bureaucracy, create more taxes, add more government control over of everyday lives and continue to drive up unemployment. He is a failure of massive proportions and needs to be removed from our lives and government.</Msg><Username>winholder</Username><Timestamp>1348674091962</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 11:41:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348674299213-7</Id><Topic><Title>Detained for paying by cash at FL toll booth</Title><Username>lavendersin</Username><Timestamp>1348509904633</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 14:05:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There were no security cameras in 1950.

Now, according to recent news reports, I'm afraid Chris Dodd may just get his way. The Obama Administration is busy circulating a five-page draft of an Executive Order giving the President control over virtually all private communication systems in America under the guise of "national security." This is nothing more than an end run around Congress who - thanks to the help of Campaign for Liberty - just blocked a bill with similar provisions last month. Under the guise of improving broadband service, the FCC is launching an unprecedented assault on the American people, collecting all types of personal information from law-abiding citizens without their knowledge. Under this scheme, government bureaucrats are scheming to get our physical home address associated with our computer’s IP address.</Msg><Username>pinhighshot</Username><Timestamp>1348674586592</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 11:49:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348674712836-10</Id><Title>The Dictator</Title><Msg>This should both get your attention and scare the hell out of you: EXECUTIVE ORDERS ISSUED BY OUR PRESIDENTS… Teddy Roosevelt 3 Others to FDR NONE FDR 11 in 16 years Truman 5 in 7 years Ike 2 in 8 years Kennedy 4 in 3 years LBJ 4 in 5 years Nixon 1 in 6 years Ford 3 in 2 years Carter 3 in 4 years Reagan 5 in 8 years Bush 3 in 4 years Clinton 15 in 8 years George W.

How many warnings do you need? 923 Executive Orders in 40 Months. During our lifetime, all Presidents have issued Executive Orders, for reasons that vary. When a President issued as many as 30 Ex. Orders during a term in office, people thought there was something amiss. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT 923 EX. ORDERS IN ONE PART OF ONE TERM? YES, THERE IS A REASON. THIS PRESIDENT IS DETERMINED TO TAKE CONTROL AWAY FROM THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE. He has decided what is best for this country!!! Even some Democrats in the House have turned on him. But actually very small number of Democrat Senators even question him or care. Not really surprising that he appointed "Czars" to be in charge of everything. THIS IS NOT FUNNY, AND IF YOU VOTE FOR HIM AGAIN, YOU CAN EXPECT MORE! Remember what he told Russia's Putin: "I'll be more flexible after I'm re-elected".

It also provides that when a state of emergency is declared by the President, Congress cannot review the action for six months. (Huh?) Just this week, he has issued a new executive order that seeks to "harmonize" U.S. economic regulations with the rest of the world. This new executive order is yet another incremental step that is pushing us closer to a North American Union and a one world economic system. Unfortunately, most Americans have absolutely no idea what is happening…..Do you??? The American people need to understand that Barack Obama is constantly looking for ways to integrate the United States more deeply with the rest of the world. The globalization of the world economy has accelerated under Obama, and this latest executive order represents a fundamental change in U.S. economic policy. Now federal regulators will be required to "harmonize" their work with the international community.</Msg><Username>pinhighshot</Username><Timestamp>1348674853025</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 11:54:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348676476071-12</Id><Topic><Title>Christians fight HHS mandate</Title><Username>geoff_holt_2001</Username><Timestamp>1347728733761</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 13:05:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"She also claimed to have met the child-Jesus several times in 1995 during her missionary travel "She also claimed to have met the child-Jesus several times in 1995 during her missionary travel in Columbia, where a life-sized statue of the Infant of Prague, dressed in pink robe came alive, smiled, and spoke to her. If you or I claimed this, we’d be put in a drunk tank, but she parlayed it into making big bucks from the naively faithful." Joseph Smith claimed the Angel Maroni came and gave him the plates from which to translate the Book of Mormon. Moses is said to have talked to God while he was in a burning bush. Jesus is quoted as speaking to God. Mohammed said God sent an angel to him with the words and translation of the Koran. Many Catholic saints have professed to have spoken with God. The Bible is a collection of short stories, many written hundreds of years past the supposed occurrence of the told events. Some were written in Hebrew, some if Greek, some in Amharic and then all translated into Greek, Italian, French, German, Hebrew and English. Many words in the languages these stories were translated from don't have literal or direct translations. Many people with different levels of education, many different biases, and personal interpretations created these translated documents. How do you know they are the literal word of God, which God and how many times were the stores changed during these many translations? Faith you say? Faith is simply a strong belief in something you can't prove. There are so many variations of the word of GOD, who wrote it, who said it, which is the true interpretation? If you have such faith, that is your choice, if not, that also is a personal choice and neither side truly knows which is correct, if either are. You’re just a sanctimonious old fool that pretends to be right about everything.</Msg><Username>pinhighshot</Username><Timestamp>1348676476071</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 12:21:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348677505173-13</Id><Title>Hate Board ?</Title><Msg>There is seldom relevant info about T posted here.

Inflation is MUCH worse than being reported. Read the history of the Weimar Republic of Germany in the 1920's. We are headed down the same path. Know what did best during that time? NOT gold and silver but public utilities. BUT, everything lost value.</Msg><Username>lewcor</Username><Timestamp>1348704785898</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 20:13:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348709222498-28</Id><Topic><Title>Hate Board ?</Title><Username>pcaphodge</Username><Timestamp>1348677505173</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 12:38:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Look hodge, if you want "relevant T info" and you come to a public message board to get it, who is the nut job? Did you expect this board to be some kind of intellectual forum that would help you make an intelligent investment decision? You are one misguided individual if that's the case. Didn't the topics give you a clue of what it is all about here? If you want to see a message board that has "relevant info", go to Facebook and see how they treat a message board. If you want T info, you'll find some occasional good takes here. But for the most part, it is spammers, humor, politics, banter and other assorted whacky topics. Again, if you don't like what you see, move on. You will not change anyone's posting habits.</Msg><Username>davemartin486</Username><Timestamp>1348709222498</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 21:27:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348712019911-29</Id><Topic><Title>Hate Board ?</Title><Username>pcaphodge</Username><Timestamp>1348677505173</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 12:38:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ya start a new thread that ya don' t like what ya see here.
