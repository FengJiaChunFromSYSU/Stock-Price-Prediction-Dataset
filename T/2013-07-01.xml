I started disliking phony Paul when late in the election game he started going out of his way to make it clear he was just as politically correct and multicultural as any liberal when it came to the colored people. I suspect he would have sold out Whites quicker than some of the White liberals, given the chance. Ron Paul is a phony and his son is nauseating too.

Poverty and unrest are spreading quickly as well. The world’s most prominent expert on genocide, President Dr. Gregory Stanton of Genocide Watch, already warned last year that the Afrikaner population could be on the verge of a government-linked extermination campaign. During a fact-finding mission to South Africa, Stanton, who helped fight against apartheid, found evidence implicating the ruling African National Congress (ANC)-South African Communist Party (SACP) government in a plot to eradicate whites as part of a scheme to foist Marxist tyranny on the nation. In fact, after the investigation, WND reported that Genocide Watch raised its alert level on South Africa to stage 6 out of 8 – the planning and preparation phase of the extermination process. “There is thus strong circumstantial evidence of government support for the campaign of forced displacement and atrocities against white farmers and their families,” Stanton said in the Genocide Watch report, Meanwhile, on the economic front, authorities are cracking down on the white minority as well. Through a controversial program known as Black Economic Empowerment (BEE), the government has instituted a race-based employment regime specifically targeting whites. Critics, even among prominent blacks, say the results of BEE have been disastrous. Among the myriad problems associated with the race-based employment system: mass emigration of skilled workers contributing to “brain drain,” soaring poverty rates among whites, chaos for businesses and more.

Johnson pushed through the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964 (outlawing segregation in public places) and his eventual Republican opponent, Sen. Barry Goldwater, opposed it. Johnson got 94 percent of the black vote that year, still a record for any presidential election. The following year Johnson signed the 1965 Voting Rights Act. No Republican presidential candidate has gotten more than 15 percent of the black vote since.” – FactCheck Sure, the Republicans are out to help black folks…just like they help women.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1372682681999</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-01 08:44:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>13</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372683811350-7</Id><Topic><Title>I hate that racist #$%$ Paula Dean, you Phony</Title><Username>lefronczak</Username><Timestamp>1372542804859</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-29 17:53:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Where are you whenever Lav sticks his ugly little mug into the daylight?

(from his U.S.Track Record) Now (today) from Rush, audio of a CNN reporter trying to drum up support for him (BO) in Egypt by suggesting "he" (BO) is supporting the student movement, and CNN want to know how the "students" feel about this - one student replied "it's our fight, and we don't need Obama's WORDS of "support" !! This same CNN reporter then moved on to another "student", and asked the 'same loaded question". This second student replied "Obama has nothing to do with our fight, we must do it ourselves" ... Remember B.O.'s earlier (and current) support of the Mooslem Brotha-hood in Egypt, THEY DO !! .... Yep - B.O. keeps skunking out every where he goes .. and now "he" must deal with the 'late breaking news" (from Snowden) of the U.S. spying on the E.U. Offices, located in the U.S. !! .... (and boy are they pithed) ... Well, so much for our elected "Community Organizer" huh ? So keep your powder dry boys because B.O. is getting the U.S. in alot of trouble all over the world - and I don't know if we can depend on him to defend us .. or our Country .. with his tele-prompter ??(oh well)</Msg><Username>echo.2l65</Username><Timestamp>1372717077683</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-01 18:17:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372719714299-32</Id><Topic><Title>14 REPUBLICANS voted to reward illegal alien lawbreakers</Title><Username>lavendarsen</Username><Timestamp>1372652864809</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-01 00:27:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"eggo" no one has stolen your I.D. - I'm echo dot 2L65 and you may possibly be my red-headed illegitimate adopted step-brotha, twice removed ??

So maybe "T" Stock will do what it's supposed to ?? So will Egypt lead the way .. for FREEDOM from a corrupt "Poltical System" - YES, the people will !! The people .. those 'brave masses' now have the attention &amp; support of their Military. That current "Mooslem Brotha-hood's" DULY elected BAIT &amp; SWITCH President has overstepped his bounds and the people won't stand for it anymore. Mmmm, that sounds familiar !!. I know of another Country having that SAME "BAIT &amp; SWITCH" problem with it's 'el presidente', BUT .. I'm not sure of the will of the people &amp; how bad they want their freedom back .. and to stop this current 'socialist' movement - and to hold that 'snake oil salesman' accountable for HIS false campaign promises !! Look how much of our TAX Money he &amp; family has blown through in 4 1/2 years !! Look how much more corrupt our goverment is !! His experience as a "Community Organizer" has done nothing but 'disorganize' a Nation !! He's pitted the classes against each other .. he's pitted the races againts each other - and NOW how many of us can afford to purchase MORE "T" Stock ?? Oh gosh, if we kept thinking back, I believe we could recall many many more broken promises &amp; lies purpetrated by OUR "snake oil salesman" .. (not to forget Bengazzi .. Fast &amp; Furious .. and such) Are the Egyptian people any bolder than us = U.S. ?? Can anyone .. or does anyone want to show him what a real "YES WE CAN" means ?? Let me know if anyone is doing a nationwide "yes we can" thing anytime soon ...

You need to do a little study on it. Iv'e posed a challenge to atheists to prove my God wrong. Two places were cursed by God and he said they would never be built on again. Many places in the mid-East were destroyed over and over and rebuilt time and again but not these two. Babylon and Tyre. Get your God hating buddies together and try to rebuild even an itty bitty part of either. Alexander destroyed Tyre and scraped the island to bare rock. The Medes destroyed ancient Babylon and it's not been rebuilt since. Try it. Prove the Bible wrong.</Msg><Username>lewcor</Username><Timestamp>1372727342304</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-01 21:09:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372727871492-36</Id><Topic><Title>I hate that racist #$%$ Paula Dean, you Phony</Title><Username>lefronczak</Username><Timestamp>1372542804859</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-29 17:53:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yet it's OK for black rap "artists" and people to call each other the N word.
