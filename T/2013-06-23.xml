I watched two Black gals on a school bus years back that got into a fight over "who was the blackest." The "N" word was used a lot. My grandfather was born in 1864 in the South. He called them "Nigers". I asked him about it and he told me that most of the slaves were taken from the Niger River area originally and in the old South that was what they called them. What would you call someone today from Nigeria?</Msg><Username>lewcor</Username><Timestamp>1372011332941</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-23 14:15:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372017249531-5</Id><Title>strum that stock!!</Title><Msg>i found out that explosive alerts (google it) they are the highest ranking site thats real! i was in there last pick i made 12k profit! it ran like 350%</Msg><Username>henrygret</Username><Timestamp>1372017249531</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-23 15:54:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372021289408-6</Id><Topic><Title>Is it time for Republicans to forgive democrats for being racists</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1371924037778</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-22 14:00:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's time for Democrats to develop a brain!!!</Msg><Username>workhard1966</Username><Timestamp>1372021289408</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-23 17:01:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372024377450-7</Id><Title>Michelle Obama</Title><Msg>I want to hire her to help with my clamming.

Hubcap, could you have solved one of the greatest mystery's of our time (??) Those numerous reports, from time to time .. of a shoeless creature that stalks the forest ?
