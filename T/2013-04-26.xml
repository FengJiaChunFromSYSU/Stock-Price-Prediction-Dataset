As a matter of fact Harry's spokesperson said: o "Congress does not need to step in to ensure that lawmakers have the same experience as the general public." o "Senator Reid is committed to ensuring that all members of Congress and Congressional staff experience the benefits of the Affordable Care Act in exactly the same way as every other American,” And Nancy said: o "She believes the law allows lawmakers and staff to remain inside the system for federal employees, thus keeping their employer contributions — they just have to buy policies that are also offered on an exchange." So there! And let me remind you that there were no secret negotiations going on to get exemptions for congress or their staff from Obamacare, because congress is an honorable institution and all that work there are above reproach. So there! "In your heart you know he is right."

Taxpayers don't pay for these phones and they have been around alot longer than Obama. It is part of the public mission of public utilities to extend utility services to poor households-in exchange for property easements, use of public property (including airwaves) and in some cases outright monopolies. Providing these things, including phones, is what allows us to claim we have equality of opportunity in this country. The Safelink program was pushed by Tracfone--a private company-- to expand the landline service to cell phones during the Bush years. People can get a phone and 250 free minutes. Tracfone provides the phone and the payment for minutes is from the Universal Service Fund. The phones you can get aren't exactly what most people would call "smart phones". They're not iphones, galaxies or even blackberries. They're flip phones from Motorola or Nokia. I'm not sure why you people can't be honest about these things. Maybe you don't like the program, that's fine. It's worth discussing. But you people are liars. All you do is lie. That's not fine.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1366984982494</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 10:03:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366985080533-17</Id><Title>Not yet time to purchase...</Title><Msg>I think 'T' will move down a bit.</Msg><Username>hitechst3v3</Username><Timestamp>1366985080533</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 10:04:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366985369417-18</Id><Topic><Title>“We have to pass the bill so you can find out what is in it”</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1366983044161</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 09:30:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What are you even talking about?

My wife came from Winco's industry. Despite very good pay and above average benefits, the pervasive attitude of her peers is one of satisfaction. Like anyone in the labor market, they would like more, but settle for what their union bargains (settles?) for. My feeling is this. If an employee is well compensated, they have minimal complaints. I can't account for what you learned about Winco's employees. Why did you pick Winco for research?

What's so special about T that you keep ragging about their union? I still suspect you flunked the T test. You may to be an EE, but I pack an FCC license that didn't come easy either. I could probably have worked for your semi-con lab and seen how you probably screwed up that outfit. That would have made me an activist, unionized the company and got your sorry asz booted out.

The dividend and modest price appreciation T is noted for may not make it into your 401 if it stays in the 36's which i suspect it will. Take that into account in any decision you make.

He had an opportunity to turn down the sequester completely but refused to negotiate and said it would never happen anyway. In his speech at the Bush gathering yesterday he commented about how all President's make mistakes, I sure he didn't mean it, but he has certainly made his share recently. He won't admit it of course, he will simply say that Congress is not doing his job and he will for once be absolutely correct.

I'm not interested in your UAN board, or any other board. The only board I'm concerned about are the boards the Knicks and Spurs will be controlling in about another hour while you're probably fighting commuter traffic. I'm not sure who Carl Ichan is, but I guess you do. If you can't spell the name Icahn correctly, the stuff you were building at work probably has already been built by Dr. Emmett Brown. Look for it in a De Lorean. As for the Obama phone? Sorry to disappoint. If you click on my name and read my posts, they are not filled with bull feces as yours are. I have made it clear I don't rely on the government for ANYTHING I haven't paid into. Wrong political affiliation. So Mr. Peace, you're wrong again. Maybe you'd care to stop dodging the question about why you keep F'n with T? There's plenty of other union targets out there, yet you obsess with T? Maybe I should take it to the UAN board and stir up some trouble like you do here. I'll make certain your signature of Hubcap will be used prominently.

Thank you for once again, in the face of gross inhumanity, inspiring and solidifying my belief in humanity and the people of this country.” – Jon Stewart "Whoever did this obviously did not know #$%$ about the people of Boston. Because nothing these terrorists do is going to shake them. For Pete's sake, Boston was founded by the pilgrims — a people so tough they had to buckle their hats on. It is the cradle of the American revolution. A city that withstood an 86-year losing streak. A city that made it through the Big Dig, a construction project that backed up traffic for 16 years — I mean, there are commuters just getting home now. Even their bands are tough. It's the hometown of Aerosmith, who are, in their fifth decade, still going strong. Even Steven Tyler looks fantastic, for a 73-year-old woman.” – Stephen Colbert “Nothing sedates rationality like large doses of effortless money. After a heady experience of that kind, normally sensible people drift into behavior akin to that of Cinderella at the ball. They know that overstaying the festivities — that is, continuing to speculate in companies that have gigantic valuations relative to the cash they are likely to generate in the future — will eventually bring on pumpkins and mice. But they nevertheless hate to miss a single minute of what is one helluva party. Therefore, the giddy participants all plan to leave just seconds before midnight. There's a problem, though: They are dancing in a room in which the clocks have no hands.” – Warren Buffet “Experience is not what happens to a man; it is what a man does with what happens to him.” – Aldous Huxley "After a very difficult week, it's good to know that bad guys don't get away with it. We caught the Ricin guy. We caught the bombers. This is a powerful message from our government; we will not be intimidated by bombs, we will not be intimidated by poison. This is America. If you are a violent, paranoid lunatic, you must use a gun." - Bill Maher “Nice work if you can get it, and you can get it if you try.” – Ira Gershwin “I made out with a homeless guy by accident. I had no idea -- he was really tan, he had no shoes on. I just thought it was, like, his thang, you know? I was like, 'He's probably in a band‘!“ – Amy Schumer "U.S. intelligence agencies have put together a psychological profile of Kim Jong Un. They say he's a narcissist, and he is obsessed with Hollywood, obsessed with plastic surgery, and obsessed with the NBA.
