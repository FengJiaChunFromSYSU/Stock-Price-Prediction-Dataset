Like winholder, saying something like, “Ya’ know, you’re absolutely right. For me to say that the duly elected President of the United States is even remotely connected to, or approving of, Sharia law, is really a very stupid statement, with no basis of fact whatsoever. You know sometimes I read this stuff and just pass it along because I WANT to believe it. I’m really not as stupid as the people who originate this birther/swift boat stuff, and I’m nowhere near as ignorant as the fools who actually believe it. It’s really very unpatriotic to suggest that our President wants harm to come to our country, and I apologize for saying silly things with no basis of fact, just because some of us very much dislike this President.” What do ya’ think, winholder? Rather than your usual excuse of “I didn’t say those exact words”, admit that you said – quote – “He shouldn't denounce Sharia Law. He knows it and likes it.” It would be nice if you would either provide some evidence that our sitting president likes sharia law, or in the absence of corroborating evidence, how about apologizing for a change? For the sake of your own credibility, why don’t you man up for once in your life?</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1373033905757</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-05 10:18:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373034107289-5</Id><Topic><Title>Will Egypt Lead The WAY !!</Title><Username>echo.2l65</Username><Timestamp>1372726911171</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-01 21:01:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"icky" says he's not an absolute moron .. mmm ???

I do believe in the American system of justice, which is why I wanted a trial. What I am not entirely sure is why you are admonishing me about "jumping to conclusions" and not Froggie, who has clearly convicted Martin of assault and thinks he had no right to defend himself--using only his fists--from an armed stranger who was following him in the middle of the night. It is amazing to me that you people cannot seem to fathom that maybe Martin was just a kid, walking home from the store, who got scared when some creep started following him. That is because you are judging this circumstance on race. If same thing happened to a white kid, Froggie, Lavendar and all of you Tea Brains would be crying about how a Hispanic guy got away with shooting a white kid. You are all so very transparent. This is America. Having to explain why you shot and killed an unarmed person under very questionable circumstances before a jury of your peers is not a travesty. I do not know what the outcome of the trial will be. But I do know that Martin was doing nothing wrong that night. I do know (from Zimmerman's own account) that Zimmerman followed Martin against police advice, that Martin tried to approach and speak to Zimmerman but Zimmerman refused to respond or to identify himself, that Martin tried to run away, and that Zimmerman followed Martin even after he tried to run away. If some creep did that to me, you better believe I'd be defending myself.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1373055873919</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-05 16:24:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373061750166-27</Id><Topic><Title>What have we learned today from our MSM?</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1372450034388</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-28 16:07:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>From what I have seen of the trial so far it appears to be a tragic failure to communicate.

Yesterday was so bad the numbers looked worse than a Paula Deen talk show on the BET network." - Jay Leno “ I remember once quarreling with Yeats who was walking around the room with a sword in one hand muttering spells to ward off evil spirits, and I noticed that every time he passed a plate of plums he put down his unoccupied hand and took a plum and I said, 'Yeats, you cannot evoke great spirits and eat plums at the same time’." – George William Russell “My theory is that we are all idiots. The people who don’t think they’re idiots — they’re the ones that are dangerous.” – Eric Sykes "President Obama was in Germany and made a historic speech. The reason Obama was in Germany was to promote democracy and to rescue Justin Bieber's monkey." - David Letterman “My generation of radicals and breakers-down never found anything to take the place of the old virtues of work and courage and the old graces of courtesy and politeness.” – F. Scott Fitzgerald “I was looking for myself and asking everyone except myself questions which I, and only I, could answer.” – Ralph Ellison “The NSA says they have developed a robotic bird that looks and flies like a bird to use for surveillance.

Let me illustrate. Patriotism assumes that our globe is divided into little spots, each one surrounded by an iron gate. Those who have had the fortune of being born on some particular spot consider themselves nobler, better, grander, more intelligent than those living beings inhabiting any other spot. It is, therefore, the duty of everyone living on that chosen spot to fight, kill and die in the attempt to impose his superiority upon all the others…” – Emma Goldman “In the abundance of water a fool is thirsty.” – Bob Marley "The Girl Scouts announced that their pension plan has a $347 million deficit. The Girl Scouts are $347 million in debt so in addition to teaching girls about camping it also is preparing them for careers in government." - Jay Leno “The discipline, nonetheless, is exacting: everything that can be observed should be observed, even if it is only recalled as the bland background from which the intriguing bits pop out like Venus in the evening sky. The goal is always finding something new, hopefully unimagined and, better still, hitherto unimaginable.” – K. Barry Sharpless “American Beer is a lot like making love on a canoe - it's focking close to water.” – Eric Idle "Over in the Senate, they found a way to get Republicans on board with immigration reform. They're going to militarize the border. They're going to build a border surge. … Sounds like something you eat at Taco Bell. Or something that happens after you eat at Taco Bell." - Bill Maher “Well, I think we do have to define torture. One man’s torture is another man’s CIA’s sponsored swim lesson.” – Rachel Marsden “The sea, the great unifier, is man's only hope. Now, as never before, the old phrase has a literal meaning: We are all in the same boat.” – Jacques Cousteau "The Supreme Court has ruled the Defense of Marriage Act is unconstitutional. Once someone explains this to me I'm sure I'll be thrilled about it. Listen to what happened.

These are the sensitive, liberal people who are always yelling about people's freedom of speech and expression, unless you happen to say something that #$%$ them off.” – Richard Jeni, on the left wing "Last night the White House staff played softball against a team made of marijuana lobbyists. Which explains why there were 20 hits before the game even started." - Jimmy Fallon “Make your ego porous. Will is of little importance, complaining is nothing, fame is nothing. Openness, patience, receptivity, solitude is everything.” – Rainer Maria Rilke “You ever hear girls say that? "I'm not religious, but I'm spiritual." I like to reply with "I'm not honest, but you're interesting!" – Daniel Tosh “Now that the Supreme Court has overturned the Defense of Marriage Act, this ruling means California gay guys can finally marry someone other than Liza Minnelli." - Jay Leno “Fretting about a dearth of randomness seems like worrying that humanity might use up its last reserves of ignorance.” – Brian Hayes “We must question the story logic of having an all-knowing all-powerful God, who creates faulty Humans, and then blames them for his own mistakes.” – Gene Roddenberry "A new survey found that 70 percent of Americans admit to 'going through the motions' at their jobs. And the other 30 percent blah, blah, blah, punch line." - Jimmy Fallon “Sir, as a man advances in life, he gets what is better than admiration - judgement, to estimate things at their true value.” – Samuel Johnson</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1373071462875</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-05 20:44:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373071531367-39</Id><Title>AHQ (final)...</Title><Msg>...“Everyone’s a pacifist between wars. It's like being a vegetarian between meals.” – Colman McCarthy “In our culture, we think that happy and color is trivial, that black and darkness is deeper. But Nietzsche said - which is a line that I firmly believe – ‘Joy is deeper than sorrow, for all joy seeks eternity’.” – Julie Taymor "Syrian President Assad crossed a red line. He used chemicals weapons. Using harmful chemicals to hurt your own people – who does he think he is, Monsanto?" - Bill Maher “This is not remarkable, for, as we know, reality is not a function of the event as event, but of the relationship of that event to past, and future, events. We seem here to have a paradox: that the reality of an event, which is not real in itself, arises from the other events which, likewise, in themselves are not real. But this only affirms what we must affirm: that direction is all. And only as we realize this do we live, for our own identity is dependent upon this principal.” – Robert Penn Warren “What most people don't understand is that UFOs are on a cosmic tourist route. That's why they're always seen in Arizona, Scotland, and New Mexico. Another thing to consider is that all three of those destinations are good places to play golf. So there's possibly some connection between aliens and golf.” – Alice Cooper "Iran has elected a new president named Hassan Rohani. Yesterday he promised that he will boldly lead Iran into the 14th century.” - David Letterman “To appreciate nonsense requires a serious interest in life.” – Gelett Burgess “He does not seem to me to be a free man who does not sometimes do nothing.” – Cicero "During the cold war, West Berlin was an 'exclave' – a tiny outpost of liberalism surrounded by people who want to crush it. It was like Austin, Texas." - Craig Ferguson “It would be a bitter cosmic joke if we destroy ourselves due to atrophy of the imagination.” – Martha Gellhorn “In this fool's paradise, he drank delight.” – George Crabbe “Have a good weekend, all.” – echo2165 “The poppy opes her scarlet purse of dreams.” – Scharmel Iris</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1373071531367</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-05 20:45:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373073859292-40</Id><Topic><Title>how do i stop my union from taking dues out of my paycheck</Title><Username>ctmuscles</Username><Timestamp>1373062693186</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-05 18:18:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You have the right to be refunded any part of your dues that goes for political activity.
