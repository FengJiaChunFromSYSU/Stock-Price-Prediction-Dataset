Lincolnton Furniture Company was silent Friday, a day after shutting down. President Bruce Cochrane and other company officers did not return messages to The Associated Press. Company financial officer Ben Causey said manufacturing operations were stopped indefinitely because orders were insufficient. He told The Charlotte Observer that only a few people would remain employed and the next steps were uncertain. Lincolnton Furniture opened in December 2011 with 60 employees and plans to grow. Obama last year invited Cochrane to a White House event on bringing overseas job back to America and he was a guest at the State of the Union Address.

Yet Republicans continue to push policies designed to increase investment capital and policies that will decrease demand. Just like Romney, tb here does not want to see savings from Medicare, and even left the AARP because they supported these savings (they were savings that did not cut benefits). So where does he want cuts to come from? Defense? Unemployment Insurance? R&amp;D? Teachers &amp; Police? All of these things create jobs and contribute to aggregate demand. But what he &amp; Romney want are low taxes on investment capital. Why? So wealthy people can invest in furniture companies that can't get enough orders to remain profitable? You are right. You cannot look at one company and say it's this or that policy's fault. But when economists agree that a lack of demand is hurting the economy and a minority party is taking actions to hurt demand, its easy to connect some dots. Tb's problem is that he doesn't know which dots connect. If anyone is to blame for insufficient orders, it's the tea brains. And you can start with Tea Brain Fine.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1357417735299</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 15:28:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357419369576-13</Id><Topic><Title>Grover's cliff...</Title><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1356880373444</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-30 10:12:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>m.swanger: I agree, but I'd prefer to see increases in divi &amp; capital gains taxes offset with reductions in the payroll tax. Capital gains and dividends are not subject to payroll taxes. If you increase payroll taxes and extend them to high earners, it does not affect unearned income (divi &amp; captial gains). So someone like Romney, who gets all his money from unearned income, would not be subject to the payroll tax but would just get the tax break on unearned income. High earners (e.g., doctors or small business owners) would have to pay the payroll tax but would get less benefit from cuts in divi or capital gains. We need to spend less effort propping up markets and more propping up the real economy. All in all, I think we have enough investment capital out there. It is time to incentivize work. As a sole proprietor, I can tell you the taxes on those earning more than $400,000 don't affect me at all, and they wouldn't have affected me at $250,000 either--I don't make that much and few small business owners do. However, the 2% payroll tax increase affects every dollar I earn. And it affects my subcontractors, which means I may be paying higher labor costs. So that means either I pull more money out of my business, or I spend less than I would otherwise, or I try to pass the cost up or down. In my opinion the fiscal cliff deal was a horrible deal. Obama should have had the cahooneys to let us go over.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1357419369576</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 15:56:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357419941199-14</Id><Topic><Title>Grover's cliff...</Title><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1356880373444</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-30 10:12:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>jim.morris: the first two years of democratic control we went from losing over 800,000 jobs a month to gaining over 200,000 jobs a month--a 1 million job per month difference.

Not true. US debt is about $100,000 per payroll employee. This does not include self-employed people, so the figure *per worker* is much lower. Average wage is about $43,000. Debt per household is about $80,000, and average household income is about $52,000. US public debt is about 80% of GDP. There is no need to exaggerate the extent of the debt with false numbers. It is very high and needs to be dealt with, but we are not Greece or Japan. We still have the ability to deal with our debt. I'll assume the rest of your post is similarly incorrect.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1357422682510</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 16:51:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357422759033-17</Id><Topic><Title>Russia must be the most unfair country on the planet</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1357225778400</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 10:09:38 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Depends on the girl.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1357422759033</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 16:52:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357424620310-18</Id><Title>Milk 7 bucks</Title><Msg>That's ok.

But if you own a company that would lose market share if the pipeline ever became operational, then it would be in your best interest to delay the pipeline as long as possible. Currently one of the functions of Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway is the transport of oil by rail. So as long as the Keystone Pipeline can be delayed for environmental concerns, Burlington Northern will not be losing market share. Example 2: After the BP oil spill the president placed a moratorium on offshore drilling in the gulf. As a result of these actions many of the gulf oil platforms were moved to locations where the moratorium would not have an impact. One of these locations was off of the coast of Brazil, that was implementing an aggressive offshore drilling program. Along with a $308 million credit guarantee provided by the US Import/Export Bank to Petrobras ( the Brazilian government's oil company) access to these oil platforms was very beneficial. Therefore if a citizen of the US owned say a $1 billion share in Petrobras, then the above actions would have been beneficial to your bottom line. So to those who say that our president is anti business, I would beg to differ. The above examples show how the president's actions can be good for business.

The US Export Import bank provided $300 million in loan guarantees for Petrobras that facilitated purchases from over 150 US companies. If the US E/I bank did not support trade by facilitating financing, Petrobras and other companies would go elsewhere to purchase equipment. It doesn't cost taxpayers a dime. In fact, by charging fees and interest for its services, the Export-Import Bank actually produces revenue for the Treasury.

Most of the crude will come from South Texas' Eagle Ford Shale and will displace the light, sweet crude that Valero now buys from Europe and Africa. Shipping Eagle Ford oil from the Gulf Coast to Valero's 265,000-barrel-a-day plant near Quebec City will cost about $2 a barrel less than shipping crude across the Atlantic, Valero spokesman Bill Day said. “The permit would bring additional Eagle Ford crude to Quebec, and there is a lot of Eagle Ford crude,” Day said. Exporting crude from the United States is prohibited without a Commerce Department permit, Day said. That Valero got the OK “demonstrates the amount of domestic crude that's produced now.” A call to the Commerce Department as to the total number of permits issued wasn't immediately returned. Valero's one-year permit was valid starting in November, but the company hasn't made a major shipment to Quebec yet, Day said. U.S. crude production gains have mostly come from the Bakken and Eagle Ford shale formations in North Dakota and South Texas, according to Energy Department data. U.S. crude being shipped to Canada would displace light, sweet oil from West African nations such as Nigeria and Angola, Amrita Sen, chief oil market analyst for Energy Aspects Ltd. in London, told Bloomberg News. “We're going to see more volumes shipped to Canada” from the Gulf Coast, Sen said. Valero's refineries in Three Rivers, Houston, Corpus Christi and Meraux, La., now process Eagle Ford crude, Day said. Also, the company is shipping about 40,000 barrels a day of Bakken crude to its Memphis refinery by a circuitous route that takes it by rail to Louisiana and then via pipeline to Memphis. “Even that is less expensive than buying imported crude,” Day said. Valero also is considering shipping Bakken crude to its California plants, he said. ------------------ I can't put anything else to reference this or Yahoo won't publish this.
