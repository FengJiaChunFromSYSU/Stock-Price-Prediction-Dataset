This family and their company participated in shipping the grain out of the Ukraine in the 1920's under "Communism". They caused the starvation of several million people because they didn't want to belong to a commune. Perhaps they plan the same type of operation here to reduce population. American people are so stupid perhaps it would be a good thing. As Kruschev stated about Americans. "You spit in their face and they call it dew."</Msg><Username>lewcor</Username><Timestamp>1355066889466</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-09 10:28:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355072526178-3</Id><Topic><Title>Kissinger and the NEW WORD ORDER</Title><Username>todlondon</Username><Timestamp>1355017207404</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-08 20:40:07 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>As with all your fantasies...simply fascinating. So intelligent and deeply relevant, it is almost difficult to believe that they are the ravings of a pitiful old loser, who has been feminized by time, and is now at the end of his life. Have you been able to take a break from your conspiracy theories to buy an airline ticket so we can meet for that beer? I thought not. Please don't let it be said that you are all just hot air and demented fantasies! Dumont's! That was marvelous indicator of how completely out of touch you are.

So I am pasting some info .. " When a church makes money from other business activities, there is the possibility that the church may have to pay tax on the profits. This tax is known as "unrelated business income tax (UBIT)." Many churches are under the impression that because the church may have to pay a tax, it cannot own or operate a business. This is a misconception. If a church engages in business activity that incurs UBIT, all it has to do is simply fill out Form 990-T each year and report its income and pay whatever tax is due. In order for a church to incur UBIT, it must determine if it has earned income from unrelated activities. This can prove a little difficult sometimes. Section 513(a) of the Internal Revenue Code defines Unrelated Business Income (UBI) using three key phrases as follows: 1.Is the income substantially related to the church's religious, charitable, educational or other purposes? 2.Is it a trade or business? 3.Is it regularly carried on? ....... " after googling this question I have decided, if our govenement can tax it, it is taxed, there is no break for it unless it benefits polticians</Msg><Username>whopperkaraoke</Username><Timestamp>1355106597890</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-09 21:29:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
