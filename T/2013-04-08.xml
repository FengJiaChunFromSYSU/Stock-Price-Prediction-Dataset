I simply believe if there is a God, that God will let me know it exists, maybe when I die. Neither organized religion or religious doctrine can tell me that, I don`t have faith in any religion, except as code to try and live by to be a decent human being. I just watched a c-span presentation of an export import bank conference with a corporate ceo, a tbtf bank chairman, a retired General and the president of the center for American progress(a think tank????) with a columnist from the Wash Post moderating the conference. It was a conference of real live wannabe fascists, if fascism is defined as control of society by rule of business and government. Because the underlying theme of the whole discussion seemed to be a way to forge a cooperation between business and government to determine policies that control major segments of our society. No mention of the will of WE THE PEOPLE. Especially not the White majority - they advocate for importing massive numbers of non White workers for their companies. Who are they kidding, massive numbers of them are already here, YET THEY WANT MORE, MORE MORE. We Whites are in big trouble, those elitists along with the criminals in government will not stop until they have eliminated our majority and mowed us under. It was just sickening watching those pukes.</Msg><Username>lavendarsen</Username><Timestamp>1365401720459</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-08 02:15:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365402314665-3</Id><Topic><Title>White supremacists or White HATERS in TX?</Title><Username>lavendarsen</Username><Timestamp>1365193552982</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 16:25:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Btw, Joe 'bite me' the clown is speaking now, and he just said something about a new world order, the idiot.

First, my monthly payments are over $110 (which is what I signed up for) but I did not consent to the costly late fees which are about $50 if you go one day over your bill due date. When calling to set up a payment system I scheduled it for the 10th of the next month only to wake up on the 8th of the month with my phone disconnected with NO WAY to reach their company via phone and ANOTHER $50 fee which is now $300 FOR ONE MONTH of service! After calling AT &amp; T to describe the miscommunication I was told AT &amp; T is not reliable FROM THE MOUTH OF THE REPRESENTATIVE, after nicely asking to be transferred to another representative which is going to help me find a solution I get the dial tone, YES I was hung up on after waiting on the line for almost an hour! AND THAT IS ONLY THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG, when I originally signed my contract I was under the impression by the associate that I was signing a 12 month contract. FINALLY, my one year has came to an end and I called AT &amp; T to let them know I WILL NOT BE RENEWING MY CONTRACT and I was faced with the unfortunate news that they have extended my contract to another 12 months making my contract now a 24 month process. Within the first year of being with AT &amp; T I have paid almost $5,000.00!!!!! I am so displeased with their service I am going to make sure AS MANY PEOPLE KNOW THAT AT &amp; T ARE THIEF'S AND FRAUDS before going forward and signing your life away to them.

Did you ever do your transaction? In re-reading your post, you use an iPhone I see. Isn't there an app for your investment bank,company, or whatever you use so you don't have to go through your home computer to conduct business? You post a problem and then disappear.

I'm always suspicious of posts like that Wilkie. You know, a complaint on a message board? What in the hell good does posting here accomplish? The fact he doesn't have an app to do business I find fishy. Especially when he writes that he can't network to his home computer? Sounds like the iPhone was working when something else was at fault. Lack of response tells me a troll type trying to stir up trouble.</Msg><Username>davemartin74575</Username><Timestamp>1365474570749</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-08 22:29:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365476671952-40</Id><Topic><Title>AT &amp; T = THIEF'S</Title><Username>j.catucci</Username><Timestamp>1365452555540</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-08 16:22:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Let's see if I get this Wilkie. You say T will be 40 in June. It hasn't seen the 40's in about 5 years. Yet, your looking for a price of 37.50 for your latest play right? If you're betting T goes lower than it is now for your next trade..and you keep using your up a little,....down a little gambit...how will it ever get to 40? I know I'm missing something in your postings. You're saying T will run up another 6%. Yet, you keep wagering on lower prices while covering yourself with minimal incremental increases? Or vice-versa, depending how the wind is blowing. I don't understand your forecast of 40 anymore than the contract trades you write about. What ever happened to buying, owning and letting dividends and modest stock appreciation work for you over time? I would think -340K would have taught you to reconsider your tactics. Do you do this with any other stock, or just T? If not, how come T is your stock of choice?</Msg><Username>davemartin74575</Username><Timestamp>1365476671952</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-08 23:04:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message></Date>
