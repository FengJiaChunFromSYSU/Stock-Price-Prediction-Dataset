Obama's "community organizer" experience is demonstrated in his campaign and in his functioning as President. Obama is the one who chose the name "Organizing for Action" for the group that sends out these e-mails. I think that demonstrates that he still views himself as a community organizer. At any rate we should all agree that he is trying to get much more mileage out of the sequester that HE suggested than it merits.</Msg><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1363237396188</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 01:03:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363240935251-2</Id><Title>Does the Constitution give Americans the right to do stupid stuff?</Title><Msg>Today in America there are countless laws and regulations at all levels of government (i.e., Federal, State and local) that regulate the food industry. For the most part these laws and regulations provide Americans with a well regulated food industry that provides food that is generally safe and nutritious. In New York City these regulations may have gone too far. The Mayor of New York City feels that it is his role to mandate what he calls "portion control". In other words, because people are getting fat and in some cases sick from eating too much food, then the city has the legal obligation to mandate the size of food portions that can be sold in restuarants within the city limits. In other words; since New Yorkers are too stupid to regulate their own food intake, then it is the responsibility of the government to do the job for them. Then on the other side of the debate you have the state of Mississippi, that has come to the conclusion that the citizens of their state have the right to do stupid stuff and regulate their own food intake. Wow what a concept. Who would have thought that in America an average citizen would have the right to go into a restuarant, order a 32 oz. sugar filled drink, not know the range of calories contained within his or her burger, and super size it if he or she pleases. Wow what a concept, giving the average American the right to be responsible for regulating his or her own food intake. I sure hope FLOTUS doesn't find out. "In your heart you know he is right."

You all don't seem to care because you suggest it doesn't make a difference. You may be right, but I believe it should be shut down as best as possible regardless of guilty party. Back to my other example: My mother-in-law lives in a full care nursing home. She is mentally incapable of making her own decisions and the home has explicit instructions to call us if there is virtually any decision to be made. We spoke with her the day after the election on one our daily calls. She was so proud of herself that she had voted in the presidential election. Surprised, we asked her who she voted for. She said she didn't know. We asked how she voted. She replied that a black nurse wheeled her down to the voting booth that had been brought in for the patients. The nurse showed her how to vote and that she should vote for the "good guy". The nurse told her which button to push to vote for the "good guy". I suppose the good guy could be Romney, but I'm thinking not. We reported it to management, but since mother couldn't identify the specific nurse I doubt much was done. Better than half the folks in this home are in far worse condition than mother. I wonder how many voted for the "good guy".</Msg><Username>t.bfine</Username><Timestamp>1363263558826</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 08:19:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363266064129-7</Id><Topic><Title>Does the Constitution give Americans the right to do stupid stuff?</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1363240935251</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 02:02:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>...“New Yorkers are too stupid to regulate their own food intake…(The citizens of Mississippi) have the right to do stupid stuff…” – Pond Trash, froggie Well, Frog Boy, how admirable of you…once again acting as an Advocate for the Stupid…you’re a veritable Mother Theresa of the Ignorant. I think I recently saw that West Virginia just took over as the fattest state from Mississippi, which held that dubious title for a number of successive years. The list I found is probably last year, but, in order, starting with Mississippi, it included these in the top 13: Mississippi, Louisiana, West Virginia, Alabama, Michigan, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Indiana, South Carolina, Kentucky, Texas, Missouri, Kansas And what do 12 of the thirteen fattest states all have in common, pray tell? That’s right, froggie, they’re all (except Michigan) RED states! (Draw your own intellectual conclusions from that.) I’d be interested to hear what your Tea Party cronies have to say about your concept of encouraging stupid fat people to, while they’re busy clogging up their own arteries, to also clog up the hospitals and health care system with obesity related diseases. Frankly, I don’t care one way or the other what New York City does. Interestingly, you drop the local and states rights concept when convenient, I notice…don’t like it? Don’t live in, or go to, New York. If you live there and don’t like it, oust Bloomberg next election.Better yet, if the portion’s too small, just order another one. Finished your first 16 oz. sugar water?…get a six pack to go. Stupid people do stupid things. Stupid people drink way too much then try to drive. We regulate that. Perhaps your “Don’t Tread on Me” concept would eliminate that. Stupid people do stupid things with assault weapons, which no one needs for any legitimate reason, but, you’re against any sane regulation there, also. Stupid people abuse all types of drugs. Is crystal meth in your list of “don’t tell me what I can and can’t do” parameters? Wall St. manipulators, environmental polluters, copyright &amp; trademark infringers, unscrupulous businessmen, quack doctors and myriad others prey on the legions of ignorant masses daily in this country. You and your antiquated and misguided views of the rights guaranteed you by the Constitution would prefer a Laissez- faire concept of “Open Season on the Uneducated.” Let the buyer beware. (Translation…it’s okay to screw people if you’re smarter than them.) Perhaps someday we’ll look back on the greed of those who today foist diabetes inducing nourishment on children and the un-suspecting masses, with the same disdain with which we view those Tobacco Industry Executives…you remember them, don’t you…the ones who had the unmitigated gall to testify, to a man and under oath, that nicotine isn’t addictive. Meanwhile they headed up one of the largest mass murders of all time…one that could be considered “Genocide of the Stupid.” I would guess you probably didn’t like that government interference at the time, either. Stupid people also listen to people like you, who tell them global warming is a myth, in an effort to protect the very people who are raping the planet for profit. Do us a favor, froggie. Round up your other 300 plus pound stupid friends, fill the cooler with beer and jelly donuts, and you boys head on out for a day on your bass boat, “The Clogged Vessel.” Oh, drat, those pesky regulators…don’t forget, for a very good reason, you’ll need a fishing license. Oh, and there is a daily limit. Then again, you hillbilly handfishers probably use hand grenades.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1363266064129</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 09:01:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>13</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363266307521-8</Id><Topic><Title>Top Analyst UPGRADES AT&amp;T</Title><Username>whitlockjohn510</Username><Timestamp>1361876686315</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 06:04:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>fantastic job</Msg><Username>ronaldfrank937</Username><Timestamp>1363266307521</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 09:05:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363267055905-9</Id><Topic><Title>AT&amp;T Insiders SELLING?!

I suppose we should assume that “all” nursing home aides are “black” and thus Obama supporters, and so your silly story adds one more vote to the Melowese Richardson excuse for getting drubbed. Okay, that’s six, but you’ve still got a couple million more to go. Then don’t forget to subtract those votes the GOP – the party itself, through hired guns, cheated on. And, btw,were all the white nurses doing the same thing for Romney? Puhleeeeeeze….How absolutely silly. “She is mentally incapable of making her own decisions and the home has explicit instructions to call us if there is virtually any decision to be made.” Oh, so you expected them to call you to ask who you wanted her to vote for? Wait a minute. Didn’t YOU know there was an election? Why weren’t you there or why weren’t YOU doing something to help her vote. So she doesn’t know who she voted for, she doesn’t know how she voted…but she DOES know that a “black” nurse wheeled her down there, told her to vote for “the good guy” (was he listed on the ballot that way?) and then told her what button to push????? Who pushes buttons in voting booths? Levers, maybe. Are you sure it wasn’t casino night at the home and she was drawing for an inside straight on computer poker? Oh, and having all those vivid details, yet “mother couldn’t remember the specific nurse”. Hmmm, that seems to be how it is down there in Texas…all those black folk look the same. “I believe it should be shut down as best as possible regardless of guilty party.” In total agreement…that doesn’t mean makin’ up stupid stories to try to justify voter suppression.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1363267761322</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 09:29:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363270893386-11</Id><Topic><Title>Top Analyst UPGRADES AT&amp;T</Title><Username>whitlockjohn510</Username><Timestamp>1361876686315</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 06:04:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>useful</Msg><Username>scottgoins92</Username><Timestamp>1363270893386</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 10:21:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363271253080-12</Id><Topic><Title>AT&amp;T Insiders SELLING?!

Not true. First, they are not 'assault' weapons. There are defensive weapons. If a group of the illegel aliens the great black wonder let out of prison attempts to attack a lone person walking down the street after dark, a defensive weapon is necessary to not be maimed and injured and quite often stay alive. If a group of thugs break into your home, a defensive weapon is necessary. Did you know that NON White on White violence is huge in this country, and that almost always it is a GROUP of non Whites attacking as single White. Defensive weapons are necessary if you want to defend yourself from a GROUP.</Msg><Username>lavendarsen</Username><Timestamp>1363292042009</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 16:14:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363292337555-33</Id><Topic><Title>Organizing for Action</Title><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1363135052065</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 20:37:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You're and Idiot!</Msg><Username>bouch84</Username><Timestamp>1363292337555</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 16:18:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363292363379-34</Id><Topic><Title>Organizing for Action</Title><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1363135052065</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 20:37:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You're an Idiot!</Msg><Username>bouch84</Username><Timestamp>1363292363379</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 16:19:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363292429837-35</Id><Topic><Title>Organizing for Action</Title><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1363135052065</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 20:37:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I don't know what ist is that I dislike so much about you!

She said it was an awful place, DANGEROUS, incredibly rude, dirty, with unbelievably expensive utiliites that provided inferior awful service, an overall cost of living out of reach for most ordinary people, forcing them to constantly do without things they need . She immediately brougt up the limit on the size of soft drinks,which surprised me. I never found the subject of interest, didn`t realize people cared that much about it, she did and thought it was ridiculous. I said I was under the impression that NYC crime had been cleaned up, that it had been reduced, not necessarily safe and non violent, just not as terrible as some of the other large U.S. cities- cesspools. better than its past crime record. She said absolutely NOT. She said murders are rampant, there is constant civil disobedience, it is DIRTY AND DANGEROUS, the public transportation is absolutely FILTHY, you risk your life to use it, she went on and on about why she left New York. She said the media lies about NYC(like they do about everything else) to keep unsuspecting tourists coming. Of course, if something happens to a tourist, you never hear about that either. I also recently read this, Mayor Bloomberg, so focused on the social engineering of New York City, seems to have added a forceful item to his list: a staggering 80% of high school grads entering the City’s community college system can’t perform well enough to take college courses. The failure applies across the board: reading, writing, and math. What a marvelous mayor Bloombooger was and is. He cares about FAT PEOPLE.</Msg><Username>lavendarsen</Username><Timestamp>1363294391341</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 16:53:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363296073605-40</Id><Title>Guess Who</Title><Msg>"I presided over the biggest energy crisis in history, refusing intervention when corruption involving the oil industry was revealed.

Proverbs 14:15 “The simple believeth every word: but the prudent man looketh well to his going.” Proverbs 26:25 “When he speaketh fair, believe him not: for there are seven abominations in his heart.” 1 Thessalonians 5:21 “Prove all things; hold fast that which is good. “ 1 John 4:1 “Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world. “ And, incidentally, 2 Timothy 3:16 says nothing about god writing the bible. It says he “breathed” it or he inspired it. Authors are frequently inspired by intangible things, but those things don’t get royalties. And, btw, there are many inspirational passages in various holy books…many far more so than the bible. But while you’re out here thumping, here’s one that may inspire you.

Winholder, just as we thought there was no sanity prevailing, you rejuvenate the salvation of mankind. There is, indeed, hope for us all. Kudos for a most revealing introspective...we are all, indeed, in this together, and the sooner we acknowledge that, the sooner the enemies of earth's inhabitants will be subdued. Peace to us all. BTW, I just underwent a PET scan today, as a result of recent happenings...life is far too short to be angry, and each day is precious. Let's figure this out so America can go on being the shining light on a bewildered planet, most of which is splintered by religion. May everyone's Ishvaras grant them love, peace and understanding.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1363306516796</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 20:15:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363308645767-60</Id><Topic><Title>Does the Constitution give Americans the right to do stupid stuff?</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1363240935251</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 02:02:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No, FIRST they weren't your children's blood cells splattered all over the classroom walls. And that's part of the problem, some people empathize, some have self centered tunnel vision and amazing callousness. Imagine seeing your own child's brains on a wall, for nothing. Imagine what the little darlings went through, bullets tearing their flesh to pieces. Where was your black group on one white in that classroom? It was a nutty white kid on innocent babies never allowed to live their lives. Don't change the subject with garbage excuses. When will the NEXT bullied kid lose it and wipe out dozens of innocent people, because he can easily go get a rapid fire gun anytime he wants one. Guns are not idols, you have made them idols. We're not safe anywhere we gather in America anymore.</Msg><Username>peppeek</Username><Timestamp>1363308645767</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 20:50:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
