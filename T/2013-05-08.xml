We have gone after the terrorists who actually attacked us 9/11…” Tell us, tadpole, what’s your problem? I’m pretty sure bin Laden is, in fact, dead, is he not? I’m pretty sure the President DID end our involvement in Iraq, did he not? I also believe we ARE transitioning out of Afghanistan, are we not? And this president DID go after the terrorists “WHO ACTUALLY ATTACKED US”, not invade a country that had nothing to do with attacking us, under a fabricated pretense of WMD. We understand that you Tea brains are not at all happy about the many ongoing successes of a talented Commander-in-Chief. Trying to suggest that the above statements somehow connect to your wacked-out Benghazi conspiracy is one of your further stretches of reality. No one would suggest that “on the path to defeat” can be misinterpreted (as you have attempted to do) as meaning the war is over and all threats are eliminated. There was, however, a different situation in which the President did say really silly things which could have led you to believe that. Were you as appalled back then as you are now, when this was said?: May 1, 2003, aboard the carrier U.S. Abraham Lincoln under a banner printed up by the White House stating, “Mission Accomplished”… After arriving in a Lockheed SB-3 Viking (the carrier was well within range of the president’s helicopter at the time) President George W. Bush, grinning from ear to ear in a flight suit, stated, “In the Battle of Iraq, the United States and our allies have prevailed." A month later, in Afghanistan, he said "America sent you on a mission to remove a grave threat and to liberate an oppressed people, and that mission has been accomplished.” Some 8109 combined coalition casualties, 6706 of them American, later, the current President is doing his best to untangle the mess he inherited. He’s doing a splendid job, and it’s most unfortunate that you extremist crackpots are so bitter and unhappy about it. It’s also absolutely reprehensible that you do nothing constructive whatsoever, but intentionally lie about every issue before you. Benghazi investigation?…give me a break, frog boy. Why don’t you pass some gun legislation or end the sequester instead of wasting everybody’s time? Or maybe come up with the half billion dollars in embassy security funding requested by the administration in 20011 &amp; ’12, that House Republicans refused to grant. In your pond, you know you’re all wet.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1368017973650</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 08:59:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368020104215-5</Id><Title>Going to forty and split IMHO</Title><Msg>Buybacks forthcoming.</Msg><Username>capp013</Username><Timestamp>1368020104215</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 09:35:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368020591851-6</Id><Topic><Title>Obama's incredible comment</Title><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1367699187107</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 16:26:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think you're going to need to offer him a payment plan.

The fact is Congress and the ARB have had access to over 25,000 pages of documents and people involved at all levels in multiple hearings and reviews. And still you have not managed to find any wrong-doing (no fibs) beyond what the ARB found (systematic management and leadership failures). My point is that even if your wildest fantasies come true, there's *still* nothing there that would come close to hurting the President or make him resign. The other fiction here is the supposed cover-up or stonewalling. This entire hearing today is based on an astounding amount of access to documents, transcripts and executive personnel. You have every version of the "evil" talking points available. But we know for you Tea Brain types actual evidence doesn't hold much sway. Patriotic Americans know that if this is the worst thing that happens under Obama's watch, we should count our blessings. But you're not a patriotic American. You're a partisan first, American second. Now we could talk about whether Al Qaeda is making a comeback or not, and our policy options there. That is a worthy discussion to have. But it is not one you are interested in because it is a conversation that is good for America. As an unpatriotic partisan, you are more interested in pinning something, anything, on Obama, no matter how far-fetched our outlandish that possibility actually is, and no matter how much it distracts us from actually accomplishing something.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1368021571883</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 09:59:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>13</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368022247821-11</Id><Topic><Title>AT&amp;T's presumed 30yr bond offering</Title><Username>convergent_series</Username><Timestamp>1368005569204</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 05:32:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well written Wilkie.

None of them, on either side seem to listen to one another. One guys would ask the same question put forth by another member of the committee just moments before and when getting the same answer seemed to not understand the answer, often times when the answer was yes or no. I am surprised while listening to many of these members how they were able to make a campaign speech sufficient to get elected....</Msg><Username>winholder</Username><Timestamp>1368042909509</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 15:55:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368043282586-34</Id><Topic><Title>"What difference, at this point, does it make?"</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1367862161237</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 13:42:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>One question was asked today that no one in the State Department can answer...knowing that Sept. 11th was a special day in the Arab world and that ALL embassies had been put on notice to be especially aware, was the Ambassador in Libya traveling to a city that even the Libyan government said was not safe? Why just a month prior to that event were 12 of the 14 Special Forces unit assigned as security pulled and send home? Another one was, and it still hasn’t been answered is why did Ms. Rice go out with her statements when even the Libyan government was saying this was a terror attack partly by the group that they had sent to provide protection for the American Embassy?</Msg><Username>winholder</Username><Timestamp>1368043282586</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 16:01:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368045138205-35</Id><Topic><Title>AT&amp;T's presumed 30yr bond offering</Title><Username>convergent_series</Username><Timestamp>1368005569204</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 05:32:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good post 'ncguras', I've read some of your other m/b posts today also.

We were lied into the war. There was no exit plan. Troops were not properly protected. And yet the Republicans, Conservatives and Neocons spent NO time questioning why young people had to die or were maimed. The cost of that war (unfunded) will be over 1 trillion dollars. What hypocrites these people are.</Msg><Username>freakedout35</Username><Timestamp>1368047080740</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 17:04:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368053792328-38</Id><Topic><Title>"What difference, at this point, does it make?"</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1367862161237</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 13:42:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If locked up all the liars in government there would be no one left.
