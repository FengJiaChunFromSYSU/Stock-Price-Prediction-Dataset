I’ve read the Constitution several times, and search as I may, I fail to find any mention of Grover Norquist. “Obama is a communist.” And you are ignorant and totally irrelevant. You bring to your cause the same ultimate, embarrassing demise that Joe McCarthy brought to them back when a similar group of the lunatic fringe thought they knew what was best for the overwhelming majority of Americans who disagreed with them.

Hey echo, does it strictly PROHIBIT such actions it anywhere in the Constitution you read? No! That is the Democratic Party poly, if the Constitution doesn’t say I can’t, then I can. Now you disagree with that position! What a surprise! What makes you think the pledge that has you so upset is binding in any way? Are there legal penalties associated with the pledge? Are they removed from office if they waiver? Are there fines if they don't toe the line? Of course not you nitwit! The pledge was for publicity, it was to raise awareness of a problem that Congress and the Democrats have ignored for eons. It was to generate interest in supporting member that should be doing what is right to limit government spending and the stupidity that has been Congress for the past 50 years. You fell for it only you fell on the wrong side of the spending equation.

You don’t have to be Einstein to understand that when debating revenues and deficits, pertinent to current events and situations, it is impossible to do your job in the interest of the people who elected you, if you fall back on “I can’t do that because I promised Grover.” Suggesting otherwise makes you look like the hypocritical fool that you’ve long demonstrated that you are. But let’s forgo that for a moment. I’m glad to see you’ve come around. So according to your new ideology, Speaker Boehner should immediately make the following declaration: To my fellow members of both The House and The Senate, as well as you State legislators who have joined us in signing The Pledge to The American for Tax Reform. Be it known, as of today, our Sage advisor, winholder has declared the following – and I quote verbatim: “The pledge is not binding in any way” “There are no legal penalties associated with The Pledge.” “You will not be removed from office if you Waiver” “There are no fines if you don’t toe the line.” “The pledge was only for publicity.” So what I’m saying, fellow congressmen (oh, there’s women here too?? When’d that happen?) Contrary to what both winholder and I have been telling you all this time, just forget it. It’s time to stop obstructing the legislative process we have been elected to participate in, start making everybody pay their fair share, and realize the select few we have been representing are not out for the best interests of this country. Thank you.” – Speaker Boehner, channeled through winholder Oh, wait, it would appear it’s already happening, despite your efforts winny. “Republicans might have held the House, but Grover Norquist’s majority in Congress is all but gone. Fewer incoming members of the House and Senate have signed the pledge against tax increases run by Norquist’s Americans for Tax Reform, in a reflection not only of the seats that Democrats gained but of the success they’ve enjoyed in vilifying Norquist. About a dozen newly elected House Republicans refused to sign the anti-tax pledge during their campaigns, and another handful of returning Republicans have disavowed their allegiance to the written commitment. “I don’t want to sign a pledge that’s going to tie my hands,’ Ted Yoho, a GOP congressman-elect from Florida, told The Hill. ‘I need free rein to do what I think is right for the people in my district and the country.’ Susan Brooks, a newly elected Republican from Indiana just took the position that she was not going to sign pledges. At the height of deficit talks in 2011, Norquist faced criticism from some Republicans who said they did not feel bound by a pledge many of them took years ago when they first ran for the House. Returning Republican Reps. Mike Simpson (Idaho), Howard Coble (N.C.), Jeff Fortenberry (Neb.) and Scott Rigell (Va.), among others, all disavowed the commitment. A pledge-signer in the Senate, Tom Coburn (Okla.), also publicly battled with Norquist. ‘It should be a teachable moment for Republicans, but the Republican leadership continues to oppose making millionaires pay their fair share, so it looks like the lesson might have fallen on deaf ears,’ said Jesse Ferguson, spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.” Well, apparently not anymore, because winholder’s going to set these guys straight. What a metamorphosis! What next? Will jon learn to spell? Will rob acknowledge he’s an albino? Stay tuned.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1352914809852</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 12:40:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352915726957-23</Id><Title>AT&amp;T get more NOKIA Lumias in stock</Title><Msg>If you own T you should get into NOK.

It sure took you a long time to quit complaining about something that really has little or no relevance to what goes on in Congress. Mostly because the members of Congress react to business in Congress in whatever way will suit them best in their personal lives and careers. You should know that will all the knowledge you claim to have regarding our government and why they do the things they do. I am surprised and a bit embarrassed for you that you bought into all the pledge nonsense. Shame on you. Looks like Mr. Norquist didn't have the impact on business in Congress like you preached about so adamantly.

There's going to be alot of news and alot of brinksmanship, but I doubt we go over that fiscal cliff. Just like the debt ceiling fiasco, politics has alot to do with stock prices right now. But if you continue to treat every drop in the market as a referendum on Obama this or Obama that, (ignoring any stock gains, of course) you are missing the point. All the market cares about is that the fiscal cliff gets resolved. It does not care if it Obama "wins" or Boehner "wins". Even if no one wins, and they just put it off like last time, the market will gain. Of course, if we do come to a long term compromise, the market will gain even more. Hopefully Grover and the Tea Brains took enough of a shellacking to sit their worthless a**es down and stay out of the way.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1352929346719</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 16:42:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352930120437-37</Id><Topic><Title>Bulletin - winholder fires Grover...</Title><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1352914809852</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 12:40:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>... “Well, there ya’ go again” (win the Gipper) “I am surprised and a bit embarrassed for you that you bought into all the pledge nonsense…” You should be TOTALLY embarrassed at even attempting to make such a ridiculous statement. Suddenly, WE bought into the pledge, but you didn’t? What is this…more Etch-a-Sketch logic? It’s like, “Well, we know what Mitt said about the 47% behind closed doors, and we know what some of our candidates said about rape, and we know what Grover said about the pledge, but…well…well, nobody really meant it. As a matter of fact, most of what we say we don’t really mean. You get your clocks cleaned, new members of Congress now won’t get anywhere near Grover Norquist, while the others, realizing the errors of their ways (out of necessity from their constituents) are fleeing the “Pledge” like rats from your metaphorically sinking ship…and now, you make this condescendingly, farcical attempt at pretending your entire platform was just a joke? Do you think each time you make a new post, nobody remembers what you’ve said previously? I mean, I know you have a lot of aliases, but you manage them not unlike Mr. Romney’s campaign…devoid of facts, confused, irrational and willing, on any given day, to say whatever you think your ever-shrinking base wants to hear. BTW, Mr. Ryan said that one of the good things about losing was that he gets more time with his kids, and that they didn’t have to change schools. More kudos to him. I imagine, likewise, Mr. Romney said something like, “Well there is a positive to all of this. I still don’t have to show my tax returns.”</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1352930120437</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 16:55:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352932338022-38</Id><Topic><Title>Bulletin - winholder fires Grover...</Title><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1352914809852</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 12:40:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This is funny, since I specifically remember debating with you, Dale and others about this. I said if Congress members can't or won't do their jobs because of a pledge they should resign. You guys said the pledge was why they got elected and standing by it IS their job. Oh the Etch a Sketch. Of the many problems facing the Republican party, one of the most disturbing to me is the rampant lack of intellectual integrity. I'm sure everyone of you Conservative News fools was surprised by the election results. They were predicting a Romney landslide. But the elections went almost exactly as every serious poll watcher thought they would--including Las Vegas odds makers. You still think the polls lie? Of course you do. Because reality has no bearing on your thinking. You have to have some true understanding of reality to build consistent and tenable policy preferences. That requires honesty, with yourself and with others. And that is sorely lacking, aided and abetted by a large dose of senior gullibility among the base.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1352932338022</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 17:32:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352937631566-39</Id><Topic><Title>Obama's Top 2% Tax ??</Title><Username>jon3retired</Username><Timestamp>1352920262336</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 14:11:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yea, the republicans took such a shellacking that they retained control of the house of representatives.
