Since wealthy people tend to save more of their income than poor people this shifts the burden of taxation to the poor. It is hardly what most people consider fair. Now, as the population gets older and fewer people are earning an income, it may be possible to use a sales tax to recoup the taxes boomers failed to pay during their lifetimes, and use it to pay for the debt they accrued and the benefits they voted for themselves.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1371215955534</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 09:19:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371219727981-8</Id><Topic><Title>Zimmer testifies</Title><Username>peppeek</Username><Timestamp>1371138558585</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 11:49:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Stalk and chase me in the middle of the night like Zimmerman did to Martin and see what you get.

It's called the Affordable Care Act, but President Obama's health care law may turn out to be unaffordable for many low-wage workers, including employees at big chain restaurants, retail stores and hotels. Under Obamacare companies can meet their legal obligations by offering policies that would be too expensive for many low-wage workers. For the employee, it's like a mirage -- attractive but out of reach. Companies with 50 or more full-time workers are required to offer coverage that meets certain basic standards and costs 9.5 percent of an employee's income. Failure to do so means fines for the employer. For low income families there is just not any left over for health insurance what the government is requiring employers to do isn't really something their low-paid employees want. Low-wage workers making more than about $15,900 won't be eligible for the law's Medicaid expansion, shutting down another possibility for getting covered.</Msg><Username>ricky1820l</Username><Timestamp>1371226801124</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 12:20:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>13</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371228218990-17</Id><Title>Obama admin denies aid to West Texas blast victims</Title><Msg>The Federal Emergency Management Agency has denied additional aid tied to deadly explosions at a Texas fertilizer plant, President Barack Obama has gone against his word.

But just because you Tea Brains have a habit of writing a "So-lin-der" in sharpie on old pieces of cardboard before you go a-tea-partying down the street when Sean Hannity hosts a $50 a ticket rally does not make it the "poster child". I think the poster-child of the stimulus was the biggest middle class tax cut since Reagan--the payroll tax cut. Possibly the Fourth Bore in Oakland. A combination of middle class tax cuts and infrastructure spending that kickstarted a recover that created 2.5 million jobs and counting.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1371234961464</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 14:36:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371236847934-35</Id><Title>Brutal!</Title><Msg>These heavy volume down days are becoming the norm for this dog.
