There’s more. Records also reveal that MF Global’s trustee for the Chapter 11 bankruptcy retained as its general bankruptcy counsel Morrison &amp; Foerester--the very law firm from which Associate Attorney General Tony West came to DOJ. And more. As Government Accountability Institute President Peter Schweizer explains in the Washington Times Thursday, the trustee overseeing MF Global’s bankruptcy is former FBI Director Louis Freeh. At Holder’s Senate confirmation hearing Freeh served as a character witness for Holder and revealed that Holder had previously worked for Freeh. “As general counsel,” Freeh said, “I could have engaged any lawyer in America to represent our bank. I chose Eric.” Until now, the conventional wisdom for why Holder wouldn’t throw the book at Corzine was that Corzine is an Obama campaign bundler. Indeed, as Breitbart News reported, four of the top officials at the Department of Justice--Eric Holder, Thomas Perrelli, Karol Mason, and Tony West--were also big money bundlers for Obama. But the newly understood crony connections reveal conflicts of interest that extend well beyond mere political support for a common candidate--they go to a tangle of prior business dealings that further underscore the need for a special prosecutor in the Corzine case. At least 65 members of Congress have already signed a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder requesting that he appoint a special prosecutor to investigate MF Global’s collapse and the loss of $1.6 billion in customer money. What’s more, even progressives have begun to wonder whether Holder’s Covington &amp; Burling connection explains why the Department of Justice has not charged, prosecuted, or jailed a single Wall Street executive after the biggest financial collapse in American history. As Richard Eskow of the Huffington Post recently wrote: More and more Washington insiders are asking a question that was considered off-limits in the nation's capital just a few months ago: Who, exactly, is Attorney General Eric Holder representing? As scandal after scandal erupts on Wall Street, involving everything from global lending manipulation to cocaine and prostitution, more and more people are worrying about Holder's seeming inaction -- or worse -- in the face of mounting evidence. This isn’t going away. Both the left and the right are onto Holder’s Wall Street head fake. With the revelation of the new crony connections, the time for Eric Holder to appoint a special prosecutor in the Corzine/MF Global case is now.</Msg><Username>ssdependent</Username><Timestamp>1343325700000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 14:01:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343325794000-22</Id><Title>News about our great jobs programs</Title><Msg>A new jobs training oversight report by Sen. Tom Coburn (R-OK) found that a federally-funded Oklahoma Job Corps program spent around $76,000 per person to help youth secure minimum wage jobs. The report, released Tuesday, comes 18 months after a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report that found that billions of taxpayer dollars are being poured into job training programs that benefit those who run them, not the unemployed workers they are supposed to assist. "Taxpayers should be appalled Congress has done nothing to reform these programs for more than 18 months," said Sen. Coburn. Sen. Coburn said he wanted to use his home state of Oklahoma as a case study for job training programs throughout the nation. Key findings included: • Wasteful administrative costs are eating up job training dollars. In one program, just 14 cents of every dollar went to actual job training. • Questionable spending abounds. For example, the Job Corps program spent $36,000 on flowers and billboards. Other expenditures included bowling trips and recreational activities that had little to do with job training. • Some job training programs appear to segregate participants by race, gender, and background. For example, Oklahoma's 40 job training programs have eight that target Native Americans and seven for veterans--"some of which require veterans to pursue training for 'green skills,' not because of labor market analysis but because politicians in Washington are imposing ideological agendas on states." As one Oklahoma constituent who went through the jobs program explained: I attended three different federally funded job assistance programs. All three were absolutely unhelpful and contributed to my panic that I may never find a good job again. One Workforce worker advised me to ‘dumb down’ my resume and even made revisions to my Workforce posted resume that included the removal of my educational and professional accomplishments. A job counselor at a different agency advised me that a ‘good job’ was one that paid $10/hour.</Msg><Username>ssdependent</Username><Timestamp>1343325794000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 14:03:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343325813000-23</Id><Topic><Title>New 52 week high..</Title><Username>gwplant69</Username><Timestamp>1343322300000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 13:05:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Past 9-12 months the stocks with high yield have been performing incredibly well because all the institutional investors needing to find yield and income for their customers have been pouring into the names-- what other choice is there? For a company like AT&amp;T, a 5% yield is tremendous compared to a bond yielding 1.5%. If the FED has pushed down the yields to stimulate growth in order to keep inflation at 2%, then you are losing 0.5% a year in purchasing power holding that bond. With AT&amp;T however, your 5% is reduced to 3% growth in purchasing power if inflation runs at 2%. That 3% is still DOUBLE the pre-inflation adjusted Treasury yield. What is hard to understand? If growth comes back, you have earnings move higher and the stock appreciates and the payout can be raised without negatively impacting the payout ratio. The yield then moves handily above 5% and adds fuel to the fire for owning high-yield stocks over Treasury paper. It will be a different story once yields start to move higher as people move toward high-yield in droves and cause this to go parabolic and push us to the realm of euphoria and "irrational exuberance". At that point, you will need to switch and short Treasuries, sell off some high-yield and buy puts to collect some of the sell-off. I don't see that happening any time soon though so long as the FED is a buyer of Treasury paper. It is irrational to not be mindful of that threat to the high-yield group however, and no matter how illogical it may seem at that time, you must act according to reason coming to rational decisions. DO NOT FOLLOW THE HERD OVER THE CLIFF-- simply run with them through the pastures and make money. But make sure to hit the breaks once you think the end of the game is closing in.</Msg><Username>vwdiesel10</Username><Timestamp>1343325813000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 14:03:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343326203000-24</Id><Title>The Thinker</Title><Msg>It started out innocently enough. I began to think at parties now and then - just to loosen up and be a part of the crowd. Inevitably, though, one thought led to another and soon I was more than just a social thinker. I began to think alone -- "to relax," I told myself, but I knew it wasn't true. Thinking became more and more important to me, and finally I was thinking all the time. That was when things began to sour at home. One evening I turned off the TV and asked my wife about the meaning of life. She spent that night at her mother's. I began to think on the job. I knew that thinking and employment don't mix, but I couldn't help myself. I began to avoid friends at lunchtime so I could read Thoreau, Muir, Confucius, Camus and Kafka. I would return to the office dizzied and confused, asking, "What is it exactly that we are doing here?" One day the boss called me in. He said, "Listen, I like you, and it hurts me to say this, but your thinking has become a real problem. If you don't stop thinking on the job, you'll have to find another job." This gave me a lot to think about. I came home early after my conversation with the boss. "Honey," I confessed, "I've been thinking..." "I know you've been thinking," she said, "and I want a divorce!" "But Honey, surely it's not that serious." "It is serious," she said, her lower lip aquiver. "You think as much as college professors and college professors don't make any money, so if you keep on thinking, we won't have any money!" "That's a fallacious syllogism," I said impatiently. She exploded in tears of rage and frustration, but I was in no mood to deal with the emotional drama. "I'm going to the library," I snarled as I stomped out the door. I headed for the library, in the mood for some John Locke. I roared into the parking lot with NPR on the radio and ran up to the big glass doors. They didn't open. The library was closed. To this day, I believe that a Higher Power was looking out for me that night. Leaning on the unfeeling glass and whimpering for Emerson, a poster caught my eye, "Friend, is heavy thinking ruining your life?" it asked. You probably recognize that line. It comes from the standard Thinkers Anonymous poster. This is why I am what I am today: a recovering thinker. I never miss a TA meeting. At each meeting we watch a non-educational video; last week it was "Porky's." Then we share experiences about how we avoided thinking since the last meeting. I still have my job, and things are a lot better at home. Life just seemed easier, somehow, as soon as I stopped thinking. I believe the road to recovery is nearly complete for me. Today I took the final step... I joined the Democratic Party.</Msg><Username>ssdependent</Username><Timestamp>1343326203000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 14:10:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343326496000-25</Id><Topic><Title>The Thinker</Title><Username>ssdependent</Username><Timestamp>1343326203000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 14:10:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I Love It.</Msg><Username>vwdiesel10</Username><Timestamp>1343326496000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 14:14:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343326656000-26</Id><Topic><Title>New 52 week high..</Title><Username>gwplant69</Username><Timestamp>1343322300000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 13:05:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It sure is funny how alot of pl on this board don't know JACK CRAP!!!

I joined the REPUBLICAN Party (not Democrat as on this poster’s version). About.com published it that way, as did most of the others, all aimed at Republicans. One ending even said, “I put up my autographed poster of Ann Coulter.” I mean, come on now, which side discourages education, belittles college professors as the “elite” who don’t make enough money and mocks Thoreau,Camus and Kafka????? Check your tea leaves. Apparently this poster, who would appear to be another ‘rational selfishness” advocate, not only changed the ending, but tried to take credit for someone else’s work. That seems to be the current, acceptable modus operandi of those who, ironically, complain loudest about free-loaders ruining the system.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1343333113000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 16:05:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343333882000-29</Id><Topic><Title>The Thinker</Title><Username>ssdependent</Username><Timestamp>1343326203000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 14:10:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Old news-- as you've said that's been around for a long time.

There are any number of Wall Street bankers who should be in jail right now. Your blatant partisanship on this issue does not help matters. Do you think Romney will go after Wall Street? He is Wall Street. He wants to roll back the weak reforms we have already put in place. The problem here is that 99% of people who follow politics are cheap partisan hacks like you. You have no interest in justice or in preventing these things from happening again. You just want get the other party. You are exactly what is wrong with America today. Obama and Holder should go after Wall Street more. But there is no partisan conspiracy here. It's all money and it affects both sides. You know and I know that if you want get Wall Street corruption under control, you have to get money out of politics. And to do that right now you have to vote Democrat.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1343338279000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 17:31:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343338954000-38</Id><Title>Switching to Sprint</Title><Msg>After 10 years of AT&amp;T !!!
