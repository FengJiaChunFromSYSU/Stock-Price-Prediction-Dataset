Everyone's salary on the lower end will be forced up. The Government, not the market place will decide the value of one's contribution to society. The middle class burb people are on Barry's radar. Anyone who commutes long distances to work, will be encouraged to move into the city, or else. Job applications will be overhauled. Questions about your credit history, criminal record will be dropped. It's unfair, not to hire those who've made a few mistakes in the past. A green energy bank, a health care bank. More crony capitalism. Obama's people will again write the rules, and make sure these same people, reap the benefits. If you think Executive Orders were misused in his first term, as Bachman Turner said, you ain't seen nothing yet. The military will become global warming warriors. Border agents will be rendered weaponless. Basically, their jobs will become those of the welcome wagon workers. Read it all, in the new book, Fool Me Twice.</Msg><Username>robfisk</Username><Timestamp>1344517169000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-09 08:59:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>14</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344520254000-3</Id><Topic><Title>Volume less than 1/3 average</Title><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1344458425000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 16:40:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes 9 million.

In 2010, China produced 11 times more steel than the United States. New World Record: China made and sold 18 million vehicles in 2010. There are more pigs in China than in the next 43 pork producing nations combined. China currently has the world.s fastest train and the world's largest high-speed rail network. China is currently the number one producer in the world of wind and solar power, but don’t use it themselves. While they manufacture 80% of the worlds solar panels, they install less than 5% and build a new coal fired power station every week. In one year they turn on more new coal powered electricity than Australia's total output. China currently controls more than 90% of the total global supply of rare earth elements. In the past 15 years, China has moved from 14th place to 2nd place in the world in published scientific research articles. China now possesses the fastest supercomputer on the entire globe. At the end of March 2011, China accumulated US$3.04 trillion in foreign currency reserves--the largest stockpile on the entire globe. Chinese people consume 50,000 cigarettes every second � They are already the largest carbon dioxid emitter and their output will rise 70% by 2020. ~*~*~*~*~*~ And we think we're saving the planet?! It will not make one iota of difference what we do in Australia, Canada, the United States or anywhere else in the world; for that matter, all the politicians are doing is increasing our cost of living and making our manufacturers uncompetitive in the world market, with their idiotic carbon tax, when countries like china are growing and consuming at these extraordinary rates!

RSI reacts to the magnitude of daily price changes but there are separate columns and calculations for up and down days. The stochastic will be keying off the $38.28 high on 8/01 for a while longer. These indicators keep us on our toes. One thing threw me off the other day. Most sites change from daily close data to minute by minute data when you shorten the chart's time period past a certain point. Suddenly the RSI or Stochastic will change dramatically to a different value.</Msg><Username>KAWill</Username><Timestamp>1344550478000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-09 18:14:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344561997000-41</Id><Topic><Title>US complete shut down on the way with Corn going over $9 and gas now over $4 going to $5</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1344530264000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-09 12:37:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Corn price will explode friday with latest report.

You have to remember that the basic I+M class was two weeks of pole climbing and ladder safety, followed by six weeks of classroom instruction (preceded by refreshers in pole climbing every morning) followed by two months of OJT. The prem tech course is two weeks, followed by a week of OJT provided by other techs- and the job title is so new that there are no "old guys". The best prem techs are splicing techs or core I+M surplussed from other positions who took that job to keep a foot in the door. No...not the same at all- especially given the lack of test gear. Of course, even I+M is being dumbed down quite a bit these days... the bean counters have their hooks in the meat of this company now- and they never did grasp what takes place where the rubber meets the road.</Msg><Username>n1tr0x3n</Username><Timestamp>1344568383000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-09 23:13:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344568681000-45</Id><Topic><Title>Strike in DIST 9?</Title><Username>josieinib</Username><Timestamp>1344298108000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 20:08:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Addendum: it still seems clear that prem techs rise to the I+M level, or I+M falls to theirs. If the latter, landline fails. That means undependable cel sites- because we maintain the fiber too.
