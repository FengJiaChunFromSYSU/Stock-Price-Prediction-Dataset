What was the source of Obama's foundation in Marxism? Throughout his 2008 Presidential campaign and term in office, questions have been raised regarding Barack Obama's family background, economic philosophy, and fundamental political ideology. Dreams from My Real Father is the alternative Barack Obama "autobiography," offering a divergent theory of what may have shaped our 44th President's life and politics. In Dreams from My Real Father, Barack Obama is portrayed by a voice-over actor who chronicles Barack Obama's life journey in socialism, from birth through his election to the Presidency. The film begins by presenting the case that Barack Obama's real father was Frank Marshall Davis, a Communist Party USA propagandist who likely shaped Obama. Much More in the Book!</Msg><Username>robertnupstatecarolina</Username><Timestamp>1347958313142</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 04:51:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347968845596-2</Id><Topic><Title>Obama The Marxist !!!</Title><Username>robertnupstatecarolina</Username><Timestamp>1347958313142</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 04:51:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You guys are so obviously desperate that you are making a mockery of your party. Now you’re promoting a film that claims that the duly elected President of the United States has a secret plan to overthrow the US government and replace it with a communist regime. It is mind boggling that anyone would say something that stupid, and even more so that anyone would believe such total nonsense. Of course it should be noted that the guy who Directed this silly film is the same guy whose previous film tells us that Paul McCartney really died in 1966 and the guy who says he is Paul is an impostor! How is it that you guys can’t resist insane conspiracy theories? Is it your collective IQ? Who on earth would want people this stupid running our great country? And why is it surprising that you people stoop to such depravity? Because here is what your nominee just said at a closed door session of his fellow millionaires: "There are 47 percent of the people who will vote for the President no matter what. All right, there are 47 percent who are with him, who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name-it. That that's an entitlement. And the government should give it to them. And they will vote for this president no matter what...These are people who pay no income tax ... My job is not to worry about those people. I'll never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives." The man who spoke these words -- who demonstrates such disgust and disdain for half of our fellow Americans -- is the Republicans choice for president of the United States. He wants to lead our country. If you believe that half of Americans are free loaders with no sense of responsibility, by all means vote your conscience. Obviously the people putting out this nonsense have no conscience, and Mr. Romney labeling half of America in this fashion, apparently doesn’t either.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1347968845596</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 07:47:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347973370500-3</Id><Title>Technical Chart Shows Upside on AT&amp;T</Title><Msg>Im in shock!AT&amp;T is on the verge of a major change in trend.

So have I. It made much more sense to me than Obama's "Dreams from My Father". Ann was a high school student at the time she became pregnant and would not have been likely to meet Barrack Obama who attended the University. On the other hand, Frank Marshall Davis was a close friend of Ann's parents and would have had free access to Ann. I think you better clear your mind of your preconceived ideas and watch the DVD again.</Msg><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1347981760987</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 11:22:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347982059134-7</Id><Topic><Title>Obama The Marxist !!!</Title><Username>robertnupstatecarolina</Username><Timestamp>1347958313142</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 04:51:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A divergent theory?

Commies have been in bed with the wealthy thieves ever since wealthy clothing manufacturer, Engels, financed Marx. Jacob Schiff of Kuhn Loeb Bank in New York financed Trotsky to the tune of 20 million of his personal fortune in 1917. Many other banks here and in Europe poured money into commie coffers. A large number of American companies helped rebuild Russia in the 20's and thirties. These crooks don't care what "ism" they use to deceive people and gain power and control. They will use "Liberalism", "Conservatism" or any other "ism" their propaganda media can sell to enough fools.</Msg><Username>lewcor</Username><Timestamp>1347984965336</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 12:16:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347985344282-14</Id><Topic><Title>COULD WE POSSIBLY WANT A MUSLIM PRESIDENT</Title><Username>sayuthink</Username><Timestamp>1347982764850</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 11:39:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I thought Romney was a Mormon, now your telling me he talks like a Muslim.
