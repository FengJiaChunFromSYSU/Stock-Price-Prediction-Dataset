President Obama pulling troops out of Afghanistan and Iraq, while offering less than total support for Israel’s effort to stop Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, has left an exploitable void in the region. The Middle East believes there is a disengagement policy with the U.S….We're leaving Iraq. We're leaving Afghanistan.” – the fake Geoff holt Okay, kids, let’s quit your #$%$ You’re getting killed in the polls, you know it, and all you’ve got left is to attack the President, no matter what he does or says – yet you offer no suggestions as to what to do. Mitt Romney’s only exposure to foreign policy is trying to remember where all his off-shore accounts are. But let’s let you knowledgeable people speak for him – jon, phoneyholt, rob, windandale. You guys say nobody answers your questions. I’ve got some for you. “We're leaving Iraq. We're leaving Afghanistan.” – You’re damn right we are, and the overwhelming majority of Americans want us to. Now, if you guys say that’s the wrong thing to do, state your case. Let’s see you, or Romney, come out and say, “We’re going to keep your sons and daughters (not mine, however) in the Middle-East forever.” Is that what you’re suggesting? I dare Romney to say that and see where it gets him in the polls. And if that’s not what you mean, why are you simply raggin’ on foreign policy when you have none of your own? “…less than total support for Israel’s effort to stop Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, has left an exploitable void in the region…” Again, total hogwash. First, are you suggesting that Israel sets the foreign policy agenda for the United States? I didn’t think so. Are you aware that “when it comes to Iran, far more Americans endorse diplomatic rather than military solution to deal with the nuclear threat.” (Source: Chicago Council on World Affairs – oh, that’s right, you don’t use sources, and anybody else’s are not valid, because you say they’re not – yet you have none of your own.) Don’t believe that one? How about Harratz, (Israel’s oldest daily newspaper), in a column by Chemi Shalev just published September,11th. 2012 : “Despite labeling Iran’s nuclear program as a “critical threat” to U.S. interests, a clear majority of Americans oppose a military strike against Tehran and support a policy of UN sanctions and diplomatic dialogue.” So you can bluster all you want, but how about telling us what YOU or Mitt would do? Are you saying you’d attack Iran now? Do you crazy war-mongers ever stop to think about what you’re saying? Our current President, the responsible man in the White House, who was elected by a majority of Americans (not the one percent that you are here representing) is doing many things you don’t even know about. To wit, he’s beefed up “Operation Olympic Games”, a covert operation originated under President Bush in 2008 – gee, I didn’t hear you complaining about it back then.: “…the existence of a broad new U.S. covert program, called “Olympic Games,’’ that has attacked Iran’s nuclear facilities with innovative cyber weapons. Those weapons are part of Obama’s “light footprint” strategy, which rejects the use of large armies of occupation – of the kind we sent to Afghanistan and Iraq – and concentrates on leveraging America’s technological advantage. So let’s hear from you guys or Mr. Romney, or Rush, Beck and the rest of your saber-rattling, chicken hawk cronies. Please come out with the specifics of your plan. Stuff like this will really fly with the American people in the upcoming election! With the ridiculous comments you make here about how the President is handling foreign policy, when you offer only criticism, we are left to assume this is what you mean. If it isn’t, please clarify your position, or #$%$: Romney Foreign Policy: Start Wars on Multiple Fronts Bomb Iran into Oblivion Bomb Libya into Oblivion Commit American Troops to the Middle East Forever You may as well throw in Bomb China, Bomb Korea, Bomb Venezuela, Bomb Mexico. You folks talk a big game, but you’re all crazy as loons if you think the electorate is going to buy into this nonsense. You know where this lunatic fringe Hawk routine got Goldwater. Go ahead and put this out before the election, and watch another landslide.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1347889566574</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 09:46:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347891835725-4</Id><Topic><Title>If Romney can't run an orderly campaign, how is he going to run the country?</Title><Username>clean_cool_water</Username><Timestamp>1347844727462</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 21:18:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How is he going to run the country?

Doubt you have ever read the Bible or done any study of it's history. You are like the post grad student of oceanography my dad spoke to on an oceanographic expedition. He said the Bible was a collection of myths. My dad asked if he had ever read it and how did he know it was mythic. He said he had never read it but his professor told him it was myth. Some of the garbage spewed in churches about scripture is mythic however. Worldwide flood? No, and scripture doesn't say so when translated properly. They will never find the ark on "Ararat". "Erets" in scripture simply means "a land or country". Any land or country. My guess is the Tarim Basin of central Asia.</Msg><Username>lewcor</Username><Timestamp>1347896428547</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 11:40:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347897542919-9</Id><Topic><Title>Foreign Policy Criticism with No Specifics - same ol', same ol'...</Title><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1347889566574</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 09:46:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Glad you are a democrat, you have aligned yourself with the correct party who's memebers believe as you do.

For what, making a low budget #$%$ film? No, for asserting his right to free speech. Will Obama arrest himself, when that very expensive, Hollywood insider movie, about how Barry took out Osamah is release in another month. I don't think so. My dog is smarter than the average Obummer supporter, and he would not believe one word that Barry said.. I wouldn't let Barry anywhere near my doggie come to think of it.
