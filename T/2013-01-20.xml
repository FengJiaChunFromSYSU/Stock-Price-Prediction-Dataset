The Second Amendment comes from the right to protect, for settlers to protect themselves from slave revolts and from uprisings by Native Americans. So, a revolt from people who were stolen from their lands or revolts from people whose land was stolen from. That was the genesis of the Second Amendment." Thank you Professor Glover for bringing clarity to the conversation and a new level of understanding of why it is so important that the second amendment be overturned. Based on current events, I am sure you speak for many in the democrat party.

Did you enjoy reading about a gun seller in N. C. yesterday excersing his second amendment rights. He took his shotgun to a large gun show in Raleigh and while pulling it out of the case shot three people. I guess he was there to explain why we need stricter gun laws. His show and tell was perfect.</Msg><Username>ellerbebil2</Username><Timestamp>1358684310500</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-20 07:18:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>13</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358684745333-3</Id><Topic><Title>Danny Glover teaches constitutional law at Texas A &amp; M University</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1358679621880</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-20 06:00:21 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So, I guess you agree with Professor Glover's position on the second amendment?</Msg><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1358684745333</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-20 07:25:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358687253589-4</Id><Title>Top 5 causes of accidental death in the US</Title><Msg>According to the National Safety Council the top 5 causes of accidental death in the US include: 5.

Obviously no assault guns means no assault gun shootings. One child lost should mean every good guy should turn in every assault weapon and report those who have them to the police.

You state that here are four in the hospital today, two critical. If under the exact same circumstances those folks had had AR-15s with 30 shell magazines, today there could easily be 20 or 30 people dead. Many of the dead could be completely innocent. Instead we have 2 in critical condition. How many lives would have been completely and utterly changed by the mass shooting? 50,100, 200? We agree that there are many in society who are idiots. We agree that we are not going to eliminate idiots/drugs/drug dealers. We agree that a weapon of one kind or another can always be found. My question is why not eliminate those that can be so destructive? Two in critical condition is vastly different than 20 or 30 dead. I believe the stabbing in Richmond perfectly illustrates my point of why eliminating military style weapons and magazine clips is proper and effective.</Msg><Username>ellerbebil2</Username><Timestamp>1358698883645</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-20 11:21:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358719694713-13</Id><Topic><Title>While There's No "T" News !!</Title><Username>jon3retired</Username><Timestamp>1358557798690</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 20:09:58 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>... “Can any ‘fashionista's’ help me understand this ??” Perhaps for the same reason you wore your plaid, polyester leisure suit to the rattlesnake tent revival service this morning…just wanted to impress the locals.

Although some of the dangers he mentioned are true, the main reason for the second amendment was that there was no national army and each colony was responsible for its' own defense. There was still a threat from England as was demonstrated by the war of 1812. It can be argued that the second amendment is no longer necessary because we have a strong national army. Nearly all state "militias" have been nationalized and report to the federal government. However, the right to own a gun is not based solely on the second amendment. There is nothing in the Constitution that forbids gun ownership.</Msg><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1358726007047</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-20 18:53:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358726577744-16</Id><Topic><Title>Underfund pensions but gift $4 Billion to T-Mobile</Title><Username>followthevolume</Username><Timestamp>1358637256159</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 18:14:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>how does any of senior management keep their job ?</Msg><Username>chunkiecoach</Username><Timestamp>1358726577744</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-20 19:02:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358727902770-17</Id><Topic><Title>A respectable close</Title><Username>davemartin74575</Username><Timestamp>1358542930816</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 16:02:10 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>We got the the squirrel thing. now about those candlestick perspectives Jon...</Msg><Username>davemartin74575</Username><Timestamp>1358727902770</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-20 19:25:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358737683449-18</Id><Topic><Title>A respectable close</Title><Username>davemartin74575</Username><Timestamp>1358542930816</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 16:02:10 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hey Jon, with all respect, the "candlestick" deal came from "nullenvoid".
