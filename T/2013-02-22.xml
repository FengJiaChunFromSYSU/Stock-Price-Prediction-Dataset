It also creates an incentive to provide more services. Alot of people think the FFS system is one of the reasons America's health system can perform amazing medical miracles, but fails to do basic things to prevent medical errors, prevent infections and prevent hospital readmissions. Doctors and hospitals get paid to fix their errors, treat infections and for readmissions, so why prevent them? IMO, the major accomplishment of Obamacare has been the encouragement of Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs). Rather than insurance companies paying doctors and hospitals for each service they provide they get paid for keeping people healthy. The ACO model has taken off, and has been more successful than most thought it would be. If you are really interested in how Obamacare is transforming our health system and controlling costs, look at ACOs. They're doing similar things with colleges. The White House just unveiled it's college scorecard which allows people to compare colleges on costs, graduation rates, loan default rates, and, eventually, employment prospects. The simple measure of the percentage of students who end up defaulting on their student loans provides alot of insight on the value of the education versus its costs. The general theme here is accountability. Rather than just throwing money at issues, we expect programs to be accountable for achieving their goals. And we expect them to compete on the value they provide--their efficiency and effectiveness.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1361545974530</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 10:12:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361546401362-9</Id><Topic><Title>Ia Obama redesigning the message board?</Title><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1361288425832</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 10:40:25 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>echo, I can see by your post you know nothing about Benghazi.

If the State Department and their leader weren’t responsible for what happened and the lack of protection for those folks, then who would you in all your wisdom surmise are responsible? The Commander-in-Chief perhaps, the absent CIC? As for your opinion of Rush, I don't listen to Rush very often, most while in the car with my wife because she is fan...she thinks he is funny. But why is it that every opinion posted herein with which you disagree had to have been formed by listening to Rush or others of his bent. You seem to never consider the option that some people form their onions based personal experiences, independent study and though processes. Just because a person does not agree with your view of the world or its politics does not mean they inherited their views from conservative talk show demons. Being a conservative is not always the bad thing you insinuate, just as being a liberal does not mean you have grown horns and want to eat little children. There are a great many conservatives that just simply disagree with the liberal views that are a tad bit too socialist and leading to a moral decay that history has shown leads to a downfall of great empires. There are great many people that think Obama is a poor President, leader, and even person that hold those opinions regardless of his color and would hold those opinions of any similar acting and speaking person. Your views are not similar to many on this board, which however does not mean we all are the uneducated, mean, ignorant souls you try to intimate. You let your ego and you blinded obedience to liberal causes too strongly color your thoughts and words. If there is a bigot on this board, you may well qualify as the leader of the pack.</Msg><Username>winholder</Username><Timestamp>1361550809563</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 11:33:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361551048527-15</Id><Topic><Title>Ia Obama redesigning the message board?</Title><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1361288425832</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 10:40:25 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>... “…it doesn't matter what there (sic) wearing they are terrorists” - IS3487 “You are echo and also ricky18201.This was a cover-up plan (sic) and simple.” (It could be a cover up plain and simple, or it could be a cover up plan and you’re the simpleton.) “People have a right to express there (sic) opinions without being insulted and put down.” You do, indeed to have a right to express your opinions.

Ever? 2009 was a particularly bad year economically, and it was also a year in which a multitude of one time tax credits were claimed. So lets look at stats from that year: 47% of Americans did not pay income tax in 2009--these are Romney's deadbeats. Only 17% did not pay either income tax OR payroll tax in 2009. 61% of persons who owed no income tax were working and paying payroll taxes. -More than half of people who claim the EITC (one of the main things that reduces income tax liability to zero) do so for only one or two years. -Of the 17% of households that pay not income or payroll tax, most are elderly, disabled or students. Most of these have paid taxes or will pay taxes in the future. So who are you talking about? Old people and the disabled? Students? Working people? People who have paid taxes? People who will pay taxes in the future? Who are the deadbeats you think don't deserve the "benefits of all those things" because they did not happen to pay taxes in 2009? Keep it up. Try calling 47% of the country deadbeats again in 2016.

You would think, but it's an approach largely pushed by moderate Democrats--including Clinton, Gore and Obama. Democrats have a political stake in making government work. They generally think it can work in appropriate instances and push it as a solution. Therefore a lean, well-functioning government that is effective at solving problems is good for them politically. Republicans, by contrast, think government can't work. They campaign against government and spending. A lean, well-functioning government that effectively solves problems is not good for them politically. A bloated, dysfunctional one is.

LOL ************************************ A West Virginia political science professor prohibited her students from citing Fox News as a source for research papers because, she told them, the network "makes her cringe." Stephanie Wolfe, who works at West Liberty University, instructed students to filter out two potential research sources: Fox News, which many Democrats say is slanted to the right, and The Onion, a satirical news source, NBC affiliate WTOV reports. Wolfe's syllabus said: DO NOT use 1) The Onion — this is not news this is literally a parody 2) Fox News — The tagline “Fox News” makes me cringe. Please do not subject me to this biased news station. I would almost rather you print off an article from the Onion Wolfe, a visiting assistant professor who has a one-year contract with the university, was filling in for another instructor who was on leave, The Daily Caller reports. On her syllabus, Wolfe does not prohibit any other news sources, such as MSNBC, which some consider is an overtly progressive news organization. Parents and students contacted the university to object to Wolfe's ban, prompting a response from Robin Capehart, the school's president. "One of our values at West Liberty is to encourage students to go out and inquire and gather information and look at as many different sources as possible on any side, before you reach your opinion," Capehart told WTOV. "Any attempt to limit the breadth of a student's ability to investigate is obviously something at which we have a concern." Wolfe declined to comment on the issue, WTOV reports. She is still teaching, but no longer imposes any limitations on where students get their information from.</Msg><Username>pinhighshot</Username><Timestamp>1361562557529</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 14:49:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>15</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361562952179-38</Id><Topic><Title>How's that good old liberal tolerance working for you?</Title><Username>pinhighshot</Username><Timestamp>1361562557529</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 14:49:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>LOL!

Clips from 'Grossly Illegal Contradictions', by Jim Kirwin: • Instead of reducing sales of AR-15s and other firearms in America, the gun grab dramatically increased sales of nearly all firearms beyond any previous record. In essence, the American people bought nearly every gun available anywhere in the country, leaving gun store shelves empty. The upshot of all this? 10+ million new firearms in the hands of citizens and a one-year backlog of gun orders with manufacturers. • While the gun grabbers wanted sheriffs and cops to jump on board the gun disarmament bandwagon, what actually happened is that sheriffs began speaking out AGAINST gun control and encouraging their local constituents to arm themselves. Sheriffs across the country -- in huge numbers -- publicly proclaimed they would not allow federal agents to enforce gun restrictions in their counties. • While gun grabbers wanted states to fall in line and surrender to federal authority on the issue of gun control, what actually happened is that the Firearms Protection Act began to be introduced in state legislatures such as Wyoming and Texas. This act, which is now being considered in more than a dozen other states, would make it a felony crime for anyone to enforce new federal gun restrictions in their states.” • While gun grabbers hoped the U.S. military would agree to fire upon American citizens who refused to turn in their guns, what really happened is that huge numbers of active duty soldiers announced they would never participate in military action against their own countrymen. In fact, inside the military there is rising talk of shooting commanding officers in the head if they order troops to fire on American citizens over gun rights issues. • In New York state, where Mayor Cuomo managed to quickly shove through an illegal, unconstitutional gun control law, there is now open talk of armed resistance against the state government. Elsewhere, there is even talk that U.S. Senators who vote for gun control may see their own staffers and families targeted for assassination. As Stewart Rhodes said on InfoWars Nightly News on December 31st, 2012: "They will be targeted. I think that if they pass this bill, legislators who vote for it will be assassinated... they're going to be military targets, too, and they're going to be killed. They think they're immune, but they're not. They cannot walk around with enough security to keep from being shot by a sniper." - Stewart Rhodes, OathKeepers.org.” And there is MORE @ the link It is clear that AMERICANS will FIGHT AGENDA 21 just as they have fought the gun-grabbers. Members of the paper-world of the UN are even less well protected, in New York, than are the 535 member-traitors in the US Congress. The people who are seeking to steal this nation might just want to THINK ABOUT THAT…</Msg><Username>lavendarsen</Username><Timestamp>1361582922844</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 20:28:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361583483124-51</Id><Topic><Title>Alternate analysis of gun grab</Title><Username>lavendarsen</Username><Timestamp>1361582922844</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 20:28:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Here are clips frpom another thought provoking Kirwin analysis regarding recent retirements in Congress: The most likely additional retirees would seem to be Sens. Tim Johnson (D-S.D.), Carl Levin (D-Mich.), Thad Cochran (R-Miss.), Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.) and Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.). And as with Johanns, there are always a few surprise retirements along the way. The senators calling it quits so far this year are: Lautenberg, Johanns and Sens. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.), Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.), Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) and Jay Rockefeller (D-W.Va.).” (2) Apparently there is about to be a major exodus from the Congress that will give “retirement” a whole new look in Amerikkkan Politics. These vulture-politicians will not be getting away with what they’ve been doing year-in and year-out. Their retirement’s will be tracked by the millions of us that are continuing to lose everything thanks to them: Which should make their personal-retirement anything but pleasant—given how many of us will have very little to do anymore except to think about how things got to be the way they are in Amerikkka today. Up till now politicians could always just resign and disappear into the mists of yesterday, where they can be protected from the CRIMES that became their staple in everyday life, as part of this damned government. THAT WILL NO LONGER BE POSSIBLE! There’s a new third force in the world that’s been operating for awhile and changing the rules. Terminating those that are no longer needed in whatever the “new world” will soon begin to look like. This couldn’t come at a better time! “A top Exxon Executive was assassinated with a double tap to the chest and a coup de grass by an assassin in Belgium. (In October of last year) Some suspect it was done by a private contractor. It is known that all Intel agencies and private mercenary contractors have "clean teams" to take care of "special problems". And most have special "boss hogg" lists by priority, folks to be targeted if a COG situation occurs. At the end of WW2 General Kammler, head of special and secret antigravity weapons "cleaned" all his scientists and officers using a clean team, and then cleaned the clean team to protect the anti-gravity and anti-matter cross dimensional secrets his team developed (e.g. the bell and other related projects). Since this occurred in Belgium where NATO is located as well as SHAPE (the Brussels international military complex), it is possible this is an executive action of the Third Force which some believe is moving to knock out old traditional money and military power and to realign power into new groups free of the world money changers run out of the City of London. A possible motive for this executive actions is for a certain Third Force, an up and coming group to be sending a strong message, a shot across the bow to the oil price fixers, the int'l oil cartel run out of the City of London and maybe as a reaction to oil prices that are far too high lately. This could also be an indicator that the Third Force is making a move to erode or implode the Petro dollar which is based on the US Dollar. If this is so, this would eventually lead to the complete financial collapse of the Babylonian moneychanger system run out of the City of London and NYC using the US dollar as its front for world acquisition through oil. And of course Putin could be making a key move to establish Russian oil priority in the background, as this shift in world power appears to be occurring. Perhaps the same folks have been involved in convincing the Pope to resign.” (3) It is almost as if the world has momentarily paused in the middle of the chaos. We seem to be holding our collective breath ­ but that can’t last more than a few more days and then events will begin to race toward their individual outcomes…</Msg><Username>lavendarsen</Username><Timestamp>1361583483124</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 20:38:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361584899450-52</Id><Topic><Title>Alternate analysis of gun grab</Title><Username>lavendarsen</Username><Timestamp>1361582922844</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 20:28:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I would assume that most, if not all, of the people mentioned in this article who are reacting to the gun grab with alarm and seem to be preparing for their own self defense, are White.

The Court noted that Illinois was the only one of the 50 states to ban most residents from carrying concealed weapons until a U.S. Court of Appeals in Chicago in December ruled the law violated the Second Amendment to the constitution protecting the right to bear arms. Can you imagine the wailing and nashing of tooth in Washington and Chicago when they realize that the collective imperial governments of the democrat party in both places will have to rethink their positions on gun control. I can't wait to see the Sunday talk shows on the major networks when they get a chance to ask prominent democrat party leaders (from both Chicago and Washington) how this ruling affects the party's plans to disarm the American people. Oh wait a minute, I almost forgot, the major networks are propagandist for our "dear leader" and his party, and they will do their best to spike this story and make sure that by Monday the decisions of the court never see the light of day, so that they can go back to the really important tasks like investigating the president golf score when he played with the Tiger. "Lordy be Oprah" you got to understand that the imperial media has its priorities, and the American people and their rights are not one of them, because you see our "dear leader" and his party have an agenda, and it can not, I repeat, can not be questioned. So go back to sleep America, enjoy the Academy awards this weekend, because by Monday our "dear leader's" propagandist will have spun the facts of the story to show that the court's majority are not of sound mind, and that the party leaders are currently making plans to have these rouge judges institutionalized so that they will never be able to make decisions that are contrary to the party's agenda ever again. Rest easy America our "dear leader" and his party have everything under control, because all citizens really need to protect themselves from assaults by well armed criminals with AR-15's and high capacity clips is a double barrelled shot gun and two shells, just ask Joe. Yes America it is time for all loyal citizens to learn to trust the party and its leaders, because resistance is futile. Again someone wrote, "All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing." So go back to sleep America. "In your heart you know he is right."
