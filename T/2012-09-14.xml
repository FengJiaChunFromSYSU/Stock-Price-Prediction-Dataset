Is this still America? The way we are being lied to is unblievable, we are now forced to rely on foriegn sources to get information. According to senior diplomatic sources, the US State Department had credible information 48 hours before mobs charged the consulate in Benghazi, and the embassy in Cairo, that American missions may be targeted, but no warnings were given for diplomats to go on high alert and "lockdown", under which movement is severely restricted. Senior officials are increasingly convinced, however, that the ferocious nature of the Benghazi attack, in which rocket-propelled grenades were used, indicated it was not the result of spontaneous anger due to the video, called Innocence of Muslims. Patrick Kennedy, Under-Secretary at the State Department, said he was convinced the assault was planned due to its extensive nature and the proliferation of weapons. There is growing belief that the attack was in revenge for the killing in a drone strike in Pakistan of Mohammed Hassan Qaed, an al-Qa'ida operative who wasfrom Libya, and timed for the anniversary of the 11 September attacks. Senator Bill Nelson, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said: "I am asking my colleagues on the committee to immediately investigate what role al-Qa'ida or its affiliates may have played in the attack and to take appropriate action."</Msg><Username>art_bell51</Username><Timestamp>1347598008522</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 00:46:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>13</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347626297294-2</Id><Topic><Title>Embassy attack - Romney does Obama's job</Title><Username>geoff_holt_2001</Username><Timestamp>1347475758963</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 14:49:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you expanded my remarks If only I had to expand your remarks.

Yes, I am sensitive when my country is insulted. You do it consistently and often. Our diplomats do not and did not apologize for American values. They stood by them, in the field, and four gave their lives for them. For the likes of you and Romney to denigrate them from the homefront, during an ongoing crisis, is awful. You and your friends on this MB are hateful, divisive, fearful and gullible. These are not the American values our soldiers and FSOs die to defend. They die for tolerance, unity, courage and reason.

Bear himself as being wrong, and that the whole World has to have higher ideals. Less bickering, less black, white, or yellow, but one human race occupying Planet Earth. In my true opinion Mitt is done. He has never had to come from below, and pull himself up. It will be interesting to see what he does. Lets see some tax records, let's talk about I am not perfect, Obama does not say he is. Let's see the Mitt only Mitt sees in the mirror. The Mitt he has been hideing. .

I can’t wait to see them. Unfortunately, all but the delusionally impaired are asking a legitimate question; If pictures of Arabs with rocket launchers coming across our southern border existed, wouldn’t Jan Brewer, Rick Perry or Sheriff Joe Arapio already have made sure they were in the hands of FOX News or any of the other Non-MSM arbiters of the truth from whom you get this type of information? But let’s examine the logic of this, another of your sage and well-documented allegations. By “coming across our southern border”, I assume you meant they were sneaking in – or was this guy just standing in line on the International Bridge Customs crossing from Ciudad Juarez to El Paso with the other migrant workers, except for the rocket launcher slung over his shoulder? Custom Agent: “What are you doing with that, sir? Answer in Arabic tinged, fake Spanish accent, English: “The-e-e-s, Senor? The-e-ess new speedy papaya picker, Senor.” Not likely, so let’s assume your pictures are of night crossings in a desolate area using night vision cameras. Let me ask you rob - If you had such a picture, how would we know they are Arabs? If you were an Arab trying to sneak through the border, would you be wearing your traditional keffiyeh and a white thawh? (Those white robe guys you saw were probably some of Sheriff Joe’s Klansmen, you dolt!) And would you be carrying a rocket launcher while sneaking in? Rob, I’d be willing to bet that you wouldn’t know what a rocket launcher looked like even if an RPG hit your Prius. But I hate to challenge you, rob, because you always provide such insight and reliable information. So let’s make a wager; If you produce one picture of an Arab with a rocket launcher crossing our border, I’ll trade you (even up) three pictures of Kate Middleton topless in the south of France, an original autographed photo of Glen Beck in his Nazi uniform from his book cover, a photo I have of black helicopters circling over your ghetto dwelling in Baltimore, a much coveted and only copy existing of a secret FEMA concentration camp cleverly hidden beneath a platform at the Fulton Street subway station in Manhattan, a Sara Palin blow-up doll once owned by Rush Limbaugh, a Joe McCarthy “Demagogues for Decency” lapel pin, an abridged version of Ted Kaczynski’s Unibomber Manifesto for speed readers, titled “I’m Wackier than Lavender”, and an Ann Coulter “Liberals Hate America” beer koozie. I’ll also buy you a beer to go in it if you throw in five years of Mitt Romney’s tax returns. Do we have a deal, Rob?</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1347627186023</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 08:53:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347629336466-5</Id><Topic><Title>Why isn't Barry attending the Daily Whitehouse Briefings?</Title><Username>robfisk</Username><Timestamp>1347587447741</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-13 21:50:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The voters are doing what I am going to do.

The next day, he was rallying a crowd in Colorado. The campaign continues to make plans for swing-state visits next week in Ohio and Florida. Yet as more information emerges indicating the attack on the American Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, may have been a coordinated terror strike -- Sen. John McCain is the latest to declare it a "terrorist attack" -- some are questioning whether the president is acknowledging the severity of the situation. "We've seen numerous reports now of a growing intelligence trail that this was a planned attack," said Richard Grenell, Grenell questioned Obama's recent campaigns stops and media interviews in light of the tragedy. McCain, after an intelligence briefing Friday, said the Libya strike was carried out by terrorists and not a mere out-of-control mob. Speculation about the true root of the attack grew following a report in Britain's Independent claiming officials believe the attack was planned, that the State Department may have had warnings in advance and that sensitive documents have since gone missing from the Benghazi consulate. A State Department official reportedly told lawmakers Wednesday that he did think the assault was planned. And other lawmakers and analysts have reached the same conclusion. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers told Fox News shortly after the attack that it was clearly "coordinated." His account was backed up by a Libyan official Thursday who said it was a two-stage operation. The second stage involved an attack on a separate building that Americans consulate employees tried to take shelter in after the main building came under fire at 10 p.m. local time Tuesday. Two of the four Americans who died were killed in that second phase of the attack. The Independent report quoted a Libyan troop leader who assisted in the rescue operation that night saying "I don't know how they found the place to carry out the attack. It was planned, the accuracy with which the mortars hit us was too good for any ordinary revolutionaries." Eastern Libya's deputy interior minister was quoted Thursday saying the attacks may have been timed for the 11th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks. "This was not just about any sort of a spontaneous revolt. This was an organized attack," he said. After a week on the campaign trail, Obama is back in Washington Friday, though he does have a private campaign event planned for Friday evening. The Romney campaign, though, is criticizing the president's approach -- not just this week, but over the course of his administration. "There's a pretty compelling story that if you had a President Romney, you'd be in a different situation," Romney foreign policy adviser Richard Williamson told The Washington Post, claiming "respect for America has gone down." He called it "amateur hour."</Msg><Username>geoff_holt_2001</Username><Timestamp>1347637961109</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 11:52:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347637974700-27</Id><Topic><Title>What's fueling the GOP decline?...</Title><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1347546435275</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-13 10:27:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The biggest thing fueling the GOP decline is the slate of characters the GOP had to begin with.
