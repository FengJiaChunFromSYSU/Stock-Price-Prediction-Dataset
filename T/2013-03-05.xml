Because the Democrats don't want to vote for an Obama budget for fear that voting for it will cost them votes at home. That is how 'fair' his budgets would be. "Republicans do not control Congress.' Precisely the point. They don't control Congress and yet Obama and Harry can't or won't get a budget up for vote or passed. He won, what is the problem? "This House has passed empty political statements so hacks like you can make posts like this." At least they passed something relating to a budget which is more than Harry Reid has done or even attempted. How many poor excuses can you trot out in hopes of convincing anyone that the Senate is doing its job and that their Democratic leader, Mr. Obama is trying? He knows one thing, how to make campaign speeches while getting the taxpayers to foot the bill as part of normal Presidential travel! "They should be working with the Senate to pass a budget--not passing their own political statements." If you want them to work with Harry, then Harry has to present something for them to work on. He hasn't. He won't bring Obama's budgets up for vote and won't present one of his own for consideration. It isn't hard to be obstructive when there is nothing to obstruct. You can’t really be believing all the stuff you write, you don’t seem that stupid and naïve.</Msg><Username>winholder</Username><Timestamp>1362493901809</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 09:31:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362494088859-10</Id><Topic><Title>On the third day of sequester Obama gave to me:</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1362344262150</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-03 15:57:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If you ever made a salient point, or any point, or said anything of consequence or usefulness, you might be worth reading.

If that is your opinion, which is becoming more and more irrelevant, you didn't read very far. I said our fearless leader, which is a misnomer when referring to Obama, is a poor leader. No, I misstated yet again, he is NOT a leader period, poor or otherwise. I said he won't or can't produce a budget and does not want to. Budget, even in Congress draw attention and place responsibilities and accountability on those drawing up, recommending or approving such tools. I wrote, not in the exact same words but intent, that he can't lead from an airplane or deal with Congress from Kansas or Virginia or wherever he has most recently chosen to run off and hide. He chooses, to ‘work’ the American people versus doing his job and ‘working’ with Congress to find a solution that might be other than his personal ambitions or ideals. I wrote that he can't or won't and hasn't compromised on anything. He doesn't grasp the concept or simply chooses to disregard the concept. He believes that ignorance is the greatest tool of oppression and he uses it to full advantage with his voting bloc. Maybe if you stopped ignoring the truths all around you and stopped reading only to find words that support your opinions and not reading between the lines and read the actual text for content, perhaps you might not miss as much.</Msg><Username>winholder</Username><Timestamp>1362496545440</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 10:15:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362496721560-25</Id><Topic><Title>Please say a prayer for a True American Sheriff Joe Arpaio</Title><Username>bouch84</Username><Timestamp>1362421106271</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 13:18:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Even Brian Williams and Chuck Todd are starting to make snarky comments about Obama's travels and his choosing to campaign for the people to do his job versus staying home and meeting face to face with those that will make the decisions.

The President's Budget Request is generally a starting point for negotiations over the budget within Congress. As you know, those negotiations have not been successful, and have basically broken down into crisis politics and cheap sniping. In response to Republican tactics, Obama has chosen to push for a Grand Bargain that includes the Federal budget legislation, entitlement reform and tax policy to address the deficit long term. Entitlement reform and tax policy are each separate pieces of legislation from the formal budget, which (for the most part) includes spending only. (There is a difference between what most people consider the "Federal Budget" and the formal legislative process).

Then his proposal that we continue to borrow an average of 688 billion dollars per year for the next ten years is unrealistic to say the least.

The trillion dollar increase is a combination of spending, tax cuts and reduced revenue from the recession. Most of the spending increase is temporary--TARP, stimulus, etc. Likewise the Bush tax cuts were responsible for most of the deficit through the 2000s. That's what "Starve the Beast" means. You cut taxes to create a deficit that you hope will result in spending cuts. Republicans do this not because they're concerned about a balanced budget. They have an ideological notion about the "size" of government. Remember how Clinton achieved a surplus? Tax increases, economic growth, and slowing long term spending growth. He did not "cut spending". Our economy can definitely handle the level of government spending we have now. Our people have consistently demanded it. We need to pay for it, keep spending growth restrained, and prioritize our spending.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1362509721302</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 13:55:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362512110274-49</Id><Topic><Title>On the third day of sequester Obama gave to me:</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1362344262150</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-03 15:57:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>...I see the board has regressed even further into a downward spiral of spam and outlandish, sophomoric rantings, mixed in with the typical, ongoing Mad Hatter Tea Party talking points. “Sometimes Ricky you are so full of it.” – t.bfine to the real ricky (I wonder why it is that he never responds to the fake rickys?) …said the pot to the kettle. How hypocritical coming from you. Here’s what I find to be extraordinary…In my opinion, the real Ricky is the most knowledgeable poster on this board, who, responds with well documented, cogent and factual information…unlike the multiple-aliased droves of you who when cornered, simply change handles and go about with your meaningless drivel and intentional distortions. Being a boomer, myself, I’m not always pleased with his condemnation of all of us with generalizations, as though we didn’t deal with philosophical political battles beginning in the 60’s, much of it as much, if not more so, polarizing than today’s dysfunctional political climate. At least I don’t see anybody mowin’ us down in the streets of Kent and Jackson today. Nevertheless, he is far and away the most factual poster on this board, and continuously embarrasses the Wall St. pawns, the Tea boy obstructionists, the racists and other general board provocateurs who are obviously paid shills. (You know, guys like the frog who end each post with the immortal words of Barry Goldwater, which led to his humiliating blow-out loss. Great idea, there, frogman…still hoping that John Birch will resurrect your sorry a#s while trying to drag America back into the stone age? Uh, did ya’ notice that there was recently an election? Oh, right, you did so you all have reverted back to obfuscation and obstruction mode. Can’t be FOR anything constructive, so let’s be AGAINST everything. Did any of you clowns listen to what Jeb Bush said yesterday? What don’t you understand about that?) Now, before you once again suggest that he and I are the same person (like most of you guys), I haven’t a clue who, or where, he is, and the open wager to compare aliases is always available. More importantly, just like the recent (and ongoing) sordid campaign strategy of the GOP who relied on distortions, redistricting, swift boat attacks, voter suppression and other desperate (and losing) tactics, why does he have so many imposters mimicking him? Are you cowards that frightened that he makes so much sense that you need to try to lie, cheat and confuse people with imposter aliases? What a sorry lot. Just for the record…for anyone who would like to sort out who’s who nowadays, simply click on the bold name of the poster at the top of the post (if viewing messages…if viewing topics, click on” by (bold name)”. You will not only see the posts from that individual, but see number of posts, last activity and member since (date). Thus, regarding the fake rickys…The real ricky has been a member since Sept. 23, 2011. The fake ricky using the l to look like a 1 started mimicking him on Oct. 6, 2011. The puzzling one is the one whose alias appears to be exactly the same, but when you click as advised above, he’s been a member only since March 15, 2012. I’ll admit, I don’t know how two people can have the exact same alias, but that’s the way to tell them apart. If anyone has any idea (yourself included real ricky), fill us in. Or, better yet, ask Yahoo W…….T……..F???? Meanwhile, imposter aliases are nothing new, and usually Yahoo will deal with them. Multiple aliases and the silly rating system are also a joke…but, hey, Yahoo wants eyeballs.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1362512110274</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 14:35:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362513043053-50</Id><Topic><Title>AT&amp;T Upgraded to STRONG BUY !</Title><Username>marymitchell773</Username><Timestamp>1362510364800</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 14:06:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This is it !!</Msg><Username>markwilson810</Username><Timestamp>1362513043053</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 14:50:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362513454757-51</Id><Topic><Title>AT&amp;T Upgraded to STRONG BUY !</Title><Username>marymitchell773</Username><Timestamp>1362510364800</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 14:06:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Verified as strong buy</Msg><Username>ps06109</Username><Timestamp>1362513454757</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 14:57:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362514832779-52</Id><Topic><Title>AT&amp;T Upgraded to STRONG BUY !</Title><Username>marymitchell773</Username><Timestamp>1362510364800</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 14:06:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thank you for sharing !</Msg><Username>danielbowen947</Username><Timestamp>1362514832779</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 15:20:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362515571868-53</Id><Topic><Title>AT&amp;T Upgraded to STRONG BUY !</Title><Username>marymitchell773</Username><Timestamp>1362510364800</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 14:06:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks :)</Msg><Username>stanley.joshua</Username><Timestamp>1362515571868</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 15:32:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362516067954-54</Id><Topic><Title>On the third day of sequester Obama gave to me:</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1362344262150</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-03 15:57:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And the deficit and out insurmountable debt are as a result of the frenzied spending by Congress for the last few decades.

All of Bush' spending would have been paid for if he hadn't cut taxes, or just let them expire on schedule. Obama has consistently pushed the idea that spending should be paid for through revenues. He does not necessarily think spending is foolish, especially in an emergency, but not paying for it is. And he is clearly trying to pay for it. Your problem is you associate the deficit with spending. However it is also caused by a lack of revenues. Believe it or not, Obama's spending is on par with natural growth in spending. He just did all of his growth in year one, spending has been flat since.

Although growth is projected to be stable, the key supports for growth are expected to shift over the two years. In 2012, the Administration’s budget proposals underpin growth, while in 2013 increased private demand is expected to play a larger role in supporting continued recovery. This economic forecast is based on the assumption that the Administration’s budget proposals are enacted in full. The Administration recognizes that not all forecasters share this assumption, and it is the main reason the Administration projections for real growth in 2012 are stronger than the consensus expectation. In 2014, growth is projected to increase to around 4 percent annually as the job market improves and residential investment recovers. Real GDP is projected to return to its long-run “potential” level by 2020, and to grow at a steady 2.5 percent rate for the remaining years of the forecast." Don't try to get sh** past me.
