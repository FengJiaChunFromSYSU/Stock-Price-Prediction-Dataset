The South Korean tech giant hopes that 5G - or fifth generation - mobile broadband, will be available for the average consumer by 2020. In a statement, the company said: "5G will be capable of providing a ubiquitous Gbps (gigabit per second) experience to subscribers anywhere and offers data transmission speeds of up to several tens of Gbps per base station. "The implementation of a high-speed 5G cellular network requires a broad band of frequencies, much like an increased water flow requires a wider pipe. While it was a recognized option, it has been long believed that the millimeter-wave bands had limitations in transmitting data over long distances due to its unfavorable propagation characteristics. "However, Samsung’s new adaptive array transceiver technology has proved itself as a successful solution. It transmits data in the millimeter-wave band at a frequency of 28 GHz at a speed of up to 1.056 Gbps to a distance of up to 2 kilometers. "Samsung plans to accelerate the research and development of 5G mobile communications technologies, including adaptive array transceiver at the millimeter-wave bands, to commercialize those technologies by 2020." Last year, the University of Surrey announced £35m funding for a research centre backed by Samsung, as well as Huawei, Fujitsu, Telefonica and others. Up to now, scientists believed high-frequency wavebands were unsuitable for long-range communications required by mobile networks.</Msg><Username>low_mac</Username><Timestamp>1368448346849</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 08:32:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368454191360-4</Id><Topic><Title>Darrell Issa Nutball...</Title><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1368203030221</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 12:23:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"began as," And in the *very next sentence* Susan Rice said that it was infiltrated by extremist elements and that they would have to wait to determine whether that was Al Quada. This is complete and utter BS. Do you not, in your life, have better things to worry about than whether Susan Rice mentioned terrorists forcefully enough, soon enough for your tastes? Do you really think the election hinged on that one comment by Susan Rice? If you do you're a fool. Obama had a commanding lead in the polls beginning in mid summer and it did not let up even after his poor showing in the 1st debate. Or would you prefer a Bush who makes decisions first and gets the facts later? If we had that type of President we would have invaded Syria last week. And THAT is why you people lose elections. That and birther conspiracy BS like this. You are disgusting for dragging the families through this.

Nor did it take me 36 hours to come up with it, unlike your rather quirky "response". But then, it would have been uncharacteristic for you to break from your squirrel-like self-pleasuring over your Glenn Beck photo collection to get a response out any earlier. I'll let you go on it this time. BTW, I like the alias jon came up with for me so much, I am not posting under the "wledigmacsen" alias any longer.</Msg><Username>hotdoggitwiggie</Username><Timestamp>1368496507199</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 21:55:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368496656028-71</Id><Topic><Title>"What difference, at this point, does it make?"</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1367862161237</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 13:42:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Uh oh.
