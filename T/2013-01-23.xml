Jim Kratsas, of the Gerald R. Ford Museum, speaking to NPR (you lunatic fringe guys call that Pravda), back in 2010, when Obama signed the health care bill into law. “Mr. KRATSAS: Well, it was my understanding that Harry Truman was the first one to have a box of pens, kind of like giveaways. And it was actually started by somebody who sent President Truman a box of pens that said, I swiped this from Harry Truman's desk. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. KRATSAS: But the tradition has been, ever since then, that each president that comes into office, they get multiple boxes of these pens. “ So Mr. Reid pocketing a pen is a big issue for the frog philosopher. Meanwhile, he just said the following: “As far as criticizing Mr. Glover's opinions, I think you have over interpreted my comments, because none of my statements have ever been critical in nature of Mr. Glover.” Did you conveniently forget that you said this about Glover, who you ignorantly thought was a Professor: ‘Thank you Professor Glover for bringing clarity to the conversation and a new level of understanding of why it is so important that the second amendment be overturned. Based on current events, I am sure you speak for many in the democrat party.” There is no “over interpretation” of you stating that either Danny Glover or “many Democrats” are suggesting anything even remotely close to overturning the second amendment. That is simply not true and nothing but empty demagoguery from ignorant, unwitting pawns of the gun lobby and the arms industry. Who would say such a thing? Well, somebody who would also say something like this, which you recently said and still refuse to answer to: “As a result of the assault 76 church members were killed, 17 of which were children. Just a little example of what happens when the federal government comes to save lives in your state. In your heart you know he is right.” So this frog character is glorifying David Koresh and his merry band of wacked out Branch Davidian-cultists, who killed four BATF agents attempting to serve them a search warrant. He also tells Americans that any discussion of sensible gun control legislation intended to reduce the possibility of further mass killing, is nothing but an attempt to overturn the 2nd amendment. But Harry Reid ripping off a ceremonial pen is ghastly. Sure Frogman, in our hearts, we know who’s right…and it certainly isn’t you.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1358952601822</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 09:50:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358953445722-5</Id><Topic><Title>Harry Reid gets caught stealing pens from the White House</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1358895111474</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 17:51:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How embarassing for this frogg character to be thoroughly debunked.

That was a war zone, nut, and Native Americans were considered the enemy. Perhaps you'll view efforts by our military to disarm the Taliban as gross violations of their 2nd Amendment rights as well? Native Americans weren't granted ANY rights. One of the reasons the 2nd Amendment existed was so American citizens could organize militias to slaughter Native Americans. What happened to Native Americans goes far, far beyond what you describe as a violation of their 2nd amendment rights. This is just outlandish. This is another example of conservatives seeing an injustice and thinking the solution is guns. Don't give those Sioux equal rights, land or an education, that won't solve the problem. Give them guns! Here's a thought, conservatives. Treat all people as equals, with dignity and respect. Provide all people with an opportunity for a decent living and the opportunity and tools to excel. Don't treat a large mass of people living and working in your midst as 2nd class people without access to basic rights and support. Don't create a social and economic situation where your prison system grows to gulagesque proportions. Don't invade other people's land and steal their resources. Then maybe people won't have to resort to shooting you. Who do you think the people slaughtered at Wounded Knee were? People like you? They were trying to kill people like you. And don't you forget it.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1358953802430</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 10:10:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358953854277-7</Id><Topic><Title>Danny Glover</Title><Username>ellerbebil2</Username><Timestamp>1358808488801</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 17:48:08 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thank you.

The philosopher and professor at Princeton University said that he has problems with some of Obama's policies. West called it “morally obscene and spiritually profane” to spend $6 billion on an election and not have any kind of national conversation about the major problems the country faces. “Poverty, stagnating and declining wages when profits are still up and the 1 percent are doing very well,” he said. “No talk about drones dropping bombs on innocent people. So we end up with such a narrow, truncated political discourse.” He said that King would not approve of much of modern America, or what Obama has not done to change during his first four years in office. Based on King’s past speeches, West insisted that Obama has a long way to go before he is worthy of MLK’s Bible. What would MLK say about the drones on the precious brothers and sisters in Pakistan, and Somalia, and Yemen. Those are war crimes Martin Luther King, Jr., what would you say?”</Msg><Username>ricky1820l</Username><Timestamp>1358954916304</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 10:28:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358955124796-9</Id><Topic><Title>Premises Technicians MUST VOTE TWICE!</Title><Username>cwa_renegade</Username><Timestamp>1358830853490</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 00:00:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>AV8LOVER, what part of this post gives you the idea that anyone is wanting to 'bust' the CWA.

" Maybe you missed my point or maybe you didn't see all of the video, regardless I thought that this touching little video was rather a metaphore for the way people in Washington think. If you actually watched the video you would have seen: o The President signs some documents and thanks everyone o Harry slides the pen holder and takes a pen o Chuck Schumer ratts Harry out to the President o Harry (after being found out) returns the pen to the pen holder o The President makes a joke about the issue and gives Harry a pen out of his pocket o And everyone has a good laugh If you can't see the humor in this moment, then I guess I will have to feel sorry for you.

Based on current events, I am sure you speak for many in the democrat party.” I guess we will have to disagree on this point. I feel that I faithfully documented Mr. Glover's statement. Further after reading his statement I got a better understanding of why it is so important for some on the left to overturn or limit the power of the second ammendment.

I feel that I faithfully documented Mr. Glover's statement.” There’s no disagreement. You in no way documented Mr. Glover’s statement. You said in no uncertain terms that Mr. Glover (and somehow in you convoluted logic, an extension to “many in the democrat party”) are telling us why it is so important that the second amendment be overturned.” Those were your words – just like Wayne La Pierre – trying to frighten people into believing that any kind of gun legislation is going to “overturn the second amendment.” That is nothing more than cheap, incendiary rhetoric designed to inflame those on the extreme right. But wait…in your non-response, response, you suddenly change what you said to, “…why it is so important for some on the left to overturn or LIMIT THE POWER of the second amendment. Really. You now ad LIMIT THE POWER?…no, sh#t, Sherlock…had you said that initially, there would have been no problem. Yes, limit the power. The 2nd Amendment does not give you the right to own a B-52, self-propelled 155 howitzers, or fully auto, unlimited magazine weapons of mass destruction. And having some restrictions is, in no way, trying to overturn citizens rights to bear arms. “Some how you find this statement to be David Koresh glorification. Nice try, but I don't think so.” I see. So saying this is fine with you. “Just a little example of what happens when the federal government comes to save lives in your state.” You criticize the government for reacting to the Branch Davidian’s killing of 4 agents trying to serve them a warrant? No, you didn’t “glorify” them in so many words. You simply implied that a crazy bunch of fundamentalist wack jobs, enlisting women and children into a cultish clan of depravity, should be allowed to maintain a small arsenal, and use those weapons on government agents at their whim. Does that pretty much sum up your frog philosophy?</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1358972588528</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 15:23:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358972885924-32</Id><Topic><Title>Top 5 causes of accidental death in the US</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1358687253589</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-20 08:07:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That is possibly the weakest response of any in a long, long time.

Even if the list you provided is true (which I doubt) it is analogous to saying all the people who died went to the hospital, therefore the hospital killed the people. You're ignoring two things. The people went to the hospital because they were sick, and it was the sickness that killed them, and that not all of the people who went to the hospital died--most were helped by going to the hospital. So what are saying is that all the people involved in mass shootings were on psych meds. You're ignoring two things. The people were on psych meds because they were sick, and it was the sickness that caused the shootings, and that not all of the people who are on psych meds were involved in mass shootings--most were helped by the psych meds. You see this kind of thinking all the time. All the kids who have autism had vaccinations, for instance. It's a fallacy. "You have nothing but twisted logic!

What I think is that if grenades were available at Walmart, criminals and psychos like Adam Lanza would have grenades. But grenades aren't available at Walmart. Same with AR-15s. It may take time to get them all off the streets, but the difficulty of access will be instantaneous. Eventually, they'll be as scarce as grenades. "Guns are not the problem, simply a tool" Keep in mind no one is talking about getting rid of "guns", just particular kinds of guns. Some guns are very effective tools for killing large numbers of people in a short period of time.

Perhaps you'd like to provide some actual documentation then. And I wonder if you consider the most watched cable news network as part of the mainstream media? "But if you are saying that our country would be better off if those of us on the right would just shut up and go away." What I am saying is they should discuss issues and solutions. What we get is the right making a national issue over whether some guy at some event at some university said something conservatives think wasn't conservative enough. (mind you, it was true what he said. Some just didn't find it conservative enough). But I've got to admit, Froggie, it's still better than your usual outright lies. "I will continue to do what I do."
