Not at all. Obama and I both propose long-term cuts to entitlement spending. We both support squeezing more efficiency from the system and slowing spending growth. What we oppose is cuts to infrastructure and safety net spending during a slow recovery from a deep recession. We both oppose cuts that are arbitrary or that cut beneficial programs. We don't support cuts that will dismantle Medicare and Social Security for future generations, as Paul Ryan will propose today. We don't support cuts that disproportionately fall on working people and future generations. I have to ask, did you even look at the number I presented? Do you have any solution to present? Of course not. You are simply intent on raving about "Obama" this and "Obama" that? That is why you are stupid.

That would be a 6% cut to BOTH Medicare &amp; Social Security. So are you willing to reduce your Social Security check by 6% AND add about $600 to your Medicare premium? Should the cuts be scaled to income, because such a move would fall disproportionately on the middle class and poor otherwise? Or are do you think the entire brunt of the cuts should be borne by younger people? Proposing cuts only for those under 55 (which would NOT affect the ten year spending projections through 2022) as Ryan and many Democrats have done?

Aren’t you callow Tea Party types the ones who are constantly harping about accepting personal responsibility for your own actions? Will you never get over your humiliating defeat? Apparently not, because you always quote from your hero, Barry Goldwater’s campaign slogan – you know – the one that led to the worst drubbing in the popular vote in the history of our country. You stick with those values, and rather than admitting why you got skunked, you try to make stuff up? Making stuff up is what got you in the predicament you’re in, fool! Now, I suppose you blame that overwhelming rejection of Goldwater’s extreme conservatism (and, sadly, still yours today) on voter fraud of old ladies. Gee, back in ’64, you clowns hadn’t yet come up with the concept of blaming the media, as you pathetically do today. You asked how many Melowese Richardsons it takes to change an election result. Well, obviously she hasn’t yet been convicted of anything, and you know full well that Richardson truthfully identified herself at the polls and voted in her own name because she didn’t think her absentee ballot would arrive in time. She also assisted others in her household in sending in ballots. Was she overzealous – I would tend to think she was. So, for the sake of your very lame argument, let’s say that all five of the alleged votes should be discounted. So, to answer your question, Obama’s 60,459,974 winning votes, minus Romney’s 57,653,982 losing votes equals a difference of 2,805,992 votes. Or, at 5 illegal votes each, how many Melowese Richardsons would it take to change the result. Well over a half million of her, or 561,199 to be precise (popular vote). So, if you still want to stick with your insane and sorry excuse for your overwhelming defeat, you might be here a while listing out the other half million Melowese’s. Oh, and btw, if we want to argue about the actual election results from YOUR side, rather than picking on one individual from your opponent…and the considerably more influence of illegal activities ORGANIZED BY THE PARTY itself…perhaps you should peruse the headlines from last Fall.

We should not therefore assume the alternative that she is innocent and her actions are rare and inconsequential.

Then go after the fraud and put systems in place to identify fraud. Of course, that involves that great Conservative bugaboo--government spending. Voter ID rules, purging voter rolls, shortening the absentee ballot period or any of the other myriad voter suppression policies you people push would have done NOTHING to stop Melonese Richardson or any imaginary army of little old ladies. What caught her was normal voter fraud techniques. Just like normal auditing exposed the malfeasance at LG. You don't need to disenfranchise thousands of voters. You need to audit your results. The fact that these techniques ARE successful at identifying cases of fraud does not lead to the conclusion that the entire system is corrupt. Quite the opposite. Yet that is the argument you you persistently push here. Systemic voter fraud would be revealed by differences in vote tallies from polls and exit polls--as happened in Iran. That simply has not been the case here.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1363111666670</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 14:07:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363111851829-44</Id><Topic><Title>Detailed AT&amp;T Research Report !!!</Title><Username>ashleyjones221</Username><Timestamp>1362156250127</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 11:44:10 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks for sharing !</Msg><Username>phipps.jennifer</Username><Timestamp>1363111851829</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 14:10:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363112051971-45</Id><Topic><Title>It looks like Obama wants to bankrupt America</Title><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1362778576708</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 16:36:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"But on the other hand you would rather that the older folks that helped build and educate today’s midlife screamers and instant gratification children can just crawl off into a corner and die" Get real, dude. There is some middle ground between privatizing Medicare &amp; Social Security as Paul Ryan proposes and making Medicare &amp; Social Security untouchable as Tea Brains and Progressives propose.
