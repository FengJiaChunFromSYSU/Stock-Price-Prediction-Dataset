You figured out how easy it is to get under the skins of all the morbidly bored, hyperventilating old women on this board. Keep it up, they need something to remind them that they are alive. Fux News can only provide so much excitement for these old screws until Glenn Beck finally decides to take his shirt off and they can fantasize about licking his tears off his pendulous manb**bs.</Msg><Username>wledigmacsen</Username><Timestamp>1367680124787</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 11:08:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367680279830-2</Id><Topic><Title>Dave Martin sez: SHOW US YOUR WEB PAGE B.S.

As well as understanding Relative Strength Index (RSI). However, I have a job so I don't have the time to do a ton of research on individual stocks (believe it or not I am an investment consultant for 401(k) plans and mostly use Mutual Funds). I have very few individual stocks. I mostly bought dividend payers back in 2008 (T, the old Progress Energy, now Duke, FSP and some ETF's). I asked this question during a quick break mostly just to see what, if anything, anyone thought. I use this board more for its entertainment value and hope to every so often find a nugget (still waiting). If you notice, I very rarely post.

The man responsible for arming rebels in Egypt, Libya, and Syria and the drug lords in Mexico is blaming the United States. Well he is right for a change. The United States elected him president or he would not have been in a position to spend our tax dollars that way. If we are responsible citizens we will get him out of office before he does more damage. He will not resign like Nixon did because he has no love for our country.</Msg><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1367699187107</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 16:26:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>23</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367706259642-6</Id><Topic><Title>Today, May 3, 2013 - 12pm Central Time</Title><Username>rdcn100</Username><Timestamp>1367600362025</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 12:59:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I was wondering the same thing. I went ahead and bought some shares near the end of the day because it seemed to be strange it was down.

He was called out to prove he is some sort of an insurance type. No home page and no listing of this cretin exists. He is a fraud. I'm sure he is unemployed and most likely collecting benefits from the last job he was fired from about 3 years ago. He's milking the system.</Msg><Username>davemartin74575</Username><Timestamp>1367711670954</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 19:54:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367711801565-8</Id><Topic><Title>Dave Martin sez: SHOW US YOUR WEB PAGE B.S.

Is everyone asleep? Obama allowed our people to get killed. This attack went on for 8 hours. We could have had marines there in 2. Then then Obama blames it on a video? Really we need to wake up folks. Israel strikes Syria on their own because we have turned our backs on Israel. Very Scary much danger... Israel will take care of it they are backed against the wall. They wont stand for this. If we dont calm this down there willl be post blast glass in the desert.</Msg><Username>hubcap1234_00</Username><Timestamp>1367718841230</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 21:54:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>15</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367719499872-11</Id><Title>T mgt should be fired and let the workers run the co.</Title><Msg>I actually spent some time looking into T mgt. Talk about ticks.... They make too much $ for poor peformance. If a workers results were that poor they wouldnt get their 3% raise. T is a bloated mgt pig festering up ready to bust open for the buzzards to feast on. Look at the numbers. Glad I sold this at 37.
