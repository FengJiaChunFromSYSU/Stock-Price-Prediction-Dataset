Here you have a group of medical professionals following protocols which have been developed by the medical community over decades. And what do Tea Brains want? A judge and an MBA--two bureaucrats--to make the medical decision instead--a medical decision that will determine that one person may live and another may die. That's your death panel. There is not one in Obamacare but the Tea Brains are determined to force one on us. All so they can score a few cheap political points. Good job. We have medical protocols in place to allocate organs. Sebelius does not have the authority to make an exception. She also has the wisdom not to seek that authority. It is too bad one judge and thousands of idiot Tea Brains don't have the same wisdom. Or the least bit of sense at all. Racists. Liars. Hypocrites. The definition of a Tea Brain.

Which demonstrates my main point--lewcor lied. This is not the first time he has told this lie and not the first time I pointed it out to him. If Zimmerman was on the police force he would have identified himself at one of the many opportunities he had to do so. Trayvon Martin would not be dead and George Zimmerman would not be on trial. But Zimmerman is not a policeman. He is not trained to do what he did that night but he did it anyway. He decided to play policeman and he created a situation in which he ended up shooting and killing an unarmed 17 year old kid. That is a crime. Understand? It is a crime to kill people.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1370963110314</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-11 11:05:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370963164764-22</Id><Title>DSL Problems?</Title><Msg>Call the AT&amp;T - Office of the President 877-677-3215</Msg><Username>bush_shlt_on_us</Username><Timestamp>1370963164764</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-11 11:06:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370963648764-23</Id><Topic><Title>Is the Yahoo message board working OK?</Title><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1370959182969</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-11 09:59:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No, it is completely down, messages not showing.

Martin insisted that they did not belong to him. Earlier, he had been suspended for skipping school and showing up late to class. And most recently, in February, he was suspended again when officials found a ‘marijuana pipe’ and an empty baggie with traces of the drug." I guess our "dear leader" had a point when he said that "if he had a son, he would look like Trayvon" Interesting that you only had a problem with the "screwdriver" portion of my post and not for the fact that I pointed out that the two individuals involved with this incident were both mixed race and for that I am guilty of being a "racist liar". Thank you for proving again just how far you will go to show your pathetic views on race and bigotry and your need to confuse and deflect when you can not support your case based upon fact, but only by marginalizing and trashing those that disagree with your position. You are a well trained zealot and for that I must admit admiration, and I would bet that Saul Alinsky would also be proud of your efforts in furthering the cause. "In your hear you know he is right."

Zimmerman/Martin incident happens and Martin is killed. 2. Due to Florida's Stand your Ground law, Zimmerman is declared innocent without trial (and, by proxy, Martin declared guilty of assaulting Zimmerman without trial). 3. People like me say this is something that deserves a trial. 4. Tea Brains say no, it was clearly self-defense, no need for a trial. I don't know if Zimmerman will be found guilty or not. But I do think we need to have a trial to determine if he is innocent or guilty. THAT is what I am defending--the need for a trial. It is the conservative media and their Tea Brain sheep who think he should just be declared innocent without a trial and have declared Martin guilty without trial. My personal opinion is that Zimmerman's actions rise to the level of manslaughter, not murder. But a jury will decide if he is guilty of that, murder or nothing at all.
