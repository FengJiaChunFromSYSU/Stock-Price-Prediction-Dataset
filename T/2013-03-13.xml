Medicare is being paid for by deductions from SS benefits.

Sec. and Medicare are funded through the payroll tax, and both trust funds invest in US Treasuries. Soc. Security does not "include welfare". Other mandatory programs, including things like the VA, SNAP, TANF, HUD, etc, appear in a separate budget line. Soc. Sec. does cover disability. However, I am not sure why you think the government should take care of income for people in their old age but not health care or the disabled. The main difference between Medicare funding and Soc. Sec. funding is that Reagan raised Soc. Sec. taxes in the 1980's, making the program almost self-funding (as Roosevelt envisioned). The same was not done for Medicare. If your argument is that retirees have "paid into" these programs and thus they "earned" the benefits, we should cut out Medicare for current retirees and seniors (who chose not to fund the program for themselves), raise Medicare payroll taxes, and reinstate Medicare once the Medicare trust fund is solvent again. We should also lower benefits for current seniors until Soc. Sec. is completely solvent, and then reraise them once the boomers have moved through the system. That way, everyone gets what they "paid into". Younger generations do not have to pay for what boomers and current retirees failed to pay for.

There are THOUSANDS of such stupid expenditures on which we waste billions (yeah I know the lesbian thing doesn’t cost billions, but rolled up the stupid things they spend money are do add up to billions). If they hadn't robbed SS to spend money on such foolishness, perhaps we wouldn't be having this conversation. As a matter of fact my health care costs were less before I had to go on Medicare. I had to go because the insurance companies say so and so do any employer run retirement health care plan. As for as your comments about Roosevelt, why do you never make the point that Obama has never had to deal with a true crisis like 9-11 as Bush did? You seem to forget that point and that the Democrats were all over starting up HLS and the waste that much of it has been. The few crises that Obama has created, and he did most of them, he has failed to find a reasonable solution. The President is again predicting failure over a budget compromise before they even hold a meeting. How engaged do you think he really is? Again he is signing, ‘if they won't give me what I want then we can't reach a deal’ and he is acknowledging that before negotiations even begin. If Harry had a set, he would do what is right, work out a deal within Congress and let Obama veto it, and then override him. Let him know he is the President, not King.</Msg><Username>winholder</Username><Timestamp>1363205398389</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-13 16:09:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363205631148-34</Id><Topic><Title>It looks like Obama wants to bankrupt America</Title><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1362778576708</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 16:36:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Again, Obama has already said that Ryan's plan won't work unless it looks like his plan.
