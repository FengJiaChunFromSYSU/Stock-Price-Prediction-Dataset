The dividend is worth more now. The higher the yield the more strong $'s I get next quarter.. Earnings should be up. 5% is safe. Its a great time for buy backs. I think Bernanke is bluffing for cheaper gas this summer anyway. Don't get caught up in the Obama/Bernanke tax trap. An honest price and a strong $ is good news.</Msg><Username>neeljak</Username><Timestamp>1371910349785</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-22 10:12:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371917711677-8</Id><Title>Test</Title><Msg>Test</Msg><Username>stockinvestment</Username><Timestamp>1371917711677</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-22 12:15:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371918793272-9</Id><Topic><Title>After Hours</Title><Username>bargainboy44</Username><Timestamp>1371882194860</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-22 02:23:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm qouting Big Charts ....Volume 1,538,552 in After Market , up 23 Cents.</Msg><Username>bargainboy44</Username><Timestamp>1371918793272</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-22 12:33:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371922521628-10</Id><Topic><Title>After Hours</Title><Username>bargainboy44</Username><Timestamp>1371882194860</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-22 02:23:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yep, that is what I get.

When asked if she'd ever used the N-word, Deen did not hesitate. "Yes, of course," she answered. In the deposition, Deen not only admits to wanting to throw a slavery style wedding for her brother in which all the servers would have been middle-aged black men but also to using the N-word repeatedly. Yes my friends I believe that if Ms. Deen's "besties" Barack and Michelle can forgive her for using the "N" word when she referred to them, then I am sure that even though she is a democrat, most Republicans will be able to find it in their hearts to forgive the racist and bigoted behavior of this very sad democrat. "In your heart you know he is right."
