Reagen and Bush started the big run up in debt and, although Clinton reversed the trend dramatically in the size of the annual deficit for his eight years he didn't leave anywhere near a Surplus. Bush ran the debt up faster than any prior President and, in 2008, was the first president to have a deficit over a trillion dollars. Now Obama is making him look like a miser with deficits over a trillion every year. The US has always been in debt except for 1836 when we had a very temporary surplus. However there were many years that ended with a surplus until FDR came along. However the largest part of our current indebtedness was under Republican Presidents. Obama will change that before 2016.</Msg><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1365654806117</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 00:33:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365656628677-2</Id><Topic><Title>The Gang of Twelve...</Title><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1365541266729</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-09 17:01:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"How about you frog folks explain to us all, why the American people, through their elected representatives are not entitled to a vote on this?" You asked for it so here it is. The Constitution can not be amended by a vote of the Congress. They are wasting their time even discussing tighter gun controls. Experience shows that gun controls don't work. They just give criminals more laws to break. Illinois, Colorado, and Connecticut are among the states most tightly controlled and yet violent crimes are higher there than in states with fewer controls. It should be clear even to you that it is not about guns, but about control. The "gang of 12" are not controlled by the gun lobby; rather they are controlled by the Constitution. I know you Communists wish there were no Constitution but there is and we need our guns to make sure you don't take the Constitution away.</Msg><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1365656628677</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 01:03:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365657208945-3</Id><Topic><Title>The Gang of Twelve...</Title><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1365541266729</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-09 17:01:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"in all likelihood" maybe happen, maybe not doesn't mean much to a parent of a murdered child, that may have had a chance to live do it now to save one child is enough reason, not going to save all, one is enough.reason.</Msg><Username>peppeek</Username><Timestamp>1365657208945</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 01:13:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365672252667-4</Id><Topic><Title>Optimistic news !</Title><Username>leeconnor743</Username><Timestamp>1365106294330</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 16:11:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>strong report.</Msg><Username>markconnor739</Username><Timestamp>1365672252667</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 05:24:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365680047062-5</Id><Topic><Title>Obama added $7,000,000,000,000,000 000.00 Trillion to our US debt.

The Homosexual community created the suicide problem in the first place by trying to convince young people that it is OK to be gay. They have even added the Q to the end of the LGBT ..... anybody even questioning their sexuality is now included in the LGBTQ club. Well there is a built in moral compass that most of us have, and a natural attraction to the opposite sex. Prior to the 60s and the radical homosexual agenda boys and girls didn't question who and what they were, they knew what they were and there were few suicides ..... as in rare. It is because of the infiltration of radical homosexuals and foolish liberal school administrators that allowed the teaching of gay is good in schools, that the I am so confused about my sexuality began. And because of that moral compass on one hand that knows who you are and knows wrong from right, and the direct opposite teaching to young impressionable minds by foolish liberals that gay is good, that is the conflict that confuses young people enough to at times attempt suicide. And rather than going back to where we once were and teach moral behavior and allow boys to be boys and girls to be girls, foolish liberals today within these companies wanting to be politically correct double down on gay is good to young people in their efforts to prevent suicide. How backwards and utterly foolish. It would be very much like the police teaching young people how to drink, text and drive safely instead of trying to stop that dangerous behavior.</Msg><Username>it_never_rains_in_oregon</Username><Timestamp>1365685475619</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 09:04:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365686020841-11</Id><Topic><Title>LBGTQ</Title><Username>it_never_rains_in_oregon</Username><Timestamp>1365599336976</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 09:08:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Great.

The Constitution can not be amended by a vote of the Congress.” – wilkes Wilkes, you need more than the bogus talking points of the far right for legitimacy. Sane people understand that no one is amending the Constitution with these gun control proposals. You sound very foolish suggesting that they are…but, then again, you sound very foolish most of the time. “Experience shows that gun controls don't work. They just give criminals more laws to break.” - wilkes “Firearm deaths are significantly lower in states with stricter gun control legislation.” The Geography of Gun Deaths, 2011 – The Atlantic Gun controls are aimed at preventing criminals from getting the guns in the first place. As it stands now, anyone can buy a gun legally and then sell it to a criminal. There are thriving businesses doing just that. Ask you pal, jon. Personally, I am not happy with the compromised version of the proposed legislation, but closing the loopholes in background checks is a start. “I know you Communists wish there were no Constitution but there is and we need our guns to make sure you don't take the Constitution away.” – wilkes Calling me a Communist and suggesting that I abhor the Constitution does very little to validate you gun control argument, does even less for your overall credibility and adds immensely to your reputation as a Tea Party fanatic, pimping for the gun manufacturers under the guise of the 2nd Amendment (which you obviously don’t understand.)</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1365686171824</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 09:16:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>14</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365686404368-13</Id><Topic><Title>AT&amp;T Upgraded to STRONG BUY?</Title><Username>miguel.janis</Username><Timestamp>1364394934253</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-27 10:35:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thank you very much!</Msg><Username>hargreaves_leo</Username><Timestamp>1365686404368</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 09:20:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365687126125-14</Id><Topic><Title>The Gang of Twelve...</Title><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1365541266729</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-09 17:01:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"The Constitution can not be amended by a vote of the Congress." Who's talking about amending the Constitution? Believe it or not, the NRA does not get to dictate the meaning of the Constitution to the government or the people of America. In fact, the US Constitution grants that authority to the US Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has, since its inception, allowed the regulation of arms. The Constitution is a pretty nifty document. You should read it some time.

The deficit peaked in 2009 at $1.4 trillion--mostly Bush budget and the recession, but Obama's stimulus spending and tax cuts were part of that too. The deficit for 2013 is about $900 billion under current law. Obama's 2014 budget proposal would result in a $744 billion deficit for 2014, and it would shrink to $500 billion by the time he leaves office. One thing is certain. Republican presidents grow deficits and Democratic presidents shrink them. I am not sure why you would think Obama is making Bush look like a miser.

How did I get busted? You just make stuff up!” – t.bfine Of course I made up the stuff about you getting busted, just as I did about win et. al. moving to Tibet. I’m pretty sure that anyone reading it, or who has followed my posts would know that it was strictly satirical, as I’m sure you did. Now, the story that you made up about the nursing home forcing your mother to vote against her wishes had no more credibility than The Tibetan Tea Party Theocracy of the Thoughtless…the difference is, one was written in jest to ridicule the preposterous one that was written to convince I’m not sure who, that the president was elected fraudulently. And, as I said, if you were concerned about how, or if, your mother voted, you should have been there to help her. And, obviously, I wouldn’t know if you were busted or not, but I would believe that if the nursing home heard about how you were slandering them, I should think they would have tried. Would you like us to contact them and see if the black nurse really influenced your Mom, or if they care about you saying they did? While you’re here, jon and wilkes are crying about gun legislation. Are you with them that we should do nothing? Are you on board with the filibuster? Do you believe registration is a violation of the 2nd amendment? Do you believe you’re a T Hall of Fame poster?

His name, Garner Ted Armstrong, was involved in some less than scrupulous activities in the church he was involved in. He was a visionary of sorts in one regard. His dad had a radio ministry and Garner Ted wanted to expand on that before television became the medium of choice (as it is today) for modern day televangelists. His story is interesting. Google it up for all the details. You will see how some practices haven't changed much in the world of using religion fo personal gain and secular pleasure since he tried his hand at it some time ago. Your card game experience sounds like a good lesson for potential gamblers to learn. If the option market isn't pure gambling, I don't know what is. Personally, I wish it didn't exist. Like I told you last week. I put my money into the real deal. In 3 weeks, I'll reap the benefit of a fat 6K tax free Roth dividend. I don't need to be on edge whether a contract makes my nut or loses a bunch. You'll be getting yours too! Funny, my dividend comes out to about $65.50 a day with 100% certainty. Just shy of Wilkie's 66 bucks a day.

Unless they have multiple identities, or change their identities frequently, you get a fairy good picture of what a contributor brings to the game. To say that for 'many years T couldn't be purchased because it didn't look good at 28.00.' How come it didn't look good when it was about 19.00 and wasn't acquired a few years ago?
