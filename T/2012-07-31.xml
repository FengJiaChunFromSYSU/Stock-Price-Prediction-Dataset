Not me. But if you're insinuating or charging me as one, then read on. That is a serious statement and accusation !! Here is my reply, lv66vette : If you were awakened at 3:30 in the morning to find a burglar in your home, in the USA one does not have to politely ask the intruder what he is doing in your house. This scenario is regarded to be life threatening. Human instincts are heightened, even fear. Would you rationalize, falter, “not-see” and fail to protect your home and family from the desperado that is burglarizing your home ? Similarly, in the wake of the World Economic Crash of 1929, what was stolen and who gained ? Like a thief in the night, unconfronted – the network of thieves (insiders) had stolen the savings, dreams and aspirations of millions of instantaneously ruined people. Everywhere society was devastated. Including your special focus, Germany society, the center of the “not-sees” and catalyst for father-like retribution. Retribution ? Germany’s proud hard working indigenous people were devastated by the economic 1929 market collapse. Indeed, the foul cream had risen to the top. Together, both the “perpetrators of theft and their favored market darlings” met their adversary of “greater pride, might and means”. I do not deny the European holocaust of WW2 had happened. I merely wish to try to understand what had provoked it and believe Germany implemented its version (“Home Castle”, use of deadly force against an intruder) of a modern day “Cowboys &amp; Indians” – which these days is still a popular children’s game. Thus, I refute being called a “Not-see” based logically on the standpoint of the naturally, popularly accepted historical record and foundation of The USA’s European expansion, combined with protection by The Constitution’s 2nd Amendment for the unquestionable logic of the “Home Castle Law” which together were invoked as the WWII remedy about how to deal with a burglarizing network of thieves. 2008 &amp; 2012 complications, dejavu ? Or have the means for retribution been legislated away to create sheople that cower before the bellowing bombastic cries of “Not-see” ! Me ? I am tired of the asshat whining and lack of manning-up to their complicity and provocation of the heavy hand that was laid on them.</Msg><Username>kit3taylor</Username><Timestamp>1343728528000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 05:55:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343729778000-3</Id><Topic><Title>Extra $1.2 trillion needed for W.

But the welfare state has spawned a whole class of people who spend everything they get when times are good, and look to others to provide for their food and other basic needs when times turn bad. * * * * The 14th Amendment to the Constitution prescribes "equal protection of the laws" to all Americans. But what does that mean if the President of the United States can arbitrarily grant waivers, so that A, B and C have to obey the laws but X, Y and Z do not-- as with both ObamaCare and the immigration laws? * * * * Two reports came out in the same week. One was from the Pentagon, saying that, in just a few years, Iran will be able to produce not only a nuclear bomb but a missile capable of carrying it to the United States. The other report said that the American Olympic team has uniforms made in China. This latter report received far more attention, both in Congress and in the media. * * * * People who lament gridlock in Washington, and express the pious hope that Democrats and Republicans would put aside their partisan conflicts, and cooperate to help the economy recover, implicitly assume that what the economy needs is more meddling by politicians, which is what brought on economic disaster in the first place. * * * * Racism is not dead, but it is on life support -- kept alive by politicians, race hustlers and people who get a sense of superiority by denouncing others as "racists." * * * * For more than two centuries, the U.S. military never had a public celebration of anybody's sex life -- until the recent "gay pride" event under the Obama administration. Here, as elsewhere, the gay political agenda is not equality, but privilege. * * * * Those who talk as if more people going to college is automatically a "Good Thing" seldom show much interest in what actually goes on at college -- including far less time spent by students studying than in the past, and a proliferation of courses promoting a sense of grievance, entitlement or advanced navel-gazing and breast-beating. * * * * One of the most dangerous trends of our times is making the truth socially unacceptable, or even illegal, with "hate speech" laws. It is supposed to be terrible, for example, to call an illegal alien an "illegal alien" or to call an Islamic terrorist an "Islamic terrorist." When the media refer to "undocumented" workers or to violence committed by "militants," who is kidding whom -- and why? * * * * After the charismatic -- and disastrous -- Woodrow Wilson presidency, the voters did not elect another president in the next decade who could be considered the least bit charismatic. Let us hope that history repeats itself. * * * * Franklin D. Roosevelt famously said, "We have nothing to fear but fear itself." Then he proceeded to generate fear among businesses for years on end, with both his anti-business rhetoric and his anti-business policies. Barack Obama is repeating the same approach and getting the same results -- namely, an agonizingly slow economic recovery, as investors hang on to their money, instead of risking it in a hostile political environment. * * * * There seems to be something "liberating" about ignorance -- especially when you don't even know enough to realize how little you know. Thus an administration loaded with people who have never run any business is gung-ho to tell businesses what to do, as well as gung-ho to tell the medical profession what to do, lenders whom to lend to, and the military how to fight wars.

And it will not be a Democrat/Republican problem, it will be just the Republicans against Republicans. The crazy ones will think they have a mandate to do what they preach. If they succeed we will have a depression inside of 18 months. And Romney? Heard he praised Israel's super socialistic national health care plan while in Israel. Just a taste of what Republicans can expect if he is elected. They will tear themselves and the country apart. They did a pretty good job with Bush and now they can finish the job. And I voted for Reagan twice and Bush Senior once. I voted for Bush Senior because he had the guts to raise taxes because he thought it was the right thing to do even though he knew it could/would cost him the election.</Msg><Username>robmxaa</Username><Timestamp>1343776094000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 19:08:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343776269000-43</Id><Topic><Title>Year End Price</Title><Username>magichoppens</Username><Timestamp>1343681779000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 16:56:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Should mention that I did not vote for Bush Jr. because I thought he was a complete idiot.
