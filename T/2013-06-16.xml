If you do have that many shares you have close to 59,000 a year of income.

It was probably with a .50 cal. black powder charged rifle. His grandson (my uncle) taught me to shoot when I was 12. He had just gotten out of the Army and combat in 1945. I got the best rifle score in my high school ROTC class and did very well in basic even with an M-1 that was so worn I swear the bullet rattled as it went down the barrel. I have an M-1 Beretta conversion (legal, no selector) made for me by Juan Erquiaga a Peruvian Army officer who was Castro's armorer in the Sierra Maestro in Cuba. When Castro announced he was a commie Erquiaga denounced him and fled with a price on his head. I knew many of the Alpha 66 Cubans.</Msg><Username>lewcor</Username><Timestamp>1371405181089</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-16 13:53:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371412934873-5</Id><Topic><Title>Obama wants your gun</Title><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1371231416862</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 13:36:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wouldn't it be nice if he, family &amp; staff would decide to stay there. Why heck, he knows how to make his own beer - just let him have A.F.1 &amp; the 'pimp-mobile' .. and if he gets hard up for funds he could just hock them ... Over there his possibilities are more favorable of becomming "King", instead of trying for it here .. ya think !!

The cost of the trip may reach $100 million. Why don`t they just go to Chicago, Detroit, Florida etc, no difference. It would be a whole lot cheaper. For the first time in American history, White deaths outnumber White births, the beginning of the end of the White majority and possibly the White race, unless immigration, birth rates and other factors change. When you consider though, the genocidal brainwashing of Whites it is not surprising. We were taught to be good residents of the earth, not to over populate it, in fact to decrease our population in order to save the earth. PUKE. And we were taught to save all other races, to help them survive and not our race, without knowing that colored populations were and are exploding while our own race declined . PUKE. And all the wars that have destroyed generations of White men, their health, their genes, their lives and their future generations. Vietnam , Korea, the middle eastern wars and all sorts of global skirmishes. Whites were the major casualties in all of those wars, Whites were used to benefit a criminal elite and possibly to further the genocide of Whites. Latinos Blacks and Asians have healthy birth rates though. As planned, imo, to replace Whites in our own country. Most ordinary Whites should prepare for a bleak future. We have intentionally been misled and really really screwed.</Msg><Username>lavendarsen</Username><Timestamp>1371433742933</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-16 21:49:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371433930497-7</Id><Topic><Title>Interesting item regarding pay for volunteer fire fighters.</Title><Username>lewcor</Username><Timestamp>1371320958123</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 14:29:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Were many of them colored, I wonder?</Msg><Username>lavendarsen</Username><Timestamp>1371433930497</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-16 21:52:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
