Randall promoted the east coast types into leadership roles after the ATT merger who make the daily decisions of how things are run at the expense of many SW leaders and rank and file who lost their jobs as a result. I am not a fan of Randall or ED, I am not sure bigger is better. SWBT provided a high level of service and was better place to work than the post AT&amp;T merger company we see now with all it's Ameritech and former AT&amp;T leadership influences.

Volume was very high that day and is only about 60% of average volume today. This increase could be due to the news that "AT&amp;T Inc.

I helped many members drop the union hoping that if I touched the wallet of the Union that they would stop being puppets for AT&amp;T. I eventually retired and it appears that nothing has changed.
