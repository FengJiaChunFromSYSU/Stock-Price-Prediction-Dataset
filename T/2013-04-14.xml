And despite your repeated efforts to ignore or discredit the international scientific community, science remains science…I know that’s something that you aren’t familiar with as you continually choose to ignore facts and believe whatever supports your preconceived view…on any subject. To wit: You lost the election by over 5 million votes, but in your mind the election was fraudulent or the voters were ignorant. Half of all Americans are worthless bums seeking hand-outs. The President’s a Muslim, communist, socialist, racist, community organizer from Kenya with no birth certificate who stole a Nobel Prize and wants to take over the world. You guys, on the other hand are all Mother Theresa-altruists working for the betterment of all of mankind. The polls saying over 90 percent of Americans want gun control legislation are bogus and made up by the fascists coming after your guns. The NRA cares only about sportsmen and not the gun industry. All media, worldwide, except Fox are liars. Obama Care wants to kill your grandmothers. Education is for losers and smart people are elitists…and God doesn’t work miracles for smart folks. Women, people of color, gays and other minorities are inconsequential in your grand scheme of things. Only you know the one true God, and he is 100 percent on your side in all issues. Everyone else is wrong, and if they don’t follow your view of love and peace in the world, they deserve a drive-by smitten. The world is only 6000 years old. Conception begins after a quart of Jack Daniels. Global warming is a hoax because jon, lew and frog boy said so. After a while, your intentional deception goes from being simply ignorantly silly, to borderline criminal behavior. “…perhaps the real reason that Governor Perry, and like-minded laissez-faire proponents, deny global warming and contend that government regulations hold back business and plea for smaller government and self-regulation is this; Texas, the center of America’s oil and gas industry, also is the number one emitter of the major green house gas – carbon dioxide – in this country today. Is it any wonder, then, why he disavows the findings of the National Academy of Sciences, as well as the overwhelmingly accepted consensus of 18 scientific organizations, whose statement to The Senate concluded: “Observations throughout the world make it clear that climate change is occurring, and rigorous scientific research demonstrates that the greenhouse gases emitted by human activities are the primary driver.” * * Letter to the Senate, October 29, 2009 from The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and U.S. Global Change Research Program, American Association for the Advancement of Science, American Chemical Society, American Geophysical Union, American Institute of Biological Sciences, American Meteorological Society, American Society of Agronomy, American Society of Plant Biologists, American Statistical Association, Association of Ecosystem Research Centers, Botanical Society of America, Crop Science Society of America, Ecological Society of America, Natural Science Collections Alliance, Organization of Biological Field Stations, Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, Society of Systematic Biologists, Soil Science Society of America, University Corporation for Atmospheric Research. There you have it…please take your time and read who made the above statement. I once again encourage you to make some kind of serious attempt to come up with some legitimate source to counter all of these folks and to support your ridiculous point of view…Eddie Munster doesn’t cut it, boys and girls. Would you suggest that all of the above scientific organizations are all in a conspiracy? For what purpose? Who benefits by denying that global warming is happening – the people that are causing it, or some clandestine group of scientists trying to start new green industries for personal gain? What a silly question. Basic logic in no way supports your view…in anything. In your heart, you know fossil humans support fossil fuels.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1365939894001</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 07:44:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>22</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365949784081-3</Id><Topic><Title>Oh no say it isn't so!</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1365866656934</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-13 11:24:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What a lovely response from a true zealot of the "environmental socialist religion". Since a true believer's belief is based primarily upon faith and not science, I will offer a few facts about this new religion: o Green House Gas is and has always been a part of the earth's atmosphere; without Green House Gas the earth's surface would average about 33°C colder than the present average of 14 °C (57 °F).The primary component of Green House Gas is water vapor. o The CO2 component has increased from 280 ppm (around 1750) to about 397 ppm (present day) o Over the last 10,000 years many global warming and global cooling cycles have been recorded (i.e., these cycles are about 170 years in duration) o The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is the primary working group that is behind the environmental socialist agenda o Over the last few years the IPCC has been caught fabricating and publishing false and misleading evidence that supports their agenda o In November, 2009, brought Climategate—the release of thousands of emails, computer programs, and other documents showing that climate scientists in control of the IPCC had fabricated, exaggerated, suppressed, and corrupted data to support the belief in catastrophic anthropogenic global warming. o The first few months of 2010 brought Himalayagate, Amazongate, and a variety of other revelations that the IPCC’s vaunted AR4 (Fourth Assessment Report) had incorporated non-peer reviewed articles, indeed sometimes outright propaganda pieces produced by environmental advocacy organizations, as sources of some of its most alarming predictions. I could go on, but there is enough proof in the public domain to show that man caused global warming has little to do with science, and more to do with a political agenda.

It’s your pond…sink or swim. Yes, the IPCC had some data challenged. The IPCC is but one of the signators to the letter to the Senate signed by 17 other professional scientific societies to which you so ineptly responded. Are you a scientist by any chance? If not, what qualifies you to challenge a world full of them who actually are, and who overwhelmingly disagree with you? Oh, I see...you’re an advocate of John Coleman, infamous TV weatherman and self-appointed spokesman for the “global warming is a hoax” crowd. So it’s you and John against the world, huh? Good luck with that...I’ll stick with the scientific community. Oh, and here’s what they say about your complaint about AR4. Again, this is 250 scientists calling both you and John, bozo’s. “Various criticisms have been raised, both about the specific content of IPCC reports, as well as about the process undertaken to produce the reports. On 13 March 2010, an open letter, signed by over 250 scientists in the United States, was sent to U.S. federal agencies that "None of the handful of mis-statements (out of hundreds and hundreds of unchallenged statements) remotely undermines the conclusion that 'warming of the climate system is unequivocal' and that most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-twentieth century is very likely due to observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations".[ Various scientific bodies have issued official statements endorsing and concurring with the findings of the IPCC. International Council for Science. "...the IPCC 4th Assessment Report represents the most comprehensive international scientific assessment ever conducted. This assessment reflects the current collective knowledge on the climate system, its evolution to date, and its anticipated future development". - Statement by ICSU on the controversy around the 4th IPCC Assessment 23 February, 2010 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (USA). "Internationally, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)... is the most senior and authoritative body providing scientific advice to global policy makers". 6/25/2012 United States National Research Council. "The IPCC's conclusion that most of the observed warming of the last 50 years is likely to have been due to the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations accurately reflects the current thinking of the scientific community on this issue". – 2/23/2010 Royal Meteorological Society, in response to the release of the Fourth Assessment Report, referred to the IPCC as "The world's best climate scientists".6/25/2012 Stratigraphy Commission of the Geological Society of London. "The most authoritative assessment of climate change in the near future is provided by the Inter-Governmental Panel for Climate Change". 2/23/2010 Nevertheless, according to frog boy, “The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is the primary working group that is behind the environmental socialist agenda.” I’m quite certain none of these scientists are promoting a “socialist” agenda. You guys are seriously loony…Friday, jon &amp; wilkes were telling us that “gun legislation” was “promoting a socialist agenda”. Today the amphibian is telling us that “climate change” is “promoting a socialist agenda”. I think I’m beginning to see a pattern here. Unfortunately, the pattern is not science…could it be male baldness?</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1365968409720</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 15:40:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>13</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365985683873-5</Id><Topic><Title>Oh no say it isn't so!</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1365866656934</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-13 11:24:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Tomorrow the global warming crowd will tell us of the dangers of dihydrogen monoxide as the earth continues to be cooler than it was 600 years ago.</Msg><Username>paula28f</Username><Timestamp>1365985683873</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 20:28:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365988983533-6</Id><Topic><Title>Now 1 in 6 Americans under Obama's failed leadership is living in poverty.

Most folks have no idea of the danger of dihydrogen monoxide. It kills hundreds in the United States every year. It is one of the more corrosive substances that exists and causes billions of dollar of damage and is so common that most insurance companies will not cover the damage is causes. I wouldn't worry too much about urination since it doesn't compare to the amount of it contained in sea water. Think about poor Al Gore. A couple of years ago he bought a nice beach house. I wonder if the rising ocean will get him before the corrosion makes his new digs look like about 100 billion termites with chain saws got to it. Yes, in my heart I knew he was right. I was told if I voted for him we would be at war. Well, I did vote for him and we were at war. That is the only time I remember the libs being right.</Msg><Username>paula28f</Username><Timestamp>1365993389417</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 22:36:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365994346141-9</Id><Topic><Title>Oh no say it isn't so!</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1365866656934</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-13 11:24:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The report says global warming didn't cause the drought.
