Those on the left that have money will soon find that they have been fooled into thinking they will make some social gains through their support of a more and more socialist leaning administration and they will be sorely rewarded for that support. They will be the last to learn this hard lesson, but they will learn...hopefully before it is too late for all of us.” – windandalejon stuck in loop mode crying “Socialists – Have Not’s” and more of the same tired Tea Party refrain that led to their embarrassing recent debacle of total rejection by the American electorate. Winny, when are you going to figure it out? You didn’t lose to the “have not’s” and those other imaginary enemies that you extremists created to protect the one percent…you got your clocks cleaned by middle-class America. You know that, but nevertheless you continue with your nonsensical, meaningless slogans reminiscent of McCarthyism tinged with racism. Wake up and join mankind. Or better yet, just go back to sleep. You and your views are old and tired and becoming increasingly more irrelevant. “they have been fooled…but they will learn.” – Yes, and apparently they are learning as we speak. “GOP Starting to Rebel Against No-Tax-Hikes Pledge” - By DAVID KERLEY | ABC OTUS News “…some Republican members of Congress said Sunday they are ready to break a long standing pledge not to raise taxes. ‘The only pledge we should be making to each other is to avoid becoming Greece. And Republicans should put revenue on the table,’ South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said… Graham's comments followed those by another Republican senator, Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, who said last week he'll no longer abide by the pledge. ‘I care more about my country than I do about a 20-year-old pledge,’ he said in a local interview. He got support today from House member Peter King, another Republican from New York. ‘I agree entirely with Saxby Chambliss -- a pledge he signed 20 years ago, 18 years ago is for that Congress,"’ King said on NBC's Meet the Press. He added, ‘The world is changed and the economic situation is different’.” Did you hear that, winny? “The world is a changed place.” Why are you still living in an imaginary world? Maybe it’s time for you and Grover Norquist to move elsewhere…perhaps rent a condo in The Caymans from Mitt… buy a yacht, strap your dog to the roof and go fishing for awhile. Do a little off-shore creative-investment banking, sock away some dough, buy some vowels for jon and a new car for rob. It’ll be fun…certainly more so than constantly embarrassing yourself here every day.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1353936345294</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-26 08:25:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>14</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353944047197-2</Id><Topic><Title>Has aggressive 'Fix The Debt' campaign started yet?</Title><Username>lavendersin</Username><Timestamp>1353427660081</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 11:07:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Which "racist" made such a claim?" Lavendar. He's upset because he thinks his food stamps might get cut. He blames minorities for this, and probably every failure he's had in life. In between racist rants, that's the bread and butter issue he's concerned with--his food stamp allotment. "They don't discriminate." They? Who is this they going after people? Grandma's? Working people? If your racist mind thinks "black" equates to "criminal", then God help you. It may help you to ask yourself if you think criminals of any race discriminate? There are white people who have robbed their own mothers, drowned their own children, and shot up their own classrooms. When I was growing up, every dealer in my neighborhood was white, and there was no lack of drugs. Do you know why criminals don't discriminate? Because their defining characteristic is that they are criminals, not that they belong to any particular demographic group. Judge people by the content of their character and you'll do alright in this world.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1353944047197</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-26 10:34:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353944183386-3</Id><Topic><Title>Warren Buffet: cap gain 30%, 50% tax on the rich</Title><Username>peppeek</Username><Timestamp>1353097971771</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-16 15:32:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What Warren knows is that a small tax cut expiration, or coined "tax increase", isn't changing anything for him.

So he is seemingly altruistic , but actually, as always, a smart businessman that knows the middle class customer is the building block of the American economy. With a little altruism thrown in.

Most of the changes this administration and those supported by the likes of Nancy, Harry and other radical leftist are not going to be good for this country. There is value in working for the things you want out of life. There is value in supporting overall advances and changes that are positive changes for this nation as a whole, not for select narrow-minded special interest groups. When masses of voters are doing so because of the benefits they receive or the single interest causes they support and not the overall well being and future of the nation, we all suffer. The phony war on women, free contraceptives, abortion, student loans, etc. that drove people to vote only to support their single cause are not interested in the welfare of the nation. Usually, the loudest in calling for compromise, the progressives, intend that those supporting limited government should do the compromising, not them. Our founders correctly established the true principle that the individual is the sovereign entity it is the function of government to protect. Over time, the progressives (read socialist) are deliberately, li9t by little, through compromise, transforming that principle to a point where the individual will be a mere agent of the state. There is a time and place for legitimate compromise. There is also a time and place to stand your ground and promote the true principle.</Msg><Username>winholder</Username><Timestamp>1353944901132</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-26 10:48:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353945796770-5</Id><Title>yet another bad day for T</Title><Msg>at least it's consistent</Msg><Username>mikerego19</Username><Timestamp>1353945796770</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-26 11:03:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353947271535-6</Id><Topic><Title>Has aggressive 'Fix The Debt' campaign started yet?</Title><Username>lavendersin</Username><Timestamp>1353427660081</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 11:07:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You know winholder, you and Mitt can call things like the Dream Act gifts and bribery.

Interestingly enough, back when Mike Armstrong was CEO, AT&amp;T was overfunded in their ERISA funds (my recollection was that it had +13 Billion overfunded). That overfunding was skimmed off to help purchase two cable companies at a combined cost of over 100 Billion $'s. In very short order those same two companies were sold off for pennies on the dollar, and the retirees took it in the pants. It's nice to see that the current version of AT&amp;T is stepping up to the plate to bring their funding up to snuff.

I said giving insanely wealthy people with large offshore bank accounts even more money would not spur them to create jobs. What will spur people to invest in job creating enterprises is to spur demand for the product of those enterprises. And that means, as it always has, a balance between capital and consumer wealth. "You just seem to be very selective in which rich guys are good guys." I don't think people are particularly bad or particularly good based on wealth or class. That is a problem of Communists, Tea Brains and other idealogues. Whether you poor more deficit dollars down Buffet's or Romney's throat, continually lowering taxes for the wealthy will not create jobs. Buffet and I agree on that. Romney and I don't. "If you think that position is bi-partisan" No, I do not think the imaginary position you assigned to imaginary liberals is bi-partisan. I think it is imaginary. "the meaning of the word compromise" Right now it is $3 in spending cuts for every $1 in revenue. Last summer it was $6 in spending cuts for every $1 in revenue. But that wasn't enough compromise for you. You overplayed your hand. You lose.
