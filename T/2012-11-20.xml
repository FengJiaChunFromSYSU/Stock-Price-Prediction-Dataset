Most of these companies are over staffed as it is, but the Dems think they need more deadweight walking the floors. Cut employees now, everybody. Walmart, Target, and the malls are over run with bodies. Computer hardware makers don't need half the staff they have. T probably has 25% too many folks running around too.</Msg><Username>cmontx</Username><Timestamp>1353415878226</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 07:51:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353416479529-3</Id><Topic><Title>PTL "T", VZ &amp; Twinkies</Title><Username>jon3retired</Username><Timestamp>1353366337815</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 18:05:37 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>As I understand it, they "agreed" because the bankruptcy judge forced them to mediation.</Msg><Username>t.bfine</Username><Timestamp>1353416479529</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 08:01:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353418781804-4</Id><Topic><Title>Next Obama Move</Title><Username>cmontx</Username><Timestamp>1353415878226</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 07:51:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And to think, you work at Mickey D's and no one will listen to you about how to manage Walmart, Target and T.

In 2006 VZ was about $4 a share higher than T, then at the peak in 2008 VZ was $4 a share higher, and finally in the dip of 2009 VZ was about $4 a share higher than T. But in the past 2 years VZ has been pulling away even faster. At the peak of 2012 T hit a high of $38.50 while VZ peaked at $48.75, that a $10 difference. And in todays price they are seperated by $9 per share. This is just my observation, but I hoping that we are going to start seeing a convergence and T is going to pull their head out before CHL takes them both to the cleaners.</Msg><Username>whopperkaraoke</Username><Timestamp>1353424323874</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 10:12:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353425166951-8</Id><Topic><Title>Twinkie Defense</Title><Username>ciscokid_1st</Username><Timestamp>1353156558534</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-17 07:49:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There ya go again, skipping right over the point of the post.

State says they didn't do it, and she works for State. The intelligence guys say that is not what their reports said, and she doesn’t work for them. All the confusion is intentional to give Obama deniability, allow the media to ignore it so it will go away...they hope and if it doesn't, they will lay blame on the Republicans for attack a black woman. It's all a charade to protect Billary and in the same breath the President from having to admit some poor decision making and misjudgments that they could lie their way out of this just prior to the elections. Liberal politics at its best…and worst.</Msg><Username>winholder</Username><Timestamp>1353425500280</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 10:31:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353429817228-10</Id><Topic><Title>Breaking news BO admin denies requests to defend Benghazi compoud during attack</Title><Username>lkglhklkh</Username><Timestamp>1351269709024</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 12:41:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Who cares? You're upset about what? That the president waited a few days before revealing information on a national security issue? "to give Obama deniability" Oh give me a break. You have no clue why they changed "al-Quaeda" to "extremists" in those talking points--which is really what we are fighting over. Were they protecting an informant? Were they not letting the perpetrators know they were on to them? Were they trying to handle a delicate diplomatic situation? Were they just being careful? What Republicans seem to forget is that Al-Quada perpetrated these attacks. Not Susan Rice. Not the President. And not Saddam Hussein. You want to talk about intelligence being politicized? Talk about 2003 and the blood spilled for those lies. What we do know is that under Obama terrorists are dealt with, no matter how much you nattering hacks try to politicize national security.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1353429817228</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 11:43:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353431592445-11</Id><Topic><Title>Lunch experience today</Title><Username>bouch84</Username><Timestamp>1352747876350</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 14:17:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Don't confuse yourself with white Southern Christians, Lavendar.
