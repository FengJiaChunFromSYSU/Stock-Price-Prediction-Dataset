What does Deen's cooking have to do with her left-wing liberal racism ? After all, she did help get another "select" bigot get elected (twice) .. didn't she ?? And her son (??) .. what does his cooking, Italian or otherwise, have to do with any of this ? Perhaps 'your' meatball tongue carries as much weight as a flat tire in motion on the highway .. It appears your attack is more on Southern Cooking vs. Italian Cooking .. and only you can remedy that through your personal choice of what Country you live in ... ya think ??</Msg><Username>echo.2l65</Username><Timestamp>1372603584546</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-30 10:46:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>12</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372605657657-2</Id><Topic><Title>Sorry Beau$39 !!</Title><Username>ossobucco20l2</Username><Timestamp>1372364214379</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-27 16:16:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>WOW ..

You find one person who is a Democrat --whose claim to fame is being a cook--who admitted to making racist comments in the past and suddenly you decide to speak up. Where were you, Froggie, when Ron Paul's connections to neo#$%$'s was revealed? Tea Brain elected officials, political pundits and thought leaders, along with just about every Tea brain poster on this MB, make racist comments all the time, and you defend them. You are what you are and you demonstrate repeatedly. Lowlifes, every one of you.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1372643201525</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-30 21:46:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372650996506-6</Id><Topic><Title>I hate that racist #$%$ Paula Dean, you Phony</Title><Username>lefronczak</Username><Timestamp>1372542804859</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-29 17:53:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>My mother brought her to my attention years ago(she enjoyed watching her i think) and was really surprised at her fame. Not many White women with a southern accent and manner like hers have been allowed to make it on bigoted tv. Maybe she was a useful idiot, helped reassure White southerners that they really aren`t being pushed down and aside for the emerging colored majority in the south. I wonder if Paula is still so liberal and ready to support other races(the democratic party in other words) in their effort to take control of this country and its White majority ? Probably, some people are so brainwashed they can`t see what`s happening right in front of them.</Msg><Username>lavendarsen</Username><Timestamp>1372650996506</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-30 23:56:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
