(WFC) have contributed $20 million toward the cost of the Democratic National Convention, helping fund an event that Democrats initially said wouldn’t accept corporate money, according to two people familiar with the matter. Organizers of this year’s convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, turned to corporations after the city’s host committee struggled to reach its $36.7 million fundraising goal, according to the people, who requested anonymity. Aug. 31 (Bloomberg) -- Charlotte Mayor Anthony Foxx talks about the outlook for the Democratic convention in his city and his call that President Barack Obama will carry North Carolina in the November election. Bloomberg's Lisa Lerer and Sheelah Kolhatkar discuss Mitt Romney's performance at the Republican convention in Tampa, Florida, and fundraising behind the scenes. Bloomberg's Esme E. Deprez talks about the impact of Hurricane Isaac on New Orleans and the rest of Louisiana. Last year, the Charlotte host committee set up a separate entity called New American City Inc., to take corporate cash and to which Bank of America and Wells Fargo contributed, according to the people. The two banks were on a list of corporate donors released Sept. 1 by the host committee that also named AT&amp;T Inc. (T), US Airways Group Inc. (LCC), Duke Energy Corp. (DUK) and the law-and- lobbying firm McGuireWoods LLP. After saying in February 2011 they wouldn’t take corporate money, Democratic Party leaders and convention organizers have grappled with how to cover the estimated $52 million cost of the event, which will culminate Sept. 6 in President Barack Obama’s renomination acceptance speech. Duke Energy Chief Executive Officer Jim Rogers, co-chairman of the host committee, “has said that he secured $10 million to $11 million from local corporations from Charlotte,” said Tom Williams, a spokesman for Duke. “He has been working hard to build on those numbers to bring in money” for the convention, Williams said.

Democrats acknowledged that divergent views. "This election is not simply a choice between two candidates or two political parties, but between two fundamentally different paths for our country and our families," the Democrats said. The document is a sharp contrast from the Republican blueprint that the GOP adopted at its convention last week. The Republican plan would ban abortion and gay marriage, repeal Obama's health care overhaul law. The Republican platform would extend the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003. It also says the party would eliminate taxes on interest, dividends and capital gains altogether for lower- and middle-income taxpayers. It also would work to repeal the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax.</Msg><Username>geoff_holt_2001</Username><Timestamp>1346768118950</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 10:15:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346768832543-14</Id><Title>Google video "Dishonorable Disclosures" video being kept secret for months</Title><Msg>YouTube is not allowing the video poster to add links to prevent spread of alarming truth.

Your'e nuts if you think physicians and patients don't like the single-payer system in Canada or the NHS. They love it. Just like seniors love the single-payer system that is Medicare. Physicians come here for a variety of reasons, but one of the strongest was outlined by minnflier. We pay specialists and insane amount of money. This is done by both public and private payers. This is why we have a shortage of primary care physicians and an oversupply of specialists. There are alot of ways to fix the payment system, but as we've seen doctors are very keen to fight this. And Paul Ryan types are quick to call these types of reforms--which do not lower benefits--cuts.

It's becoming apparent to those few undecideds that you're trying to attract,, that the Republican Party has lost its way to such an extent, that complete fabrication of your position on almost every subject is the only way you think you have any chance of winning this election. Guess what, folks? Starting tonight, this won't be a defenseless, empty chair responding to your pack of lies from last week. Increased taxes? Gimme'a break - the truth sinks your boat, doesn't it? "The Democratic platform calls for extending the middle-class tax cuts for the 98 percent of American families who make less than $250,000 a year, and makes a promise not to raise taxes on them. The platform claims a typical family has saved $3,600 during Obama’s first term. ‘‘Now he’s fighting to stop middle-class families and those aspiring to join the middle class from seeing their taxes go up and to extend key tax relief for working families and those paying for college, while asking the wealthiest and corporations to pay their fair share,’’ the platform says. The Republican platform would extend the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003, pending reform of the tax code. It also says the party would try to eliminate taxes on interest, dividends and capital gains altogether for lower- and middle-income taxpayers. It also would work to repeal the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax."</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1346786848827</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 15:27:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346789076164-43</Id><Title>T NEVER finishes strong...</Title><Msg>eom....</Msg><Username>mikerego19</Username><Timestamp>1346789076164</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 16:04:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346789355100-44</Id><Topic><Title>Dems reveal platform backing higher taxes, gay marriage and abortion</Title><Username>geoff_holt_2001</Username><Timestamp>1346768118950</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 10:15:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So every Dem tells the truth....and all Repubs are liars!!!!

Is that what I said? Getting a little testy lately, there, ck. I replied to a post that very obviously deleted the truth about the Democratic plan for taxes - one, I might add, that logically should be acceptable to the 98% of Americans for which it's intended. Because the other two percent don't like it, they resort to lying about it. If you are defending that specific post, you are part of the problem. If you have lies that you believe are intentional deceptions in the Democratic Platform, feel free to air them. As egregious as Paul Ryan's lies were last week, John Burton has no right referring to him as Goebbels, although the reference was to someone successfully repeating untruthful propaganda over and over again.. People should understand, Germany’s actions back then, were not forced upon its people, who were fired up by lies, hatred and intolerance from its leaders looking for scapegoats and power. On the other hand, Hank Williams, Jr., while only an entertainer, just said this: "We've got a M#slim for a president who hates cowboys, hates cowgirls, hates fishing, hates farming, loves gays, and we hate him!" That’s an interesting comparison. You say the deceit is equal on both sides. I disagree, but I don't matter. If your side, the apparent 2%, succeeds in capturing half of the other 98% through lies, you win. I don't see it happening. My bet is Obama gets a big bounce from the convention (bigger than Mitt’s 2 %), and rolls from there. But, the problem is, Citizens United.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1346792403498</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 17:00:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346797054410-49</Id><Topic><Title>Is security giving up</Title><Username>onebellplaza</Username><Timestamp>1346772564785</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 11:29:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Here it is, Our AAA+ CEO thinks it looks good for him to brag that he increased the dividends every year on his watch ........on 10 billion shares to keep the record going .

In 2008, the party platform read: “We need a government that stands up for the hopes, values, and interests of working people, and gives everyone willing to work hard the chance to make the most of their God-given potential. But that plank has been rewritten to remove the phrase "God-given." "We gather to reclaim the basic bargain that built the largest middle class and the most prosperous nation on Earth – the simple principle that in America, hard work should pay off, responsibility should be rewarded, and each one of us should be able to go as far as our talent and drive take us,” the platform now reads. David Brody said he has contacted the DNC to find out why God's name was removed from the platform. "When you have planks in your platform that support abortion rights and gay marriage then it's no wonder that God's name would be dropped as well," "The collective voice of millions of Democrats across the country have been reduced to 'whatever Obama says,'" "Out of the 40 pages that make up the platform, Obama is cited by name on 38 of them. He is cited over 200 times throughout the document.
