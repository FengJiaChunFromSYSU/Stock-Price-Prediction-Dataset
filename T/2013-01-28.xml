Now then, why not bring the T's stock yield of over 5 percent to the forefront? 2) VZ has some huge problems ahead of it whether we go by periodic payments to VOD or outright buyout of their share. S&amp;P conveniently ignores mentioning this important factor. Working the EBITDA for VZ could take a lifetime with no confidence in the resulting conclusion. 3) VZ is expected to grow earnings by 8 percent compared to 7 for T. 4) Same credit rating but VZ stands on a shaky ground mainly because when they have to cuff up $22.5B to buy VOD's share of assets held and used by the company. In summary, we should ignore the claims made in the reports in totality with respect to VZ. By far, T makes a much better buy.</Msg><Username>convergent_series</Username><Timestamp>1359393587989</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 12:19:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359394660845-17</Id><Topic><Title>If you can find in your heart, please say a little prayer for Shirley Chambers</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1359387588486</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 10:39:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I remember Dale claiming he stocked up on incandescent light bulbs when he thought (incorrectly) that they had been declared illegal. I wonder if he's stocking up on AR-15s now? I doubt his attic full of dusty lightbulbs and assault rifles do give his disturbed mind any degree of peace. He's more likely to shoot himself or someone in his family before he ever uses a gun for defense. With any luck he'll just break a few lightbulbs. The reality is I do not care about his peace of mind, or yours, or any other loon scared of the UN invasion or the white genocide or the Islamo-socialist takeover or whatever it is you people have zeroed in on as the target fro what is really just a fear of change. I doubt any number of AR-15s will provide you, Dale, Lav, Lew and the rest of the tea brain psychos with any degree of peace of mind anyway. If you want to sleep at night without fear stop watching Fox News or take your meds or move to a shack in the woods. Or don't. I really don't care. What I do care about is the very high probability that more than one of you loons will take those AR-15s out of the attic and starting shooting people who do not deserve to be shot. What I do care about is that the bulk of those AR-15s will probably be diverted to criminal gangs or drug cartels, or stolen. What I care about is that some old fool "defending his property" is more likely to send a few rounds into the neighbor's five year old than his target. THAT is what shatters my peace of mind and the peace of mind of millions of Americans. And it will shatter many lives as well.

The difference between an AR15 and my Remington 740 I use for hunting is looks. Their functionality is the same. If they made it, I could put a collapsible stock, 30 round clip, compensator, etc on my 740, but it's still a Remington 740 deer rifle! Only the military owns a fully automatic assault weapon! I'm hoping your liberal pea brain can understand this. but I'm doubtful! So you're question should be "why does anyone need to own an AR15?" There are lots of reasons. 1. They are used in competition shooting. A sport. 2. They are used for nuisance animal control. Especially Texas for pigs, Az for Coyotes, etc. 3. They are used for hunting. The .223 round is a great round for small deer, pigs, javalina,, etc. The AR15 is a great choice to use for hunting, it's fast, accurate, can be modified for any envirionment. 4. Because the 2nd Amendment guarantees my right to. I don't see where it excludes these scary looking guns! These are all of the top of my head as quickly as I can think.

Just more political theater.</Msg><Username>winholder</Username><Timestamp>1359413614000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 17:53:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359414024371-29</Id><Topic><Title>If you can find in your heart, please say a little prayer for Shirley Chambers</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1359387588486</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 10:39:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obviously you know nothing about hunting. In more populated areas, like Ohio and other areas, shotguns are to reduce the distance the bullets will travel to stop unintentional injuries. In mountainous areas where there is less flat land and the distances for the shots are longer range, different weapons and ammo are required. I lived and hunted for years in CO and UT and most of the shots deer hunting were not 70 to 100 yard shots, most were 200 sometimes 300 yards, something a shotgun will not accomplish.</Msg><Username>winholder</Username><Timestamp>1359414024371</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 18:00:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359414070945-30</Id><Topic><Title>Where do all the regular crackpots go...</Title><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1358475058533</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 21:10:58 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Don't know; where do you go?</Msg><Username>winholder</Username><Timestamp>1359414070945</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 18:01:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359421173311-31</Id><Topic><Title>Why does ANYONE need an #$%$ault weapon</Title><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1359409509274</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 16:45:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>NO one needs to justify why they need any type of gun - to you or anyone else. It is their RIGHT to own it. Those who try to make U.S. citizens justify why they own a gun are trying to take away those citizens` RIGHT to own a gun. The recent push for more gun control is a racist desire to disarm law abiding Whites, imo, just like immigration reform is an anti-White racist desire to eliminate the White majority and its culture. We have really really been screwed and Whites are waking up to that fact. Those who hate the White majority know that and fear that White majority, that is why they want to disarm us. So they can eliminate us easily and withour fear of us, with the final objective of genocide ,just like the genocide which has been occurring to the tiny White minority in South Africa since Black rule began.</Msg><Username>lavendarsen</Username><Timestamp>1359421173311</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 19:59:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359423608733-32</Id><Title>How sad what Florida has become</Title><Msg>Something seems really wrong in Florida. Much of the state looks half dead. The palm trees look half dead, lawns and areas where grass should grow are half dirt, half grass. Like you might expect in a desert climate. The skies are never bright blue, rather a dim whitish blue. Many business areas are trashy, with big weeds everywhere and either poorly mown or unmown grass. FOR LEASE signs are in all business strips in Florida. Surprisingly lately I have even noticed a lot of trash and litter along the highways and freeways. There are still a few nice areas , the beach side communities - where the wealthy live and water their lawns and plants of course, also a few areas that for some reason are still hanging on, and a few other areas that appeal to snow birds. But overall Florida is becoming just like the industrialized rust belts of the north. Dirty trashy and decaying. Almost everyone has a shiny newer affluent looking car though. How did a worldwide tourist destinatin get this way? Were those in power trying to copy third world tourist destinations maybe? If so, they suceeded. What a shame. It was such a paradise years ago. Maybe it is the unrelenting almost nonstop chemical spraying of the skies in Florida. Many claim we are being bombarded with aluminum, barium and other harmful heavy metals and even viruses. Who is spraying us like bugs, and Why? The military no doubt has to be involved. Illegal and legal third world immigrants probably love it here though.. It is THEIR state now. They all work and hold jobs.Poor White citizens are the ones you see standing at the corners with signs asking for help or work, begging those third world immigrants for mercy.</Msg><Username>lavendarsen</Username><Timestamp>1359423608733</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 20:40:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359433775667-33</Id><Title>Well folks it's official, the second amendment has been deemed obsolete</Title><Msg>The head of the Nation of Islam Louis Farrakhan has announced that the second amendment is obsolete. His logic includes the following points: o “See, the right to bear arms was given at a time when there was no regulated militia to protect America,” o "He said, ignoring the actual wording of the Second Amendment, which speaks of a “well-regulated militia.” o “now you have police well-armed, you have state troopers well-armed, you have the National Guard and you have federal troops.” I hope Dianne Feinstein got the memo, it would make her job so much easier.
