I also pray for the president and all government officials. I was just wondering, could it be possible that some of the constituents of those in congress, who received the president's wrath, asked their senator to vote the way he or she voted? Or was the president saying that the senators should ignore their constituents and vote the way he (the president) wants them to vote? Just wondering. "In your heart you know he is right."

Since 90% of Americans support the provisions in the bill that is doubtful. It was simply a technical change to existing law, one that acknowledged the internet exists. This should have been done years ago without challenge and as Obama said, most Americans already expect their government is preventing felons and the insane from purchasing weapons. The NRA works (like most special interest groups) by funding primary challenges to people who vote against their wishes. The YouTube video they put out about Cantor being identical to Obama was a shot across the bow for him. They were not threatening to support the Democratic candidate, but to fund a primary challenger. That challenger might not win, but would at least make life difficult for Cantor. He would have to expend funds and political capital and move to the right--all things which could hurt him in the general election. These tactics are less effective in the Senate, but the NRA began flexing its muscles right after the Newton shooting--starting with the Cantor video. They immediately indicated they would go after anyone who even bent a little on gun legislation--including a powerful and close ally to the NRA. Obama is right. We have to target the NRA.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1366293232647</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 09:53:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366293333901-4</Id><Topic><Title>WHAT .. a Democratic Senate ??</Title><Username>zonbac98</Username><Timestamp>1366239447721</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-17 18:57:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No, Obama has the right of it.

Keep in mind the polls also show about 11% who want even LESS regulation of guns than what we currently have…that would be people like you, Frogg. So, you and the NRA have won this round, which is only round one. Unlike you folks who deny everything when you don’t get your way, or insist the election was a fraud or the voters were stupid, I will acknowledge what happened yesterday, as unfathomable as it was. Sadly, it speaks volumes about how America is viewed by many around the world as an extremely violent society of discordant and frightened individuals, not unlike the wild-west of old. I, for one, am ashamed of what happened yesterday and incredulous that anyone would feel reason to celebrate the non-action of our elected leaders. What follows is a story from December, about how our close friends, The Australians, dealt with gun control legislation, even when led by a Prime Minister who was staunchly conservative. And their actions were far more restrictive than the watered down proposal that was defeated yesterday. Again, keep in mind, few fights are won or lost in round one. Australians Urge U.S. To Look At Their Gun Laws by Stuart Cohen As the U.S. wages a debate on its gun laws, some Australians are urging Americans to consider their experience. For Australia, the turning point came on April 28, 1996, when a lone gunman opened fire with a semi-automatic rifle in Port Arthur, a popular tourist destination in the state of Tasmania. Thirty-five people died and another 23 were wounded in the killing spree that became known as the Port Arthur massacre, Australia's worst mass shooting.

Often this is the only thing that saves this country from these idiots. They think passing laws and regulations are what they are there for, regardless of consideration if the laws or regulations are wise or often even necessary...that is their jobs to pass laws; it doesn't matter if they are effective or needed. Many times these laws and regulations are passed to satisfy a campaign contributor or and potential new contributor. When that happens they should individually and collectively hang their head is shame, but instead they will go on TV to tout their new success and their unwavering commitment to this country and their voters. It is then that we should all gag and throw many of them out of their office.

Strict Rules The new laws prohibited all automatic and semi-automatic weapons, and imposed strict licensing rules. Even paintball guns need a permit. There are also background checks and lengthy waiting periods for all purchases. Tim Fischer was deputy prime minister at the time and head of the country's conservative National Party. He was given the task of selling the plan to his rural, pro-gun constituents. ‘There was no doubt it was going to be a very rough road to hoe,’ he said. ‘But, at the end of the day, I could see that Australia could drain the suburbs of semi-automatics and automatics.’ Fischer says he sees no contradiction with being both conservative and in favor of strict gun ownership laws. ‘We too value freedom. But that's not the freedom to own machine guns in the main streets of the U.S. of A.,’ he says. ‘The facts are you are 15 times more likely to be shot dead per capita in the U.S.A. than here in Australia.’ Roland Browne of Gun Control Australia says it's an example the U.S. can follow. ‘It doesn't really matter to what extent you might recognize or even support rights to own firearms,’ he says. ‘Our governments have the pre-eminent responsibility of ensuring public safety.’ Gun violence hasn't been completely eliminated in Australia. But gun-control advocates are quick to point out that there hasn't been a single mass shooting in the 16 years since the laws came into effect.”</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1366300612473</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 11:56:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>13</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366300633274-31</Id><Topic><Title>WHAT .. a Democratic Senate ??</Title><Username>zonbac98</Username><Timestamp>1366239447721</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-17 18:57:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Quote and cite or shut up.</Msg><Username>zonbac89</Username><Timestamp>1366300633274</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 11:57:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366301283591-32</Id><Topic><Title>WHAT .. a Democratic Senate ??</Title><Username>zonbac98</Username><Timestamp>1366239447721</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-17 18:57:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well, look who finally crawled out from behind the couch (!!)
