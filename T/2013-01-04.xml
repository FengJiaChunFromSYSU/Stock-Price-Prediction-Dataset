Because it is bad statistics and bad writing. Remember our discussion of precision? They threw out a bunch of buzzwords--welfare, government worker, pensioner, taker, maker--without defining them or explaining how they are related to state finances. A bunch of undefined buzzwords together to get an emotional reaction is a fluff piece. Any decent news organization should be ashamed to print such a piece. I generally have respect for Forbes but their online content tends to be poor. "when someone on the left tells a falsehood, they are given a pass with words like hyperbole" By whom are they given a pass? Not by me. I recently called echo to task for posting some BS from moveon.org. If winholder made a mistake let him admit it. The reality is, though, I spend most of my time here correcting repeated and gross falsehoods posted by conservatives. Most of these take about thirty seconds of research to correct. The people who do this either know the truth and are lying or remain intentionally ignorant of the truth to permit them to spread falsehoods. I see little point in distinguishing between the two. "I am so glad that you have never been guilty of such behavior." Never is a strong term. What I don't do is revel in it. "I have never made a threat to move to China or Russia." I may be confusing you with someone else. My mistake.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1357309818605</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 09:30:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357311244339-6</Id><Topic><Title>Grover's cliff...</Title><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1356880373444</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-30 10:12:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>They passed budgets when Democrats controlled both houses. Republicans have blocked every budget since they took control of the House. "But lets move forward, this is Obama's Presidency, he's been in charge for four years, no more blaming Bush." That would be nice. The first two years we were moving forward and Obama was clearly accountable for policy outcomes. GDP and job growth was strong. Since then, a minority of House Republicans have prevented this. They should be and are being held accountable for causing repeated fiscal crises and economic uncertainty.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1357311244339</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 09:54:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357315022309-7</Id><Title>AT&amp;T Dividend &amp; Stock Price</Title><Msg>Looking back over the past year the chart shows a drop in price after each dividend payment that exceeds the 44 cents of the dividend.

The Democrats did not refuse to reduce government spending. Obama and Senate Democrats made proposals that included quite a bit of spending reductions. This is true for the fiscal cliff negotiations, but also for the debt ceiling debates. Remember, Democrats agreed to the spending cuts in sequestration, and implicitly agreed to any spending cuts that would have come from the Supercommittee. Tea Brain Republicans continue to refuse to accept any tax hikes on the wealthy. They were, however, quite willing to increase the payroll tax on workers.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1357319003083</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 12:03:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357325713846-14</Id><Title>Here is your trivia lesson for the day.</Title><Msg>Here is your trivia lesson for the day.

At one point Senate Republicans forced an up or down vote on Obama's budget verbatim. Does that mean they supported Obama's budget 100% as written?
