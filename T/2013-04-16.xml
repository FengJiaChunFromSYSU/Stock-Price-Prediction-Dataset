I wonder why they didn't have the fore-sight that the marathon is always a perfect "soft target" for mass casualties !! Oh, they're Libs (I forgot). What ever happened to due-dilligence ? Is it not required on their watch ? Do they know, or have they forgotten about 9/11 .. have they learned NOTHING from the past !!.” Well, jon, I believe that unlike you, who has obviously learned nothing from the past, (particularly your geography class in 4th grade), they both learned that the Boston Marathon is usually held in the state of Massachusetts, some two hundred plus miles north of NYC, and out of the jurisdiction of the Mayor of NYC and the Governor of NY. And with another brazen display of your total ignorance, you really need to retire ALL of your aliases, put down the bottle and refrain from repeatedly making a complete buffoon out of yourself. I do believe you’re in a state of flux, son. You’re morphing from simply a happy go lucky imbecile into a raving lunatic, intent on, and well on your way to, embarrassing yourself into extinction.

The only thing worse than you being so stupid, is that you're an even bigger coward, too afraid to man up when you mess up. I guess it was just another April Fool’s day joke, right? You seem to have a reoccurring problem with dates. But, I can see how you could confuse the two…let’s see, The Boston Marathon, the first big one of the season in the U.S., is always run on Patriots Day, and they call it The Boston Marathon because it’s held in Boston (of all places.) “I was moblie last night when I realize it was Boston &amp;.called her back, she was still thinking NY.” (Boy, I bet she was really happy when you straightened her out…what a hero.) So between 3:50 p.m. yesterday, and sometime last night, you had no idea where this tragedy had happened because…why, exactly? What, are you institutionalized with no access to news? Did your parents have you locked in the potato cellar in the basement? How is it that you’ve apparently found the only female friend in the world who is as stupid as you are? And where was she…in a sensory deprivation tank at the spa for 6 hours? Good god, man, I’d bet even your dog knows the Boston Marathon is in Boston. Well, don’t worry too much about it. Just switch aliases and try to blame me or ricky. Truthfully, we can overlook your consistent lack of attention to detail. As I said, it’s easy to get the two confused. The Boston Marathon, held on April 15th this year, and the forthcoming New York Marathon which is just around the corner on… on…on…oh, my, jon, that’s not until November 3rd. You really are goofy. Now, a quick quiz. Next week there will be another large marathon. It’s called The London Marathon. For two free tickets to the Fluvanna County Gun Show, a Tea Party bumper sticker reading, “You’re never too stupid to join the Party’, a Beauregard the Wonder Dog flea collar for your puppy and a hat worn by Doris Ziffel…tell us…where is The London Marathon held? (One clue because of your single digit IQ…it’s NOT Ontario.)</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1366131169084</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 12:52:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366134959857-19</Id><Topic><Title>Gov.

It was 1971 and I made the mistake of giving an honest answer to a franchisee of my employer (Sir George's Smorgasbord). He had been waiting over a year after paying his $25,000 franchise fee and asked me when he would likely see some action on his franchise. He was not the only one waiting and, from my vantage point, I knew that the company was using the franchise fees for operating capital. I told him that it was doubtful that he would ever see any action. (he didn't) I was fired. I was 43 and obviously didn't get good recommendations from my previous employer. I had tinkered with mechanical work ever since I was 7 and built my first bike with parts from a trash bin at a bicycle shop two blocks from my house. While I was looking for another job a friend from church asked me if I could fix his VW Square-back. I did and he was so pleased with the work and the low price he sent a couple of his friends. Dido with those two. Within a few weeks I had VW's parked in front of my house, some without engines while I was rebuilding them. I lived in an upscale area in Yorba Linda, CA. and, although none of my neighbors had complained, I didn't think it was going to be long before they did. So I rented a small shop a couple miles away and I hired a young man to help me. That lasted a little over a year and I moved to a larger shop and hired two more mechanics. A couple years latter I rented the adjacent shop and I was doing very little mechanical work myself. I spent my time setting up a machine shop to do work in house that we had been sending out. In 1982 I moved to an 8,000 SF shop in Placentia and soon had 8 mechanics all working on air cooled VW's. We were rebuilding and installing 3 engines a day. Five years later the VW craze was coming to an end and we were branching out into all other cars. I didn't like it so I sold the business and retired.</Msg><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1366137426343</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 14:37:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366138576346-22</Id><Topic><Title>Much needed tax break</Title><Username>zonbac89</Username><Timestamp>1366074786962</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 21:13:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Now that's voluminous. . .</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1366138576346</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 14:56:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366139578610-23</Id><Topic><Title>Much needed tax break</Title><Username>zonbac89</Username><Timestamp>1366074786962</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 21:13:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>...really.

Got your response to my question. Next time, please use paragraphs to make it easier to read. Anyway, you really didn't clarify how you got to be a CPA and financial adviser after the mechanic gig. The way you went from a home-based VW mechanic in your garage to opening a shop in Placentia was very interesting. I bet your Y.L. neighbors loved seeing you tinkering away with all the cars you worked on every day. Your street must have looked like a used car lot. Knowing a little about the VW 300 series with electronic fuel injection, you had to be damn good at repair. They weren't easy to service. It was nostalgic to see you mention Sir George's Smorgasboard. Hadn't seen that name in quite a while. I think there was one in the Pasadena area that I went to a time or two. I preferred Perry Boys Smorgy on Colorado Blvd. though. I'm sure I'm not the only one to be interested in how you got into tax prep and learning your option trading thing, so please elaborate on that if you don't mind. I also have another question or two. How come you moved from O.C.

This is the study Paul Ryan cites in his budget to justify his cuts, as well as being used to justify austerity programs worldwide. Do a search for "Researchers Finally Replicated Reinhart-Rogoff, and There Are Serious Problems." ". . .all I can hope is that future historians note that one of the core empirical points providing the intellectual foundation for the global move to austerity in the early 2010s was based on someone accidentally not updating a row formula in Excel." --Mike Konczal</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1366144425287</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 16:33:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366145165679-34</Id><Title>A little consolidation...</Title><Msg>..setting up the next nice run.</Msg><Username>mikerego19</Username><Timestamp>1366145165679</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 16:46:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366157228775-35</Id><Topic><Title>June 41 calls are selling for 14 cents</Title><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1366140217074</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 15:23:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Who's the astute investor with two names Danny?

Nearby?…OMG, should I care enough to see where this is happening…Oh, I’m in such a state of flux!! (Or I’m welding) Was that an arm that sailed by my window? I don’t live anywhere near New York of Boston, but why in the world did I turn off the TV???? True, I was watching Nicleodeon very near the comedic denouement…but…suddenly denouments (bad plural – self sic myself for laziness) are no longer comedic. The phrase has come to mean that one can "insist so passionately about something not being true that people suspect the opposite of what one is saying” Jon, you once again, unintentionally clearly define, wacked (not whacked). Just knockin’ round the zoo…bars on all the windows…</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1366158009134</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 20:20:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366164313216-37</Id><Topic><Title>Are Ricky and Echo really front names for an organization?</Title><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1366125975927</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 11:26:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Col. put me in touch with a lady that had been thrown in jail during WW2 for "sedition" by FDR. She and some others spent most of WW2 in prison without a hearing. After the war a judge let them all go and stated that it wasa the worst miscarriage of justice he'd ever seen. Thjis Col. had also visited a so called "extermination Camp where some escaped U. S. prisoners had been taken. As senior officer in his own camp he was accorded the privilege. He later read articles about this camp that he said were totally false. His name was Thomas Drake. of San Diego, CA.</Msg><Username>lewcor</Username><Timestamp>1366164313216</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 22:05:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
