It is still very easy to get an AR-15. These have become the weapon of choice for every petty criminal or nutcase out there. They are cheap, easy to use, easy to get and they kill alot of people in a short period of time. You are trying to make the case that a country with a citizenry armed to the teeth is safer and more free than one that is not saturated with arms. That argument simply does not hold up to reason or the evidence. If you want to make the case that a certain number of innocent people dying each year is a price worth paying to have access to guns, that is one thing. But America is not safer or freer with easy access to assault rifles. Just look at Mexico. With the weaponry available to our own drug gangs, we should be glad the worst thing we've had to deal with is the occasional lunatic. "I believe almost 20% of all high schools already have some type of armed officer, so expanding the program to include all schools is not a reach." Our elementary schools should not require armed guards. A society in which we require armed guards in our schools is the exact society we are trying to prevent. You should be clear on this. Armed schools are not a solution. Every school with an armed guard represents a failure. You seriously have to question the sanity of people who are willing to pay billions to put guns in schools but not teachers. This is what "conservatism" has been reduced to.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1356553652070</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-26 15:27:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356554355918-8</Id><Topic><Title>Wayne La Pierre For President</Title><Username>robfisk</Username><Timestamp>1356111777788</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-21 12:42:57 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Martin was a teenage kid.

Because wealthy people in a capitalist country can afford expensive private schools the capitalists are communists? You finally talk about equality of opportunity in our schools, and it's the opportunity to bring a gun. But alas, the capitalists you describe, buying privilege for their children, are acting like capitalists, not communists. George Orwell was a Democratic Socialist. He was one of a small but important number of Socialists who did not let ideology blind them to the reality of totalitarian Communism. He was a brutally honest critic of power, and a vehement advocate for causes he supported, but was ultimately a moderate. He is one of my political heroes and in my own writing and actions I hope to emulate him. If you think he'd agree with the likes of you on anything, think again. "No question now what had happened to the faces of the pigs. The creatures outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again; but already it was impossible to say which was which." George Orwell, Animal Farm In other words, if you think Obama is a socialist, then by sending his children to an expensive private school he is a socialist acting like a capitalist, not a socialist acting like a socialist.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1356573674054</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-26 21:01:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356574162948-19</Id><Topic><Title>Jan 2014, 30 Million Uninsured Clog Up Our System</Title><Username>robfisk</Username><Timestamp>1356485610283</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-25 20:33:30 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Just one year away, till the World's number one health care system is no more.</Msg><Username>robfisk</Username><Timestamp>1356574162948</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-26 21:09:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356577227990-20</Id><Title>Ricky</Title><Msg>You say so often just pay for your own stuff....Think for a moment ....every thing the government gives to people is what they have taken away from other people..so your point is moot !!!!</Msg><Username>ltcolhen</Username><Timestamp>1356577227990</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-26 22:00:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356577623890-21</Id><Topic><Title>Sidwell Friends School sounds like a very safe place for children</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1356558043024</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-26 16:40:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Dear Ricky, I was attempting to point out the intellecual dishonesty of those on the left (Mr. Gregory) who spent 30 minutes on his TV show (Meet The Press) attempting to discredit conservatives for having the temerity to desire the same level of security enjoyed by Mr. Gregory's children and the children of our "dear leader".

That is not what is happening. Much of what the government gives people is financed by debt. Much of the money the government spends is spent on interest on that debt. My goal is that whatever the government spends is financed by taxes, not debt. I think that is the best way to moderate spending. This is in contrast to "Starve the Beast" philosophy of Norquist, which encourages deficit spending in hopes of bankrupting the government.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1356580065573</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-26 22:47:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356580873285-23</Id><Topic><Title>ricky</Title><Username>t.bfine</Username><Timestamp>1356292032094</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 14:47:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A public utility is any private corporation granted a geographic monopoly (or something like it) by the government. It is a response to a particular set of economic circumstances--it has nothing to do with basic services or "essentials". It is simply inefficient to have multiple competing sewer systems, railroad systems, road systems, transmission line systems, telephone line systems, aviation systems, that do not connect to each other. This is why the government does these things. Sometimes it does it itself (roads) and sometimes it grants geographic monopolies to private companies (power companies) and sometimes it grants geographic monopolies and cooperative arrangements for managing and sharing infrastructure and costs while competing over that infrastructure (telephone lines). Generally for phones, the legacy wired lines are the "public utilities". But imagine if your wireless AT&amp;T phone could not communicate with Verizon phones, or if Verizon tried to muscle out T-mobile by blocking calls. It is the government that makes sure that doesn't happen and that we have competition from upstarts like T-mobile to push the larger carriers. It is doubtful that wireless communication would have advanced as far as it has without government regulating competition over the public airwaves. I hope you guys have your money with managers.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1356580873285</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-26 23:01:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
