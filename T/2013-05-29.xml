It says so in the preamble to the constitution: "...for our progeny...Whites have allowed themselves to be brainwashed by the anti-Christians in public indoctrination centers (aka, public schools)…Do not hesitate to home educate!” – taquinas65, an apparent home-schooled offspring of lew and lavender. Actually, the Preamble says no such thing…it does say “Posterity” not “progeny” (which, granted, means essentially the same thing = descendants). And it also has no mention whatsoever of “Europeans”, but rather “We the People of the United States”, which has, indeed, been legally interpreted to mean citizens. Sadly, you seem to neglect the fact that many citizens of our country today are immigrants from counties other than Europe, and many also are of religions other than Christianity or inclined to secular humanistic leanings. You demonstrate very well why home schooling by an untrained, often under-educated, implacably dogmatic parent(s), often leads to children with few socialization skills, and an ongoing bias, bigotry and intolerance in matters of religion, politics and race. Home schooling by a parent trained in education, with unlimited resources for curriculum/software needs, the luxury of not having to work for a living and an ability to provide regular access to other youth and the outside world is one thing…home schooling by ignorant, fundamentalists wanting to pass on their fears and intolerance is quite another. Taking it to the next level, if untrained and unqualified parents are encouraged to provide their children’s education, why not then, when the child has a brain seizure, encourage them to perform Home Brain Surgery? Same principle…same outcome. I think we’re on to something…Home Dentistry. Home Church. Home Psychiatry. Home Counseling. Home College. Home Graduate School. Home Medical School so they can perform future brain surgeries. Home Work. Home Philosophy. Home Careers. Home Investing. Home Marriage. Home Procreation. Just lock ‘em in the basement for life to keep them from those nefarious “indoctrination centers.” It must be horrible to be perpetually in fear of mankind and the world. You folks shouldn’t reproduce in the first place, let alone try to raise or educate vulnerable children.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1369831737747</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 08:48:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369832138635-7</Id><Title>Chinese to out **CPOW** MONSTER$$$$$$$$$</Title><Msg>HUGE!!!!!!!</Msg><Username>ddavis942</Username><Timestamp>1369832138635</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 08:55:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369832370381-8</Id><Topic><Title>Angry protests in England and riots in Sweden</Title><Username>lavendarsen</Username><Timestamp>1369733717231</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 05:35:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You are a remnant of a horrible chapter in human history.

Even while programs for children and working families are being cut, combined lifetime benefits for couples turning 65 rise by an average of about $20,000 every year, so that couples in their mid-40s today are scheduled to get about $1.4 million in lifetime benefits, of which $700,000 is in Social Security. Social Security has morphed into a middle-age retirement system. Typical couples are receiving close to three decades of benefits. Smaller and smaller shares of Social Security benefits are being devoted to people in their last years of life. If people were to retire for the same number of years as they did when benefits were first paid in 1940, a person would on average retire at age 76 today rather than 64. Soon close to a third of adults will be on Social Security, retiring on average for a third of their adult lives. While Social Security did a good job reducing poverty in its early years, it has made only modest progress recently, despite spending hundreds of billions of dollars more. The program discourages work among older Americans at the very time they have become a highly underused source of human capital in the economy. The failure to provide equal justice permeates the system. It discriminates against single heads of household, spouses with relatively equal earnings, those who bear their children before age 40, long-term workers, and many others. At the same time, private retirement policy leaves most elderly households quite vulnerable."

Reports indicate that the deceased, Boris Feltersnatch, was out fishing on the Sozh river with his girlfriend, renown adult film-star and Pole Princess of Polatsk, Ivana Humalodadix. The two apparently were distracted when, after consuming three bottles of vodka, Ivana, while topless sunbathing, lost her fishing pole overboard. Boris, rather than diving overboard for it, then offered her his own pole, which led to a fourth bottle of vodka, additional diving of another variety and the ensuing beaver attack, resulting in Ivan’s disappearance. When questioned by the KGB, Ivana said they had been watching old Leave it to Beaver re-runs before fishing, and she was merely quoting June Cleaver when she told Boris, “Ward, you need to have a face to face talk with the Beaver.” Charges are pending unless Boris re-emerges.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1369835902562</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 09:58:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369836240770-14</Id><Topic><Title>And this just in...Beaver kills fisherman...</Title><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1369835902562</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 09:58:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>...was that off topic?</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1369836240770</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 10:04:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369836486864-15</Id><Title>THIS FROPS 1/2 PT A DAY SORRY I BOUGHT AT 39 YET !!</Title><Msg>Iam long however right now ineed 2 yrs of divys to break even hahaha $$$$</Msg><Username>beau287</Username><Timestamp>1369836486864</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 10:08:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369836525228-16</Id><Title>Oh, no...Michele Bachman quitting...</Title><Msg>...l"ike the Tea Party movement she came to embody, has quietly faded almost as quickly as it so vehemently burst onto the national scene, will not seek reelection in Minnesota's 6th Congressional District."

I think your assumption that 13 million people will just up and leave because of the remote possibility they may get caught is misguided. First, your talking about 13 million people. The risk of getting caught is quite low. The entire US prison population is just over 2 million--that gives you an idea of what our entire system of law enforcement is designed to handle, nationally. If you wanted to make the chance of getting caught as an illegal immigrant meaningful you would have to greatly increase the cost of enforcement. And not just enforcement. Right now illegal immigration is a civil violation, requiring a low burden of proof. If you give people seven years hard labor, it must be reclassified as a criminal violation with a higher burden of proof. In other words, you're going to have to do more than an administrative hearing. The burden on our courts and our legal aid system would be tremendous. Second, a large chunk of those immigrants have been here for years or decades, some since they were children. They have jobs, homes, families, businesses, churches, community roots. They're not just going to up and leave. Third, those that are recent migrants often work in poor conditions--migrant labor camps that wouldn't be too different from your hard labor camp, but without the guaranteed health/room and board or a chance to apply for citizenship after seven years. The average annual wage in Mexico is $7,000. Plenty of those migrants will see $26,000 a year digs with a chance for citizenship in the end as a worthy proposition. Finally, for people who have lived here for decades, or who spend their life savings and risk their lives to come to this country, I think deportation is a huge punishment/deterrent. If you spend your entire life's savings-possibly with loans or support from family-- to come here and then get deported or caught at the border, that's not just "a bus ride home".</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1369837420969</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 10:23:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369837433093-20</Id><Topic><Title>And this just in...Beaver kills fisherman...</Title><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1369835902562</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 09:58:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Professor Echo ..

First, we don't know how many millions there are here; it is an ‘educated’ guess by our government and you what that means...they might be off by as much as 50%. We don't know who most of them are or where they are living and working, if at all. We have no way to identify them under this Justice department to fine them or tell them to get into a citizenship line. A lot of them don't want to become citizens. That would require them to forsake their Mexican, Guatemalan, Honduran, Panamanian and other citizenships. They are here illegally and a goodly number of them are not paying taxes, they don't have a valid driver’s license or auto insurance and their health care is the local emergency room. If they accept the offer, they have to self identify, they will be fined, they will have to get into a line to become a citizen and all the expense that goes with that, that most of them aren't paying today. Large portions of this population won't do it. They will be happy to stay where they are because it is less expensive and if things go badly here, they simply go home until it gets better. They have the better of both worlds. There seems to be no understand of what ‘illegal’ means in this situation.</Msg><Username>pinhighshot</Username><Timestamp>1369856709259</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 15:45:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369856761796-65</Id><Topic><Title>The bright side</Title><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1369840299063</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 11:11:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>$35.97 looks like history - this stock ison life support right now.</Msg><Username>ossobucco20l2</Username><Timestamp>1369856761796</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 15:46:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369857088128-66</Id><Topic><Title>Oh, no...Michele Bachman quitting...</Title><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1369836525228</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 10:08:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>She is not going to run again but that doesn't mean she is quitting.

He can't lead, he can't negotiate and that is the fault of the Republican Party, it is a person shortcoming of our poor misused and abused President. He just isn't strong enough to overcome objections to his agenda. He can't figure out a way short of cheating to bring his brand of 'fairness' to the masses.

I am not saving that white nations are better, you said that, I am just wondering what your justification for those comments might be because you seem to confused about how a nation became productive in the first place.</Msg><Username>pinhighshot</Username><Timestamp>1369857614902</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 16:00:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369858062499-69</Id><Topic><Title>Angry protests in England and riots in Sweden</Title><Username>lavendarsen</Username><Timestamp>1369733717231</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 05:35:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You're posting fabrications again Ricky.

A local worker decided to hold my legal documents in his desk drawer until he was paid a bribe to dig them out. They had been issued in Mexico City, sent to the local staff to pass on to me. He refused and said he couldn't find them until he was paid and they suddenly appeared. We had several chemicals we had used in the plant for years suddenly appear on the ‘contraband’ list. We had to pay an additional $50 per barrel to get then into the country. The forwarding firm we used for years said this was a common practice and we would simply have to pay. If you have never worked there you have no clue, which is painfully obvious and you need to shut up and stop embarrassing yourself. This was common in Mexico in the late 70's and when traveling there in the past two years on vacation, it is still the case.
