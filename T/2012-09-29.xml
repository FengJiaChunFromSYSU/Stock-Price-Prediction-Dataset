And it’s a hell of a lot more than “some”. What on earth were you people thinking? Santorum? Bachman? Perry? Gingrich? Paul? Herman Cain? Christine O’ Donnell? Sara Palin? You picked the wrong Mormon. Jon Huntsman was the only reasonable candidate who had a shot, and you let the extremists dictate. I’d like to attribute it to stupidity, but it would appear to me that Mitt is nothing but a sacrificial lamb being thrown into a no win situation up against a very popular incumbent President. “Not to mention that he's got EXCELLENT business experience” Yeah, just what the average voter is looking for……..“harvest them at a significant profit” Sure. That really resonates with the electorate. You also said that you are confident that you can unite and…topple this ‘Self Proclaimed’ King of the United States !! What is “self-proclaimed” about being duly elected? When will you folks get it? People want someone who actually stands FOR something, not simply running entirely on a platform of “toppling” an incumbent because you don’t like him, for a variety of dubious reasons.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1348922183740</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 08:36:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348922210568-3</Id><Topic><Title>Obama Approval Numbers match 2008</Title><Username>robfisk</Username><Timestamp>1348880505506</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 21:01:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>They already woke up, the Bishop's numbers are in the tank.

Say 10% of gross income. Pick a number. A flat rate tax is as close to a fair rate as you can come. The more you make the more you pay, but we all pay the same percent of income. That defines fair. Fair is a #$%$ word when used by the Dems and this President to describe their proposal. Fair as they use it is just another one of their lies and it seems many are just too dumb to understand it. Call it what it is, but don't tell me it is fair. The practice is right up there with liberals calling themselves progressives. Liberal became so unpopular, they just changed the label. They believe the dummies won't get it! By the way, no deductions. None. Zero. And, carve out a reasonable exception for the truly needy. However, it isn't 47% of America's households. Take most of the IRS folks who are no longer needed for tax administration and put them on something meaningful for taxpayers (now there's a real change), like cleaning up medicaid, medicare and social secutiry fraud that is costing taxpayes a furtune and contributing to the insolvency of the programs. My, how simple can it be?</Msg><Username>t.bfine</Username><Timestamp>1348922662675</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 08:44:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348946699031-5</Id><Topic><Title>Latest pro Kenyan(or whoever he is) ad</Title><Username>lavendersin</Username><Timestamp>1348935505696</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 12:18:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>“Self respecting Whites can not possibly watch that ad…” Right!

So to answer your question, the rich should pay the amount of taxes required to ensure that their level of misery is equal to a level shared by a majority of society, because only then will government be able to ensure equal treatment of all. Remember it is not so much that our rulers love the poor it is more that they really hate the rich.</Msg><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1348962041322</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 19:40:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348962259803-10</Id><Title>Obama keeps secret thousands of Union worker jobs to be lost under his policies</Title><Msg>The Obama administration has doubled down on its plea to defense contractors not to warn employees about possible layoffs due to looming budget cuts -- going so far as to offer to cover legal fees in compensation challenges.

Sending Thirty Thousand Additional Troops to Afghanistan Despite strong opposition from his own party, Vice President Biden and his chief of staff, President Obama ordered thirty thousand more troops to be sent to Afghanistan in December 2009, raising the total number of troops there to more than one hundred thousand, an increase of more than sixty thousand since he took office earlier that year. He accelerated the timetable of the deployment, sending the troops there more quickly than initially anticipated. But the president also set a clear timetable for the beginning of troop withdrawals, a commitment he kept by starting to bring them home from Afghanistan in July 2011. In May 2012, he signed a strategic partnership agreement with Afghan president Hamid Karzai, ensuring that all combat troops would be withdrawn by 2014 and establishing a solid foundation to guide our commitment to Afghanistan for the next decade. 2. Saving GM and Chrysler Though most Americans and nearly all Republicans were against the auto bailout, President Obama recognized that letting Detroit go bankrupt, as Mitt Romney had suggested, would destroy the American automotive industry and wreak tremendous havoc on the entire U.S. economy. Over a million jobs would have been lost, and the federal government would have been stuck with paying a $14.5 billion tab for the two companies' pension plans. Today GM is back as the world's number one auto manufacturer and more profitable than ever, and the auto industry has created 230,000 jobs in three years (the most in a decade). All loans have been repaid to the government. 3. Pushing Health Care Reform During the 2008 campaign, Barack Obama repeatedly pledged to sign a universal health care bill into law by the end of his first term as president. In the face of staunch opposition from Republicans, President Obama realized that if he wanted to deliver on his promise, he would have to push through health care reform immediately, while he had Democratic majorities in both houses of Congress, or risk losing the opportunity, as had so many presidents before him. Fighting against near unanimous opposition from Republicans, unprecedented lobbying by the insurance industry, and pushback from the more liberal wing of his own party, Obama signed the Affordable Care Act just a little over a year after taking office. In summer 2012, the Supreme Court upheld the law. 4. Osama bin Laden Raid Many of his top advisors, including Vice President Biden, Defense Secretary Robert Gates, and Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff James Cartwright, were against the attack. Bush's secretary of defense, Donald Rumsfeld, had called off a similar raid six years earlier. Success was far from guaranteed, and the costs of failure would have been enormous. But President Obama was convinced that the raid was the only option to ensure that the United States could finally remove the threat posed by Osama bin Laden, and he alone made the call to send in SEAL Team Six. 5. The Stimulus Plan Facing the greatest economic crisis in eighty years, Barack Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act less than a month after being sworn into office. The package of tax cuts, aid to the states and investment in infrastructure cut taxes for 95 percent of working Americans saved as many as 3.5 million jobs (according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office), and is credited with preventing another Great Depression. The bill passed the House without a single Republican vote. Since then, the U.S. economy has experienced eleven consecutive quarters of expansion and registered twenty-eight straight months of private-sector job growth, adding 4.4 million new jobs. Character. Strength. Determination. Perseverance... These are the qualities of a true leader.</Msg><Username>jbhdallas2000</Username><Timestamp>1348972931710</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 22:42:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>14</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message></Date>
