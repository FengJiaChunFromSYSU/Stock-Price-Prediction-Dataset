We all know he lied about a BJ. BFD! How convenient of you to forget that the posse of Newt Gingrich, Henry Hyde, Dan Burton, the main hypocrites attacking Clinton, were also having affairs at the same time. It’s really sad and pathetic that what you represent cannot stand on its own merit, but requires deception and lies to resonate with your base. Why are the Republicans such Anti-Obama Liars? Frank Schaeffer, New York Times, March 2009 Do you wonder why the Republicans tell such whopping lies about President Obama and his economic recovery plan? Isn't one conservative value truth telling? Not when you are serving the "higher call" to save America for Jesus and/or perpetual war, as I explain in my book, Crazy for God: How I Grew Up as One of the Elect, Helped Found the Religious Right, and Lived to Take All (or Almost All) of It Back . You see the Republican "base" is living in an alternative universe. These are the folks who believe that: Guns make you safe, The earth is 6000 years old, Gays are evil and dangerous, Iraq had something to do with 9/11 Obama is a Muslim, Obama is a communist, Obama is the Antichrist, Lowering taxes for the super rich would help the economy, Deregulating banks leads to prosperity. Jesus is coming back soon to take all the evangelicals to heaven leaving anyone who can walk in a straight line and chew gum at the same time on earth, Sara Palin's only problem is that the "elite media" was unfair to her, Every word of the Bible is true -- literally, We don't need trains that work, infrastructure that functions and new energy, just Jesus... What I slowly realized (back in the 1980s before I fled the right) was that the religious right and Republican leadership that my dad and I were helping to gain power were not "conservatives" at all in the old sense of the word. They were anti-American religious revolutionaries. The right had once been led by people like James Buckley and Senator Barry Goldwater who stood for the separation of church and state. The religious right, as it emerged in the late 1970s -- and consequently the Republican Party it took over -- was all about religiously-motivated "morality" which it used for nakedly political (and fund raising) purposes. This was a throwback to an earlier ugly time when 1930s fascist xenophobic hate-mongers like Father Charles Coughlin and his vicious anti-Roosevelt radio program were influential. Father Coughlin would have loved today's congressional Republican leadership. He started a radio "ministry," moved it steadily to the populist right, then identified the "enemy"---in Coughlin's case Roosevelt, in today's Republican's case -- President Obama. Coughlin yesterday, Dobson and Limbaugh, Coulter today: new names, same hate. In the 1970s and 80s the leaders of the religious right were gleefully betting on American moral failure in the way Limbaugh and the Republicans are now rooting for Obama's (and America's) economic failure in 2009. If secular, democratic, diverse gay-tolerant and pluralistic America survives, then wouldn't that prove that the Republicans are wrong about God only wanting to bless a "Christian" (white!) America of low taxes, and unregulated markets? What began to bother me back in the 80s was that so many of my new "friends" on the religious right seemed to be rooting for one form of apocalypse or another. In the crudest form this was part of the evangelical fascination with the so-called End Times. The worse things got, the sooner Jesus would come back. But there was another component: the worse everything got the more it proved that America needed saving, by us! And now the religious right infection (of wanting failure to score a moral/religious point) has become the Republican illness: root for failure so "we" win ideologically! Today the Republican Party is rooting for doom. And since the Republicans are now anti-American members of an Obama-must-fail insurgency, lies become a self-fulfilling prophecy: talk doom, and keep the economy in a panic and we may get what we wish for. Don't conservative Republicans object to the lies? No, because the Republicans don't have any actual and traditional conservative followers left. The Republican base is now made up of religious and neoconservative ideologues, and the uneducated white underclass with a token person of color or two up front on TV to obscure the all-white, all reactionary all backward -- there-is-no-global-warming -- rube reality. Actual conservatives, let alone the educated classes, have long since fled. The Republican religious nuts are rooting for Jesus to "rapture" them, not for America, and the neoconservatives are rooting for war and the Israeli hard liners, not for America. Truth (and sanity) are out the window. So, what is the problem with lying to our faces, say, claiming that all American's taxes are going up when 95% of American's taxes are going to go down? Why not claim Obama is a socialist, even if he's not? Why not say anything at all to drive our country into a pit when losing is seen as winning? That, is all the Republicans have to offer America: more lies on a path to destruction from which the Republican "leadership" plans to resurrect themselves and "save" America from Obama.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1347361901786</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 07:11:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347362961774-2</Id><Topic><Title>Yes, Slick Willie was Impeached !</Title><Username>kit3taylor</Username><Timestamp>1347243288590</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 22:14:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Like your 2 idiots Mutt and Jeff, the truth tellers.

This tells the whole story, why Bush was so bad at the end of his term. Don't just skim over this, it's not long, but read it slowly and let it sink in. If in doubt, check it out! The day the democrats took over was not January 22nd 2009, it was actually January 3rd 2007, the day democrats took over the House of Representatives and the Senate, at the very start of the 110th Congress. The Democrat Party controlled a majority in both chambers for the first time since the end of the 103rd Congress in 1995. For those who are listening to the liberals propagating the fallacy that everything is "Bush's Fault," think about this: January 3rd, 2007 was the day the Democrats took over the Senate and the Congress. At the time: The DOW Jones closed at 12,621.77 The GDP for the previous quarter was 3.5% The Unemployment rate was 4.6% George Bush's Economic policies SET A RECORD of 52 STRAIGHT MONTHS of JOB GROWTH Remember the day... January 3rd, 2007 was the day that Barney Frank took over the House Financial Services Committee and Chris Dodd took over the Senate Banking Committee. The economic meltdown that happened 15 months later was in what part of the economy? BANKING AND FINANCIAL SERVICES! Unemployment... to this CRISIS by (among MANY other things) dumping 5-6 TRILLION Dollars of toxic loans on the economy from YOUR Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac FIASCOES! Bush asked Congress 17 TIMES to stop Fannie &amp; Freddie - starting in 2001 because it was financially risky for the US economy. And who took the THIRD highest pay-off from Fannie Mae AND Freddie Mac? OBAMA And who fought against reform of Fannie and Freddie? OBAMA and the Democrat Congress So when someone tries to blame Bush.. REMEMBER JANUARY 3rd, 2007.... THE DAY THE DEMOCRATS TOOK OVER !" Budgets do not come from the White House. They come from Congress and the party that controlled Congress since January 2007 is the Democrat Party. Furthermore, the Democrats controlled the budget process for 2008 &amp; 2009 as well as 2010 &amp; 2011. In that first year, they had to contend with George Bush, which caused them to compromise on spending, when Bush somewhat belatedly got tough on spending increases. For 2009 though, Nancy Pelosi &amp; Harry Reid bypassed George Bush entirely, passing continuing resolutions to keep government running until Barack Obama could take office. At that time, they passed a massive omnibus spending bill to complete the 2009 budgets. And where was Barack Obama during this time? He was a member of that very Congress that passed all of these massive spending bills, and he signed the omnibus bill as President to complete 2009. If the Democrats inherited any deficit, it was the 2007 deficit, the last of the Republican budgets. That deficit was the lowest in five years, and the fourth straight decline in deficit spending. After that, Democrats in Congress took control of spending, and that includes Barack Obama, who voted for the budgets. If Obama inherited anything, he inherited it from himself. In a nutshell, what Obama is saying is I inherited a deficit that I voted for and then I voted to expand that deficit four-fold since January 20th.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1347396101906</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 16:41:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347400387265-29</Id><Topic><Title>Ban on US Flag Pin = Fraudulant Report !!</Title><Username>jon3retired</Username><Timestamp>1347395864401</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 16:37:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>But God, Flag pins, and American pie have all been discouraged by Barry, and the DNC.

We have no money to expand our military if need be. China, our banker uses it influence every day against us. Our space program is defunct. We've lost control of our borders. Everyone is well aware of the sleeper cells that are waiting in this country, that have come here across our southern border. We are no safer, despite spending BILLIONS. And, Obama's answer is to frisk Grandma. Because it would be politically incorrect to zero in on you know who. Grandma(s) never intentionally hurt anyone.
