You stuck you foot in where it didn’t belong and instead of pulling it out of your mouth smelling like a rose, it apparently had a quite different smell that many find offensive.

Compare that with his predecessors Bush and Clinton: Bush: 1,300 convictions; Clinton: 1,000 convictions; Obama: Zero attempts. And why the difference in prosecuting the law?

Unfortunately that is the same promise made by Lord Barry. No politician will ask for, wish for, allow a review of thier actions and have anyone be able to ask why. More stupidity on the part of government; The Labor Department paid out hundreds of thousands of dollars in federal stimulus funds to a public relations firm to run more than 100 commercials touting the Obama administration’s “green training” job efforts on two popular MSNBC cable shows, records show. The commercials ran on MSNBC on shows hosted by Rachel Maddow and Keith Olbermann in 2009, but the contract didn’t report any jobs created, according to records recently reviewed by The Washington Times. Spending reports under the federal Recovery Act show $495,000 paid to McNeely Pigott &amp; Fox Public Relations LLC, which the Labor Department hired to raise awareness “among employers and influencers about the [Job Corps] program’s existing and new training initiatives in high growth and environmentally friendly career areas” as well as spreading the word to prospective Job Corps enrollees. “Hiring a PR firm does not create jobs and this was obviously meant for selling a particular political agenda,” Mr. Williams said. “The placement really reeks of a political ad rather than a job ad, and taxpayers see through this."
