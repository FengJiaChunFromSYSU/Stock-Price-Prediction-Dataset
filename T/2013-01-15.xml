Let’s suggest that our Democracy is now open to any and all disgruntled citizens to stage a coup every time they don’t get their own way. Do you enjoy sounding like the ignorant, foaming at the mouth, Alex Jones? What in the world is the matter with you people? This isn’t some third-world, West-African nation where they have a coup d'état every other week at the drop of a hat! What don’t you get about the issues of gun control? How many times do you have to be told that a responsible discussion about reducing the availability of assault weapons and magazine capacities is what America wants? And requiring the same background checks at gun shows as are required at gun stores is a no nonsense approach to preventing highly unstable individuals with questionable mental health capabilities (i.e. jon and his buddies at a gun show in Richmond last weekend) or criminals, from easily obtaining our most common domestic weapon of mass destruction. These suggestions make sense and the American people want something done about it NOW. Are they perfect and will they totally eliminate the possibility of violence? Of course not. But doing nothing under the guise of protecting your 2nd amendment rights, when your 2nd amendment rights are not at all jeopardized, is playing right into the hands of the gun lobby. Trying to vilify the President or pretend that the bogeyman is coming after all your guns makes you look like nothing other than a mouth piece for the gun manufacturers, just like the NRA. What more do you want said than this?: President Obama at a campaign rally in Lebanon, Va., on Sept. 9 “I don’t want any misunderstanding when you all go home, and you’re talking to your buddies, and they say, "Aw, he wants to take my gun away." You’ve heard it here; I’m on television, so everybody knows it. I believe in the Second Amendment. I believe in people’s lawful right to bear arms. I will not take your shotgun away. I will not take your rifle away. I won’t take your handgun away. … There are some common-sense gun safety laws that I believe in. But I am not going to take your guns away. So if you want to find an excuse not to vote for me, don’t use that one. … It just ain’t true. Wall Street Journal, Sept. 5: “If you’ve got a gun in your house, I’m not taking it,’’ Obama said. But the Illinois senator could still see skeptics in the crowd, particularly on the faces of several men at the back of the room. So he tried again. “Even if I want to take them away, I don’t have the votes in Congress,’’ he said. “This can’t be the reason not to vote for me. Can everyone hear me in the back? I see a couple of sportsmen back there. I’m not going to take away your guns.’’ And yesterday he said: "…people who have a gun for protection, for hunting, for sportsmanship. They don't have anything to worry about." America does not want people who advocate overthrowing the government to have access to military type arsenals. If you WANT to overthrow the government, simply because you CAN’T have them, as you suggest, then you are part of the problem, and an impediment to the solution. And whether you believe it or not, America is more concerned with the safety of their children, than your apparent concern for the profits made by arms sales.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1358255205861</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-15 08:06:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358259024793-2</Id><Topic><Title>Romney wins "Lie of the Year"</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1358203944318</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-14 17:52:24 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I went back and checked the add.

They insist every event or decision is a crisis and that the other side, to quote ding#$%$, has a gun the head of America. Now he claims he won't even discuss anything about the debt ceiling and it’s his way or shut everything down. They appointed a commission to suggest what needed to be done to begin to resolve some of our economic problems and he ignored them. He would not compromise on health care and along with Nut Job Nancy insisted we had to pass the bill even if he and many other didn't understand the entire bill. He wouldn't compromise on tax increases and his cohorts in Congress are now saying they are still not through with increasing taxes but will not sit down for any meaningful discussions about spending reductions. He is not satisfied with the status quo, he doesn't want to continue to spend and go further into debt, and he insists we have to increase revenue to spend MORE! Has he not looked outside his windows lately? We cannot continue on the path of unlimited spending.

And just before Xmas, you also said this: “I agree that automatic weapons, large capacity clips are unnecessary…” Okay, end of story, right? We agree then, no? Oh, wait, of course not…the rest of your sentence was this: “…the problem is that once a politician gets you leaning one direction, they will knock you over completely…” Do you see how silly you look when you say things like that? You are saying that you agree we don’t need assault weapons and that large magazines are unnecessary…but you don’t want to do anything about it only because you suffer from a completely unfounded, politically motivated doctrine of paranoia that there’s a diabolical government conspiracy of socialists out to disarm you, destroy America and put you in hidden concentration camps already awaiting any and all gun owners. A good analogy would be that The Howard Hughes Medical Center is a world leader in immunology, but were he alive, Howard probably wouldn’t ever go there because of his paranoia induced fear of germs. Then again, a week ago you said this, about which we are still awaiting the documentation of your very questionable sources. “According to the FBI, the #1 weapon used in violent crimes…is a baseball bat.” Watch out boys and girls – here come another inner-city gang – Are they the Crips? No, they aren’t carrying Louisville Sluggers…they’re armed with Mizuno bats…must be The Yakusa.</Msg><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1358262435472</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-15 10:07:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358262610521-10</Id><Topic><Title>AHQ (2)...</Title><Username>echo2165</Username><Timestamp>1357960284445</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 22:11:24 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>...

As each state reported their final election details, the evidence of voter fraud is astounding. Massive voter fraud has been reported in areas of OH and FL, with PA, WI and VA, all are deploying personnel to investigate election results. Here are just a few examples of what has surfaced with much more to come. * In 59 voting districts in the Philadelphia region, Obama received 100% of the votes with not even a single vote recorded for Romney. (A mathematical and statistical impossibility). * In 21 districts in Wood County Ohio, Obama received 100% of the votes where GOP inspectors were illegally removed from their polling locations - and not one single vote was recorded for Romney. (Another statistical impossibility). * In Wood County Ohio, 106,258 voted in a county with only 98,213 eligible voters. * In St. Lucie County, FL, there were 175,574 registered eligible voters but 247,713 votes were cast. * The National SEAL Museum, a polling location in St. Lucie County, FL had a 158% voter turnout. * Palm Beach County, FL had a 141% voter turnout. * In Ohio County, Obama won by 108% of the total number of eligible voters. NOTE: Obama won in every state that did not require a Photo ID and lost in every state that did require a Photo ID in order to vote.

Let me list the assumptions: 1. Employers would give their contributions to employees. 2. You would have invested all of your contribution and all of your employer contributions. 3. You would have invested them the same way with the same success. 4. Population-wise, the added money in financial markets would not have affected those markets negatively (e.g., increased overall risk-taking or decreased historic yields). 5. Population-wise, the lack of security would not have changed behavior in a manner that negatively impacted the economy. (e.g., less-risk taking by entrepreneurs, higher savings rate by consumers). 6. You would not have had to pay the living and medical expenses of your elderly relatives. And that's just looking at the historical risks to your own financial circumstances of not having soc. sec. or Medicare.

That revival of T (which is actually SBC who chose to take on the T brand for reasons beneficial to SBC), was made possible by the U.S. federal government. The old T was taken apart in 1984 by the federal government in 1984. As I have pointed out, everything government is related to T and T's circuitry as T circuits monitor these pipelines and alarms if there is a problem. T does so much more which I don't care to discuss on a forum where there are people who don't have a clue about communications, except they have learned to push buttons to trade or short the stock.</Msg><Username>windyfrostt</Username><Timestamp>1358269301846</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-15 12:01:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358270003258-28</Id><Topic><Title>These numbers don't lie</Title><Username>windyfrostt</Username><Timestamp>1358267238071</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-15 11:27:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>... “In 21 districts in Wood County Ohio, Obama received 100% of the votes where GOP inspectors were illegally removed from their polling locations - and not one single vote was recorded for Romney.” - windy Sure, windy.

In the Star Ledger, a Democratice newspaper if there every was one, is reporting on the front page that NJ looks to scrap college healthe care law. NJ requries that all students be covered by heatlh care, and if they are not coverage is offered at a rate of $100 to $600 per year per student for varying levels of minimal health care coverage. In September of 2014 as a direct result of Obama Care the costs for the same bare minimum coverages will rise and ADDITIONAL $1,000 to $1,500 per year. If Ricky is still on the board he will tell you that is not true. Hmmm the heard of education in NJ (Cerf) will tell you that Ricky is full of it. Not only are middle income taxes rising, oh darn, Obama and Ricky exclude fees, but the costs are rising in increased taxes and increased fees on the Middle Class, so are the coverage costs that will be dropped by most major corporations. The fines are cheaper than the coverage. You voted for the Fool on the Hill you will really be regretful when the costs become clearer at the end of the year. T will rise as they do away with excessive health care costs. Direct bottom line benefit!!!!!!!! As an investor in T, THANKS RICKY!!!!

The answer is 152. ” That makes your post a totally stupid response…” - Wilkes Thank you, once again, for displaying your undying faith in inaccurate message board propaganda…not at all unlike exactly what you dunderheads repeatedly post here on a regular basis. First off, in Ohio, while we have Congressional Districts, the locations of where people cast their ballots are called precincts. Each precinct is staffed by 4 workers, two from each major party. I know you would like folks to believe that you know what you are talking about, but let’s take it straight from the Woods County Bd. Of Elections: “Wood County is separated into ninety-seven (97) precincts…Those ninety-seven (97) precincts are located in sixty-one (61) polling locations. Some locations having two (2) precincts to a location.” So you’re suggesting that in 61 polling locations in Wood County, 21 of them recorded absolutely no votes for the Republican Candidate???? Please be our guest and show us your sources for this information other than where you gleaned it from a message board. (As long as you’re providing sources, could you get your pal to come up with the infamous “bat” statistics while you’re at it?) As to your next point: “In Wood County Ohio, 106,258 voted in a county with only 98,213 eligible voters.” – wilkes again Official Results November 6, 2012 General Election Wood County, Ohio Stewart Alexander 44 0.07% Richard Duncan 117 0.18% Virgil Goode 62 0.10% Gary Johnson 940 1.47% Barack Obama 32802 51.21% Mitt Romney 29704 46.37% Jill Stein 279 0.44% Total 63948 So, let’s see here…we take your 106,258 that you say were cast minus the 63,948 official votes as reported by the Wood County Bd. Of Elections = 42,310 write-ins for Tom Hoefling, Merlin Miller and Justin Bieber, or whatever other illogical explanation you have for your ridiculous post. Maybe they are winholder’s numbers – he claims executive privilege from having to document anything. (at least until he’s called on it, then he lies, as usual.)

Could see 40 by Q5 maybe Q4.</Msg><Username>dan2003hr</Username><Timestamp>1358286994419</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-15 16:56:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358287115245-58</Id><Title>mikerego 19</Title><Msg>You need to go to investing school!!!!!!

During the raid the death toll was 4 agents and 6 church members. After the initial raid the FBI was placed in charge of the siege (which lasted 51 days). On April 19,1993 the US Attorney General authorized the final assault of the church by the FBI and US military personnel with tanks and heavy equipment. After a CS gas container (launched by the FBI) caught a couch on fire (within the church) the church complex soon went up in flames. As a result of the assault 76 church members were killed, 17 of which were children. Just a little example of what happens when the federal government comes to save lives in your state.
