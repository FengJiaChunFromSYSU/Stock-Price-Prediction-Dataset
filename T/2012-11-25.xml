One nation even deliberately attacked one of our unarmed naval ships in a "False Flag" attempt . Think there was any penalty? Nope, we raised their payoff and they "paid us back" with that increase. I understand they have government health care too that is obviously partially paid for by your taxes.</Msg><Username>lewcor</Username><Timestamp>1353854971474</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-25 09:49:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353859078617-2</Id><Topic><Title>Morsi = Peace Deal = Foreign Aid !!</Title><Username>jon3retired</Username><Timestamp>1353764635299</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-24 08:43:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>While that theory may be a bit farfetched, the Arab Spring is turning into an Arab pain in the #$%$ for Obama. The people he supported are now turning out to be a liability and a real sore spot for him. They are turning into the anti-American, radical Muslims that many projected they would be. Yet, we still send them money, money to call us names, support our enemies, and defame the US name. Makes sense to me! Just yet another example of the lack of leadership and due diligence on the part of this administration and the poor management of our fiscal and political resources. Congress is afraid to resist this President, fearing they will be called racist dupes.</Msg><Username>winholder</Username><Timestamp>1353859078617</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-25 10:57:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353859247453-3</Id><Topic><Title>Warren Buffet: cap gain 30%, 50% tax on the rich</Title><Username>peppeek</Username><Timestamp>1353097971771</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-16 15:32:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I find it very interesting that most of the Wal-Mart picketers aren't even Wal-Mart employees.

Those on the left that have money will soon find that they have been fooled into thinking they will make some social gains through their support of a more and more socialist leaning administration and they will be sorely rewarded for that support. They will be the last to learn this hard lesson, but they will learn...hopefully before it is too late for all of us.</Msg><Username>winholder</Username><Timestamp>1353859534622</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-25 11:05:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353880679669-5</Id><Topic><Title>Has aggressive 'Fix The Debt' campaign started yet?</Title><Username>lavendersin</Username><Timestamp>1353427660081</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 11:07:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Some racist claims Obama wants to fix the debt so he can cut food stamps for white people and give them to illegal immigrants. The idea is not only contemptible and untrue, it is filled with logical inconsistencies (that match Lavendar's twisted mind). Yet the tea partiers jump on the bandwagon. Including the self-proclaimed only black man in America with a Prius. Don't you get embarrassed by this stuff? I still hope for a Republican party that isn't run by nutcases. You're worried that members of Congress are on vacation. I'm worried their back in their gerrymandered districts realizing that their voting base is as senile as it's ever been.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1353880679669</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-25 16:57:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353882407799-6</Id><Title>Join us to forty. been there before.</Title><Msg>and get a heck of a dividend on the way up every 90 days.

Or is it just something made up in your fetid brain? Nice thing about Black neighborhoods. They don't discriminate.
