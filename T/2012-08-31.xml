He's done that in spades. And, of course, it is no secret Republicans repeatedly blocked the President's attempts to close Gitmo. They apparently think Americans are too weak to try a terrorist. What is hilarious about all these accusation about what the president "didn't do" is that they all refer to fixing the boneheaded things Republicans did in the first place. Don't want troops in Afghanistan? How about finishing the war before you invade another country? How about troops in Iran? Syria? That's what you get with Romney Ryan? Even Fox News knows Ryan's speech was little more than lies.

I haven’t seen a speech like Clint Eastwood’s since Rick Perry’s in New Hampshire in October, when he rambled on and on with his slurred speech so much that folks thought he was on Quaaludes. I think serious disservice was done to the GOP cause, by permitting Eastwood to ramble on to an empty chair, making throat cutting gestures, suggesting “they” own America, implying that the empty chair (POTUS) was telling him to go fock himself, and ending with a famous line from his macho movies (“Make my day”) suggesting he was about to blow somebody away at the slightest provocation, particularly in this day and age. In fairness, it would appear he had carte blanche permission to freelance, and word has it that many in the RNC were grimacing and squirming in their seats, while listening to Eastwood’s least impressive role since his brief appearance as a sailor in “Francis (the talking mule) in the Navy” early in his career. Unfortunately, it would appear many (not all) of those in attendance, (mostly angry, old, white guys, the Tea Party stalwarts not unlike Eastwood’s character Walt Kowalski in “Gran Torino”) ate it up. Did the rest of America? Stay tuned. I, for one, a fan of much of his later work, was extremely disappointed in this performance, and do not feel it was at all appropriate.

That would have wrapped up the GOP in a nutshell - special emphasis on the word "nut". Interesting article in the NYT contrasting the platform in '80 with today.

All different, yes. I do not hear many complaints regarding these costly time saving, and live saving items. Cars are part of our "American Heritage" we want to be independent, a horse would be cheaper, and more friendly to our environment. This is true even with the road apples. Of course to insure a horse if used daily, would be costley. So consider the cost of these cars part of your Freedom, you are free to buy them or not.

Somebody else made that happen," he said. If you leave out the "that" he had been speaking about for several minutes: schools, roads, government research the internet. This is the flip side of attacking Romney for saying he likes to fire people. You can be a "gotcha" person, or you can be a respectable human being. The choice is yours. The full quote: If you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help. There was a great teacher somewhere in your life. Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we have that allowed you to thrive. Somebody invested in roads and bridges. If you’ve got a business. you didn’t build that. Somebody else made that happen. The Internet didn’t get invented on its own. Government research created the Internet so that all the companies could make money off the Internet. The point is, is that when we succeed, we succeed because of our individual initiative, but also because we do things together. There are some things, just like fighting fires, we don’t do on our own. I mean, imagine if everybody had their own fire service. That would be a hard way to organize fighting fires. So we say to ourselves, ever since the founding of this country, you know what, there are some things we do better together. That’s how we funded the GI Bill. That’s how we created the middle class. That’s how we built the Golden Gate Bridge or the Hoover Dam. That’s how we invented the Internet. That’s how we sent a man to the moon. We rise or fall together as one nation and as one people, and that’s the reason I’m running for president – because I still believe in that idea.

They are much easier overcome if you have money, insurance, and you don't have to work a job or two while overcoming them. Unfortunately, alot of people don't overcome them because of this. They succumb to illness or become disabled, their children become latch key children because they can't get daycare, or the bills mount up and the lose their savings and house or can't afford to eat or feed their kids. These are things Anne Romney never had to think about, much less experience. It's just a different world the Romney's and Ryans lived in. They may have faced challenges, but they never struggled just to survive or make ends meet. I'm sure they're fine, "tough" people. They just don't understand the world 99% of Americans experience on a daily basis.

He let hundreds of buses that could have been used evacuate people sit idle. In July of 2005, New Orleans Mayor Nagin prepared DVDs warning that, if the city ever had to be evacuated, residents were on their own. A couple days before Katrina hit New Orleans, Governor Jeb Bush of Florida called Louisiana Governor Kathleen Blanco. The first time he called her, her aids said she was taking a nap and couldn't be disturbed, but they would ask her to call back. After not receiving a call back Jeb called back again and got ahold of her. He told her that he help her evacuate the New Orleans hospitals. She told him that she would think about it and get back to him. She never called back. President Bush began to communicate the extreme emergency to the Governor and the Mayor days before the storm hit. President Bush asked the City Mayor to declare a mandatory evacuation but the Mayor refused. President Bush urged the Governor to sign the papers needed so that he could order the Federal personnel into position to help. He even made out the paperwork for the Governor, but the Governor refused to sign it, making it illegal for President Bush to help those poor people in New Orleans. The Governor apparently saw it as a kind of political power struggle.</Msg><Username>ricky1820l</Username><Timestamp>1346465240000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 22:07:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346466086000-88</Id><Topic><Title>MITT ROMNEY IS MORMON... vs. OBAMA IS CHRISTIAN</Title><Username>jbhdallas2000</Username><Timestamp>1346210905000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 23:28:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I pick a good moslem anyday over a christian.

Clint, really nailed Biden also. He does act like Grinning Cheshire Cat. Will they say Clint is a bigot? Can't anyone disagree with This poor excuse for a President?</Msg><Username>robfisk</Username><Timestamp>1346467174000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 22:39:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346467560000-93</Id><Topic><Title>Obama ignores New Orleans</Title><Username>ricky1820l</Username><Timestamp>1346432456000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 13:00:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Then don't vote for him.

But with a name like that (after a civil war General), Jeb has got to give up ever being a President. It's a good thing he doesn't hold a grudge against George. The real problem is we have had some terrible Presidents in the modern era, Carter, Bush, and Obummer. Losers, one and all. I really believe Mitt can help. With his business background, and Paul's economic degree/knowledge. Anyone has gotta do better than Barry. If bu!!crap was music, as my Dad would say, Obama would be leading the band. Barry really feels he hasn't communicated his position very well. I know so many people that whenever Barry talks, they change the tv, or just cut it off. No one wants to hear you whine. It's way past the time when we should have seen some action. But, as Rubio has said, Barry has become a much better golfer on our dime. And Mouchelle vacations well.</Msg><Username>robfisk</Username><Timestamp>1346468398000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 22:59:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346470377000-95</Id><Topic><Title>MITT ROMNEY IS MORMON... vs. OBAMA IS CHRISTIAN</Title><Username>jbhdallas2000</Username><Timestamp>1346210905000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 23:28:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Best study your religions.
