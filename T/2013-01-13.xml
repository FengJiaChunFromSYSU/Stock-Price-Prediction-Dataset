We have a system of laws in place. If you decide to make up your own, then I guess anyone else who disagrees with you can do the same thing to you. “so much anger”? How ironic for you to mention anger. Anger – the fuel of mob rule, vigilantism and lynchings…what you preach is the epitome of anger. How about some answers for a change instead of frog philosophy.

The Federalist Papers were a series of writings by a group of American thinkers that advocated a strong centralized federal govenment. Thomas Jefferson and his followers were opposed to a strong federal govenment and advocated states rights. In fact the bill of rights ( the first 10 amendments is the answer to the Federalist Papers ) were added to restrict the rights of the federal govenment. The Constitution could not be approved until the bill of rights were added, naming what rights were reserved for the people. I see Frogg didn't make it through the 7th grade.

First, the Fed says that they may not have enough to pay my Social Security in my Senior years, which are upon me now. I payed into this for 43 years, and thought we had an agreemenrt. I guess not ironclad. Then they say that Medicare will be compromised because too many undeserving, non- paying folks are now attached to it. That will affect me negatively very late in the game. I would have taken better care of myself if I had known this. Now they say that my U. S. Savings Bonds, which I have been buying for 45 years, are in danger of being defaulted upon. I thought that we had a Bond, Treasury Department. I am keeping up my end. Why would you even consider not paying me off for these Bonds? What a bunch of losers. And finally, they say that my 401K Money Market funds, which are uninsured, could be attached ( Federal Employees are in that boat). If you need to borow some money from me, you must suck badly. What exactly do I have left? All agreements that I made have been, or are under consideration for reneging upon.. As far as I am concerned, the U.S. Govt can kiss my butt.

It has always been yes. We have three branches of government with overlapping powers. These form a series of checks and balances. The role of the executive branch is to faithfully execute the laws. The executive branch *always* has the authority to enforce or not enforce a law. They *always* have the authority to prioritize the laws they execute Whether it is the local police chief choosing to priortize property crimes over traffic infractions or the Attorney general choosing to prioritize gun smuggling over immigration. "Faithfully" is a subjective term--one to be interpreted by the voters. You may not like what they choose to prioritize or execute. In that case, vote. But prioritizing and selectively enforcing the law is precisely what the executive branch is supposed to do. When Bush II decided to ignore Civil Rights laws I didn't like it. But I knew it was in his Constitutionally granted authority to do so.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1358132450581</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-13 22:00:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358132734742-24</Id><Topic><Title>Harry Reid the new hero of the right</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1357790625707</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 23:03:45 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Jon, fake ricky was telling a lame joke.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1358132734742</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-13 22:05:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358133173811-25</Id><Topic><Title>Looks like some people in Mexico understand that guns are not just for hunting</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1358076072441</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-13 06:21:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.
