Have you seen any other posts I have submitted with spelling errors? You don't know the answer to that one either do you wise guy? "The need to criticize Obama is over, or serves no purpose." Oh you couldn't be more mistaken. People still have to point out the errors in his speeches, the broken promises of his campaigns, which he won so why does he keep campaigning. People need to keep pointing out the bad decisions he is making and making more people aware of his flawed ideology. Hopefully there are still some intelligent folks in the Democratic Party that will recognize the error of their and his ways and try to slow his rush to socialism. He is still campaigning because that is all he really knows how to do, he has few if any leadership expertise, he doesn't appreciate the truth and those traits and shortcomings need to be exposed as often as possible. I notice you completely disregarded the subject of the message as well; that being the pathetic performance of the students and teachers in Detroit and the thoughtless support by the President of such incompetence. I wonder why? Of course, silly me, you were focused on a misspelled word...so much for seeing the big picture. Good job.

Teddy Roosevelrt and unions helped create the middle class in our country. We'd still be in the hands of the robber barons of the 1800s - extreme abject poverty all around. No child labor laws - no education - no work safety laws - no work hours limits - no benefits - no paid into retirement. Poverty has risen again in USA over 40% higher in the past 30 years while the wealthy have become even wealthier. Gap has widened tremendously. Wealthy greed has no limits once again. Look at big oil, huge corporate farms, big pharma, insurance, Wall St. banks and insurance cos. have run wild as a result of many many deregulations since Ronald Reagan. Unbelieveable greed - never seen since the 1800s and of course the greedy party during the 1920s. We see how these excesses and wild parties ended in all instances since the 1800s. Huge depressions in the 1800s and 1920s. Learn from history. Toynbee was right; if we do not learn from it we are doomed to repeat its mistakes!

These are unrelated dots you connect. It has nothing to do with Union teachers, the data. Union teachers are experienced and best. You get a new roof, you call an experienced firm, or led a kid with a how to book do the job? Teaching is one of the most difficult and taxing jobs there is. Obama was right on praising them, as we all should be. I do. I give teachers the highest praises. Teachers do not have time to go home with each child, and with the large size classes, there is only so much teacher for each child. You are really off base on the whole thing. Their pay is very low in the early years, so low they barely get by. When are you going to thank all the thousands of Union employes for your present day job conditions? You just think that happened by chance? Read some history of the labor movement and about the working conditions 100 years ago. You want that, just to be against Obama?

So go outside, shout and scream, make big signs, rent a loudspeaker if you wish, but Yahoo owns these boards and they have the right to allow what they see fit and to disallow anything they see fit. They own it, they control it. It is their right.</Msg><Username>usganut</Username><Timestamp>1355269979650</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 18:52:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355274878044-34</Id><Topic><Title>Yahoo censors truth?</Title><Username>lavendersin</Username><Timestamp>1355247592411</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 12:39:52 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Don't flatter yourself lavendarASS. You've never written anything even vaguely interesting enough to "censor". Your posts got picked up by either the "crap filter" or the "bugsh+t" crazy filter and ended up precisely where they belong. It's Yahoo's equivalent of a street sweeper, it picks up dead vermin, rotting food wrappers and discarded bowel movements, which, on a moment's reflection, is a pretty accurate description of your intellect and its contribution.</Msg><Username>geoff_holt_2000</Username><Timestamp>1355274878044</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 20:14:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355275093836-35</Id><Topic><Title>Yahoo censors truth?</Title><Username>lavendersin</Username><Timestamp>1355247592411</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 12:39:52 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I've got it now lewussy. You're all talk and can do drooly senile conspiracy posts but cannot make an airline reservation. Tell the truth for once, ever since that time they found you naked in an irrigation ditch after 36h, you're not actually allowed to leave the house anymore, are you? Dec. 26. Noon. Red's Java Hut.

I have to laugh at your insults. "Sticks and stones may break my bones but names will never hurt me." I learned that in grade school. I know how upset you would feel in the presence any real men. Most of your type do. I used to go to "liberal" meetings all by myself and ask provacative questions. Only once was I challenged. Had they come to any of our meetings they would have been thrown out bodily.</Msg><Username>lewcor</Username><Timestamp>1355276483795</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 20:41:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355279619596-37</Id><Topic><Title>Yahoo censors truth?</Title><Username>lavendersin</Username><Timestamp>1355247592411</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 12:39:52 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good. They're supposed to amuse. Good also that we have established that I will not have any reason whatsoever to be "upset" while in your presence - emasculated by time and other thieves, endlessly chewing on imagined memories of lost physical prowess and regurgitating them to anyone who will spare you a tedious instant. Remember, I've seen your marathon times - nothing there anyone other than a rather chubby 12 year old girl would crow about. I don't care about your meetings you attended or didn't attend. It's just more lies and you "provocative" questions were more likely propositioning other men to throatf+ck you in the bathroom than anything else. Since when did the simple recognition of the lies of dirtbag liars such as you become strictly the province of "liberals". You're kidding yourself lewussy. For the third time - Red's Java Hut (SF), on the docks you want to show me, Dec. 26, 2012. Noon. Just admit that your son and wife will not allow you to leave the house anymore.</Msg><Username>geoff_holt_2000</Username><Timestamp>1355279619596</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 21:33:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355279962862-38</Id><Topic><Title>Kissinger and the NEW WORD ORDER</Title><Username>todlondon</Username><Timestamp>1355017207404</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-08 20:40:07 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Volunteer for immediate deresolution and win a free gift certificate at J C Penny's with no expiration date.</Msg><Username>sdmiller4747</Username><Timestamp>1355279962862</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 21:39:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355280829495-39</Id><Title>$20 Special Dividend Coming</Title><Msg>For all T loyalists.</Msg><Username>xtgeminiman</Username><Timestamp>1355280829495</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 21:53:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355282529694-40</Id><Topic><Title>$20 Special Dividend Coming</Title><Username>xtgeminiman</Username><Timestamp>1355280829495</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 21:53:49 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'd hate to be at the receiving end of the magic wand that just hit the side of your head,</Msg><Username>geoff_holt_2000</Username><Timestamp>1355282529694</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 22:22:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
