And honestly do you really believe that RBC would be involved that fiasco? Out of all the rumors I have heard about buyouts during 30 years not even 0.001% came through Especially now after the banks disaster in 2008, Banks are reluctant financing LBOs and I do not blame them since they are a losing proposition to start with, otherwise Dell's stock would not be where it is. Logic dictates that even if a deal is possible the stock price would drop to $10 to show the shareholders that the deal is a good deal and that they will be making $2 or $3 per share, at today's level, law suits will start pouring the minute any deal is announced. The high of the year was $18.35 and law firms would use this numbers to attack Dell even though knowing Dell real stock price should be $8 or less and the next QTR results will show you why.</Msg><Username>davidduke5000</Username><Timestamp>1358691930746</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-20 09:25:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358692048610-5</Id><Title>what's dell worth gurus everywhere,then whamo!! $17...</Title><Msg>ah ha..</Msg><Username>dubble_dog</Username><Timestamp>1358692048610</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-20 09:27:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358692146119-6</Id><Title>economy growing more..= dell worth more = $17+</Title><Msg>or more..</Msg><Username>dubble_dog</Username><Timestamp>1358692146119</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-20 09:29:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358692266299-7</Id><Topic><Title>DELL CANNOT USE THE $10 BILLION FOR THE BUYOUT.</Title><Username>davidduke5000</Username><Timestamp>1358630963926</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 16:29:23 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Start by writing a post more than 5 words to be taken seriously.</Msg><Username>davidduke5000</Username><Timestamp>1358692266299</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-20 09:31:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358692338561-8</Id><Title>**** DELL will go BK ****</Title><Msg>The market maker will be out of job &amp; waiting at the soup line &amp; sleeping over at Greenwich Village with a buddy.

Less than 500 million shares traded hands in a full week of rumors between $13 to $20 per share, but somehow it's not moving beyond $12.95. The deal is not going to happen, Dell would not go private since there is no reason to believe it will do better as a private entity , and alleging that the shareholders are in Michael dell's plans is utter nonsense since the stock price has nothing to do with his plans. We simply have to look what IBM did when they dumped the PC business, they were not worried about the stock price. But I tell you what seems to be the problem with Michael Dell, I believe one or more of the acquisitions were fraudulent and this news is about to come out which will send the stock down to $6.00 making his stake in the company worth $1.6 billion instead of $3.2 billion especially not long ago he bought millions of shares at $14 and $15. Here you have it, my experience tells me it's a nonsense deal and that big investors will ask Michael Dell what are his plans to turn around the company and he needs to take it private.</Msg><Username>davidduke5000</Username><Timestamp>1358692851241</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-20 09:40:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358692946163-12</Id><Title>in @$9,stocks continue to run, dell continue to run too</Title><Msg>could see $20 before this is over...</Msg><Username>ka_chinng</Username><Timestamp>1358692946163</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-20 09:42:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358693354289-13</Id><Topic><Title>in @$9,stocks continue to run, dell continue to run too</Title><Username>ka_chinng</Username><Timestamp>1358692946163</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-20 09:42:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>afraid it is going to dirty Market Maker's pocket.

Thus far, Singapore's state investor Temasek Holdings Pte Ltd -- another prospective equity partner that Silver Lake has tapped -- is not interested in joining the consortium, the people said. While Silver Lake has yet to line up investment partners, the buyout firm has told its bank lenders that it remains very confident about its ability to secure equity financing, two of the sources said. Founder and CEO Mike Dell remains a linchpin of the effort. The man who grew Dell from a college dorm-room hobby into the world's No. 3 PC maker is sitting on an estimated personal fortune of $14.6 billion, according to Forbes. It is unclear how much the billionaire will contribute to the buyout, or how much of his 14 percent stake in Dell will be rolled into the deal, the sources said.</Msg><Username>davidduke5000</Username><Timestamp>1358717740395</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-20 16:35:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358721192490-24</Id><Topic><Title>Tuesday comes and no deal we crash</Title><Username>gmns888</Username><Timestamp>1358714389071</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-20 15:39:49 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>WHY, Tuesday is meaningless unless your short and spreading rumors.

Private equity player Silver Lake Partners is leading the deal that would take the technology heavyweight private for about $13 a share, sources have previously said. Dell closed at $12.84 last week, but traded as low as $10 recently before the potential buyout was reported. Still, some shareholders have voiced concerns about founder Michael Dell taking the company private at what they consider to be a "bargain," and are now threatening not to vote to approve the deal, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter. It's unclear if the opposition from some shareholders would doom the deal, and private equity and banking players have hopped one major hurdle: financing. Sources close to the deal-making process say Silver Lake has nearly completed financing with a group of banks that include Royal Bank of Canada (RY), Bank of America (BAC) and Credit Suisse (CS). J.P. Morgan Chase’s (JPM) famed deal-banker James Lee is advising Dell. Still bankers involved in the negotiations say the concerns being voiced among shareholders represent a significant issue for Dell founder Michael Dell and his private equity partners. If he raises the per-share price of the deal to appease shareholders too much, the transaction's economics might not make sense. If he doesn't, shareholders might balk at approving it. Bankers working on the deal say last week's media leak that Dell was considering a management-led buyout of the company exacerbated these issues. Bankers would have preferred to officially announce a proposal in one stroke rather than have the news leak even before financing was nailed down. Many of Silver Lake's competitors and bankers at major Wall Street firms initially expressed skepticism that Dell could pull off what would be a leveraged buyout that would allow the company to go private through a massive sale of debt. Moreover, Dell's business of manufacturing personal computers is highly profitable but maturing. It is unclear if the company could be sold eventually at a higher price, which is the ultimate goal of any private-equity transaction. Also unclear is Michael Dell's plan to re-tool Dell to justify that higher sale price. Still, bankers working on the deal say they are confident the transaction will ultimately get done because most investors will realize that shares will slide sharply if a deal isn't completed, though it might just take longer; some bankers were shooting to complete the transaction as early as Sunday. Now the timing is more fluid as the company and its advisers continue to monitor shareholder sentiment and possibly adjust the deal's terms. The total value of the deal is expected to be north of $22 billion, making it one of the largest take-private deals in recent years. On several occasions, such mega-deals have fallen through at the last minute and sources have warned that this could happen here too.</Msg><Username>davidduke5000</Username><Timestamp>1358726255824</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-20 18:57:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358726303057-28</Id><Topic><Title>Tuesday comes and no deal we crash</Title><Username>gmns888</Username><Timestamp>1358714389071</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-20 15:39:49 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I agree, its just typical media noise to shake the weak.
