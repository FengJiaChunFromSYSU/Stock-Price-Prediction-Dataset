On the one hand we see M.Dell trying to steal the company. What disturbings me is he did not think anyone would comprehend that. However, what is worse is this offer is so incompetent that one has to wonder about M.Dell. No wonder the company is not doing better. How could anyone with any experience make an offer without having quietly checked to see if the Institutional shareholders were aboard. There are many quiet ways to put feelers out to be sure that the offer would be accepted by a majority of the shareholders. He honestly believes that he could cram this offer down these fund manager's throats. What hubris. He thinks he is smart and everyone else are idiots. What is worse, this deal is not going to get done. I assume that M.Dell will very soon withdraw the offer and return to being CEO. He has now proven for all the world to see he is incapable of managing anything. Instead of buying the company, he needs to sell his shares and allow the BOD to get someone capable to turn this giant around. He is certainly not capable. As shareholders we have two hopes: that Larry Ellison with the former CEO of H-P will make a $16.50 offer and let M.Dell retire or M.Dell will retire and allow the BOD to hire someone capable of righting this ship. The emperior has no clothes; M.Dell is a proven incompetent.</Msg><Username>ellerbebil2</Username><Timestamp>1360436109052</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-09 13:55:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360436322916-38</Id><Topic><Title>M.Dell</Title><Username>ellerbebil2</Username><Timestamp>1360436109052</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-09 13:55:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thank you for an insightful well articulated post.

By the way, if you have any ethic or morale, think about thousands if not millions investors, shareholders, beneficials, mutual funds, or anyone may be impacted by this transaction. If you have any 401k, you are certainly one of them. Basically, everyone in America is directly or indirectly getting hurt by this. I own 2000 shares at average 13.75, and i won't get much damage. What I really can't stand is when one of richest man in US conducting such behavior of robbing us. You can argue Dell was $10 2 months ago. Well, a house sold at bargain does not equal the rest of houses should be sold at the bargain. Please understand we are fighting to avoid this type of wall street behavior that you've known in last 4-5 years. Greedy banks got bailout, 1% benefiting from the rest, this richest man is stealing the company.

For example, Southeastern owned significant stakes in General Motors, Chesapeake Energy, and now Dell. In each case Southeastern bought shares at too high a price, without really understanding the businesses in which they bought shares, and then became accusatory when the stock prices declined. GM, Chesapeake, and Dell management never asked Southeastern to buy their shares. Like you, Southeastern made a mistake paying too much for their Dell shares. The stock market is risky. Dell is doing the right thing now, holding a 45 day period where any interested (and financially capable) enity may make an offer to buy Dell. If Southeastern believes Dell is worth $24, or $20 per share then Southeastern is welcome to make an offer to buy the company for more than the current $13.65 LBO offer. It can't be any more fair than that.</Msg><Username>bashfordcapital</Username><Timestamp>1360438298063</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-09 14:31:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360438843445-47</Id><Title>We are not fools mike</Title><Msg>The $24.4 billion buyout of Dell (ticker: DELL) announced last week would pay stockholders $13.65 a share. That amounts to just eight times projected 2013 profit of $1.67 a share and just six times earnings, excluding Dell's net cash of $5 billion, which comes to $3 a share. That's a steal, given that Dell is believed to have earned $1.71 a share in its just-concluded fiscal year that ended in January. No major company has ever gone private so cheaply. Most leveraged buyouts are done for double the Dell transaction valuation. "This deal is so compellingly unfair to shareholders that I don't know where to begin," says Richard Pzena, chief investment officer at Pzena Investment Management, which held 14 million shares on Sept. 30. His firm values Dell at about $25 a share. The stock was unchanged at $13.63 last week, after gaining about 1% Friday afternoon on the Southeastern news. Look for Michael Dell and his investment bankers to put out the word that rejection of the deal would hammer the stock price back down toward its 2012 low of $9. Such a drop is very unlikely. The initial decline could be just a point if the buyout is withdrawn, and the shares could rise if the company makes a tender offer for its stock.</Msg><Username>sexylawgirl1</Username><Timestamp>1360438843445</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-09 14:40:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360439811923-48</Id><Topic><Title>What do you think will happen? from your experience...</Title><Username>kkkk200928</Username><Timestamp>1360435421768</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-09 13:43:41 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The current $13.65 buyout offer is structured so that stockholders choosing to not cast a vote will be considered a "NO" vote. Above all else, that will be the determining factor casuing the current offer to fail and Dell will remain a public company. Mike Dell tried to do the right thing here, and give stockholders an exit at a nice premium valuation. But if the stockholders don't want to vote for it, and take the deal, Mike Dell is fine with reorganizing Dell as a public company. If and when the stock trades down to $6, $7, $8 per share he can buy more shares at that time. And the stock price will get down that low, because the process of selling off assets, building new business divisions etc... takes time, money, creates uncertainty and some short term bottomline losses. Wall Street doesn't like that, and will sell off the shares for the next few years until Dell can start to gain some traction as a transformed company.</Msg><Username>bashfordcapital</Username><Timestamp>1360439811923</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-09 14:56:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360439836004-49</Id><Topic><Title>Southeastern Asset Management made a mistake</Title><Username>bashfordcapital</Username><Timestamp>1360365924022</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-08 18:25:24 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>bashford.

I was long and I am now out. So I currently have no dog in this fight. However, if it does go significantly higher than the $13.65, I will be shorting it (hedged w/ calls). Here's how I see it: 1) There is no reason for this deal to take place as far as long-term, on-controlling shareholders are concerned. The idea that the BOD is looking out for shareholders is laughable. If this deal is killed, the first order of business should be to oust the entire board since they voted unanimously for this horrible deal. I agree with longs and Southeastern that the BOD is not acting responsibly. I repeat: there is absolutely NO need to take Dell private! The few reasons given in articles are just silly and making stuff up. The stock was already smacked down. If a few more years of the stock being down is the price to pay for a potential turnaround and what could ultimately be strong gains for long-term shareholders - why should they not be allowed to do so? They took the risk and so far have paid the price. This deal pulls the rug out from under them and I can understand anyone who paid a higher price being very upset with this deal. 2) It is illogical for the buyers to suggest that the company is worth only $13.65 today - yet obviously think they will be able to get a solid return on their investment a few years from now. Huh??? lol. You can't have it both ways! If $13.65 will yield a good return for THEM, how could it not for current shareholders? This is why I think the "public stub" option that Southeastern mentions would have been the best way to go. This deal cuts out long-term shareholders from any future potential upside after they have already experienced the downside. That's disgusting. It was fine as long as Michael Dell was pulling out billions from the company, but now that they have sucked it dry they want to take it back from the public? Nuts. 3) This $13.65 offer could very well be a ploy by the buyers to start low and see what happens - but I wouldn't count on it. They might be thinking they'll lowball it at first, and if they can get shareholder approval, it's a great deal. Otherwise, they can come back AFTER and make another offer. But...they could also walk. Don't forget they are taking on significant risk that Dell will be able to execute, macro conditions, etc. Lots of assumptions that may or may not pan out. 4) Dell earnings are coming out soon and they will likely not be great. That will make their lowball offer look better (for the short term). 5) Southeastern can say that Dell is worth whatever they want. It does NOT make it a fact. There is no such thing as intrinsic value. It is subjective - not factual. It is based on many assumptions. I can say my home SHOULD be worth $1 million, but if the market is only willing to pay $400K, I have two choices: either sell at $400K or hold it until the market reappraises. I don't care if someone thinks Dell is worth $100 or $5. At the present time, the offer is $13.65. If it was such a steal at that price, are the other companies and investors of the world so incredibly stupid that they won't make a better offer? Of course not. They would/will step up and bid higher! 6) The deal should never have been allowed to get off the ground and Dell should be executing a turnaround strategy for the future (which it is well on its way of doing). This is not Michael Dell's private company. When he chose to go public, and become fabulously wealthy, he made a choice. He has reaped incredible rewards from going public - and NOW he decides he wants his company back? What a greedy, despicable man. His legacy? Hey Michael - take your legacy and shove it. Your ego versus millions of shareholders??? You pulled billions out of DELL. You OWE the public - not the other way around. A decent man would be doing his best to turn around the company for the benefit of OTHERS (who he took money from) since he made many billions of dollars off of their backs. A good man would feel a sense of obligation to repay the public - he would not be looking out for himself. Honestly, being worth $20 billion isn't enough? What a loathsome creature.</Msg><Username>slickvguy</Username><Timestamp>1360440803396</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-09 15:13:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360440834328-53</Id><Topic><Title>What do you think will happen? from your experience...</Title><Username>kkkk200928</Username><Timestamp>1360435421768</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-09 13:43:41 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>" M.

Heads...enough shareholders vote "yes" and you get the company for $13.65. Tails...the shareholders vote "no" OR someone else makes a bid, etc., and you get to reassess (w/wo a fee, depending on what exactly happens). Ultimately, they might increase the offer, but there is *NO* reason to do it before the shareholders vote UNLESS someone else makes a qualifying bid before that time - which I believe is highly unlikely (is another PE shop or tech company really going to go hostile against Dell and Silverlake? lol. Not a chance). Unless it becomes 100% clear that the shareholder vote will not go their way...they have no reason to not see if the $13.65 will fly. Which is why if the stock trades substantially higher than $13.65 ($14+), it's a good short. If the deal closes, you buy back your shorts at $13.65. If the deal doesn't get approved, the odds are the stock will take a hit at least temporarily - especially if upcoming earnings aren't good.

Huh? Where are you getting this idea from? I've read the documents and it's not how I'm reading it at all. (Though it IS worded strangely). I believe you are wrong. It would be insane for non-votes to be counted as no votes. They would never enter into an agreement like that because they would never be able to get a majority. Trust me - it's a simple majority of "non-Michael Dell" votes that they need. Further, it's likely that they had "friendly hands" buy enough shares before the run-up, to ensure a positive outcome for the buying group. Bottom line: I see $13.65 or no deal and Dell back in the $11's or lower (at least temporarily). I think the odds are strong that they will get the company for $13.65. They know what they are doing.</Msg><Username>slickvguy</Username><Timestamp>1360443827265</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-09 16:03:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360443976764-64</Id><Topic><Title>What do you think will happen? from your experience...</Title><Username>kkkk200928</Username><Timestamp>1360435421768</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-09 13:43:41 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>why do you change your tune so often bashford???.... last night you said the vote WILL pass: "For conversation let's say DELL is a pie of 100 shares. Mike has 16 shares, and we will remove those from the pie, making the voting pie 84 shares.Southeastern has 8 shares, which they are threatening to vote against the merger. Add to that a few other large shareholders who comibned have 8 votes. So, worst case scenario 16 of 84 votes (from significant shareowners)will be NO. But let's add a bunch of passionate little amateurs like fluteman or CTG or mrphile who are sitting at home in t-shirt and jeans, sweating their 500 share positions here. But, because they watched some 15 year old Hollywood movie about Wall Street , they think they know how the game is played. For conversation let's add every little fools share count to the mix and call it 25 NO votes out of 84. Understand, the overwehleming majority of shareowners never cast a vote, And, plenty are very pleased to get $13.65 for their shares, becase that's a lot better price than $10, where DELL traded much of last year. Get the picture now? hope this helps." now you're saying the vote WILL NOT pass: "Considering that nost stockholders never actually vote , this nearly ensures Mike Dell's buyout offer will not be accepted." seriously, make up your mind. you can't have it both ways!</Msg><Username>jj0850</Username><Timestamp>1360443976764</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-09 16:06:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360444158280-65</Id><Title>My two cent of saying</Title><Msg>I believe that Mr. Dell Orchestrated this deal solely, he is too smart and he knows how to put complicated topics to test, that what he is been doing for so many years ,and I believe he knows a head of time the outcome, the deal will consummate by Dell consent.

Thinking that Oracle (or anyone else) will pony up an additional $4 billion or more is not realistic. Why didn't they make a bid previously, e.g. when the stock was at $9, if they were interested? You think Oracle would play a game of chicken w/ MD for $28 billion? heheheheh. C'mon. Get serious. And aside from the price, the idea that they would bang heads with Michael Dell to buy his own company out from under him is just not realistic. Nobody is going to buy Dell w/o Michael Dell being the major player and maintaining control. I think you're looking at it wrong. If, however unlikely, someone else is interested in acquiring Dell (or more likely, a piece of it), it would be to make a superior offer *WITH* Michael Dell's full support and control. But even if that were the case, they would be wise to wait until this plays first. I believe it is HIGHLY unlikely that there will be other bids. Very low probability. However, I believe there ARE some alternatives that might in time be examined by the Special Committee, and could possibly take place instead of this current deal. At least that's more probable, though I still think the odds are strongly against it. The BOD has their backsides covered. They know how to play this game. Sure, they can (and will) be sued - but they won't lose. Why? Because it's subjective as to what is "the best for ALL shareholders". They have no incentive to go against MD. Good luck with that. I'm a bit curious as to why they didn't go to Southeastern and let them in on the privatization. That possibly shows you how confident they are that they have the votes w/o Southeastern. It's not as if they didn't know Southeastern would vote "no" to $13.65. We'll see. Time will tell. It'll be interesting to see what happens. This is a BIG game being played by BIG players. They have all the angles covered. Us little guys don't matter in the least. Bottom line: shareholders have the final say. One share = one vote. This is as it should be. Let the shareholders decide. p.s. "He has lost control?" lol. C'mon. He is in complete control.
