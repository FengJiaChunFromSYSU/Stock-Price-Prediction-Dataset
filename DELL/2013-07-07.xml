I really don't need to know anything else about DELL, as far as I am concerned. I'm a huge fan of Carl Icahn. He's done great things for the performance of TTWO in the past by sticking his toe in the pool over there, and I've made amazing profits in TTWO because of it. If he's willing to take on the amount of risk that he did with his much larger position in DELL, then I am willing to do it with my much smaller position in DELL, too. One thing that I learned a long time ago regarding Wall Street... Always bet with the rich. Always.</Msg><Username>thesavvymonkey777</Username><Timestamp>1373195450365</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-07 07:10:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373205235378-4</Id><Title>Michael Dell</Title><Msg>Much has been said about this SOB.

No worries! Not sure if you have been to Hong Kong before. It runs a "surplus" and has more money in treasury than it knows how to spend. Most of the "money" comes from land sales.
