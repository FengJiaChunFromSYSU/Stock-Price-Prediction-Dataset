I will give u a few things to think about. Dell has been priced for defeat and taken a massive beating this last year. I suggested getting long in 9's and mid 10's... Which I am. (Full disclosure) 1. Dell has been running down inventory from their old model pcs in preparation for windows 8. And yes they have lost a lot of ground in this arena to apple. However they and a few other pc makers have beat apple on one aspect with help from Microsoft. The windows 8 truly enhances our touch sensitive generation. Finally we go to our home 23 inch monitor pc and utilize touch capabilities with apps that will integrate our everyday habit flow of how we use our smartphones and tablets. Imagine all the great things u can do let alone what my young children can do. Educationally this is a great idea. Why do kids know how to use a smartphone at the age of 2 to find the apps or content of what they r desiring. Imagine now letting children access that content of creative freedom on a much larger screen with touch integrated. I am sure u have sen the painting app. Where a kid uses a brush to paint on a big monitor then print out the picture. it will be a new station for learning if u will, a much faster and easier way. I could not put a 2 or 4 year old on Mac or pc right now with a mouse they would click away all over the place. But they do understand how to swipe and find the icon that carries the content they desire. So imagine the apps that are being created right now, for a newer way of learning. Then think from a professional stand point. Imagine the creative freedom u will have in content creation and manipulation. I have done lots of video and photography. And it would be nice to pinch, zoom. Swipe, select up close, Etc... I won't go on but there are a lot of apps would benefit. And now with windows 8 there is an actual ecosystems from the phone, tablet, home pc. Wth software that will give a unified experience. Also Microsoft is spending I believe over 500 million to launch windows 8. Have u noticed when u walk into any AT&amp;T, best buy,etc retailer. Windows 8 is on everything. Now I will point out it is going take some time for people to be trained in how to use it. But we r techno addicts and as the older users will fade out. The younger and newer ones will adapt much faster. Windows 8 is for the next generation... My question to u is have you sampled one out yet with touch? Will dell be the main driver no, but they have made a good choice to get their premiums back into their business model. All their new products have much higher margins which means they can sell fewer but make more. Which will ultimately restate they r not going away, or dieing off. Windos 8 will have to make some adjustments. But a few years ago I called android out as the next big thing and no one believed me... That was when Motorola came out with droid packed with android. It takes some time to follow thru. 2. Dell has a lot of cash on hand. Over net 5.5 billion... Not bad! Or Cash, investments, etc of 11.5 billion. And now pay a dividend. Which will bring in some other value investor institutions. 3. With a 1.70 earnings for next year... A decent multiple of 10 times earnings would value it at $17 a share. For tech that Is a low and considerable. I am not saying like 15 or 20 times earnings. But right now they have been priced for doom. Yet they are going to make a lot of money this next year! There revenues still to above 60 billion next year. 4. micheal dell has a Huge portion of the shares so the total outstanding left is a few hundred million less then stated. He ain't selling. Too prideful. Over 500 millions shares traded hands las t month. I think the wash put has taken place. 5. From a chart perspective momentum is shifting. When a stock drops after earnings from bad news and then reverses higher in the ensuing days,typically that marks a shift in direction. 6. When everyone starts to believe the same thing, it's about to change. Look at rimm.... 6 back to 12 in no time.... 7. They have begun their shift into more than just pc, cloud storage is huge. And data centers are the future for everything. These are just a few to chew on... I am not saying hey go bet the house on it, but there is opportunity here. Be safe in ur investments. Dell is worth looking deeper into. And reading their financials shows a much different picture then fun news stories of Death of pcs... Those articles don't sell well with out exuberance. Positive or negative. Let me know what u think.

Management has done an excellent job with the balance sheet and have built a strong cash position. Management is to investing, as location is to real estate and I believe the management team at DELL is solid and have quietly done a good job in a very fast paced, high stakes industry where innovation can happen overnight and devices become obsolete in a month. They are positioning themselves well in markets that represent solid growth opportunities such as the lucrative IT field (Perot acquisition) and cloud/mobile computing. I also believe that there is a recognition that they will still make good and competitive personal devices that are solid and marketed to certain individuals, but won't waste their time and resources trying to overhaul things to beat google or apple for the hottest mobile device. It is my belief that DELL is taking a page out of IBMs book and to me that is smart. The stock price has positive momentum in the short and long term. Short term, Windows 8 should reignite sales in PCs and PC mobile devices, positive analyst coverage (GS recent upgrade), and the fiscal cliff may in my opinion result in a special dividend. Long term, the investment in service industry and mobile computing (cloud/security) is a good strategy, the good cash position that allows timely acquisitions, and Windows 8 should all make the stock a good one for 2013. Obviously the macro economic environment may influence things, but DELL has the valuation, and management team that can be successful.</Msg><Username>weirdo801</Username><Timestamp>1354689187477</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 01:33:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354716500109-4</Id><Topic><Title>Is a special dividend possible before Dec 31</Title><Username>labman9</Username><Timestamp>1354640287009</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 11:58:07 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>DELL has been diversifying.
