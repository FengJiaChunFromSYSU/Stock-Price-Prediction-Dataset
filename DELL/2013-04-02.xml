The equipment can make cheap and relatively modern computers for the majority of the world that doesn't live like the US and Europe. M Dell could build a new company, but the Dell firm would get that market very quickly and with a reputation. That's why he wants to keep the firm. @gitreelonce There is a report that says that M Dell may really be willing to sell. Short and sweet, just like it hits the Y! Fin homepage in 3 days. I think the only way that I see that is if he says ... fine, if it's worth 150-167% of my bid then I'll sell and get out of the way. That moves the price from $14.24-$15 up to $20-22. idk, just a thought. Remember, if there is a public stub he can approve the deala nd still be the 14% majority holder behind any buyer. What do you think of any of that?</Msg><Username>btv104</Username><Timestamp>1364884786080</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 02:39:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364885178587-2</Id><Topic><Title>Hey Mike Dell, why do you need to stay in control.

If he gets less than the average cost basis and is up by 150% of his bid, then he should call a bluff and pull the trigger at or above $20... $$18 is a contender i think. It's the difference between a CEO or very upset 14% shareholder of a public stub and a guy who once built and held stock in DELL. Kind of makes sense if that valuation should hold, then hey!

If Dell's various business lines were to be offered for sale, there is absloutely no way to acurately predict what buyers might pay. It is nonsense for Southeastern to claim this or that business division is worth X, Y, or Z. The reality is that Southeastern's "analysis" of Dell various divisions might be off by 50% (or more). The only true valuation method is to offer something for sale and see what a buyer will pay. Hope this helps.</Msg><Username>bashfordcapital</Username><Timestamp>1364911171521</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 09:59:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364912115499-10</Id><Topic><Title>DELL Bounce Report</Title><Username>wiliam.keneddy</Username><Timestamp>1363122793646</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 17:13:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>good</Msg><Username>amadeus_miller</Username><Timestamp>1364912115499</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 10:15:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364912187959-11</Id><Topic><Title>IN DEPTH DELL Analyst Report</Title><Username>sergiovialueva</Username><Timestamp>1363016548804</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 11:42:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>nice</Msg><Username>amadeus_miller</Username><Timestamp>1364912187959</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 10:16:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364913025202-12</Id><Topic><Title>Hey Mike Dell, why do you need to stay in control.
