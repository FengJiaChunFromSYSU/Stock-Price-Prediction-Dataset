When Carl starts dismantling Dell piece by piece and the money mysteriously vanishes without a trace (probably into some fund run by Michael Milken). You will then realize how badly Carl has screwed you. Then, just as you start to make a case against him he'll send in his mafia thugs to put the squeeze on you.
