Every strong company has its moment in the lime light. It's called technology boom. Apple and its ipod, iphone, ipads has dominated the market for the last decade. Now the other giants that have been idling would soon come up with a new technology that will exceed Apple. HPQ, IBM, Dell-- all these giants if they remain viable long enough they will come up with something spectacular and exceed expectations. RIMM is a one trick pony, that I can not bet on. You can't go wrong with buying a solid profitting company that has taken hits because of investor's ill perception.</Msg><Username>cameleonman</Username><Timestamp>1349365110795</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 11:38:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349368424889-18</Id><Topic><Title>Bought more today</Title><Username>cameleonman</Username><Timestamp>1349365110795</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 11:38:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Bought more too at low.

What makes you think Dell will win where HPQ failed. Both of them are in dying commodity business with razor thin margin. All the tablets are cannibalizing the laptop. Laptop was replacing the desktop. In the server market, Dell is going up against big boys like Oracle, IBM and even HPQ What is the advantage that Dell has over HPQ. I think investing in companies like Dell is a sure way to lose money.

Here is what he said today: "According to industry experts, customers have withheld PC purchases ahead of the Win 8 launch and hence believe that new launches could charge up the gloomy PC market. However, it will be hard to predict any clear winner as all the key players appear to be playing their cards right. All this notwithstanding, it is a fact that notebooks are being cannibalized by tablets and while Dell will soon be launching a few Ultrabooks, it does not have a tablet business to speak of. With consumers remaining cautious, sales are likely to remain below typical seasonal levels despite drivers like Win 8 and Ultrabooks". DELL has already launched Ultrabooks and does have a Tablet business to speak of, if the analyst did a bit of research or read DELL's website. Folks, hang in there and buy as much as you can at this PPs as Windows 8 will be launched soon and all the folks who are delaying purchases will be glad to buy DELL Ultrabooks and Tablets in a few weeks.

DELL is ready for Windows 8 and also has a tablet business; not only that, DELL is growing in network and software service businesses too. DELL is expanding. Shorts do not want you to know that.</Msg><Username>king_kim_1</Username><Timestamp>1349396348746</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 20:19:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349396847611-43</Id><Topic><Title>Shorts' analyst caught lying about DELL....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1349395836256</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 20:10:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I agree as all it takes is a simple Google search and you would find tons of material on Windows 8 and DELL's Ultrabooks and Tablets. The HP conference call was an excuse to scare the longs and cause a sell off as the shorts ONLY have about 3 weeks before Win 8 is launched. All this stupid talk about the death of PC is another short ploy as even them must use a PC to spread the news of the death of their machine! What a joke.</Msg><Username>longsrboss</Username><Timestamp>1349396847611</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 20:27:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349406750905-44</Id><Title>Short squeeze starting tomorrow....</Title><Msg>All the bad and fake news has played itself out as Zacks , the only sell analyst out of 37, has lowered its target twice in a week from $11 to 10 and then to $9 to take advantage of the HPQ's beating, post CEO's tragic performance. DELL is a much better company than HPQ (Don't get me wrong, HP has great products, but they have had a leadership fiasco for several years) with stable leadership and a plan being executed to diversify its revenue base and that with Windows 8 launch on October 25, we will get the DELL Ultrabooks and Tablets train on their way.</Msg><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1349406750905</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 23:12:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message></Date>
