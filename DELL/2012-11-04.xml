AMBS was up 300% this week alone with news such as this; co founder of Amgen announces he will purchase 1 million shares within the next 10 days, Major University and the Michael J Fox foundation awarded AMBS research grants based on the recent progress towards treating Parkinson's Disease. We added a new board of directors member just this past week hailing from none other than Bristol Myers Squibb, the best news of all came when a independent research report proved the science behind our major drug line works!! This all has combined to really set this stock on fire but it's not to last to get in AMBS still trades for only pennies on the dollar near it's 52 week low. Volume Friday alone was around 47 million shares the float for the company is only 57 million shares that is remarkable! As interest picks up and news spreads this stock should continue to climb to new highs. Good Luck to you no matter what your invested in but add AMBS to your watch list you will not be disappointed!
