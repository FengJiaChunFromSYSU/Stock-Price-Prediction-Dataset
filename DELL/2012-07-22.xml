Well done for a solid service. I want to tell you that I can't compare anyone to them in terms of the daily analysis. For someone like me, who is familiar with technical analysis and has used it for two decades, it is very rare to hear from anyone who will share their analysis like they do. Watch the daily video its free, and maybe it can help you like it has helped me.

Market Cap: 21.0B Enterprise Value: 16.29B Shares outstanding: 1.75B Book value per share: $5.31 Insiders were dumping shares when the price was three times what they were worth. Shuckenbrock dumped millions of shares. Who better knows the value of the company than the COO? That's right, the CFO. They are dumping too.</Msg><Username>runningblackbeardog</Username><Timestamp>1342992096000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-22 17:21:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
