Operated activity was focused on the northern block of Evi during Q1, where LPR drilled eight wells in a single section. All eight wells are now on stream and initial rates indicate no signs of interference between wells. LPR has regulatory approval for up to 16 wells per section in certain sections at Evi and has plans to initiate a pilot of up to 12 wells per section in H2. Notwithstanding certain step-out wells that did not perform as expected, we believe LPR ultimately has the opportunity to double its current 500 well location inventory and surface up to ~$9/share. As well managements guidance For second half of 2012 was for 90$ wit with a differential of 12 meaning they only expected to receive 78$ a barrel for oil vs. The 100$ we are getting today. Wti at 92 Edmonton par wit premium of 7.50$ That is a big deal especially when oil accounts for 70% of rev. At current cap ex and prices we will be fc positive in q3 with 1 rig in evi, I suspect we will add back the second one and ramp up into 2013.....and if we sell off some ng acreage, then add more evi......look out ....this stock came public at the wrong time and forest shouldn't have dividended out the ownership....there is no short interest, no interest, completely unknown which is great for us in at these vast discounts. Time will reprice. The oil is flowing. Liquidity secure with over a 100 million available and that to will expand as banks use higher price decks. No worries on a possible winfall tax from US govt should and when oils spikes. Land in NWT more productive then Barnett Shale, once Ng recoveries LPR is a ATM, spitting out cash. See my research on board. :o)</Msg><Username>jimjones62</Username><Timestamp>1348509372402</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 13:56:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348511264507-8</Id><Topic><Title>DELL WILL MAKE AN OFFER FOR RIMM ANY DAY NOW !!</Title><Username>starcityvideo</Username><Timestamp>1348509204307</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 13:53:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>why not buy Palm frfom HP?</Msg><Username>jwsull</Username><Timestamp>1348511264507</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 14:27:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348514772704-9</Id><Topic><Title>A fresh 2-year low!</Title><Username>coolheadwarmblood</Username><Timestamp>1348497114940</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 10:31:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Agree!</Msg><Username>linfc1</Username><Timestamp>1348514772704</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 15:26:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348515987812-10</Id><Title>aapl buy out 15.00 ashare in cash</Title><Msg>wish list</Msg><Username>ron.wallach</Username><Timestamp>1348515987812</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 15:46:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348517311978-11</Id><Topic><Title>A fresh 2-year low!</Title><Username>coolheadwarmblood</Username><Timestamp>1348497114940</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 10:31:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Agree</Msg><Username>linfc1</Username><Timestamp>1348517311978</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 16:08:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348518911770-12</Id><Topic><Title>aapl buy out 15.00 ashare in cash</Title><Username>ron.wallach</Username><Timestamp>1348515987812</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 15:46:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>why would they buy this dog?</Msg><Username>kenberthiaume123</Username><Timestamp>1348518911770</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 16:35:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348519078431-13</Id><Topic><Title>aapl buy out 15.00 ashare in cash</Title><Username>ron.wallach</Username><Timestamp>1348515987812</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 15:46:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Is Microsoft also interested?</Msg><Username>yysinger</Username><Timestamp>1348519078431</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 16:37:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348519247138-14</Id><Title>Is Microsoft interested in buying DELL?</Title><Msg>Is Microsoft interested in buying DELL?

Seems you forgot to mention that it has multiple law suits against the management for misleading investors. Didn't you think that was important? I saw liquids at 30%, not 70% oil as you stated. I saw G&amp;A more than doubled this past year and interest expense is up by 4 times, yet production was down from a year ago. Sounds like management using this as their piggy-bank and are not very good oilmen. Saw enough to pass on this one.
