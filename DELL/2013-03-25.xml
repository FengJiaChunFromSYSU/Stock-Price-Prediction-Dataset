The news says bidding war, so... Most of this board is WAY shy of right. The $15 Ichan bid is a new floor, so if we aren't at $15 before the bell, something is off. I saw $15.50 and that sound like a good number at open. The thing is that $15 is the FLOOR, so you could see some really pretty fluctuations today and for a while. P.S. I'm not that knowledgeable, but have an MBA and MS Fin (which doesn't mean a ton here imo)</Msg><Username>btv104</Username><Timestamp>1364199910290</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 04:25:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364200525881-5</Id><Topic><Title>Speculation of Monday's DELL opening price due to new bids?</Title><Username>dxzellers</Username><Timestamp>1364141257648</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-24 12:07:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think that either Ichan or Blackstone will bid again at least at the $16 level, and more likely $17, to test Dell's mettle. Dell gets just one final shot to bid or lose his firm, and Microsoft is a known financial backer (can you say deep pockets?). A bid under $17 is not really worth spending your time worrying about, because it will certainly be beat. The question is will we see those $20+ valuations that we heard of in the early stages? The market seems to think that M. Dell's old credit limit (somewhere in the $15-$17 neighborhood) is going to increase. He has close to $10 B in MSD and isn't going to need to use half of that to show that he deserves his new line of credit. just enough to show that he is really keeping skin in the game.</Msg><Username>btv104</Username><Timestamp>1364200525881</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 04:35:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364201230485-6</Id><Topic><Title>Michael Dell to lose CEO job should BX or Icahn bids succeed in winning Dell Inc?</Title><Username>nanganamdar</Username><Timestamp>1364152291784</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-24 15:11:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Do you mean ....

I'm waiting to see what they will do here. They are playing with the idea of joining the Blackstone buyout group. I expect them to wholly roll their stake (not keep a little stub) into, and possibly contribute additional funding to, a reworked bid by Blackstone just barely above Ichan's lightly funded tender offer. Then.... I wouldn't be surprised to hear M Dell come back with something on the order of a $16.5-$17, probably all cash, offer. I'm not sure anyone will but up the $$$$ to contend with that kind of a bid. They'll take the money and run.

Ichan is trying to buy Dell with Dell's own assets. Or, he would like dell to borrow money to pay a dividend, and effectively bankrupt the company. His proposals are absurd and no one with authority will take Ichan seriously. You should try to get your tuition money refunded from the schools which gave you your MBA and MS degrees,. Hope this helps.</Msg><Username>bashfordcapital</Username><Timestamp>1364234836685</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 14:07:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364234855325-37</Id><Title>MF CRIMINAL FINANCIAL TERRORIST CARL ICAHN IS NOW GONE INSANE TO LOOT WITH FRAUD AT LIGHTENING SPEED BEFORE GOING INTO HIS GRAVE NEXT</Title><Msg>Mf criminal financial terrorist carl icahn is now gone insane to loot with fraud at lightening speed before going into his grave next this mf is here to loot with quick pump/dump fraud what the $uck can fix at dell..hardware bust company for the future management and crooks trying to cash out..a dead company future</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1364234855325</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 14:07:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364235155680-38</Id><Topic><Title>DELL Bounce Report</Title><Username>wiliam.keneddy</Username><Timestamp>1363122793646</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 17:13:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>dfhadgf</Msg><Username>vmaxymiliano</Username><Timestamp>1364235155680</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 14:12:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364235326425-39</Id><Topic><Title>IN DEPTH DELL Analyst Report</Title><Username>sergiovialueva</Username><Timestamp>1363016548804</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 11:42:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>sdvdsvds</Msg><Username>vmaxymiliano</Username><Timestamp>1364235326425</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 14:15:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364235430871-40</Id><Topic><Title>Speculation of Monday's DELL opening price due to new bids?</Title><Username>dxzellers</Username><Timestamp>1364141257648</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-24 12:07:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>@bashford IMHO, Both Dell and BX are going nowhere with this bid @14.25 1) M Dell doesn't get his objective of taking DELL private and it gives an option for shareholders to retain ownership of the company and which would continue to remain "publicly traded on the NASDAQ" 2) A completely private transaction will never take place unless the bid is upped to $17 or so, cos the big guys aka SouthEastern and T Rowe need atleast that much to breakeven The option that makes the most sense is for Silverlake/Microsoft to meet up with SouthEastern, T Rowe and Icahn , offer about ~30 billion or so (which is a little more than 17$ per share) and be done with the deal. Any bid 17$ would be a blowout bid and Silverlake doesn't get a second shot at this.

Microsoft has deep pockets and has an interest in doing this deal. SE has an average of 16.88 on their shares....come on, they need to atleast breakeven here.

They are one of the few who can actually do this deal. By the way, the reason blackstone was not interested initially is that MDell is requiring that he ends upwith a majority of the shares. That is why the offer is no higher than it is. There is no way blackstone is going to allow that. Now that MDell is in jeopardy of losing his company and his job, he is now ready to do a deal with blackstone. If you don't know what I am talking about review the actions of Johnson when he was trying to do a deal for RJR with KKR about 20 years ago. KKR recognized that Johnson was a pig and cut him loose . And now blackstone realizes MDell is a pig.

Good, because there is no reason to brag about that. Now, anyone who bought in too late, or at too high of a share price, if the $13.65 buyout offer is not voted affirmative, is at risk of losing a quick 25% to 30% percent per share here. Neither Ichan or Blackstone has offered anywhere close to the solid all cash $13.65 per share which Mike Dell has offered. Ichan is offering nothing except a scheme to borrow money to pay a dividend. this would effectively bankrupt Dell. Blackstone is offering nothing except a scheme to sell off Dell assets to fund a buyout of Dell. This too offers no guarantee to Dell stockholders and is at best a very shady, shaky proposal.
