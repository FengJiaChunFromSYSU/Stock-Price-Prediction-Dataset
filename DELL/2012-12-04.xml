Floor established with over 500 million shares trading hands in the low 9's. then come out with some fuel to get this going. A nice upgrade. Shares spike at opening, those who were down gasp for air and jump out, others who have stop loss get stomped out by end of day since it drops from peak 8% to up 4%... Now back over 10 bigger investor instituions can climb back into this trade.... By the time it reaches 11.00 people's overly doubtful mindset gets stomped out. They cant believe it, surely it will drop back.... Climb to 12 with realization the company is not dieing.... Still has more revenue then Cisco, or google, charts start sporting further break out... See 14 next year.... And low and behold the comeback story is alive and hope and greed run this thing back to 16... With spike higher to dump off what will be almost an 85% gain to the big boys... All that cash on hand don't lie...</Msg><Username>daretorollthedice</Username><Timestamp>1354602277314</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 01:24:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354602818819-2</Id><Topic><Title>Another Goldman SACHS P&amp;D.......DUMP IT</Title><Username>halljohn471</Username><Timestamp>1354574775698</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 17:46:15 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's been selling off for a year...this boat is going higher.... And the best part about dragging it out for so long is that u get used to calling it a loser, that u r emotionally involved now. Which is why u are here to make sure it keeps going down cuz that is the mindset u have. Follow the least line of resistance... I do hope u made money on the short though. It's moved almost 2 dollars in 2 weeks.... Keep an eye out.</Msg><Username>daretorollthedice</Username><Timestamp>1354602818819</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 01:33:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354623896208-3</Id><Topic><Title>Another Goldman SACHS P&amp;D.......DUMP IT</Title><Username>halljohn471</Username><Timestamp>1354574775698</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 17:46:15 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Bought the Dec 10 Put yesterday morning.

You wrote, "comeback." Comeback from what? What new and exciting thing is it doing that would excite an investor to say, Wow, they are really going back? Sell me the Comeback Story? What you gave above is nothing, give me something to chew on? Are they developing a new kind of smartphone or ipad that will revolutionize the industry? Are they developing technology that you are able to plug in to your head the computer, so you can have any kind of information without even typing? "If you think it, it will come" - kind of thing. What's HOT and interesting, that also can sell? Give it to me!</Msg><Username>bananas500</Username><Timestamp>1354648745239</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 14:19:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354648804862-12</Id><Topic><Title>Keep confined and unapproachable In Your Dell Inc. profits</Title><Username>marjorie.carrillo45</Username><Timestamp>1353943601727</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-26 10:26:41 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>thanks</Msg><Username>harry_palmore</Username><Timestamp>1354648804862</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 14:20:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354649239803-13</Id><Topic><Title>Is a special dividend possible before Dec 31</Title><Username>labman9</Username><Timestamp>1354640287009</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 11:58:07 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You would have to have enough shares in DELL to be worth it. Most people don't have thousands or millions of shares, especially in a dying company like DELL. A "special dividend" is not the answer and irrelevant. DELL needs a game changer, but doesn't everyone want a game changer? Not everyone has a Steve Jobs hanging around and he's dead. DELL is in a death spiral and in 5 years, they won't be around, unless something changes. I am not trying to be a jerk, but isn't it obvious, I'm no friggin genius either.</Msg><Username>bananas500</Username><Timestamp>1354649239803</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 14:27:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
