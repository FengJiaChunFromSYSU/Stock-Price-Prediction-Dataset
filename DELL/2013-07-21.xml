Icahn will pick Dell to run company.</Title><Msg>As said before if you put all the future dividends in the present value, DELL is worth $300. However, I think the plan might be for Icahn to take control and then all the "weak" money sell out for $14 per share. Then Dell, Icahn, and myself will have a company with a p/e of 1. Where all the debt will fade away with inflation and the interest tax deductible. Hoping for $50 in 3 years. Dell will run the company as before just with a much higher share percentage. Icahn will fire all the dead weight on the board.</Msg><Username>billberggren</Username><Timestamp>1374465343202</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-21 23:55:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
