Dell Ichan is going to submit his financing and his bid will be official. The first price to change is likely Blackstone with similar offer for more of the firm.. a less risky proposal. if M Dell bids again, ther is at most one other bidder in the room. He gets only one more shot. Not taking it next week and not at $15.</Msg><Username>btv104</Username><Timestamp>1365302247495</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 22:37:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365302739366-12</Id><Topic><Title>Options Question</Title><Username>danstock2012</Username><Timestamp>1364933093319</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 16:04:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You can sell them with the stub, but you need to cover, or essentially buy back the shares you need. In that light, this is interesting, because anyone on the sell side of a call who sold to use their capital while the deal clears approval and settle will be in the market for a much smaller pool of public shares when the option is due... if past the deal date.</Msg><Username>btv104</Username><Timestamp>1365302739366</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 22:45:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365302847025-13</Id><Topic><Title>Options Question</Title><Username>danstock2012</Username><Timestamp>1364933093319</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 16:04:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The owner of the call shouldn't allow the wait though, nomatter the term. they will be exercised before the deal settlement date.
