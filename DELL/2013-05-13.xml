The market is valuing Skullcandy at only 2.6 times EV/EBITDA. Compared to its peers including Harman International Industries (NYSE: HAR) and Sony (NYSE: SNE), Skullcandy has the cheapest valuation. Harman, at $44 per share, is worth more than $3 billion on the market. It has the most expensive valuation at 6.6 times EV/EBITDA. Sony isthe biggest company among the three, with nearly $15.7 billion in the total market cap. At around $16 per share, Sony is valued at nearly 4.4 times EV/EBITDA. Interestingly, Skullcandy generated the highest operating margin at 14%, while the operating margins of Harman and Sony were 7% and 0.5%, respectively. Skullcandy delivered quite a high return on capital among the three at around 40%. The return on capital of Harman was 40.6% while Sony generated net losses. Among the three, Sony has the highest forward dividend yield of 1.9% while Harman pays to existing shareholders a 1.4% forward dividend yield. Skullcandy does not pay any dividends to shareholders. In the first quarter of 2013, the company expected to generate a loss between $0.25 to $0.30 per share. Interim CEO Rick Alden admitted: “We have not kept up with all the changing trends nor have we led with our own innovations.” Indeed, I would expect the similar downtrend in the short-term for the company, indicating by the wider divergence between its operating cash flow and its net income.</Msg><Username>dariodbest</Username><Timestamp>1368464811082</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 13:06:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368468414433-6</Id><Topic><Title>HP will come in to buy Dell</Title><Username>adamwangwang47</Username><Timestamp>1368463000384</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 12:36:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>THEY HAVE NOT DONE TO MUCH OF ANYTHING</Msg><Username>a.hudkins</Username><Timestamp>1368468414433</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 14:06:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368469036541-7</Id><Title>DELL</Title><Msg>Dell should be at least 17.00 a share for any deal know matter who buys this company???</Msg><Username>a.hudkins</Username><Timestamp>1368469036541</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 14:17:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368469209163-8</Id><Title>Have you checked out MISM</Title><Msg>MISM looks like the only legit company on the entire OTC.
