Sure, they wanted to spend as little as necessary, but that gets to be a problem when you're the head of a publicly held company and have a legal fiduciary responsibility to provide the most value to shareholders. That position gets even stickier when there have been major allegations that a CEO and his management team had used accounting fraud to make the company look as though it were doing better than it was. The Securities and Exchange Commission made that claim a few years ago, charging Dell the company and its senior executives, including Michael Dell, with "failing to disclose material information to investors and using fraudulent accounting to make it falsely appear that the company was consistently meeting Wall Street earnings targets and reducing its operating expenses." Most reports on Dell have long stopped mentioning this problem, as the company paid $100 million and its CEO, $4 million, to settle the complaint. But investors, particularly big ones, like Carl Icahn, probably haven't forgotten.</Msg><Username>johndeansmith</Username><Timestamp>1374236219935</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 08:16:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374240245953-2</Id><Topic><Title>Dell investors: Feeling cheated</Title><Username>johndeansmith</Username><Timestamp>1374236219935</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 08:16:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>johnny, wow, undervalue at $13.65 so you think.

It is difficult to infer his guiding valuation theory. Investor sentiment is sometimes an important contrarian indicator for him. When he sees most investors leaning one way, he advises to go the other way. He sometimes anchors on historical analogies (samples of one), such as: “it’s ’91 all over again” or “I’m placing my bets for 2004 strictly using 1994′s tip sheet.” He is prone more to headline hyperbole than equivocation. For example, from 1/21/01: “This is the lowest-risk, highest-reward environment possible.” And from 3/24/03: “…the risks of owning stocks are as high as I have ever seen them, and the rewards the least certain.”</Msg><Username>johndeansmith</Username><Timestamp>1374244071941</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 10:27:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374244157418-5</Id><Topic><Title>Cramer lambasts both Dell and Icahn on Sqwack Box this morning....</Title><Username>rogerjames55346</Username><Timestamp>1374243309031</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 10:15:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Carl Icahn is worth $20 BILLION. i trust his opinion over Crammer's.</Msg><Username>johndeansmith</Username><Timestamp>1374244157418</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 10:29:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374245242249-6</Id><Topic><Title>Cramer lambasts both Dell and Icahn on Sqwack Box this morning....</Title><Username>rogerjames55346</Username><Timestamp>1374243309031</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 10:15:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A year ago the stock was trading within $1 of the current price.
