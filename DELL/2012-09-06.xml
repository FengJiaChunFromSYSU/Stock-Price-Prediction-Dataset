Won't it be wise for small to medium investors to sell DELL and buy GDOT whose PEG ratio is just about 0.40, which is just 1/3rd that of DELL ... The 09/05 upgrade of GDOT by Piper Jaffray from Neutral to Overweight could just be the beginning of a monster run up ... Could GDOT be closing above $20/share or above $25/share by end of this year ...</Msg><Username>delphioracle2009</Username><Timestamp>1346935116542</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 08:38:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346953633808-4</Id><Title>selling pressure</Title><Msg>Is this an indication that Dell is doomed?
