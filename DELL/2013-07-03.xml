It's been months and no other bidder emerged to beat, or even match Mike's curent $13.65 offer. I hope the offer does not get enough yes.votes. This would mean DELL stock would trade back down to the $8.50 to $9 per share price range. This would give investors and traders an opportunity to buy DELL stock at a reasonable price instead of the current overinflated $13 price. Once the stock settle in at $9 or so, Mike Dell will have the opportunity to present a new offer of $11 to $12 per share. In summary, everybody wins except the people who bought in too late, at too high per share prices. Let Southeastern and Ichan lose money here, it's their own fault for paying too much. Hope this helps.</Msg><Username>bashfordcapital</Username><Timestamp>1372889561695</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 18:12:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372896946879-11</Id><Title>The reality of the Dell situation</Title><Msg>Neither Michael Dell nor Carl Ichan can outright buy Dell Computer..

He'll then later either dissect the company piece by piece and sell it off (probably into something associated with his original partner and long time pal Michael Milken) or some other scam where he has agreements setup that he alone can profit on. Or do what he did in the BB case in somehow managing to push through a 363 despite countless objections for a value which was substantially lower than book. Hence he pulled some scam with Ergen to make himself good since there is no way he would do that otherwise. I'll say it again, letting Carlito have the company will be one of the sorriest mistakes you could make.</Msg><Username>susan.mcan</Username><Timestamp>1372901986593</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 21:39:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372902939814-14</Id><Title>And of course...</Title><Msg>... how could I not mention the sob story he'll pull in any legal arena to get sympathy from the courts which will probably center on things like, if you don't do it my way all these jobs will be lost placing a judge or whoever is in an authoritative position needing to pick between the lesser of two evils. But guess what, it doesn't matter because both evils will eventually come to fruition. BB under Dish purchase were supposedly to keep a certain number of stores open maintaining jobs and benefits. It didn't take too long after the deal was done to start slamming the doors in fire sale like fashion. Send Carlito packing! Any plan involving him is leaving you out.</Msg><Username>susan.mcan</Username><Timestamp>1372902939814</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 21:55:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
