Oct 22, 2012 12:36 PM Can we Trust President Barack Obama as Commander and Chief? Here is a fact, Bill Plante of CBS News reports on Obama telling Russian President Medvedev that he will work on the missile defense system with Russia after the election (March 26, 2012). ( Obama failed to turn off his microphone and this Russian message was picked up ) Lied about 911 Libya Attack - No Barack Obama Trust a Huge Problem in his Campaign Going Forward - No More people saying! One latest poll shows that many young men, women and Veterans do not trust President Barack Obama any longer. Mitt Romney today has an overwhelming support of married women with children and many young women, young men and Veterans of all ages are switching to support Mitt Romney for President of the United States of America. Tonight, the two candidates will share a stage for the last time. The race could not be closer: On Sunday, a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll indicated that the candidates tied, each with 47 percent of likely voters. Before the debates began, Obama led the same poll by 3points. In this debate, Obama could face the opposite of the situation many envisioned weeks before. Instead of lending him credibility, his commander-in-chief role could make him more vulnerable, opening Obama to questions about a range of unresolved crises. Romney is likely to renew criticism of the Obama administration’s reaction to a Sept. 11 attack that killed four Americans at a mission in Benghazi, Libya. And Obama is also likely to face questions about the civil war in Syria, a recent assassination in Lebanon and possible signals that Iran may be willing to bargain over the future of its nuclear program. A White House official on Saturday denied a New York Times report that said the United States and Iran had agreed in principle to hold one-on-one talks about that program. The report said Iran wanted to wait until after the election for talks to begin. “It’s not true that the United States and Iran have agreed to one-on-one talks or any meeting after the American elections,” White House spokesman Tommy Vietor said in a written statement. The Reuters news service reported that Iran also had denied the report. Foreign-policy questions played a significant role in the last presidential debate, held last Tuesday in Long Island, N.Y. Romney was caught flat-footed with an overly broad statement that Obama had taken two weeks to label the attack in Benghazi an “act of terror.” Romney was corrected by moderator Candy Crowley: Although Obama did not directly call the attack terrorism the next day, he did say that the U.S. will not retreat from “acts of terror.” Since then, Romney has said little about Libya on the campaign trail. Advisers, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal-campaign thinking, said Romney deliberately turned his focus away from Libya and toward the domestic economy and gas prices following the last debate. His arguments on those issues had polled well among viewers last week, the advisers said. But Libya is almost certain to come up again tonight.</Msg><Username>obama_whisper_russia</Username><Timestamp>1350938571784</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 16:42:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350939029114-15</Id><Topic><Title>Looks like dell is headedd to mid $8's</Title><Username>use.caution</Username><Timestamp>1350924984911</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 12:56:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That is, or just below, my entry point as well.
