I won't tell you to sell your house to buy a stock. Investment is an art in life. It should be a balanced approach based on your own criteria. Though I see Dell as having the most compelling risk/reward ratio in the universe where we live, my portfolio still stretches boardly across different industry segments. I buy pharmaceutical, as well as biotech too. Like someone said in an interview at CNBC days ago, it is crazy not to be on equity. Dividends, PE Ratio, Cash Assets, Cash flows, all these point to a significantly higher market ahead. Stock prices have to appropriately truly reflect all these magnificient elements. The stock market is still fundammentally considerably undervalued as a whole. And there are some stocks, like Dell, that will even outperform this up and coming rising market. Happy Thanksgiving And Smart And Confident Investing!</Msg><Username>value_oriented_123</Username><Timestamp>1353652559524</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 01:35:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353682274768-3</Id><Topic><Title>Swing-trading Long Dell Inc.

Nice free-cash flow, debt ratio is great, Windows 8 as a catalyst + new blade servers. I love this company at such low P/E. Discounted Cash Flow show great upside potential.</Msg><Username>jorgequincocesbaz</Username><Timestamp>1353682274768</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 09:51:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353684322979-4</Id><Topic><Title>Strong Bay!</Title><Username>by_and_hold</Username><Timestamp>1353430524883</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 11:55:24 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The best investment ever!</Msg><Username>by_and_hold</Username><Timestamp>1353684322979</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 10:25:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353689365386-5</Id><Title>SELL SELL SELL SELL</Title><Msg>Beware, HUGE SELL is coming.
