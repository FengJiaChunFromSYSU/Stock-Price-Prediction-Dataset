You see moron the price you see on the stock exchange is only for a small amount of shares. If Dell tried to buy the company by making buys on the exchange, the price would skyrocket to $50. Thus they manipulate the price down, hire people to bad mouth the stock, so they can get it cheap, while you take the losses. Sorry to be blunt, the SEC should not allow any company to be taken private with less that 90% of the vote and that is how it works in the corrupt USA.</Msg><Username>billberggren</Username><Timestamp>1374465831632</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-22 00:03:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374489154434-2</Id><Title>Ready to Breakout Past Resistance and Explode Higher!</Title><Msg>CCUR is a coiled up spring ready to explode. Over the past six months, CCUR has reached higher lows/bottoms of $5.87 in January, $6.23 in April, $6.51 in May, $6.88 in early-June, $7.10 in late-June, $7.34 in early-July, and $7.42 in late-July. However, CCUR has been unable to break through its early-February high of $8.45 despite numerous attempts. After CCUR breaks $8.45 it will likely explode into the $13-$15 per share range! CCUR recently reported 3Q 2013 GAAP EPS of $0.11 up 175% from 3Q 2012 GAAP EPS of $0.04. CCUR's 4Q results should be extremely strong when CCUR releases their fiscal 2013 10-K filing next month, as CCUR is expected to begin reporting major revenues from their HUGE new deal with the largest UK cable TV operator Virgin Media! If CCUR reports 4Q 2013 GAAP EPS of $0.11 (even with their 3Q), it will be up 450% from 4Q 2012 GAAP EPS of $0.02, and CCUR will finish 2013 with full year GAAP EPS of $0.33 vs. their fiscal year 2012 GAAP EPS loss of ($0.34), for an UNBELIEVABLE turnaround! If CCUR finishes with fiscal 2013 GAAP EPS of $0.33, it will likely equal fiscal 2013 non-GAAP EPS of $0.52. This will give CCUR higher trailing non-GAAP EPS than its two closest rivals SEAC, which has trailing non-GAAP EPS of $0.44 - and HLIT, which has trailing non-GAAP EPS of $0.21. Both SEAC and HLIT hit new 52-week highs last week and CCUR is now way overdue to breakout above $8.45 and explode into double digits! CCUR deserves to soon be trading for well above SEAC's share price of $12.32 and for more than double HLIT's share price of $6.99! CCUR has no downside here at $7.78, especially with its dividend yield of 6.2% - the highest out of all profitable, debt-free, NASDAQ technology stocks!</Msg><Username>jowslir632</Username><Timestamp>1374489154434</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-22 06:32:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
