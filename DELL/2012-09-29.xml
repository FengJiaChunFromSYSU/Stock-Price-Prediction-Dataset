Big companies rarely disappear or die overnight, but tech companies that can’t keep up with the times often become things of the past. If Dell can’t find a way to succeed in a market driven by Apple, then it’s going to find itself falling down the same road RIM is on and Nokia is desperately trying to escape from. Dell needs to show off some kickass devices or its days may be numbered.

Also we have nearly $15 billion in cash and short/long term investments, and that we should be trading at much higher levels, with a good dividend that is going to be increased and a decent EPS this year. Europe's economy has bottomed and we will see better revenues going forward. Also European parliament would make Cloud Computing viable that would do wonders for the sector.</Msg><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1348963945316</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 20:12:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348969838508-7</Id><Topic><Title>Dell has $5.3 billion share repurchase program as of August 31/2012 (Source 10-Q)</Title><Username>longsrboss</Username><Timestamp>1348962726221</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 19:52:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Your points on Europe are valid as the current doom and gloom with Intel and the PC makers are at the bottom of the cycle and with any increased activity there, we should see better days ahead. Also Dell is busy re-shaping its revenue mix by acquistions as it completed the takeover of Quest on Friday as well. Finally, Friday was also the end of the month and the Q3 and many funds were rebalancing their portfolios and barring any major political fiasco, we should ease up above $10 on Monday and let's hope the share buyback team is going to do what it must.</Msg><Username>longsrboss</Username><Timestamp>1348969838508</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 21:50:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message></Date>
