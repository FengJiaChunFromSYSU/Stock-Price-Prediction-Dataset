It is the same firms, weeks after week, month after month, filing suit for any public company merger or acquisition. Whether the buyout price is a takeunder, 10% , 50%, or 100% premium doesn't matter, the lawsuits will still be filed. It is a way for law firms to collect some shared fees, paid by insurance companies. As a shareholder, to participate you will have to sign some documents, and provide a notarized statement declaring how many shares you own. The lawyer you speak to will readily admit this process is not about trying to increase the buyout price. Telephone any one of the law firms and you will get confirmation of what I am posting here. Hope this helps.</Msg><Username>bashfordcapital</Username><Timestamp>1360247643213</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-07 09:34:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360250009080-12</Id><Title>sucks this no rally to 1500</Title><Msg>sucks</Msg><Username>ron.wallach</Username><Timestamp>1360250009080</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-07 10:13:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360251354810-13</Id><Title>Yield Starved Buyers Paying $13.52 to Get $13.65 in 6 Months</Title><Msg>For a great 13 cent profit.</Msg><Username>debbie_downer_does_dallas</Username><Timestamp>1360251354810</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-07 10:35:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360252648000-14</Id><Topic><Title>Yield Starved Buyers Paying $13.52 to Get $13.65 in 6 Months</Title><Username>debbie_downer_does_dallas</Username><Timestamp>1360251354810</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-07 10:35:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>My portfolio died of YieldStarvation, and it was so young!</Msg><Username>fattymcbutterpants2001</Username><Timestamp>1360252648000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-07 10:57:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360252698018-15</Id><Topic><Title>Yield Starved Buyers Paying $13.52 to Get $13.65 in 6 Months</Title><Username>debbie_downer_does_dallas</Username><Timestamp>1360251354810</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-07 10:35:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>They are not buying for the .13 profit.

The claim was to go after higher margin product sales and leave the lower margin stuff to Lenovo and other "White Box" suppliers. Their shares of total industry PC sales has diminished, in large part because of the decision not to compete with less capable PC units. As a consequence, Revenue related to PC sales has suffered immensely. DELL share price has declined in kind. The convenience of PC sales/revenue decline, share price decline, and now a low ball buyout offer sure is a mystery in my view. How that timing, benefited the PE buyout group seems rather questionable at this stage. Apparently, the buyout consideration has been active since as far back as August 2012, and quite possibly sometime even prior to August. I'm not making any specific claim of foul, from DELL the person, or DELL Management/BOD, PE guys, etcetera but sometimes connecting the dots offer clarity in the operations decision process. Just a coincidence?

Southeastern has privately told the company that it is "disturbed" by a $13.65 per share offer for the third-largest PC maker by a consortium led by founder and CEO Michael Dell, and instead believes Dell is worth $20 per share, the sources said on Thursday. The Memphis, Tennessee-based fund, which owns a 7.5 percent stake in Dell, did not return calls seeking comment. Southeastern has not commented publicly since the deal was announced on Tuesday, but Chief Executive Mason Hawkins said in a Sept. 30 filing that the fund believed the company's shares were worth in the "low 20s" even if Dell's personal computing business was valued at nothing. A representative for the buyout consortium, which also includes private equity firm Silver Lake Partners and Microsoft Corp, declined to comment. Dell was not available for comment. The sources said the buyout consortium has no plans to raise its current bid. The buyers are counting on the shareholders eventually realizing that no better options exist for Dell than their current offer, they said. Southeastern's reservations could create new uncertainty about the deal. Over the past few days, some other Dell shareholders have indicated they will vote against the deal. Further complicating the largest leveraged buyout since the financial crisis is the influx into Dell shares in recent weeks by event-driven funds and risk arbitrage investors. Such investors now own roughly 20 percent of company, according to investor estimates, and could bet on a higher offer. "Let the fools sell low - don't make us all fools," said Nick Tompras, president of Alpine Capital Research in St Louis. Tompras said his firm would vote its 2 million Dell shares against the deal. Schneider Capital Management in Wayne, Pennsylvania, which owned almost 350,000 Dell shares at the end of September, will also vote against the deal, President Arnie Schneider said. Southeastern stands to be among the biggest losers if the deal is completed at the current price. Sanford Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi estimated Southeastern paid an average of more $20 a share for its stake, meaning a loss of at least $825 million at the current $13.65 offer price. Hawkins, a 40-year veteran of the money management business who has agitated against companies in the past, could take his objections public. Last year, Hawkins applauded the board of embattled gas producer Chesapeake Energy Corp for stripping CEO Aubrey McClendon of his title as chairman after revelations by Reuters that McClendon's personal dealings might be in conflict with the company's interests. A few days later, Hawkins sent a letter urging the board to consider selling the company in the wake of a stock plunge caused by the reports. McClendon resigned this year. Hawkins also agitated against troubled Japanese medical device company Olympus Corp in 2011, after disclosures of a massive accounting scandal, eventually calling for key members of the company's board to resign or be replaced.</Msg><Username>jaykam10</Username><Timestamp>1360293070055</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-07 22:11:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360294234710-80</Id><Topic><Title>Dell</Title><Username>stinknutsballs</Username><Timestamp>1360291724455</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-07 21:48:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>'Southeastern Asset Management, one of Dell‘s (DELL) prominent shareholders, has told the company that the proposed leveraged buyout at $13.65, undervalues the stock, which is probably worth more like $20, according to the firm, Reuters reports.

DELL has bought billions of dollars worth of diversifying businesses in the past few years and those chickens have not yet come home to roost. Michael Dell well knows this--and what those companies will be worth some day. Unfortunately, shareholders do NOT and they are too focused on quarterly earnings. Michael has a 5-year horizon for getting his new cash machine working while DELL's public shareholders are thinking about the next 3-month period--and SEVERELY undervaluing DELL stock in the process. This is one of those times when "the market" is WRONG. Michael Dell knows this and is taking the opportunity to strike. He's putting up his stock--that which the public has devalued--but only $700MM of his own cash (when he has BILLIONS!) and yet he will retain control of the "new" private enterprise, using OPM (other people's money) to do the deal. Michael is BRILLIANT!!! For my part, I cannot understand why Microsoft doesn't buy 100% of DELL. It's got the cash to do this on its own! Instead, it's bankrolling the buyout with a $2-3 BLN LOAN. Please remember: YOU shareholders OWN Dell Computer right now, NOT Michael Dell. You do NOT have to accept Michael's low-ball buyout offer for this company. Please do NOT accept it. Hold on to this gem until a fair price is offered for it.
