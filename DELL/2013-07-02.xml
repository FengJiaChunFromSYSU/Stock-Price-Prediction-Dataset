You were too smart and didn't take the advice of all the experts. Your company would be worth $15 billion more right now if you had bought Brocade instead of all that junk you bought instead for over $6 billion. Dell would be the only real rival to Cisco now, but you were too stupid to see with an ego too big. You could have bought Brocade for $4 billion, the only thing that could have saved you from losing your company to someone like Carl Icahn, but you were convinced you could reinvent within Dell, what Brocade is, piece by piece instead of a turn-key operation and asset. How dumb can one person be? Say good bye to your legacy Mr Dell. For you and your ego gave it away.</Msg><Username>shelly_is_here</Username><Timestamp>1372798702736</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 16:58:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372801591603-13</Id><Title>VOTE YOUR PROXIE TO SOUTHEASTERN</Title><Msg>Let Carl see if he can do a job that the board and Michael Dell couldn't.</Msg><Username>jayhawk2134</Username><Timestamp>1372801591603</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 17:46:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372803103284-14</Id><Topic><Title>VOTE YOUR PROXIE TO SOUTHEASTERN</Title><Username>jayhawk2134</Username><Timestamp>1372801591603</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 17:46:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>i voted with Icahn and AGAINST Michael Dell.</Msg><Username>johndeansmith</Username><Timestamp>1372803103284</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 18:11:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372807939736-15</Id><Title>Letting Carlito Icahn take control of the company is a lose/lose scenario all around.</Title><Msg>Geesh, it doesn't take much in terms of looking at this guys history to see what happens.
