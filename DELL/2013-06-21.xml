But he thinks a low ball offer and sympathy for his lack of funds, should convince all shareholders to just give it over at chump change levels. Hey Mike think about closer to $31.5 billion and you can have it all with no problem. Actually the premise that Icahn puts forward for the company to by back over half the shares sounds good to me.</Msg><Username>shelly_is_here</Username><Timestamp>1371830086675</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-21 11:54:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371831543924-5</Id><Topic><Title>Why is M.

Dell has been open to other buyout offers for a few months now and no buyer has emerged with a better offer than $13.65. If $13.65 does not receive enough YES votes then DELL stock will likely trade $7.50 to $8.50 per share and at that time Mike could make a $9.50 to $10 per share buyout offer. Hope this helps.</Msg><Username>bashfordcapital</Username><Timestamp>1371831543924</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-21 12:19:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371831673249-6</Id><Topic><Title>Dell and the board have been have been lowballing from the start.</Title><Username>suggp</Username><Timestamp>1371591803509</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-18 17:43:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Lowball? No other buyer has come forth to even match Mike Dell's $13.65 offer. If anything Mike Dell's $13.65 offer is a high price, not a "lowball" price.

The $5.2 billion is split between a $2.2 billion six-year term loan B-1 and a $3 billion three-year term loan B-2. The six-year tranche will have standard 1 percent amortization, while the shorter-dated tranche amortizes at 10 percent. Icahn was not immediately available for comment. As previously reported, initial price guidance in May was in the LIB+350 area, subject to change due to market conditions. Earlier this week, Icahn reiterated his interest in owning Dell, saying in a telephone interview with Thomson Reuters LPC on Tuesday that he was moving forward with his plans to line up $5.2 billion in credit facilities. His comments echoed statements he made earlier that day in an open letter to Dell shareholders. "Nothing has changed regarding the financing," Icahn said in the interview. "We expect to have $5.2 billion in the next couple of weeks. Our investment bank is already committing $1.6 billion and my affiliates and I would provide $2 billion, if necessary."</Msg><Username>alba95</Username><Timestamp>1371856926809</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-21 19:22:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371866312202-11</Id><Topic><Title>Dell and the board have been have been lowballing from the start.</Title><Username>suggp</Username><Timestamp>1371591803509</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-18 17:43:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>suggp, Try to understand, company management job is to manage sales revenues and profitability. All factors considered, Mike Dell has done an excellent job of building DELL into the giant company it is today. Is it a "growth stock" like it was 20 years ago? No. If you are looking for high flying stocks try some micro cap companies, which offer high risk, high reward. Hope this helps.</Msg><Username>bashfordcapital</Username><Timestamp>1371866312202</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-21 21:58:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371867107724-12</Id><Topic><Title>Dell and the board have been have been lowballing from the start.</Title><Username>suggp</Username><Timestamp>1371591803509</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-18 17:43:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>add it up 20.9 billion offer by Dell. they keep the 10.9 billion in cash. Makes them pay 9.3 billion for a company that grossed 12 billion dollars last year. Wonder how long it would take to pay off the cost.. Then they can offer a IPO at 20 times earnings which would be slightly more than 60 billion. All they gotta do is talk the shareholders into take a stupid offer</Msg><Username>jayhawk2134</Username><Timestamp>1371867107724</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-21 22:11:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371867202877-13</Id><Title>Carl Ichan will end up owning this company and i am all for it.</Title><Msg>Time to make a change at dell....................................................</Msg><Username>jayhawk2134</Username><Timestamp>1371867202877</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-21 22:13:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
