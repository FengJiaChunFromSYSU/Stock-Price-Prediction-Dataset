CCUR will be powering VMED's new Virgin TV Anywhere platform that will deliver on demand video content to smartphones and tablets. CCUR is breaking out big and about to explode.

CCUR's #1 competitor Seachange (SEAC) just broke $12 and hit a new 52-week high of $12.10 and now trades with an enterprise value/revenue ratio of 1.93, which would value CCUR at $15.80 per share!

Icahn might stay around and match the higher price as he proposed buying only up to 58% of the outstanding stock with the rest keeping their shares. That would be a more popular option for the funds that think it is worth north of $20, including Icahn who has stated he thinks it is worth $22.60. They could stick around. The worst thing that could happen is that BX and CI join forces and bid $14.25 with the option for cash or stock with no counterbid from Silverlake. Whether the stock could get up to $20 on its own in the future after BX and CI drain the cash, load up the debt, and sell of DFS is anyone's guess.</Msg><Username>redgem264</Username><Timestamp>1364326791324</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 15:39:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364328248557-22</Id><Topic><Title>DELL Bounce Report</Title><Username>wiliam.keneddy</Username><Timestamp>1363122793646</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 17:13:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>good</Msg><Username>dereckrymm</Username><Timestamp>1364328248557</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 16:04:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364329431564-23</Id><Title>Record date is 4/1/2013, when is the ex-dividend date</Title><Msg>yahoo says 3/27/2013, but I think it should be 3/28/2013</Msg><Username>value_oriented_123</Username><Timestamp>1364329431564</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 16:23:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364329841905-24</Id><Title>If I buy tomorrow, do I still get the 8 cents dividend</Title><Msg>I am quite confused.</Msg><Username>value_oriented_123</Username><Timestamp>1364329841905</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 16:30:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364330249797-25</Id><Topic><Title>Record date is 4/1/2013, when is the ex-dividend date</Title><Username>value_oriented_123</Username><Timestamp>1364329431564</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 16:23:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>my TD account says it's the 27th.</Msg><Username>mdn0403</Username><Timestamp>1364330249797</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 16:37:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364330732782-26</Id><Topic><Title>Carl Icahn</Title><Username>superdividenz</Username><Timestamp>1364303174926</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 09:06:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The only question I have when I read on of bashford's posts is if he is down 15 percent on a firm14.50 bid since he started selling short, or if he is trying to buy as many shares for as cheap as possible and leaving a negative sentiment...

Blackstone would have had a change to sniff at the books of Dell and use that info for other transactions.</Msg><Username>sulur</Username><Timestamp>1364338035454</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 18:47:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364338369580-37</Id><Topic><Title>Michael Dell/SL can offer %15.65 all cash offer - and complete the LBO</Title><Username>sulur</Username><Timestamp>1364338035454</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 18:47:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If the board ups their bid by two dollars then they are all but admitting they were trying to skin the stockholders , who they were supposed to be representing, which should help the lawsuits already against them.</Msg><Username>jayhawk2134</Username><Timestamp>1364338369580</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 18:52:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364338676884-38</Id><Topic><Title>DELL Bounce Report</Title><Username>wiliam.keneddy</Username><Timestamp>1363122793646</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 17:13:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>gfjfgj</Msg><Username>roland_east</Username><Timestamp>1364338676884</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 18:57:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364338713172-39</Id><Topic><Title>IN DEPTH DELL Analyst Report</Title><Username>sergiovialueva</Username><Timestamp>1363016548804</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 11:42:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ghjhgjgh</Msg><Username>roland_east</Username><Timestamp>1364338713172</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 18:58:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364338775863-40</Id><Topic><Title>Michael Dell/SL can offer %15.65 all cash offer - and complete the LBO</Title><Username>sulur</Username><Timestamp>1364338035454</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 18:47:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Which is probably why I think Microsoft will step in with their deep pockets...maybe then Dell/SL can point at MS and say that they were the X-factor behind upping the bid</Msg><Username>gaptun</Username><Timestamp>1364338775863</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 18:59:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364339414085-41</Id><Topic><Title>Michael Dell/SL can offer %15.65 all cash offer - and complete the LBO</Title><Username>sulur</Username><Timestamp>1364338035454</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 18:47:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why would Mike Dell increase his $13.65 (cash) per share , when no one else has made an offer to even match it, much less beat it?

These are not serious offers or bids, these "offers' are absurd." Get this dude...BX or Icahn dont give a ____ about what becomes of DELL. If they have the support of the shareholders, they will do whatever it takes to make money (like the debt-dividend program from Icahn or the piece by piece sale of DELL by BX). U and I dont matter..only the big boys like SouthEastern and T Rowe matter. And they have a pretty high average on their shares....unless they get close to $16.50 - $17.00, they will never go along with an all-private deal. The reason they are going along with BX's deal at the moment is because it leaves out a public stub. Considering all these, the only logical conclusion is that Dell either raises his offer to $17 or sees his company getting dismantled. I know Dell is a smart man...I even suspect this is exactly how he planned this whole thing. The next step is to get about 1.5 Billion more from Silverlake, about 3.5 billion more from Microsoft and finish the deal at around 30 B i.e around $17 per share and put it beyond both BX and Icahn. That way , 1) Icahn can take his $17 minus $14 profits and go away 2) SouthEastern and T Rowe can wash their hands off DELL and atleast breakeven for their trouble 3) M Dell can take the company private like he wanted 4) BX can prove that it was a "competitive" bidding process in which Silverlake finally won This is the only sequence of events that makes sense to me IMHO.

The board ruled that both proposals represent potentially better bid, they did that hours ago. The Blackstone bid is a cash tender, and extremely solid. If you wanted to complain about that and knew what you were talking about you would say that they need bank backing and that there are few that aren't involved on the Silverlake side. But, Ichan and his money look to be tending toward Blackstone. In any event, they run tremendous money and Blackstone will certainly not make fools of themselves by coming to a deal broke. They really aren't dumb. Good luck bashford. Really, I hope you do well. But you have this deal all wrong. There is plenty of capital on M Dell's side to beat the offers that the board has already deemed worthy of consideration. Yes, they need firm financing. I get it! But that's not what you are saying. And you are wrong. There are too many major holders involved to have the thing fizzle in the end. There are already known talks to roll in major investors who want to keep their shares.

That is, Dell's current cash reserves represent only about 105 of dell's current market cap. This "leveraged recap" you refer to would be a liquidation of Dell and result in shareowners receiving about 130% of Dell's current market cap value. In other words, DELL here at above $14 is ridiculously over valued. Mike Dell's current $13.65 per share cash offer is an extremeley generous bid. Forget about Ichan's or Blackstone's offer to 'borrow money to pay a dividend" or "liquidate Dell assest to pay off shareowners". The first will never receive financing. the econd is dependent on third party buyers willing to pay a premium for distressed Dell assets. Neither plan will ever pass any scrutiny or recieve affirmative votes. Meanwhile, Mike dell's offer is solid, all cash. Hope this helps.</Msg><Username>bashfordcapital</Username><Timestamp>1364355188181</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 23:33:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364356435389-69</Id><Title>What will happen to alien ware if Dell gets bought out?</Title><Msg>no more?</Msg><Username>bat1_70605</Username><Timestamp>1364356435389</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 23:53:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
