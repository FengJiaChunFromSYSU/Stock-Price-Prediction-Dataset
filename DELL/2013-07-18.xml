Definitely a head scratcher. Maybe they are hoping to drive it lower and will back up the truck. Then they can all team up and vote Michael Dell out and takeover the board. They are surely putting the pressure on Dell/SL. Will be interesting to see what the votes are. If they push the vote back they may be on a contact campain to call every shareholder that hasn't voted.

Dell takes this private at $14, you wait and see, in 2 to 3 years he takes it public again at $30 - $35 plus and he will own MORE shares. Last year he was crying to the public that the company was severely undervalued, now that he wants to take it private he tells everyone it not worth more. Wake up people, M.

They are people to be "worked on". He is also vindicating Icahn's diatribe about how he's trying to "steal" this company. When RJ Nabisco was going private and they all lined-up behind Johnson, KKR outbid Johnson's low-ball offer and after that, the Board couldn't hand him the company no-matter-what. The same may apply here.</Msg><Username>fattymcbutterpants2001</Username><Timestamp>1374167810885</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 13:16:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374168762268-72</Id><Topic><Title>Read this now - Dell Computer Corporation (DELL)</Title><Username>acord.lawrence</Username><Timestamp>1374166544406</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 12:55:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>oh yes it does</Msg><Username>timothy_lefthand</Username><Timestamp>1374168762268</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 13:32:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374170462275-73</Id><Topic><Title>Read this now - Dell Computer Corporation (DELL)</Title><Username>acord.lawrence</Username><Timestamp>1374166544406</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 12:55:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>wonderful</Msg><Username>kahaleua_lonneman</Username><Timestamp>1374170462275</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 14:01:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374171040994-74</Id><Title>The sad truth</Title><Msg>If Michael Dell was "stealing" the company for $13.65 a share, then if he pays $14 a share he's still "stealing" the company and #$%$ Icahn is just stealing some money from #$%$ Dell.</Msg><Username>robby9257</Username><Timestamp>1374171040994</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 14:10:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374173255820-75</Id><Title>Michael Dell Attempts LOOTING of Shareholders - My Opinion</Title><Msg>it's obvious Michael Dell is trying to steal the company from shareholders for cheap! you think he's running a charity? he wants to buy DELL on the cheap and then bring it public again in a few years and DOUBLE his fortune. this is the reward the BOD wants to give him for destroying shareholder value over the last 10+ years!!! Michael Dell and his compatriots were purposely talking down the stock at every chance they got well before his buyout was announced! are you that blind to not see the conflict of interest and the cause and effect here? Michael and the BOD control the information flow and they purposely have been painting a bad picture for investors. WHY? so he could buy the company for cheap! you ever buy a used car and negotiate? the first thing you do is walk around and point out all of the dings and flaws! but in this case the same BOD that was selling OUR (shareholders) car were the ones pointing out the flaws to beat down the price so Michael could get a sweetheart deal and buy the car for cheap! Michael was/is in a unique position to METHODICALLY PREMEDITATEDLY IN ADVANCE talk down the price and screw shareholders! for all i know - they manipulated earnings and margin numbers and forecasts as well! stranger things have happened in my 20 years of following Wall Street! One of the Dell directors (Laura Conigliaro) who was part of a four-person special committee that approved the buyout of the company at $13.65 a share is a former Goldman Sachs equity research analyst who had a $35 price target on Dell back in 2007. THE POINT IS this woman has no clue how to value anything! WHY SHOULD I TRUST HER OPINION FOR $13.65 WHEN I COULDN'T TRUST HER AT $35 6 YEARS AGO??????? LIKE CARL SAID - SHE IS DRINKING THE KOOL-AID THAT DELL GIVES HER!!! WHY SHOULD I BELIEVE THIS WOMAN NOW WHEN SHE TELLS ME DELL IS WORTH $13.65?????? i don't have/never had a specific target for DELL because that's not what i do. nor do i believe anything any analyst has say.</Msg><Username>johndeansmith</Username><Timestamp>1374173255820</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 14:47:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374173442970-76</Id><Topic><Title>Michael Dell Attempts LOOTING of Shareholders - My Opinion</Title><Username>johndeansmith</Username><Timestamp>1374173255820</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 14:47:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>johnny, You can steal Michael's thunder and back up your trucks to load up the shares at $13.14 rtq.
