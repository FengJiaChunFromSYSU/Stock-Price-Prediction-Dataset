There are two themes that emerged from the event. First, Dell is putting more of its resources and focus into a smaller portfolio of products, which could pay off bigger. Second, the three new products have been designed with the BYOD (bring your own device) trend in mind, so they can be optimized and configured for either personal or professional usage -- or both. Neil Hand, vice president of Dell's personal computing products group, cited during the event that at least half of U.S. workers share devices for work and personal use. He continued on to say that this has shown how mobility has changed the market, but for IT, it's all about providing security and balance. "Users need freedom. Businesses need control and management," Hand asserted. "The proliferation of devices is helping explode the amount of data for the consumer and business professional." Here's a rundown on the three new Windows 8-based Dell computers, each one covering a major category all on its own: all-in-one PCs, laptops, and tablets. OptiPlex 9010 •All-in-one design with 23-inch multi-touch display panel •Targeted towards medium to large business customers but could also be used in the home •Optimized for collaboration •Commerical possibilities include being used at point-of-sale points as it can be readjusted to face the display horizontally rather than vertically Latitude 6430u •First Ultrabook in Latitude series •Designed for all-day computing in mind with 10 hours of battery life •Users can swap out batteries, memory and even solid state drives for easier management when on-the-go •Supports wireless docking Latitude 10 •Described as a "100 percent business-class tablet" •10-inch tablet with 18 hours of battery life •Users can swap out batteries •Connects to a docking solution that extends storage capabilities and enabled with full HDMI and multiple USB ports; Intended to boost productivity in office environment when docked •Supports legacy apps as well as Windows 8 This is just a glimpse at what these products are about, and obviously there are many more specs involved. One of the big one to point out is that these are all running on Intel architectures, although only the tablet would not be supporting vPro technology. All of them have different security options and what not, but the more obvious customer group with all of these products -- based on how Dell is trying to frame them -- is business and enterprise customers. Nevertheless, they all looked consumer-friendly at the same time. That said, with a smaller Windows 8 portfolio compared to some competitors, this might actually pay off for Dell as it can focus on a few good products that could apply to everyone with more in-depth support. If it were to unveil a bunch of new Windows 8-based devices, there's the potential pitfalls of having a bunch of mediocre devices as well as just too many options, which always has the possibility to just leave customers confused.</Msg><Username>longsrboss</Username><Timestamp>1349639242996</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-07 15:47:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349645143974-8</Id><Topic><Title>Dell's smaller Windows 8 portfolio might be the big idea that everyone else is missing.</Title><Username>longsrboss</Username><Timestamp>1349639242996</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-07 15:47:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>DELL also has a loyal customer base both in Enterprise and Consumer fronts and that most have been delaying purchases waiting for Windows 8 and the launch in October coupled with Xmas season would certainly boost Q4 Rev. and EPS.</Msg><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1349645143974</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-07 17:25:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349648634413-9</Id><Title>Dell covers all the Windows 8 bases with new XPS models</Title><Msg>In a press event at IFA 2012 in Berlin in August 2012, Dell unveiled three new models in its XPS series. In the process, the company took several veiled swipes at Apple and borrowed a trick or two from Microsoft’s playbook. The new devices, all with 10-point touchscreen capability, cover the three categories that will be a staple for new Windows 8 hardware this fall: an ARM-powered Windows RT convertible, an Intel i5-based refresh for the flip-screen Dell Duo, and a 27-inch all-in-one powerhouse with a quad-HD screen. Sam Burd, Global VP of Dell’s Personal Computing Product Group, echoed Microsoft’s messaging with this introduction: "We have thoughtfully stepped back and reimagined every aspect of what makes a PC." “Reimagined” might be too strong of a word. Anyone who’s seen the XPS 13 Ultrabook and its 14- and 15-inch successors will recognize the materials and many of the design elements. In another nod to Microsoft’s approach, the company declined to discuss pricing and kept its display models under glass, making it impossible for pesky journalists to get any hands-on time with the devices The XPS One 27 is big and gorgeous, with very clean lines and a display that looked crisp and sharp even when zooming deep into high-resolution photos. Dell positions the device as one that’s “designed for professionals but also works for families.” Burd added, “We think touch is a great addition to this screen,” noting that the only other equivalent display—Apple’s highly praised Retina display—allows users to look but not touch. The adjustable stand looked solid from a distance and tilted smoothly back and down into a laydown mode good for lightbox-style work. It’s a demo we’ll see over and over as new, similar models appear this fall, but it’s an open question whether professionals and families will find the real-world use cases for this configuration. The other two models are both designed for mobile use. The XPS Duo 12 has a 12.5-inch screen, with a machined aluminum bezel and carbon fiber on the back of the display and the bottom of the device. It uses the same trick as the older Inspiron Duo, with a hinge in the center of the screen that allows the screen to flip and lay flat over the keyboard. The result turns an Ultrabook into the functional equivalent of a tablet, although it has the thickness and weight of the notebook. Dell didn’t offer up full specs for the display, but described it as “Full HD, with 97% more pixels than Standard HD” (presumably 1920x1080) with edge-to-edge glass, CPUs up to Core i7, and a backlit keyboard. The last entry is the XPS 10, running Windows RT in a package that looks startlingly like a netbook, with a compact keyboard. Unlike Microsoft at its Surface launch, Dell was willing to talk about usage, boasting that the unit would offer “up to 20 hours of battery life” and run for an entire weekend thanks to its thrifty power management. And in a "one more thing" moment, Dell showed off the device’s killer feature—the screen snaps away from its hinge to convert into a tablet form factor. All three models will be available for sale when Windows 8 launches on October 26/2012.</Msg><Username>longsrboss</Username><Timestamp>1349648634413</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-07 18:23:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349651025407-10</Id><Topic><Title>Shorts' analyst caught lying about DELL....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1349395836256</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 20:10:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hey Osso thanks for this great post as I also dug up some product material so to prove that Zacks is really a fraud house and not a legitimate investment research outfit.</Msg><Username>longsrboss</Username><Timestamp>1349651025407</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-07 19:03:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349656550151-11</Id><Topic><Title>Any idea which way DELL will trade next week?</Title><Username>jermain.mcbride</Username><Timestamp>1349608223356</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-07 07:10:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>We will close above $10.50....</Msg><Username>longsrboss</Username><Timestamp>1349656550151</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-07 20:35:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message></Date>
