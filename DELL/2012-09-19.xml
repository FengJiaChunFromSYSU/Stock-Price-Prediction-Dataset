Remember, the dividend can go away as fast as it showed up. Divvy was a desperation move to prop up PPS. The PC market is definitely dead. PCs last longer and there is nothing on the horizon to make them more attractive. Windows 8? Octa yawn. Maybe at eight bucks, it's a buy. DELL insiders simply want to prop this POS up so they can issue founders' options and dump, IMO.
