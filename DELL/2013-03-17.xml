This is why no other bidder has emerged to top it, or even match it. The only people complaining are those who paid too much for their DELL shares, but they have no one to blame but themselves. I expect a run for the exits here soon, once the speculators realize there is no competing buyout bid. And if it becomes evident $13.65 will not receive enough YES votes, DELL stock could easily trade back down to the $10.50 per share price range. Mike Dell may return again next year to propose a new, lower price to privatize the company. There is significant risk here owning DELL at todays inflated prices. Hope this helps.</Msg><Username>bashfordcapital</Username><Timestamp>1363531300054</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-17 10:41:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363536237950-7</Id><Topic><Title>cramers dumbest call,since he had motorola as the stock of the week</Title><Username>jayhawk2134</Username><Timestamp>1363403835439</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 23:17:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He has had others too, remember when AA couple years back was his stock of the year and Ford was to climb like the blazes.

Upon the Cramer ramble, DELL shares took a hit but then recovered throughout the day and indeed closed higher for the day. Anyone that missed the early morning rant by Cramer were reintroduced to his comments on Mad Money. Just for background, back in late December, or early January, Cramer told his viewers that DELL was a good speculative play and issued a blessing to buy. Cramer's opinion is forever changing. I didn't hear anything new from Faber or Cramer that changes the two contrasting positions on the buyout. DELL--the company needs to release the minutes from all negotiation meetings so that the individual can make their own assessment on a fair and reasonable value for the share price. Moreover, they need an internal check to ensure that non public information isn't being released to the press...while at the same time denying disclosure--TWICE--to the third party Shareholder Focus group...seems like a double standard may be conducted by DELL.
