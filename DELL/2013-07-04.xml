That's if he still cares to own this undervalued jewel.

The shift for personal use is mobile and based on the projection that tablets sales will overtake laptops this year is what I would consider surprising and very aggressive. IBM and HP have diversified and have had substantial investment in R&amp;D (considering that is core to both organizations) into the areas that matter such as virtualization and cloud based deployments both of which Dell has really nothing to speak of. When you see Oracle team up with Microsoft you know for sure how dramatically this market is shifting. Carlito and cronies know this is coming and are only playing this out so that they will be in the best position to feed on Dell's carcus once the company, under their plan, arrives at its final destination bankruptcy. Either that or the resulting stress that will come to Dell will leave them in the drivers seat without opposition to do whatever is best for Carlito.</Msg><Username>susan.mcan</Username><Timestamp>1372922616804</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-04 03:23:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372935384766-3</Id><Title>Icahn is the only reason!</Title><Msg>Icahn is the only reason that Dell’s special board committee, which is supposed to be looking out for the best interest of Dell’s shareholders, has gone back to Michael Dell and advised him to raise his offer!
