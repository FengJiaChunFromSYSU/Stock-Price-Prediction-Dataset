SilverLake looking to put in a relatively small 1.4B and Michael Dell 750M for a "weak" total of ~2.15B when the total cost of the buyout is ~ 24-25B. This means the rest is a combination of the following, 2B from Mirocsoft and trying to repatriate 7.4B that is sitting offshore, using 500M cash on the books for Dell in the the U.S and new loans for ~14B. This is a complete train wreck for shareholders and employees Just take a look at SilverLake/TPG Avaya deal... its a total failure with very bad Sr. leadership driving the company to the ground with SilverLake and TPG drawing distributions since Avaya was taken private back in '06 keeping them whole. Again, little skin in the game. Look no further than Avaya as an example of what is instore for Dell employees and shareholders. Message to midlevel and lower level employees in all discilplines find another job NOW! Do not wait.... Your Sr. Mgrs have to stay because they are average at best and no one is willing to pay them the big bucks. So when they start to see the mass exodus don't fall for their "stated loyalty" since their loyalty is to themselve to maintain their high salaries. Rank and file employees ask yourself a question... Are you paid for all the job insecurity hat you are experiencing now and the many years to come? If not LEAVE... what are you waiing for? Your failure to act is not fair to yourself and family while Silverlake and Dell get richer and playing with your loyalty and offering false hope. Again. look at Avaya. Word is Silverlake may try to merge and purge massive headcount by combining Avaya's operation with Dell. Who cares just quit you deserve better....Good luck. As a side note if you decide to endure the pain the better option is the Icahn offer... employees NEED the public eye to keep your leadership infocus and accountable...</Msg><Username>viewpoint999</Username><Timestamp>1372695451461</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-01 12:17:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372696165464-2</Id><Title>Icahn is up to his old familiar tricks...</Title><Msg>Look Folks, I've got financing, I can make a new bid, but not-right-now.

I am proud to say that our stock price performance since January 2000 through May 28, with reinvested dividends, showed a total return of 1,122%. During the same period the S&amp;P 500, Dow Jones industrial and Russell 2000 indices had returns of only 46%, 85% and 137%. The reason so few play the activist role and take advantage of the great risk/reward ratio it offers is that it is extremely difficult to breach the heavily guarded walls that CEOs and boards have built to protect themselves. Corporate democracy does not exist. Critics of activism state that activism may be good for the activist but not for other stockholders. Yet shareholder value has risen by many billions of dollars in the companies we have targeted over the years. I believe this proves conclusively that all shareholders, not just us, benefit from our involvement, and, perhaps even more important, the changes we institute at these companies cause them to become more productive, and therefore enable them to compete with foreign companies more efficiently, which in turn creates more jobs–something this country needs. This story appears in the June 24, 2013 issue of Forbes.</Msg><Username>johndeansmith</Username><Timestamp>1372697376315</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-01 12:49:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372697452900-4</Id><Topic><Title>Carl Icahn: What I Do Is Good For America</Title><Username>johndeansmith</Username><Timestamp>1372697376315</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-01 12:49:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Most people would agree that many of the companies in our country are mismanaged. You don’t have to be a brilliant financier to realize that the stocks of these companies are undervalued and would be much higher if the CEO were removed or at the very least paid more attention to his troubled company than his golf game.</Msg><Username>johndeansmith</Username><Timestamp>1372697452900</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-01 12:50:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372698827579-5</Id><Title>I want $14.00</Title><Msg>do you?</Msg><Username>twitbum</Username><Timestamp>1372698827579</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-01 13:13:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372699910045-6</Id><Title>DELL is worth at least $23.72 per share</Title><Msg>Valuing Dell Est.
