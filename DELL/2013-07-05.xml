Dell isn’t upping ante NYPost Michael Dell doesn’t appear to be letting a little thing like a competing offer for his ailing PC maker force him to up his offer, sources tell The Post. The executive and Silver Lake, his partner in the $13.65-per-share — or $24.4 billion — bid to take the Round Rock, Texas, PC maker private aren’t expected to budge on the bid, sources said. The two are expected to stand pat despite a rival bid from Carl Icahn and prodding from Dell Inc.’s special committee to raise their offer.</Msg><Username>johndeansmith</Username><Timestamp>1373021970001</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-05 06:59:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373024473152-2</Id><Title>$15 recommended by Yackman Asset Management as minimum bid</Title><Msg>According to a Seeking Alfa article; Silver Lake, Michael Dell's (DELL) partner in his $24.4B bid to take Dell (DELL) private, is reportedly wavering in its commitment amid the firm's deteriorating performance and worsening debt markets. Meanwhile, several of Dell's largest investors have told the board to up the $13.65-a-share offer or risk shareholder rejection, or come up with a Plan B in case the proposal fails. Over $15 a share would probably be enough to win shareholder backing, says Dell investor Yacktman Asset Management. As a personal comment, anything less than $15 per share would be criminal as far as I'm concerned</Msg><Username>filtered_out</Username><Timestamp>1373024473152</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-05 07:41:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373025503719-3</Id><Topic><Title>$15 recommended by Yackman Asset Management as minimum bid</Title><Username>filtered_out</Username><Timestamp>1373024473152</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-05 07:41:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>i'd rather own the SHARES and be able to participate on the UPSIDE. the stock will come back - i don't want to be forced to sell at the LOW!</Msg><Username>johndeansmith</Username><Timestamp>1373025503719</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-05 07:58:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373026791355-4</Id><Topic><Title>$15 recommended by Yackman Asset Management as minimum bid</Title><Username>filtered_out</Username><Timestamp>1373024473152</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-05 07:41:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What is interesting to me is if everyone of these big investors thought Dell shares were worth so much more, then how did the price get so depressed? They should have been supporting the stock rather than allowing it to be sold down. If it should have been priced above $15 and so many think so, then they should all be owning over 100 million shares at this ridiculously low price. It was only when Dell decided to actually take it private that people came out of the woodwork against the purchase. Dell has been threatening to go private for years, but no institution has been out there loving the stock so much that they were willing to buy more at the undervalued price. They, in fact, sold it down. Just look at the institutional ownership and see the culprits that undervalued the stock and the volumes of institutions that are short Dell. All of the negative does not line up with the $15 call options for Aug, Sept and Oct though. Of course it could all be cheap hedges both put and call.</Msg><Username>filtered_out</Username><Timestamp>1373026791355</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-05 08:19:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373028661628-5</Id><Topic><Title>$15 recommended by Yackman Asset Management as minimum bid</Title><Username>filtered_out</Username><Timestamp>1373024473152</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-05 07:41:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's dropping in the premarket.I think owning DELL is very risky for retail investors.this is a big boys game who play with somebody else's money.As soon as i break even i'm out and own calls and puts instead.</Msg><Username>alba95</Username><Timestamp>1373028661628</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-05 08:51:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373029899266-6</Id><Topic><Title>$15 recommended by Yackman Asset Management as minimum bid</Title><Username>filtered_out</Username><Timestamp>1373024473152</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-05 07:41:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And the quicker we get rid of this low end retail trader, then the better off we will be as a company.</Msg><Username>shelly_is_here</Username><Timestamp>1373029899266</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-05 09:11:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373030270267-7</Id><Title>What is now stopping Dell or Ichan</Title><Msg>from accumulating as many shares as they can down here?</Msg><Username>wi_mike</Username><Timestamp>1373030270267</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-05 09:17:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373030783115-8</Id><Title>Michael Dell knows more than anyone about DELL, and he's a BUYER!</Title><Msg>he's got the ultimate inside info on DELL - and he's a BUYER! what does that tell you?</Msg><Username>johndeansmith</Username><Timestamp>1373030783115</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-05 09:26:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373032397282-9</Id><Title>I'm In At $13.13/Share...</Title><Msg>Thank you for selling me those 1,000 shares of DELL, whoever you are!</Msg><Username>thesavvymonkey777</Username><Timestamp>1373032397282</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-05 09:53:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373032972135-10</Id><Topic><Title>Michael Dell knows more than anyone about DELL, and he's a BUYER!</Title><Username>johndeansmith</Username><Timestamp>1373030783115</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-05 09:26:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yet DELL management talks down their business at every possible opportunity.

He wouldn't have to do $15, I don't think. For that matter, he may be the one out there buying everything up right now. Someone was supporting the price around 13.28 and now someone is holding the bid up again. Icahn has the means to do what he wants if he wants bad enough. It could become a vindictive move and he could win. There could also be enough bidders out there to buy up the pieces of Dell just to see the extra player go away in an ever shrinking market. Icahn could have already have talked with those that would want some pieces and it would be worth it to them to see Dell go away. I'm surprised that Microsoft hasn't kicked in more than the $2 billion reported to be in play for the buyout since Dell has been such a loyal customer. I'm betting that MSFT hates Icahn and doesn't want him in the neighborhood of Dell.</Msg><Username>filtered_out</Username><Timestamp>1373048376579</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-05 14:19:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373049091229-58</Id><Topic><Title>Why doesn't Dell just add some debt and issue $15 dividend?</Title><Username>billberggren</Username><Timestamp>1373039283562</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-05 11:48:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Any comments on this Icahn supposedly has $5.2 debt already.

Of course since the BOD is acting out of love for Mike they are not going to pursue the Icahn bid as an actual thought process until the last vote is cast for the horrible deal that Michael Dell has put out.
