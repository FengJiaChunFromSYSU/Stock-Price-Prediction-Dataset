My floor is now $14.25.’” For Blackstone and Icahn, a leveraged recapitalization offers a cheaper alternative to a full takeover, according to James Hill, who runs the private-equity practice at law firm Benesch, Friedlander, Coplan &amp; Aronoff LLP. It’s also a “hybrid of necessity” that can help win shareholders’ approval, he said in a phone interview from Cleveland.</Msg><Username>btv104</Username><Timestamp>1364365187814</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-27 02:19:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364387432939-9</Id><Topic><Title>DELL Crash Predicted, BOUNCE COMING !!</Title><Username>stanley.joshua</Username><Timestamp>1362515325397</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 15:28:45 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>awesome report! thanks</Msg><Username>meynterrence</Username><Timestamp>1364387432939</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-27 08:30:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364390805799-10</Id><Title>DUMP DELL HARDWARE GARBAGE AND MOVE ON...LET MF CRIMINAL CARL ICAHN HAVE IT SO HE CAN BE BURIED UNDER OBSOLETE PC CHASSIS FOR HIS FUNERAL</Title><Msg>DUMP DELL HARDWARE GARBAGE AND MOVE ON...LET MF CRIMINAL CARL ICAHN HAVE IT SO HE CAN BE BURIED UNDER OBSOLETE PC CHASSIS FOR HIS FUNERAL MOVE ON..................NOTHING HERE LEFT TRADE TRADE INTC/CSCO SLOT MACHINES FOR GOOD DELL......IS HISTORY.......................DYING OBSOLETE COMPANY MF CRIMINAL #$%$ CARL ICAHN WANTS IT BEFORE GOING TO HIS GRAVE LOL</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1364390805799</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-27 09:26:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364390886821-11</Id><Topic><Title>What will happen to alien ware if Dell gets bought out?</Title><Username>bat1_70605</Username><Timestamp>1364356435389</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 23:53:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ALIENWARE SI ALREADY DEAD VIDEO GAMES HAVE MOVED ON..............</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1364390886821</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-27 09:28:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364391584459-12</Id><Topic><Title>What will happen to alien ware if Dell gets bought out?</Title><Username>bat1_70605</Username><Timestamp>1364356435389</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 23:53:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Dell could sell off the unit.

Shareowners should decide whether they want $13.65 cash or have the stock trade down to the pre buyout $10.to $10.50 range. Looking out to 2015 and beyond, if DELL remains public, the stock price could become a $5 stock, or it could trade back up to $20. So much is dependent on the economy, market conditions, management ability to transform the company etc....

As the weeks pass by the reality of the situation becomes clear. that is, Dell is a struggling company trying to transform its business lines to higher margin, potential growth generating products and services. There is no guarantee the future initiatives will be succesful, so Mike dell and his LBO team are taking a significant risk by paying a premium to privatize the company. There are several institutional stockholders such as Southeastern Asset Management, who paid too much for their DELL shares, and owned them too many years. this has nothing to do with Dell's business operations , but it does reveal the ineptiitude of Southeastern's money managers. T Rowe Price is another DELL shareowner which paid too much and have no one to blame but their own money managers. The recent speculators, such as carl ichan and a bunch of amateur stock buyers, took a risk overpaying for their shares, but Dell is not responsible for their reckless, cavalier buying habits. When all the ridiulous hype and posturing recedes, and the dust settles, serious DELL investors will vote to decide whether to approve the 413.65 offer, or take their chances with DELL remaining a public company. Hope this helps.</Msg><Username>bashfordcapital</Username><Timestamp>1364400485469</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-27 12:08:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364401568918-21</Id><Topic><Title>reality of the situation</Title><Username>bashfordcapital</Username><Timestamp>1364400485469</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-27 12:08:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Not going to happen, joint bid coming at 14.50 to go private</Msg><Username>instantwinbutton</Username><Timestamp>1364401568918</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-27 12:26:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364403104971-22</Id><Topic><Title>reality of the situation</Title><Username>bashfordcapital</Username><Timestamp>1364400485469</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-27 12:08:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No it really does not help...................if you think $13.65 is a good price you must be ecstatic at the current price of $14.38 ???</Msg><Username>droptop1</Username><Timestamp>1364403104971</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-27 12:51:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364413317394-23</Id><Topic><Title>If I buy tomorrow, do I still get the 8 cents dividend</Title><Username>value_oriented_123</Username><Timestamp>1364329841905</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 16:30:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No, you would need to buy at least 1 day before the ex-date . . .

Add the cash back and you get $22.50. I think at 10x earnings the company should approach $20. Am I missing something?</Msg><Username>flakjacket999</Username><Timestamp>1364441423674</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-27 23:30:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
