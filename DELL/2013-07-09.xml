It is a higher price for the small shareholders. The only way they would accept $13.62 is if the whole plan was to take Dell private in the 1st place. "With the board replaced under the Icahn-Southeastern plan, the newly installed directors would make a $14-a-share-cash tender offer for up to 72% of Dell stock. The buyback would allow unhappy investors to cash out, while increasing the ownership stakes of investors who stick around. " forbes. I want to stick around Dell is worth $50. There is no reason for management not to take the higher number, unless the plan was to screw the small investors to begin with.</Msg><Username>billberggren</Username><Timestamp>1373370906358</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 07:55:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373371085241-2</Id><Title>Institutional Shareholder Service gave its stamp of approval to the</Title><Msg>ISS is just a website.

Book value is an accounting term, subject to much varied interpretation. Book value has nothing to do with what a company is worth to a potential buyer. In the DELL situation, there is no better revelation of "value' than the recent months of auction, when any and all interested buyers were permitted to access DELL's accounting books and present an offer to buy the company. That is the best "value test' of all, the free market. No outsider was interested enough to even match Mike Dell's $13.65 offer. much less beat it.
