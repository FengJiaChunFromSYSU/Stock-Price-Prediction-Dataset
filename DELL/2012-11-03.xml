First EPS then Dividend Payment!!</Title><Username>citioec</Username><Timestamp>1351861160378</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 08:59:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You do not even know for sure what you are going to do tomorrow or even if you will survive the whole day and you expect to know what will happen to DELL in few years? Come on! I have been trading DELL recently bought and sold between 10.20 to 10.85 and waited patiently because I knew the company is weak. I bought again on Friday at 9.14 and I intend to buy more a little under 9 if possible(it is almost certain now that we will trade at least at 8.90 next week)? With RSI at 33 and soon earnings to be it is possible to get some profit right now but still risky. My target is around 9.75/10. Maybe I am wrong but I think DELL has been sufficiantly punished and now is trading in "fair value" territory. With the cash on hand and a nice dividend it is hard to see DELL weakening much more from here? Looking at the 2Y chart it is an horrible situation and I believe many shareholders have lost a huge amount of money. Sorry for them not much I can do... My investement in DELL is limited because the risk involved with this company is HIGH but I see also an opportunity forming if the Company can turn itself around the next few months/years? They have sufficient cash and a still profitable business that allow them to be able to adapt if they want? It is preposterous to imagine that the market of computer and laptop will disappear because it will not at all. It is shrinking but the players will shrink as well which will give the same market volume to the ones who will survive. I see DELL surviving for now or at least better than HQ.
