The Dell Optiplex 9010 AIO, Latitude 6430u Ultrabook, and Latitude 10 tablet take some of the Windows 8 ideas we’ve already seen from Dell’s consumer range at IFA, but throws in some business seriousness including a rather fetching dock for the new tablet. The Optiplex 9010 is the business version of Dell’s XPS One 27, a touchscreen all-in-one PC which can be stood on your desk or wall-mounted via a standard VESA mount. Dell is positioning it as ideal for installed environments, such as lobby display, with support for remote management of the hard-drive. The camera can be rotated so that even if you have the AIO tilted right back, you can still position the webcam so that you’re in frame. Next up is the Dell Latitude 6430u, a new 14-inch ultrabook and the first such model for Dell’s Latitude business line. It supports all of the usual enterprise-centric remote management, but also includes swappable batteries, memory, and SSD storage. Dell will also be offering a wireless dock for the Latitude 6430, for those wanting to use a larger display, keyboard, and mouse at their desk. The ultrabook meets military specifications, and has a full-sized keyboard borrowed from the regular Latitude notebook line. Finally, there’s the Dell Latitude 10, a business iteration of Dell’s XPS 10 announced at IFA a few weeks back. A full Windows 8 slate, rather than Windows RT on the XPS 10, the 10-inch tablet works with a desktop dock complete with HDMI, ethernet, and several USB ports, along with adding extended storage". SO DON'T TELL ME THAT ZACKS ANALYSTS DOESN'T KNOW ALL THIS AS THIS WAS OUT 3 WEEKS AGO! THIS IS ALL ABOUT DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGN TO FLEECE THE SHAREHOLDERS.</Msg><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1349411263848</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 00:27:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349416485573-4</Id><Topic><Title>m</Title><Username>ShannonT9</Username><Timestamp>903471900000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 1998-08-18 16:25:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>hey there</Msg><Username>babyliagirl</Username><Timestamp>1349416485573</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 01:54:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349447624162-5</Id><Topic><Title>Short squeeze starting tomorrow....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1349406750905</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 23:12:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Especially when the short are still dreaming DELL doing lower, hahahaha.</Msg><Username>king_kim_1</Username><Timestamp>1349447624162</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 10:33:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349447624228-6</Id><Topic><Title>Short squeeze starting tomorrow....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1349406750905</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 23:12:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Especially when the short are still dreaming DELL doing lower, hahahaha.</Msg><Username>king_kim_1</Username><Timestamp>1349447624228</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 10:33:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349447757765-7</Id><Title>DELL will outperform AAPL in Q4/2012</Title><Msg>Windows 8 will be launched on October 25/2012 as DELL has introduced its Windows 8 ready Ultrabook and Tablet line ups already.

I ordered a complete PC computer system from Dell on Sept 24, everything including speakers, computer, and printer were delivered in a timely fashion except for the wireless keyboard, mouse, and 24 inch monitor that I ordered. After repeated calls that all end up in India it was explained to me that the monitor etc would be delivered October 29th. Excuse me I am without a computer for 5 weeks after I ordered it online from Dell, unbelievable. I talked again just an hour ago to some idiot in India that said there were waiting for a part in order to manufacture my monitor and the due date was Oct 29th. If a mult-million dollar company like Dell cannot fullfill a basic order for there product how do you think here stock is going to perform. And if anyone who works for this company who understands english is reading this you can vderify what I am saying by checking out order # 10504950.

The Windows 8 release and launch event is scheduled to take place on October 25 in New York to showcase the much anticipated operating system and tablet, while the smartphones will be unveiled on the West Coast on October 29, according to eWeek. Windows 8 and the Surface tablet will take center stage in New York on the 25th. For your device to support Windows 8, however, it’ll need to fulfill a few requirements. According to TechRadar, You need a 1GHz or faster CPU (it also needs to support PAE or PAE-NX Physical Address Extension for new security features in the Windows 8 kernel), 1GB of RAM (or 2GB for 64-bit systems), 20GB of hard drive space and a DirectX 9 graphics card with WDDM driver. The Surface specs have yet to be fully disclosed, but we suspect Steve Ballmer wants it that way. In fact, Business Insider wrote yesterday, “Microsoft was widely criticized for keeping the Surface tightly guarded at the tablet’s unveiling in June, but only a few people got to actually try it out. Now Microsoft is promising a “Microsoft Surface reception” following the final Windows 8 demonstration.” Here’s what you can expect to see at the event. The Surface will sport a 10.6 auto-adjusting HD screen, it will be 9.3mm thick, and will feature a 3mm thick cover that doubles as a fully-functioning keypad. There’s still no word on price, but according to the Seattle Times back in September, Microsoft has a “very competitive product from the features perspective,” and that “probably $300 to about $700 or $800″ is the “sweet spot.” Windows Phone 8 will debut on five confirmed smartphones: Nokia’s Lumia 920 and 820, HTC’s Windows Phone 8X and Windows Phone 8S, and Samsung’s ATIV S. The smartphones will range in screen size from 4-inches to 4.8-inches but all will feature HD multi-touch screens. They will all come with NFC capability, SkyDrive integration, and Qualcomm’s Snapdragon quad-core processor for speed and efficiency".</Msg><Username>longsrboss</Username><Timestamp>1349486207905</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 21:16:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349491178349-31</Id><Title>should dell buy hp's pc &amp; server business?</Title><Msg>or would that not make any sense?
