Yes, people will still buy pc, but Dell will continue to lose market share and margins will continue to decline. The smart investors saw this coming. The Dell brand is becoming much less important when buying a pc. Lenovo and other companies are gaining market share and lowering prices. PC prices continue to fall. The server market is moving in the same direction (low cost generic brands but sold in higher volume). Dell knows this is happening and they are trying to remedy the situation by buying into other businesses. Even if Dell manages to meet estimates, the stock price will continue to be under pressure. If Dell fails to meet estimates, the stock gets crushed.</Msg><Username>zillionaire_investor</Username><Timestamp>1346547495618</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-01 20:58:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
