There will be lawsuits for discrimination. They have to offer the smaller shareholders a higher price to appease them. The latest discussions with Dell, BX, and Icahn have them all pooling into it together and letting the large shareholders like Southeastern, T.Rowe, Icahn, Blackrock, Dell take stubs instead of cash, but forcing everyone else to cash out at $14.25. That is blatently unfair. I think the majority of shareholders if given the choice at $14.25 would keep their shares, not sell. The smart money already has stated that they believe this company is worth north of $20. Also, if I buy today at $14.26, don't I still get to receive the July dividend of $0.08, so worse case scenario, I get $14.33 or are they trying to close the deal by June/July of this year and screw the shareholders out of the next dividend payment.</Msg><Username>starcushing</Username><Timestamp>1364489435266</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 12:50:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364489996497-5</Id><Topic><Title>Reality Check</Title><Username>starcushing</Username><Timestamp>1364489435266</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 12:50:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The offer price is $13.65.

So he spews his venom in an effort to get the deal done at a lower price for his buddy. God only knows how much money he gets kicked back for publicly attacking Dell by SilverLake. He gets his facts all wrong. Dell is an amazing US company with great cash flows and a great balance sheet. Security, Servers, Cloud, amazing cash flow make it of course very attractive for other suitors. The PC business revenues are down because the company walked away from lower margin business on purpose. See right threw the sad man Cramer for what he is. Cramers company he founded sells for $1/Share and some change and does $50 million in revenue. Michael Dell does $55 Billion in revenue and this guy Cramer has the audacity to rip on Dell.
