I know from experience they FAR surpassed simply giving bad service! (maybe they're much better now) I forget how many state attorney generals sued them. Dell gave good service to business customers and thrived however now many of their prior victims have spread the word and now are the ones involved in ordering computers. Imagine you're involved in the decision to buy computers and Dell ruined a loved ones credit after outright cheating them? I hope the best for Dell but I'll never buy another one...ever...never. When corn seeds are planted...don't be surprised when corn grows!</Msg><Username>mrsparex</Username><Timestamp>1370096539617</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-01 10:22:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370112259159-2</Id><Title>Dont vote for the Dell offer vote your proxie to southestern instead.</Title><Msg>You have already had a chance in the last 6 months to sell at a higher price, ,Ichan and southeastern have a better idea.

Mr Dell basically wants to buy the company at a 30% discount and rework his magic and transform the company into a big money maker. In three years he will than bring the company public and sell the shares for 22-25 dollars per share. Mr Dell will walk away with billions. Call his bluff and force him to bow out or up the ante.</Msg><Username>currantim55</Username><Timestamp>1370129833094</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-01 19:37:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370141553043-4</Id><Title>Thank you Dell</Title><Msg>For offering Ubuntu Linux as an alternative to #$%$ Windows 8.</Msg><Username>hahahacreek</Username><Timestamp>1370141553043</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-01 22:52:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
