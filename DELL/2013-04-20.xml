Looking forward, there is no problem for Dell to do PCoIP. My point is that smartphones or tablets are not the major problem for dell. The problem is the macro economy resulting in its sales down, the ecomomy will be eventually coming back though.</Msg><Username>yakimariver</Username><Timestamp>1366475083439</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-20 12:24:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366491902309-7</Id><Topic><Title>So what price will Icahn make his hostile bid???</Title><Username>rockstarsg3</Username><Timestamp>1366402724399</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-19 16:18:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>BashTURD is the biggest JOKE on the yahoo message board. This moron told everyone to sell at $12.50.....He doesn't know the first thing about Wallstreet. Tell the class how you told the board that NO SINGLE ENTITY held more than 1% ownership in Dell and M. Dell had the final decision on everything. BashTURD is an IDIOT. This cat is the dumbest rookie I have ever seen.</Msg><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1366491902309</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-20 17:05:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366504170781-8</Id><Topic><Title>So what price will Icahn make his hostile bid???</Title><Username>rockstarsg3</Username><Timestamp>1366402724399</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-19 16:18:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Last week, 14.25-50 seemed more realistic.
