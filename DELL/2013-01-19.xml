Dell will eventually will start selling pieces of the company, do a reverse split to shrink the float to more manageable size and be patient as it will take 1 to 3 years to be profitable again. Going private and taking on a huge bridge loan would be catastrophic. Maybe it pleases the bottom feeders who bought at these low prices, but I checked some funds are not happy since they have holding that were bought over $25/sh, they will stop any leveraged buyout, the same goes with the bond holders since they are unsecured and adding another $25 billion will for sure send this company into bankruptcy with 2 years.</Msg><Username>davidduke5000</Username><Timestamp>1358630963926</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 16:29:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358632187482-7</Id><Topic><Title>DELL CANNOT USE THE $10 BILLION FOR THE BUYOUT.</Title><Username>davidduke5000</Username><Timestamp>1358630963926</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 16:29:23 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>1) The bondholders cannot stop the deal. Sure they'll be unhappy. They knew the risks when buying the bonds. Even here in Canada, the BCE bondholders lost in a UNANIMOUS decision by the Canadian Supreme Court. 2) With Michael Dell's 15%, in order for this deal to be approved by shareholders they would need 35% more, but of the remaining 85% only. That equals a little over 41% - a relatively low threshold. With the HUGE volume since this news broke, there are now sufficient shares/votes in the hands of shareholders who will vote "yes" (as long as the price isn't ridiculously low - which it won't be). Sure, those who bought at higher prices aren't going to be happy. Boohoohoo. That's part of the risk of buying shares in public companies. They will not be able to stop a deal from going through. 3) Due to various events of the past years (e.g. Fed policy) since the so-called credit crisis hit, the lenders are sitting on huge sums of money and making very little on it in this extremely low interest rate environment. They are highly motivated lenders. Dell will have no problem finding funding, and it will split up between global powerhouses, thus reducing the risk for the lenders. 4) Silverlake and possibly other PE houses want this deal to go through. They have far more than enough capital to do it. The deal doesn't even hinge on the PE amount. As long as they have the lenders on board, this deal will happen. 5) Michael Dell has a vast fortune outside of his Dell shares. If necessary, he can add a billion or two. I don't think he will do this. 6) We have a single rumour from an anonymous source stating the range is $13.50 to $14. Thousands of articles have been written and countless words have been spoken by talking heads based on this SINGLE rumour. Maybe that range is correct - maybe it isn't. Obviously, there is a practical, fundamental limit to what price it will be done at (i.e. the deal won't be done at $25), but I think that it'll be higher than $14. My guess is $15. 7) There will be many twists and turns before this is done. The deal that they are supposedly working on may or may not be how the final deal is structured. While it is unlikely that anyone else will enter - it certainly is possible. Perhaps Dell spins off its PC business? We may end up seeing a cash and shares hybrid of some sort. The final FORM of any deal might be quite different from what is currently being assumed by the public.</Msg><Username>slickvguy</Username><Timestamp>1358632187482</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 16:49:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358634639215-8</Id><Title>CAN pc home users store info in the cloud?</Title><Msg>How about EMC tied up with Dell?

What anybody is his right mind would want a losing proposition? Dell is a dinosaur that is on verge of tipping over if it does not stop the hype and start running a legitimate business instead than always trying to copy somebody. The PC should be left to Acer and the independent players, and Dell should have started building up the storage business to become a big business player replacing EMC and others by providing servers, business computers and storage, in addition to offering services. Dell is behind the curve in strategies and all what Michael Dell is to recover legally his $4 billion from his stock and would not even care if the business survives. I doubt there is any financing now that many were approached turned down joining the syndicate knowing upfront what is the outcome and to show you how desperate they are, they tried to hit Canada pension investment fund. LOL I was monitoring the trades and not even one third of the float changed hands as more small traders were trading up and down the stock. It will continue playing this way for a while until the results of the planned scheme are accomplished since Dell never acknowledged nor denied what's up with Silver Lake. I would give it one more week until the media start to leak the possibility that Silver Lake is not able to assemble enough suckers to leverage the financing .</Msg><Username>davidduke5000</Username><Timestamp>1358638647825</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 18:37:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358640576257-10</Id><Topic><Title>DELL CANNOT USE THE $10 BILLION FOR THE BUYOUT.</Title><Username>davidduke5000</Username><Timestamp>1358630963926</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 16:29:23 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you are a clown...stop embarrasing yourself</Msg><Username>chazchem</Username><Timestamp>1358640576257</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 19:09:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358642133054-11</Id><Topic><Title>CAN pc home users store info in the cloud?</Title><Username>value_oriented_123</Username><Timestamp>1358634639215</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 17:30:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>As I have a lot of important info stored in my pc, I wonder what would happen if my pc breaks.

What does experience have to do with what is going on behind closed doors? This play will happen or it won't. Like any other play. Sometimes they happen - sometimes they don't. You and I have no way of knowing how it will end - to pretend otherwise is just stupid. I was short DELL after the runup post-rumour. But after making a bit that way, I went the other way. It's not that I disagree with some of your instincts, but what I do find curious is your penchant for making erroneous and non-factual statements to reinforce your preconceived notions. If you don't think it'll happen, that's fine. You might be right. Why not just say so? To then make a bunch of statements that are either unknowable or false does you no favour. As a Canadian, your attitude toward the Canadian pension shows an American bias. Why woudl one need to be desperate to ask the CPP if they want in? (Hint: RBC is one of the lenders). You seem to be confused about debt financing and equity participation. You said "I doubt there is any financing now that many were approached turned down joining the syndicate knowing upfront what is the outcome ". This is pure fantasy on your part. You have no information, no facts, to say such a thing. You have no idea who was approached (I do, btw), how many were approached, and what their reactions were. Do not doubt this, my friend: the lenders are lined up and happy to participate IF a deal should be put together. Fact. Further, and very importantly, the deal does NOT hinge on other equity partners. Make sure you understand this. It is not like most other deals. Silverlake is in. Between Silverlake and Michael Dell, they have enough EQUITY to do this deal. As for your prediction that the media will start putting out rumours that the deal won't go through - I believe you are correct. I don't care. I am long DELL. Not a large position - so my downside (and upside) is limited. If there is no deal, and it gets whacked, I will lose. Big whoop. Nobody should be betting the farm on this! But I think taking all of the information into account, you get two kicks at the can: 1) a deal being worked out, 2) Dell coming back on its own. My long on RIMM certainly has paid off, despite all the negativity and predictions of failure even when it was at $6! There are no guarantees. The risk is real. But in this case, at $12.50ish (my ACB) I think it's a worthwhile risk.</Msg><Username>slickvguy</Username><Timestamp>1358648472782</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 21:21:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358653979423-15</Id><Topic><Title>DELL CANNOT USE THE $10 BILLION FOR THE BUYOUT.</Title><Username>davidduke5000</Username><Timestamp>1358630963926</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 16:29:23 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>your logic doesn't even make sense.</Msg><Username>dramdram</Username><Timestamp>1358653979423</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 22:52:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358656362771-16</Id><Topic><Title>HOW i made 100% this month TRADING</Title><Username>bemerr3</Username><Timestamp>1358635889326</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 17:51:29 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How you made $5.00 SPAMMING MBs?</Msg><Username>elperorabioso</Username><Timestamp>1358656362771</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 23:32:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
