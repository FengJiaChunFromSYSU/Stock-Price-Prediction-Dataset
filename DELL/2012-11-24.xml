It saddens me to see this company slowly dying cause that is exactly what is happening. The pc is dead and dell has failed to adequately diversify. Look at ibm as the model............away from hardware to services............thats the path. At least I made my money and got out. I still have the autographed stock certificate addressed to me and my kids personnally from Michael Dell hanging in my living room since 1998. Dell bought my home, cars, college education for my two kids and hundreds of thousands of dollars were left over and still in the market. Those were exciting times for this stock but no more. Sad..................very sad.

I am making a fortune trading the blips up and down. Its a volatile stock and if you are discipline enough to buy at near new lows, and hang a day or two you can realize nice 5-6% gains very quickly with little downside risk. Sell on strength, buy on days where it sells off with the general market. Have the good sense to take your money off the table when its there, and wait for the next sell off.. you can make $$$$$'s on this POS.</Msg><Username>steely11</Username><Timestamp>1353778520665</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-24 12:35:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353788898589-3</Id><Title>"Value Oriented 123, investors respond to your posts!"</Title><Msg>True.
