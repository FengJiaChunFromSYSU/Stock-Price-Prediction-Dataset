Now especially with the vote this week and the price down wouldn't you guys be buying. I suggest you buy and vote "yes" and make some nice, easy money. Southeastern should be buying too. All these guys, but are they? Makes no sense to say it's undervalued but not out there buying at current levels. Current price is $13.02. Doubters act like this is the only company out there to invest in. Vote yes, take the money and buy a better company.</Msg><Username>whiskycat26</Username><Timestamp>1374046585186</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-17 03:36:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374060106590-2</Id><Topic><Title>Attention Blackrock, T Rowe Price, etc</Title><Username>whiskycat26</Username><Timestamp>1374046585186</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-17 03:36:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>too much uncertainty because of the shenanigans with the voting process.</Msg><Username>johndeansmith</Username><Timestamp>1374060106590</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-17 07:21:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374061313451-3</Id><Title>$12.85 now, seems like free money to me</Title><Msg>unless I'm missing something?</Msg><Username>virtualgh0st</Username><Timestamp>1374061313451</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-17 07:41:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374061402244-4</Id><Topic><Title>Attention Blackrock, T Rowe Price, etc</Title><Username>whiskycat26</Username><Timestamp>1374046585186</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-17 03:36:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I don't get it either, why are they sitting on the side lines,they should be loading up on all shares under 13.00 !!

"There is no corporate democracy in this country and it's a sad sad situation," he told Wapner. Icahn says he's plugging the old Graham and Dodd philosophy. Dell, he maintains, is an undervalued asset, not a dying business. "If you can get rid of that board, it's a great asset for the company." As for whether or not he thinks Michael Dell will up his bid, Carl says, "I don't care a hell of a lot... I really want to own this company... the real money you make is when you own these companies... They keep hinting to me, well, what do you really want? I want to own this company... If Dell raises some of the big shareholders could go to him." Oh, and no, Carl's not afraid of a proxy fight. He believes he can win. Wapner brought up Jim Chanos' negative comments on Dell. "I like Chanos," said Carl Icahn, "but look at some of the stocks he's shorted, they've gone up...With all honesty I think I have a much better record than he does... I like the guy... The billions I've made are on companies Chanos might have been short... Here's what Chanos misses: These companies can be turned around with the right CEO and the right board." After a few jokes about his wife running his hedge fund, Wapner asked Icahn how he felt about being called "the msot disruptive man in business." "Who called me that," Icahn asked, "I think you did... You meet these guys somewhere that run a company and you say 'I wanna go after that company.'"</Msg><Username>johndeansmith</Username><Timestamp>1374097345973</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-17 17:42:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374097585420-105</Id><Topic><Title>LIVE: Carl Icahn Is Unscripted In Front Of A Room Full Of Hedge Fund Managers</Title><Username>johndeansmith</Username><Timestamp>1374097345973</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-17 17:42:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Corporate Democracies?

The Vanguard Group had about 3.65 percent of Dell’s outstanding shares in its portfolio. According to my math, that would bring the total percentage of shareholders who have publicly come out against the buyout to just shy of 25 percent. That is now more than half of the 43 percent majority required to approve the buyout. Vanguard’s opposition comes on the heels of word from investment firm BlackRock, which indicated yesterday that it opposes the buyout. While there were reports yesterday that the vote might be delayed by as much as a week in order to try to rally some support, but I’ve been told that, as of this afternoon, the vote is expected to take place as scheduled Thursday morning. There has been no word of a change in the posture of people in the Dell/Silver Lake camp, who told me reliably yesterday that there will be no addition to their per-share bid of $13.65 for the company. This makes the potential for a lengthy and messy proxy fight for control of the company a lot more likely.</Msg><Username>johndeansmith</Username><Timestamp>1374100486356</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-17 18:34:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374100836017-114</Id><Topic><Title>If the vote is postponedet on the</Title><Username>cspanosmwc</Username><Timestamp>1374089151274</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-17 15:25:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You said DELL owns a majority and can vote HIMSELF whatever deal he wants.

Vanguard Group, State Street Corp. STT +1.03% and BlackRock Inc., BLK +1.47% which collectively hold nearly an 11.4% stake in the computer maker as of the latest public filings, have signaled they will oppose the deal, one of the people said. Representatives of Vanguard and State Street declined to comment, and a representative of BlackRock didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. That opposition would bring the count of known planned negative votes to close to 30% of Dell shareholders. The takeover agreement requires the majority of shareholders outside of Michael Dell and his affiliates, who hold a combined approximately 16% of the shares, to vote for the deal. That means shareholders with just over 42% of shares need to vote yes for the deal to pass. Dell founder Michael Dell and private-equity firm Silver Lake Partners struck a deal to take Dell private for $13.65 a share. A vote on the deal is scheduled for Thursday but will likely be delayed to give the buyout group and company more time to convince shareholders to vote for the deal, people familiar with discussions said Wednesday, although they cautioned that no decision had been made.</Msg><Username>johndeansmith</Username><Timestamp>1374101835936</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-17 18:57:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374101895447-119</Id><Title>Dell’s deal DEAD: Founder's $24.4B offer for PC maker to fail, sources say</Title><Msg>Dell’s deal dead: Founder's $24.4B offer for PC maker to fail, sources say By Josh Kosman and Mark DeCambre Last Updated: 12:21 PM, July 17, 2013 Posted: 11:18 PM, July 16, 2013 Stick a fork in it. Michael Dell’s $13.65-a-share offer for his company is done and dead, two sources familiar with the situation claimed yesterday. The bold forecast, based on conversations the two had with central players in the deal, comes as a second large shareholder in the embattled PC maker, index fund Blackrock, said it would vote against the offer and a third, State Street, is leaning against it, a source told The Post. At the same time, Dell’s special committee is weighing a delay in the July 18 shareholder vote. The delay could be for a week — to allow the company to win support from shareholders who hadn’t voted, a source familiar with the company’s thinking said. Bloomberg was the first to report the committee’s potential cold feet. While winds were buffetting the bid, sources close to Michael Dell maintained the vote is too close to call. Michael Dell’s advisers are trying to figure a way to improve their offer, realizing that despite six months of selling its merits, it is coming up short just hours before tomorrow’s 9 a.m. vote, a source close to the situation said. Still, a sizable Dell shareholder, an index investor, told The Post there may be a level of brinkmanship taking place. Shareholders can vote against the deal, and then decide up to the deadline to change their vote. The investor said he believes Michael Dell will offer some small sweetener and the deal will pass. “As a risk averse investor, we are not prepared to take the risk of the company turnaround” and will vote for the buyout, he said. If shareholders reject the offer, the shares will likely fall from their $13.02 close yesterday to below $10 a share, a prominent Dell analyst told The Post. After a short time, the share price will stabilize between $10 and $11, said the analyst, who believes shareholders should reject the deal. Michael Dell will find it hard to raise his offer, since co-investor Silver Lake Partners has no interest in going above $13.65 and he needs their permission, several sources said. For every 25 cents they raise their bid, they’ll need to come up with roughly $500 million, a source familiar with Silver Lake’s thinking said. It’s a very expensive proposition in light of the eroding PC business. Not only has the PC industry fallen more than expected since Silver Lake agreed to co-invest with Michael Dell in February, but the likely interest rate Dell would need to pay in a leveraged buyout that includes $16 billion of debt has risen — reducing their projected return. “This blows up their model,” said a source. In a statement, Dell said: “The Special Committee has had only one goal from the beginning — and that is to maximize value for stockholders, however that goal is best achieved. We have studied the options very carefully and our conclusion, which has been supported by all of the leading proxy advisory services, is that a sale transaction at a substantial and certain premium is the best way forward.” Carl Icahn and partner Southeastern Asset Management are fighting the Dell offer and appear to have won over enough shareholders.</Msg><Username>johndeansmith</Username><Timestamp>1374101895447</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-17 18:58:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374105176877-120</Id><Topic><Title>Why Does Carl Icahn Want Dell Anyways?</Title><Username>playboy210</Username><Timestamp>1374095893616</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-17 17:18:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Replacing the ceo and all board members, Dell can transform from PC makers to tablets or smart phone makers, and as business solutions provider following IBM and HPQ.</Msg><Username>stjoseph1990</Username><Timestamp>1374105176877</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-17 19:52:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374105399557-121</Id><Title>Dell Is the Next Gateway...Moo Moo</Title><Msg>Dell will eventually be bought out by a Chinese PC outfit like Lenovo for about $3 per share just like Gateway was.</Msg><Username>debbie_downer_does_dallas</Username><Timestamp>1374105399557</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-17 19:56:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374107787508-122</Id><Title>Icahn kicked all there buns.
