Look at the chart for God sake!!! it is a CATASTROPHE! What kind of rosy glasses are you wearing? I do not see a huge downside right now so but it is almost certain that $8's will be coming at one point? I may add then another 500 shares at 8.75? and HOLD. Dividend are not bad in the mean time....It is possible to see $11 if earnings are not disappointing but the problem is not really the earnings themselves but the financial forecast and revenue for Q4 and 2013 that will show the way up or down for pps. risky risky Good luck</Msg><Username>bigblue904034</Username><Timestamp>1349953477073</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 07:04:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349954833777-2</Id><Topic><Title>Next stop 8.25</Title><Username>runningblackbeardog</Username><Timestamp>1349915414356</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 20:30:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Michael Dell's beach house in Anguilla cost more to build than Michele and Barry's rental on Pennsylvania ave.
