Tennessee-based Southeastern Asset Management Inc. wrote that Round Rock-based Dell’s (Nasdaq: DELL) performed well in the business division that matters most in the coming years — software and services. “Dell’s results are heavily skewed by a combination of headline-grabbing PC statistics and the significant investments being made in the future of the business,” the company wrote in a Wednesday filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. “The enterprise solutions, software and services business is Dell’s future, and we are highly encouraged by its continued outperformance.” Southeastern Asset Management and billionaire investor Carl Icahn are competing with an investor group led by Dell CEO Michael Dell to buyout the company’s shareholders. Dell (Nasdaq: DELL), the No. 3 computer maker in the world, employs 14,000 workers in Central Texas. Michael Dell’s group is proposing pay $24.4 billion – $13.65 per share – for the company. Icahn has characterized the buyout proposal as “the great giveaway.” Last week, Dell posted net income of $130 million on revenue of $14 billion, compared with a net income of $635 million on revenue of $14.4 billion during the same period last year.</Msg><Username>johndeansmith</Username><Timestamp>1369316142972</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 09:35:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369326328714-3</Id><Title>Dell shareholders on suicide watch</Title><Msg>Nobody is forcing these people to buy these worthless shares of stock.</Msg><Username>schule7607</Username><Timestamp>1369326328714</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 12:25:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369330280484-4</Id><Topic><Title>no deal with ichan dell deal in 6 months back to 12.00</Title><Username>ron.wallach</Username><Timestamp>1369070400278</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-20 13:20:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Plus you keep your shares I'm for that.</Msg><Username>loboosh</Username><Timestamp>1369330280484</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 13:31:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369336808569-5</Id><Topic><Title>Dell shareholders on suicide watch</Title><Username>schule7607</Username><Timestamp>1369326328714</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 12:25:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Simple solution to any long that worries that the deal may fail. Sell the Jan 2015 15 calls. Collect 33 cents each. Option 1, the stock backs off and deal disolves, you keep the 33 cents. Option 2, the deal goes thru at 13.65, and you keep the 33 cents. No matter how you look at it, you keep the 33 cents. What is NOT going to happen is a deal over 15. No magic offer will arrive to get shareholders one penny more than 13.65.</Msg><Username>cspanosmwc</Username><Timestamp>1369336808569</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 15:20:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369336942675-6</Id><Topic><Title>no deal with ichan dell deal in 6 months back to 12.00</Title><Username>ron.wallach</Username><Timestamp>1369070400278</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-20 13:20:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There is no chance that this deal for 13.65 fails. Its overly generous. No sane shareholder would not approve it. Carl and other dissenters will get their dividend and 13.65 and be done with it.
