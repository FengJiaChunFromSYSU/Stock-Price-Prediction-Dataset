Maybe a token .01 on the $15s and very little on the $14s. If however the market suspects $14 is a starting point then there will be premium left in both until it gets sorted out. Pay attention to the Implied Volatility. Your option platform should list it, if that collapses the price will collapse with it. The February Vol is roughly twice the March, so the market is pricing in a move in the near future.</Msg><Username>kevlar4christmas</Username><Timestamp>1359818030906</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 10:13:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359818945292-17</Id><Title>14.72 min bid shorts cover to 1557 to 1575</Title><Msg>ok</Msg><Username>ron.wallach</Username><Timestamp>1359818945292</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 10:29:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359818961012-18</Id><Topic><Title>First deal is not necessarily the final deal</Title><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1359754308804</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 16:31:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>DELL is the largest LBO in a while so its getting the attention.

I think selling calls at $14 against a long position is almost as close to a "no lose" trade as you can make. Assuming you are holding Dell anyway if the deal blows up and the stock goes back to $11-12 you could keep selling the calls at $13 and that's not a bad way to go.</Msg><Username>kevlar4christmas</Username><Timestamp>1359827028004</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 12:43:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359827542749-25</Id><Topic><Title>If there's an announcement on Monday...then what?</Title><Username>eightyeight222</Username><Timestamp>1359826256702</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 12:30:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Monday is only an offer to buy the stock at a specifc price.

I'm thinking your estimate might be pretty good and works also with the idea of the DCF value of Dell at $13.6 appearing in the WSJ plus the premium of 16% from insider shares that need not be compensated= $15.70. $15.70 x 1.46B shares float = 23B deal.

With that said, many sources are citing that Microsoft is willing to invest $3 billion into the privatization of DELL. The UK/domestic banks willing to finance the deal have announced $15 billion guaranteed loan. Reuters is reporting a deal around $13-$14. Barrons and Forbes are throwing around $15-$16. Sources are reporting that Microsoft $3 billion dollar stake are going to give Microsoft 10% control of the company. According to NASD, DELL has roughly 1.7 billion shares outstanding. Now if Microsoft receives a 10% stake for $3 billion, doesn't that equal the equivalent of a $30 billion dollar deal in order to go private. Simple math right? $30 billion / 1.7 billion shares = $17.64 share offer on the table? I personally think $17.64 is a tad high per share, however why throw Microsoft 10% of the company for $3 billion? A 10% stake for $2 billion would only be a $20 billion dollar deal or simply $11.76 a share. I think if you take the $17.64 + $11.76 (high/low spectrum), we would probably arrive at the median price of $14.70 for a final price. Many sources are throwing around Microsoft's expected 10% stake, however the numercial amounts are ranging from $2-3 billion investment.

About 70% of their DELL shares were acquired for less than $13. About 30% of their DELL shares were acquired for more than $13. I did not have time to run the actual prices paid with each firm as that would take a couple days. Some shares were acquired in the early/mid 90's, while many shares were acquired in the past 6/months when DELL was sinking. So if your looking for majority rules, I'm sure the 70% that are in the money would unload their shares between my $14.50-$14.70 range. Heck, this might even pull up another 10% that are in the losing (above $13 paid) either break-even or slightly in the money as well. I'm sure some would undeniably be happy with the $14.50-$14.70 range for break-even or even a slight gain. Why do these metrics matter? Simply said because anywhere from 75-85% shares would vote in favor of the deal. Per NASD us retail folks only control 8% of total DELL shares outstanding therefore we don't exactly have a say/vote in regard to these matters. Let's just hope it works out for everyone where we could all show green in our portfolios. Just my opinion of course.</Msg><Username>eurotyle</Username><Timestamp>1359838729930</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 15:58:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359838963314-41</Id><Topic><Title>Something wrong with the math here?</Title><Username>eurotyle</Username><Timestamp>1359837909703</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 15:45:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I agree.

But anyways - I don't believe taking reported media averages of pps buyout values is a reasonable strategy though I will acknowledge that they do set up expectations and do have perceived consequences if they aren't met. The key as you allude to, is to provide some comfort for those shareholders who bought high and mitigate lawsuits and bad press. But I am not persuaded in the merit of using those guestimates as a basis - they serve better in spiking interest in share purchaser and in generating expectations of 'fair' valuation among a minority of shareholders (those you ID as having bought above $13). Your valuation based on the MSFT investment is more convincing. I don't think MSFT will throw in $3B because if it is to have a 10% stake, it seems a $30B deal is over-the-top and based on float shares would amount to a pps of almost $20 and I have not heard of any credible estimate that high. I think the most realistic and actuarial basis for starting with an estimate of pps buyout would be to consult the discounted cash flow model reported in the WSJ which results in an implied equity value of 13.60 a share. I think that is the lowest basis and believe any 'fiduciary premium' (FP) would be added to that. In the absence of a FP, the deal will be done for 13.60 per share and there will be considerable threats to litigate the process as well as much bad press - both of which are worth money to avoid. It would be a pretty negative legacy for Michael Dell to cash out shareholders at a pps that reflects the deflating effect of poor management for the last decade. So I do think though that shareholder compensation will likely reflect a 'fiduciary premium' and the question is really how much is that premium and where does the money for it come from? I think M. Dell and insiders who retain their interest in the new private Dell will not be having their shares purchased. After all, they will keep their original shares, and why not? The other equity investors will have shares commensurate with M. Dell's retaining majority control, so his 16% has to somehow become 51%. And I think that 16% is a very interesting number. It might reflect the FP for Dell shareholders. Simple, it is $13.60 + FP of 16% = $15.80. In other posts I also offered alternative back of the envelope methods of 'guestimating' the buyout pps but as of this writing I think $15.80 is my favored estimate, with the most likely range being 15.50-16.50 - allowing the FP to range from 12% - 20%.</Msg><Username>ae_savant</Username><Timestamp>1359843971275</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 17:26:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359844019304-63</Id><Title>they my veiw to stockholders ok deal 15.00 ok</Title><Msg>ok</Msg><Username>ron.wallach</Username><Timestamp>1359844019304</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 17:26:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359844082142-64</Id><Topic><Title>Something wrong with the math here?</Title><Username>eurotyle</Username><Timestamp>1359837909703</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 15:45:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So sorri, looks like Ron wallace jinxed this deal and it will be $13.50......

Why would M. Dell who has 16% of shares receive any compensation above a majority stake of the new business? His shares would form the core around which the other equity investors would obtain proportionate interests based on their capital contributions to buy out shareholders. Other small-time insiders of course would be free to sell their shares, but they amount to a pittance compared to M. Dell's and the float.</Msg><Username>ae_savant</Username><Timestamp>1359844812982</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 17:40:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359844989049-73</Id><Topic><Title>My Basis Disclosure and Estimate</Title><Username>andrewsubk</Username><Timestamp>1359823093818</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 11:38:13 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Mr. Dell needs to pay for his Dreamliner.

I'm not disputing your statement, however they could also say they're willing to pay $30/a share. First question is can they afford to $30? Not at all. Could they line up financing to pay $30? Probably not. Could you line up financing for $15/share is the key question. They stated they were green-lighted for $15 billion. Microsoft wants $3 billion, Michael Dell owns 16% of all shares, which equals to $3.55 billion (per closing price on Friday). These three numbers equal $21.55 billion. Minus a billion for Microsoft and let's assume $2 billion, you're looking at $20.55 billion. MSFT's $2-$3 billion has been tossed around, but a more key critical number being tossed around is Microsoft wants that 10% say-so in the new company. Possibly to keep DELL real to their products, possibly to keep their products pre-loaded on DELL's systems. Maybe to use MSFT's office suite instead of DELL jumping to something more open-sourced like Android/Google Office Apps. There's undeniably some motive there and that's surely going to help shareholders in this arranged deal. Question being, aside from the $15 pre-approved financing, $2-3 billion from Microsoft and Michael's $3.55 billion stake. Where's the other money/loans coming from? These three factors only total $20.55 to $21.55 billion (varies depending on MSFT's $2 or $3 billion investment). Granted DELL has roughly $9-$10 billion in hard cash on their balance sheet. Let's assume they borrow a higher credit line against 1/2 ($4.5 to $5 billion) of DELL's cash on hand (then simply pay down the extra loan for the same amount once privatized). DELL would start fresh being a private company with $4.5 to $5 billion in cash. Now's your looking at: Microsoft Investment: $2 or $3 billion Michael DELL's stake: $3.55 billion (could hit $3.75-$4.00 depending on price) Silver Lake Capital: $15 billion loan Silver Lake Capital $5 billion loan (contingent to 1/2 cash balance): $5 billion This would be about $25.55 to $26.55 billion. Divided this by 1.7 billion shares: $25.55 / divided by 1.7b = $15.03 $26.55 / divided by 1.7b = $15.61 I personally don't see them going this route, especially burning through 1/2 their cash (as a retainer if you may) to simply finance the higher price. I'll stick to my $14.50 to $14.70 prediction. Silver Lake would over-extend themselves by existing using cash flows.</Msg><Username>eurotyle</Username><Timestamp>1359845641409</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 17:54:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359845877700-75</Id><Topic><Title>Something wrong with the math here?</Title><Username>eurotyle</Username><Timestamp>1359837909703</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 15:45:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Not trying to sound rude, but if there's a deal Monday, sell at open b/c there's about a 85-90% chance that it will be the best your going to received.

If Silver Lake pressed to bid $15 a share, they only way they could do it would be as a contingency to borrow half against the $9-$10 billion cash on hand. Then simply repay this once privatizing is completed. See my previous post on this thread. This wouldn't even actually get the share buyout price to $15 ($14.70 tops). It wouldn't make sense for anyone, especially DELL. Dell probably needs about $6-$8 billion to retool and gun for some private/public acquisition to counter moves by HP, Oracle and IBM. I'm a shareholder here, but I do not think we'll even see $15. If we see $15 even, we are truly blessed.</Msg><Username>eurotyle</Username><Timestamp>1359846115209</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 18:01:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359846756859-77</Id><Topic><Title>Something wrong with the math here?</Title><Username>eurotyle</Username><Timestamp>1359837909703</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 15:45:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Savant, I understand what you're referring to however as an FYI remember 70% of all DELL shares held by investment banks/funds were acquired for less than $13. Only 30% of all shares were acquired above $13. It's hard to tell exacts, but what if, and it's simply a what if half of that 30% were bought between $13.01 to $14.99? Throw in Michael Dell's 16% stake and your clearly going to green light a deal at any price really. Most would be undeniably tendered. Retail only owns 8% of all shares. I imagine probably 50-60% of these shares are much higher than $15 per share. The patient longs who bought higher will be the only losers here. It's either do a deal and cash out for slightly more than you had the day/week/month before or watch this falter back to sub-$9, then have someone like Oracle swoop in and pay a measly $12/a share (at which point would be a 25-30% premium. Would you take the lesser premium now or the higher premium later?

That would be a handsome $15 ps from my perspective. And you are right that a bidding war may ensue that could paradoxically produce a lower pps than the original offer. I do think anything less than $15 would draw a red flag and be a costly PR and litigation blunder. Maybe $15 is enough to mitigate that or maybe the principals want to have a larger margin of safety to forestall such criticism?

I have no relation to any talks of any parties involved. I'm simply a finance guy by nature (BBA/MBA/experience). Silver Lake would no way be able to swing a $20 billion credit line without a prior contingency plan in place to tap DELL's cash reserves once it goes private. There goes the special dividend for all you hoping for it. My prediction is $14.50 to $14.70 a share. How do we get there exactly, not quite sure. Could be combination of all-cash deal or even using a portion of DELL's cash as a special dividend. For anyone's guess, we might get $14.50 a share in cash and a or get $13.20 a share in cash and special dividend in the amount of $1.20 (using $2 billion of DELL's cash). This still amounts of $14.50 no matter how many times you clip the scenario. I haven't actually crunched the numbers regarding the cash divided scenario. I personally do not see it as viable. Might happen, might not. It if were to happen, it wouldn't be for more than 20% of DELL's cash.</Msg><Username>eurotyle</Username><Timestamp>1359847404998</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 18:23:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359847791023-80</Id><Topic><Title>Something wrong with the math here?</Title><Username>eurotyle</Username><Timestamp>1359837909703</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 15:45:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Savant, Exactly. They want to do this as quickly and quietly as possible without an ongoing risk of litigation which will slow down the process. Another bidder stepping up to the plate would seriously rock.

I would pay to see this occur (albeit one problem, we are a little big therefore our suitors are limited).

However, there are other issues: The investment bankers must be convinced that they can make a big return since the risk is so great. A company's worth is what it can return in the future. Keep in mind that this buyout is to effect/cause a change in the direction of the company. That is a huge risk for everyone: the bankers, MSFT, and the Institutions. MSFT is going to a make an investement only if it will have a longterm beneficial effect on MSFT. And what that means is having a say on product developement and marketing, and longterm direction. MSFT is not interested in helping Dell; their only concern is helping MSFT. Do not think they want to be Michaels banker. Steve Balmer is a huge isssue for this deal to work. That is going to be a problem for Michael and Dell's customers.I have a problem understanding how this deal, then partnership, can be equally beneficial to both Dell and MSFT. One of the biggest issues is making sure the Institutional Investors will sell at the offer price. I believe that is what is happen now and is the biggest obsticule. You can bet that before an offer is made some of the biggest Institutions are being courted to be sure they will sell. Dell will not make an offer unless the Institutions are committed. The lawyers are talking 24/7 to see at what price they will commit to sell. I believe that at least one or two or three of the largest Institutions are being asked to stay in, that is, not be a part of the sellers. That allows Michael to become majority shareholder without having to come up with all the cash. That is a big risk. However, that might allow Dell to go private without MSFT, i.e. without Balmer. I do not think this deal will get done unless some of the largest Institutional stay in and I do not see how Michael can do a deal that allows MSFT to be a partner.

For example, not much risk to banks because they will have Dell's great cash flow business as collateral. Microsoft is lending money, as a bank would , to earn interest or interest-type income on its money. Dell is a significant Microsoft customer, and making what is in effect a financial loan to Dell makes good business sense. "Institutional investor" is a fancy term which usually means nothing more than a retail-type stock buyer. Lots of "insititutional investors" only own a few thousand shares of a given stock.
