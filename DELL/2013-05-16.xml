It is an undiscovered gem with the most rapidly improving fundamentals on the NASDAQ today! CCUR could potentially double within the next 2-3 weeks! CCUR's EPS has been soaring faster than any other small-cap tech stock with their quarterly GAAP EPS increasing over the past twelve months on a quarter-to-quarter basis from $0.02, to $0.04, to $0.08, and to $0.11 this past quarter, for total growth of 450% this past year - yet only one no name analyst covers the stock. CCUR is currently trading for $7.09 per share with 8.75mm o/s, a market cap of $62.07mm, cash on hand of $22.37mm, an enterprise value of $39.7mm, and sales of $63.23mm. CCUR is the #1 VOD and multi-screen technology provider for cable TV companies with countless BILLION dollar clients like Time Warner Cable, Cox, Charter, Rogers, and Virgin Media. CCUR's breakthrough CDN platform allows cable TV companies to combine their classic VOD systems with their new IP-based networks to deliver on demand content to tablets, smartphones, and other IP connected devices, while quickly and cost-effectively increasing the amount of VOD content they can offer their customers. CCUR's CDN platform this week started streaming VOD content to iOS and Android smartphones/tablets of Time Warner Cable's 12 million+ video subscribers! CCUR's top competitors are Seachange (SEAC), which has gross margins of 52% and an enterprise value/revenue ratio of 1.65, and Harmonic (HLIT), which has gross margins of 46% and an enterprise value/revenue ratio of 0.90. CCUR has larger gross margins of 59% yet it has a shockingly low enterprise value/revenue ratio of 0.63. CCUR's trailing twelve month GAAP EPS is now up to a record high of $0.25 while SEAC and HLIT both have negative trailing twelve month GAAP EPS! CCUR could rapidly rise to a new 52-week high of over $9 to match HLIT's ratio and $14.47 to match SEAC's ratio! Research CCUR tonight, it will be the best decision of your life!</Msg><Username>rblatuis</Username><Timestamp>1368733084889</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 15:38:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368733667029-16</Id><Title>pray they beat and deal get done with carl! 15.00 ok</Title><Msg>that it</Msg><Username>ron.wallach</Username><Timestamp>1368733667029</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 15:47:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368734389771-17</Id><Title>15.31 the high from last year at this time!may 16,2012,</Title><Msg>ok</Msg><Username>ron.wallach</Username><Timestamp>1368734389771</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 15:59:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368734562534-18</Id><Topic><Title>pray they beat and deal get done with carl! 15.00 ok</Title><Username>ron.wallach</Username><Timestamp>1368733667029</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 15:47:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Beat?

Leaving the bond holders and banks to take a 8 billion dollar loss on a bankrupt company. The shareholders may get an extra 50 cents in a year over the 13.65 offer, but the company and its leadership dissolve by 2015. There is NO WAY the committee will approve that deal.

But I couldn't short the stock because people are hanging on for a buyout. I mean, the stock hardly dropped at all. It doesn't pay to short at $13.40 and buy the stock back at $13.35 Alternatively, I can't buy the stock because I could very well end up overpaying. I know there was an offer for $13.65 but with each disastrous earnings, the buyout price could go down. If I buy at $13.43 and the offer drops to $13.35 per share, I just lost money I wouldn't invest in Dell because I love PCs. I'd invest in Dell because I want to make money. And at this point, it's impossible to figure this thing out. Good luck to everyone regardless of how you're approaching this stock.

Alexa also posted Instagram snapshots of younger brother Zachary Dell sitting on a private jet with a remarkable food spread before him as he prepared to go on vacation to Fiji. The picture showed up on the Tumblr page “Rich Kids of Instagram,” which celebrates — and mocks — the lifestyles of young 1-percenters.

There is definitive answer as to where this is heading, but like you said, it has become frustrating to track the stock. For that, I am betting on more institutional holders like T.Rowe to start leaving the stock. Either way, if Icahn gets an upper hand at any point in the coming few weeks, M.Dell could walk away and burn the stock. The downside : This will go back to $8-9 based on today's figures. The upside : The $13.65 promised buy out price, maybe a few ticks higher. Hence why I'm short - the reward is higher than the risk at this price level. Long term: I would hold the stock if their enterprise unit keeps growing the way it has been.</Msg><Username>btb101</Username><Timestamp>1368757995590</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 22:33:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368762345878-68</Id><Title>need stockbuy back mike!if want the buy back shock please it the right thing to do so please do it bev that work for you!</Title><Msg>13.70!</Msg><Username>ron.wallach</Username><Timestamp>1368762345878</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 23:45:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368762619519-69</Id><Title>bust dell up like back in 1993!13.70 open you get company mike so start buy it!thankyou mike standing ovation man!</Title><Msg>13.70</Msg><Username>ron.wallach</Username><Timestamp>1368762619519</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 23:50:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message></Date>
