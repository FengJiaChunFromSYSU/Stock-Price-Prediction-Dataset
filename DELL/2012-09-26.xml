Since then, the lack of quality across all products lines, (except for the servers whose design was done by INTC in Hillsboro,) has been the hallmark of the Dell name. Packaged with MS Windows, a Dell machine is a pretty potent combination of awful hardware and software all in the same box. Does Quanta still design Dell laptops in Taipei or did they find some other hack shop to do the deed? I remember Quanta engineers chopping huge chunks of BIOS out because they didn't want to spend the extra few cents for a bigger flash part.</Msg><Username>vinnie_baggadonitz</Username><Timestamp>1348667222636</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 09:47:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348667411172-6</Id><Topic><Title>Bought more DELL shares at $9.8</Title><Username>king_kim_1</Username><Timestamp>1348667201290</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 09:46:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I also bought more at 9.8....it's either a great value or value trap...IT has become like a self-sustaining organism...it always needs to be fed and maintained</Msg><Username>jwsull</Username><Timestamp>1348667411172</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 09:50:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348667418475-7</Id><Title>Only retard would not take advantage of this buying opportunity</Title><Msg>Only retard would not take advantage of this buying opportunity</Msg><Username>king_kim_1</Username><Timestamp>1348667418475</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 09:50:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348667418714-8</Id><Title>Only retard would not take advantage of this buying opportunity</Title><Msg>Only retard would not take advantage of this buying opportunity</Msg><Username>king_kim_1</Username><Timestamp>1348667418714</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 09:50:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348667499823-9</Id><Topic><Title>End of quarter window dressing, nothing more</Title><Username>o08o.ugh64w</Username><Timestamp>1348620717222</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-25 20:51:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Seeking to understand.... you had sold cov. calls with a $10 strike?
