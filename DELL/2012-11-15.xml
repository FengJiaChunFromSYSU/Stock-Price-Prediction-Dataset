New to Dell, (owned it in the 90's quite successfully) but am wondering if I should move some of my remaining money from DMND (clusterphuque recently) and pick up some Dell here. Unless there's a reason the hardware maker is falling off a cliff, I can't imagine the name brand dying.

In fact it seems that DeskTop volumes were stable and the LapTop/Notebooks were hurt by Tablets, which makes good sense as you can not do serious IT on a tablet, but you can use the Tablet as a Mobility Device.... Now we have Windows 8 Tablet and Convertibles and as the economy improves in Europe and in the US, we will see our sales and earnings pick up like any other business.... So hang in there, enjoy the dividend as the economy has bottomed in the US, Europe and China.</Msg><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1353021095381</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 18:11:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353021963604-51</Id><Topic><Title>The Earnings are as expected and all is priced in.....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1353021095381</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 18:11:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I agree as the shorts were blaming the wrong product and now that DELL has Tablets with vast Enterprise clients that were buying AAPL Tablets, we will start eating into APPL's market share on Tablets as we can package DeskTops and Tablets and sell direct without any retail eating into our margins.

The fact is that Tablets will kill the consumer PCs and Laptops for the folks who do not need serious computing or they will use their Smartphones.... The advantage DELL has is that 90% of its business is Enterprise and granted that many people opted not to refresh their Laptops and bought Tablets during the past year so our sales were down.... Now Windows 8 is here, we have many Tablets for Enterprise and Consumer markets and that the main driver will be our loyal customers buying our Tablets and as some WILL "finally" decide to upgrade their PCs from Windows XP with touch capabilities, the rest of this Jazz will be ALL history.... At this point AAPL is at risk of getting killed by MSFT, DELL, INTC, HPQ, NOKIA et al as both its consumer and business clients will be having a lot more options to choose from.... Finally, we have another $4.5 billion cash still remaining from the stock buyback program, US/Europe and China's economies have bottomed out and that growth in IT spending would be a major part of the path forward.

Dell’s enterprise solution strategy continued to show positive results with server and networking revenue increasing 11 percent year over year. “We are consistently executing our end-to-end solutions strategy for the benefit of our customers,” said Michael Dell, Chairman and CEO. “In the quarter, we completed the acquisition of Quest Software which – along with other recent acquisitions like SonicWALL and Wyse – adds leading management, security, virtualization and cloud capabilities to our expanding portfolio of powerful solutions.” “In a difficult global IT spending environment we saw solid proof points that demonstrate progress in our strategy,” said Brian Gladden, Dell CFO. “A highlight has been the strong progress of our newly introduced servers, with our server and networking business up 11 percent. We’re also encouraged by early interest in our new Windows 8 touch portfolio and the opportunities it creates for our commercial and consumer businesses. ” Mr. Gladden added that strong cash flow from operations generated over the past two years continued with $1.3 billion in the quarter and, combined with a strong cash position this fiscal year, helped enable Dell to invest in new capabilities and return almost $900 million year to date to shareholders through the company’s recently adopted dividend and share repurchases. Results •Revenue in the quarter was $13.7 billion, an 11 percent decrease from the previous year as desktop and mobility revenue contracted. •GAAP operating income for the quarter was $589 million, or 4.3 percent of revenue. Non-GAAP operating income was $886 million, or 6.5 percent of revenue. •GAAP earnings per share in the quarter was 27 cents, down 45 percent from the previous year; non-GAAP EPS was 39 cents, down 28 percent. Cash flow from operations in the quarter was $1.3 billion. Dell ended the quarter with $14.2 billion in cash and investments. contentDOTdellDOTcom/us/en/corp/d/secure/2012-11rtewq155-133pr.aspx</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1353028964977</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 20:22:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353032373744-62</Id><Topic><Title>Well, I hope we get some analysts downgrades so I get buy more even cheaper.</Title><Username>jimmmeycrackcorn</Username><Timestamp>1353027861363</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 20:04:21 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think you will get your wish tomorrow.

We will have a deal on taxes soon and the economy will grow and people buy more stuff, computers, tablets, laptops or any toy they think they need. No worries on DELL as when the IT spending resumes, all will fall in place and with Windows 8 replacing Windows XP, Vista and Windows 7, we will see a lot of corporate and consumer refresh.</Msg><Username>longsrboss</Username><Timestamp>1353033779558</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 21:42:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353034041915-64</Id><Title>Michael, don't you wish you had a Made In America</Title><Msg>label.</Msg><Username>wallysucks</Username><Timestamp>1353034041915</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 21:47:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353035111187-65</Id><Topic><Title>Well, I hope we get some analysts downgrades so I get buy more even cheaper.</Title><Username>jimmmeycrackcorn</Username><Timestamp>1353027861363</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 20:04:21 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>jcrack.i like your style. as you and a fellow poster said no surprise if we get downgraded.heck we may even get upgraded. stranger things have happened this week ala fb going up big on lockup exp. date.Reading the cc transcipt i am not so sure downgrades are coming tomm.The stock basically went up on 2 not so good days.y esterday and today. we could get an upgrade on what you pointed out. p/e and div yld.If they can buyback tomm i think we will see some.did not do in 3q due to big acq. maybe we will get a div increase. stranger things have happened</Msg><Username>bidenboy</Username><Timestamp>1353035111187</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 22:05:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353036336011-66</Id><Title>Don't understand the need for lines of credit and commercial paper with $14b in cash....</Title><Msg>This I don't understand: "I would say there are several things we are doing from a planning standpoint, especially on the treasury side to ensure that we are in a position to have appropriate access to liquidity," Gladden said, adding that Dell is making sure it has access to lines of credit and commercial paper.</Msg><Username>jimmmeycrackcorn</Username><Timestamp>1353036336011</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 22:25:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353037707548-67</Id><Topic><Title>Don't understand the need for lines of credit and commercial paper with $14b in cash....</Title><Username>jimmmeycrackcorn</Username><Timestamp>1353036336011</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 22:25:36 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>i think its good business to have it especially when our current ratio on the #$%$ is not that great</Msg><Username>bidenboy</Username><Timestamp>1353037707548</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 22:48:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353038489649-68</Id><Title>Negative tangible value?</Title><Msg>Seriously, how can a company that has been making billions of dollars a year in profits every year for 20 years have a negative tangible value?
