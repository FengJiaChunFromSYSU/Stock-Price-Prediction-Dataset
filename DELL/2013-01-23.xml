On January 4, ITT announced that it had reached a $46M settlement with Sallie Mae (SLM) over the latter company's lawsuit related to underperforming loans whose risk the companies had agreed to share. ITT said the deal would reduce its Q4 earnings per share by 56c. ITT has $500M of additional loans that could also perform below the company's estimates, Samford wrote. As a result, the company may have to make more payments related to underperforming loans and take more write-downs, the analyst believes. ITT will be saddled with$15M-$25M in annual charges and cash payments as a result of higher default rates, predicted Samford, adding that the company could report results below analysts' consensus estimates. The analyst slashed his price target on the stock to $13 from $24.</Msg><Username>wall_st_knight_mare</Username><Timestamp>1358955200781</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 10:33:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358955604701-28</Id><Title>CNBC Pumping of Dell Over?</Title><Msg>Ponzi Network!

Losing share, decreased earnings and failed products right and left. They tried and failed to join the smartphone market, the tablet market, etc and every attempt was squashed by Apple. They have no choice but to accept a PE bid and regroup without the visibility that a public company has to conform to. Having said all that what makes anyone think that PE will pay up for Dell? If anything I think this will be a take-under from the current PPS. All the closed door meetings now are to entice the larger holders to vote yes. They will be given some other form of compensation for this vote. More importantly, they won't have to watch their holding here plummet back to the single digits. As is always the case, the small individual investor will lose. Just a sad but simple truth.</Msg><Username>finalfor28</Username><Timestamp>1358956053971</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 10:47:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358956460008-30</Id><Title>whats next....</Title><Msg>CERP</Msg><Username>stocksthe</Username><Timestamp>1358956460008</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 10:54:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358956714314-31</Id><Title>Its amazing how many trades are going through in this tight range.</Title><Msg>It gently moved higher yesterday on same volume, now holding steady.</Msg><Username>jcljack25</Username><Timestamp>1358956714314</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 10:58:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358956783224-32</Id><Topic><Title>Its amazing how many trades are going through in this tight range.</Title><Username>jcljack25</Username><Timestamp>1358956714314</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 10:58:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>HFT my friend, HFT ...

My name is Colleen Ohler. I am a purchasing agent for a production company is Scappoose Oregon. And I have been trying to get a computer from your company for 7 weeks now. And I need your help. We are a small company and have all Dell computers here. In fact, we just got 7 new ones last year. We only had one to update and I placed a purchase order with the Small Business section of Dell on the 4th of December. I was told when I originally ordered it that it would be three days. They just put it into production and we would get it fast. I said that was fine as long as it billed in 2012. I had no communication from Dell until I called on the 21st of December to get the status on my 3 day build and I spoke to Timothy Deffebaugh. I was told they didn’t know why but my computer order had been internally cancelled two or three times. I can’t remember which. Timothy said he would get right on it and make sure it was taken care of and it would take 3 days to build. We discussed the speed I needed it as it was almost the end of the year and I needed it billed out in 2012. He said he would expedite it and even though we were closed from the 22nd until the 2nd he would be sure it was shipped so it was billed. And we would get it when we got back. Needless to say, it wasn’t sent. I contacted Timothy after we returned on the 2nd to find out the ETA and what was going on. He told me it was being made overseas and that as soon as they received it, it would be overnighted to me at no cost as they had messed up and not gotten it done. It was not even billed in 2012. The computer finally arrived stateside and I was given a tracking number by Timothy. I checked the number and called him as it showed it would not arrive until the 12th and it shipped on the 6th. He notified me that he hadn’t gotten the information in soon enough to have it ship fast and so it was coming ground. Never mind that the order was placed on the 4th of December. There wasn’t time to get it entered before it shipped. The shipping and receiving date hardly matter as when the computer arrived, not only was the screen not the touch screen I ordered, but the computer locked up to the point where it wasn’t usable. This was on the day it was taken out of the box. I called and spoke to Timothy again. I was told I needed to call Dell Support regarding the locking up problem. And that I would have to sit on hold for a while since I hadn’t purchased the Dell Support Plus plan. If I had purchased the plan, I would be able to talk to someone right away. Mind you, this computer was costing $3152.93. This is 200.00 more than the Dell site said it would. But because I was going through Small Business and was being taken such good care of….I figured that is how I should be going. He did tell me that next time I ordered a Dell I would get a great discount due to all of the problems we had during this order. Not this time….next time. I was pretty fed up by this time and finally was able to get ahold of Timothy’s manager. His name is David Whyatt. He apologized profusely, sent my info to the returns department and told me he would get all of this fixed for me. He would make it right. I thought I was getting somewhere now…..I was wrong. He sent me a quote that matched all of the items I had sent him on the original order. Mind you, when I ordered this originally from Timothy, I had scanned in a list, description, price, and part number of all of the features I needed the computer to have so he would have everything. David got everything entered into my order and as a way of taking care of me, he gave me a discount and added the Support Plus at no additional charge. He even rushed it through and sent it overnight shipping. The second computer was received here last week. We removed it from the box to find it was a 20” instead of 27”. I called David who was apologizing again and said he had no idea how this happed and he would fix it right away. He did re-order it right away and I received the 3rd computer within two days. We didn’t even bother to remove it from the box as it was once again the 20” instead of the 27” we ordered. I e-mailed David and told him this was beyond ridiculous. He apologized again and said he would get to the bottom of this. I have been e-mailing him for 3 days and last night he finally found out what the problem was. He said that the computer had a sku number in that was incorrect and the people building the system didn’t look at the description of the computer, just the number. He would look into how to fix that problem and get back to me. This morning I e-mailed him for a status update and he wrote back that he can’t even get this system for us. We have to get it from Consumer Division. REALLY????? I mean REALLY????? I wrote back and said now I have to wait another 6 weeks and pay $3100.00 for the computer I ordered in December. I still haven’t even gotten credit for the 1st computer that was picked up. I still have two wrong ones sitting here and no info to return them. So basically I’ve put out almost NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS and don’t have a computer. Nor do I have credit. Can I tell you how fed up I am? David wrote back that he would see if he could find someone for me in the Consumer Division to help us out on the price and shipping. I told him I wasn’t putting out another penny to you folks until I got credit. I’m ready to cry! This has been beyond bad service….Just typing this all out is raising my blood pressure! I just hung up on a phone call from Timothy telling me that he would e-mail me a coupon good for employees so I could get 17% off of the 4th new computer. That was the best he could do. Still no contact in the consumer division and no credit. Dell use to be a company you could depend on. If you ordered it, you got it, fast and right the 1st time. I tell you, I don’t want to have to place a FOURTH order. We are looking into another brand of computer. The aggravation has been beyond anything that a company should be put through, especially since we have been such a faithful customer.

Worst screen I've ever seen on a laptop. It has atrocious viewing angles, dead pixels, and a large blotch of bad screen uniformity that looks like something pinched the screen at the bottom. It goes back to Best Buy tonight, and I hope they throw the piece of junk back in Dell's lap. QC on these screens is far too lax if this piece of junk got through. It's too bad too, because the computer runs well, has excellent sound. But, it's a laptop and I have to look at that hideous screen, which isn't going to happen. Why let otherwise quality components be ruined by cheap monitors? Don't get it, but I hope Microsoft does and will have some input into fixing this company. Dell is a fine brand, but QC is starting to really be a drag on consumer confidence. I'm very reluctant to give them another shot. I little trust that I'm getting quality for my money. This is why they're struggling, and people are willing to pay twice as much for Apple products. Having peace of mind when spending over $1k on a computer, is worth a premium.</Msg><Username>s_keltner</Username><Timestamp>1358969221163</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 14:27:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358969347885-55</Id><Topic><Title>remember whatever the price it will trade 50c - a buck higher -- for go shop provision and also give Michael a chance to up the deal a little</Title><Username>kalkid420</Username><Timestamp>1358964709616</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 13:11:49 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Disagree, case in point is Nabisco.

The article adeptly points out, what cnbc, and most of the financial rags conveniently omit. There is a serious conflict of interest here, people. There is no way around it. I understand many of you are only interested in your short-term profit. If you can make 50 cents on an option, you couldn't care less about a conflict of interest. But remember what goes around comes around. Next time you might get the short end of the stick in dealing with an unethical CEO or corrupt insiders. So think about this. Most of us know the stock market is hugely unfair. The flow of information is totally lopsided. The only way to mitigate the unfair access to inside information is to invest long-term. Additionally, there are laws on the books to prevent insider trading. People go to jail for insider trading. But this buyout goes beyond the already extreme unfairness inherent in the market with respect to insider information. Shareholders are now being forced to sell "when the man who knows the most about the company, Michael Dell, is buying," as the article so adeptly states. And there is more, so even if you still see no conflict of interest or unfairness, remember, Michael Dell, the ultimate insider in this case, and in the midst of his massive insider trading binge (or private equity buyout as cnbc likes to politely call it), also gets to set the price at which shareholders must sell. Now, do you see any conflict of interest here? If you still don't see any conflict of interest, you might want to check into a nearby hospital and request a brain scan, because you might be legally brain dead and didn't realize it. I tell you, people, this whole deal is about to hit the rocks very soon. Many of the financial rags, many commentators on CNBC, politicians and judges, hedge funds, will continue to fawn over Michael Dell (he is a billionaire, after all, and he is like a celebrity in the financial world). He can do no wrong in their minds. But if challenged in court, and if you can find a mature fair minded judge or jury who are not star struck, the case against Dell will be very strong. In fact, the case will be so strong, the judge might order a psychiatric evaluation of Michael Dell to see if he is sane. The only way around this, is for Dell to make an offer that is acceptable to the majority of all shareholders, not just the shareholders with "insider information." If the offer is not acceptable to all shareholders in general, then Dell will have to deal with many lawsuits from many directions on many points of law for many years to come.</Msg><Username>investor606</Username><Timestamp>1359001840249</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 23:30:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
