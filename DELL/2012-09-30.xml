I have traded DELL recently bought at 10.50 and sold at 10.83 and I am back at 9.81 now just on RSI and a quick trade possible. May turn long when I will see some meaningful support. Short term, DOW/Nasdaq are over-priced and we will probably correct these next few weeks...Which means that DELL will probably test 8's or lower before we will see a meaningful support. Momentum is awful, look at the chart although RSI is BULLISH in the short term so, hence my purchase. DELL is facing a lack of interest and probably some deep endemic "situation" that will take many months/years to correct if even possible? Look around the Techno-World is changing and DELL must re-invent itself and it has a very narrow window of opportunity to do so. It may be already too late? DELL is like anything else in this World and found itself at the end of a cycle that could mean its possible death. Then prepare for more struggle down the road...One day at the time. My 2 cents Good luck,</Msg><Username>bigblue904034</Username><Timestamp>1348997926166</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-30 05:38:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349023499295-2</Id><Topic><Title>Dell has $5.3 billion share repurchase program as of August 31/2012 (Source 10-Q)</Title><Username>longsrboss</Username><Timestamp>1348962726221</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 19:52:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Your arguments are typical trader/broker talk without considering the fact that Dell has already started re-inventing itself by investing in software as it closed another deal on Friday and has plans for another dozen acquistions in the near to mid-term.... We have respectable cash flow/dividend, a large cash pile and that management will start large share buyback now that we are trading in single digits.... The fears over PCs are overblown as the main problem is AAPL's valuation that is creating a downdraft with DELL and HPQ.</Msg><Username>longsrboss</Username><Timestamp>1349023499295</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-30 12:44:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349025342157-3</Id><Topic><Title>Dell has $5.3 billion share repurchase program as of August 31/2012 (Source 10-Q)</Title><Username>longsrboss</Username><Timestamp>1348962726221</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 19:52:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I wish you good luck but just be careful DELL up or down will not change my holding much...In my opinion only, you are NOT looking at the picture objectively and it will cost you money in the long run. As always time will tell... If you have an average under $10 you may be able to make some profit down the road if the Company can refresh its image but so far I do not see really how? Heard the same argument with DELL when it was at $15 and I was selling out. At the time I was predicting $11 with possible $9 if I remember correctly...We are at $9 now but the economy is going to hit a brick wall in US as we are closing to the debt debate and Europe is getting deeper in recession. Just this global forecast should tell you to be very careful because DELL will eventually follow the down trend. I see perhaps a support at 8.50 right now but not very sure... Just hoping that DELL will get back to 10.50 on technical soon before resuming its slow descent. Again it is only my opinion only Good luck,</Msg><Username>bigblue904034</Username><Timestamp>1349025342157</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-30 13:15:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349026919004-4</Id><Title>Bernanke aims to recapture Fed debate</Title><Msg>Last week the market sold off as Plosser, Phil. Fed Governor slammed the QE-III.... This should keep thelly alive. WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) — Federal Reserve Chief Ben Bernanke is likely to use a speech Monday to try to focus the market’s attention back on the central bank’s aggressive easing policy and away from the doubts about the policy, Fed watchers say. A report in The Wall Street Journal on Friday said Bernanke worked behind the scenes for weeks to get the bond-buys, colloquially known as QE3, approved by colleagues. The Fed’s interest-rate policy committee approved the program by an 11-1 vote. At the same time, the Fed also voted to push out the timing of its next interest-rate increase until mid-2015 and stressed it would hold to the guidance even as the economy recovers.

The market should bounce back nicely as I think HPQ will be guiding higher on Wed. and Intel will be cheerleading the Ultrabook, Cloud Computing et al and we should get back to above $10.50 this week.... Also it is significant to note that the Fed vote was 11-1 in favor of QE-3 and that Plosser was being a complete jerk crying over spilled milk. I would also expect some insider buying by DELL brass to boost confidence at this PPs.</Msg><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1349031336941</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-30 14:55:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349048156256-7</Id><Topic><Title>Bernanke aims to recapture Fed debate</Title><Username>longsrboss</Username><Timestamp>1349026919004</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-30 13:41:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes you are right as when Plosser started his attack, the Bears immediately called it "The Deep Division Inside the Fed" and cast doubt over whether if the E-III is real....
