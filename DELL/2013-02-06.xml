That 30% is more significant when you remove M. Dell's 14% position out of the vote! So even if half of them start raising a stink and the public gets wind the buyout might be in trouble. I think there will be a higher offer. If you read the protections put in by the board, it really does show the board did have the shareholders best interests in mind. I'm no expert but I think the offer will be closer to $15. Just think about it, SOUTHEASTERN ASSET MANAGEMENT has 7.5% of the stock. And for the minority vote, that stake is even higher. What do they have to lose by publicly saying they won't vote yes? It would be wrong not to try to get a higher price. Even if they get $1 more that is $130M more for their fund holders. They have nothing to lose. They even publicly said they feel it's worth around $20. It's been rumored Silver Lake would pay up to $15, so it would be foolish for any of these major holder not to push for $15. Disclaimer: I did buy some $14 calls. I'm speculating! I know I could lose my $$ on this. :)</Msg><Username>danstock2012</Username><Timestamp>1360156112898</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-06 08:08:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360157113641-24</Id><Topic><Title>This deal is by far done.</Title><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1360154859045</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-06 07:47:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There seems to be an re-occurring theme that if the shareholders vote no that it is a given that another larger offer will be forthcoming from Silver Lake et al.

First of all, we are currently in a waiting period termed "go shop" where other company's and, or, groups are welcome to make a purchase offer for the company. When no other offers materialize it is impossible to make the case that the current $13.65 offer is inadequate, as so many amateurs here seem to think. Second, voter participation in these type situations is typically about 5%. In other words, nearly all common stockholders choose not to make the effort to cast a vote. Smart money bought in here last year at prices from $9 to $10, where the stock traded for quite awhile. Those owners began taking their profits a couple of weeks ago, when rumors of the buyout pushed the stock up 20%. And the balance of people recognized their profit yesterday, once the deal was officially announced. The buy trades now are arbitrageurs buying in volume and looking to capitalize on the current ..20 to .25 cents on the difference from the current market trading price ($13.40) and the final deal price ($13.65). Hope this helps.</Msg><Username>bashfordcapital</Username><Timestamp>1360163185987</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-06 10:06:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360163847915-44</Id><Title>Strange trade Shorts allowed to cover low?</Title><Msg>What the hell is up, never seen a takeout offer trade like this... at this point I hope we get some rumor that the deal is not going through, that would take it to 11-13 pps range ...that would be buy time.

The chance of another buyer coming in between now and then is also priced into the mix.</Msg><Username>ppnp5</Username><Timestamp>1360166490243</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-06 11:01:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360166902268-53</Id><Title>Doesn't add up..</Title><Msg>So deal is valued at 24.4B. So it appears they are just buying the float of 1.47B shares at a total of $20.5B. So the remaining 285M shares are owned by the company and are financing the rest of this deal? What am I missing? So if another bidder wanted this they could most likely find the same financing from the bank but put up more cash (3.4B (M Dells stock) +.7B (M Dells cash) + 2B MSFT + 1.4B Silverlake = $7.5) say increase it by $500M ($8B cash required) puts it at $13.91 or adding $1B ($8.5B) put this at $14.18.

Clearly</Title><Msg>DOVER, Del. (AP) -- A lawsuit challenging plans to take troubled personal computer maker Dell Inc. private is being filed in Delaware. The lawsuit filed Wednesday claims that company founder Michael Dell and a group led by investment firm Silver Lake are trying to buy the Round Rock, Texas-based computer maker on the cheap for $24.4 billion, or $13.65 per share. The lawsuit was filed one day after the management-led leveraged buyout was announced. It accuses Michael Dell and company directors of breaching their fiduciary duties by failing to maximize shareholder value and selling the company at an inadequate price at the expense of minority shareholders. Anticipating resistance to the deal from stockholders, Dell's board has said other potential buyers will have 45 days for to submit higher bids.</Msg><Username>jaykam10</Username><Timestamp>1360190526492</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-06 17:42:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360191221024-83</Id><Topic><Title>Breach of fiduciary duty.

I dont think so. Hell no he wouldn't. He is two faced. The case against Dell will be strong. He has yet to offer an osstensible expanation as to why Dell needs to go private. Why does the company need to be sold? The answer, of course, is that it does not need to be sold. He just wants to buy it. That is the true impetus driving the sale. He just wants the profits he anticipates making in an eventual ipo.</Msg><Username>zillionaire_investor</Username><Timestamp>1360193543313</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-06 18:32:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360193608285-91</Id><Topic><Title>Shorts</Title><Username>lock_with_noway</Username><Timestamp>1360107723900</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 18:42:03 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Reports still coming in that more are exiting this world every day.</Msg><Username>lock_with_noway</Username><Timestamp>1360193608285</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-06 18:33:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360193862757-92</Id><Topic><Title>today was good</Title><Username>bashfordcapital</Username><Timestamp>1360193507839</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-06 18:31:47 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well, you're still here.

Law firms file suit so that they may join together and collect settlement fees paid by insurance companies. In the case of DELL I expect a dozen different lawsuits and law firms will be involved. In the end they will divy up about $2 million in fees, paid for by the insurance companies representing.. The law suits have nothing to do with changing the announced deal price of $13.65, negotiating money for common stockholders, or anything like that. Hope this helps.</Msg><Username>bashfordcapital</Username><Timestamp>1360205232300</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-06 21:47:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360205911624-118</Id><Topic><Title>Handling loss in IRA account</Title><Username>free2worry</Username><Timestamp>1360183050593</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-06 15:37:30 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Judy Judy Judy. !!!

Would not SEC ban a reissue of Dell public stock without an 100% reorganization? Is that not resissue controversial? I mean why isn't that suggestion of yours - reissuing the same paper in a later IPO like murder? What if it is murder and we just let this happen. I complaining about getting blamed for this. And I have more complaints just as controversial. You think this is good business like from college MBA? I disagree that this is smart business. I don't want a class action suit check, then reissue IPO. The whole "thing" is stupid and a shame. And I apologise for my gripe. But I still think there is something wrong with the business picture and I want if fixed. Or more complaints.</Msg><Username>slaptwins</Username><Timestamp>1360206991906</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-06 22:16:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360207258679-120</Id><Topic><Title>{EXCLUSIVE REPORT} DELL on SQUAWK BOX! {EXCLUSIVE REPORT}</Title><Username>estebanmoreno6756</Username><Timestamp>1360092497120</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 14:28:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>thank you was very helpful</Msg><Username>terrenecenewman</Username><Timestamp>1360207258679</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-06 22:20:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360207752067-121</Id><Topic><Title>Breach of fiduciary duty.

An English guy, Branson, knighted by HRH Elizabeth, selling to Liberty? That is not a PLC UK incorporation. So the money runs one way with Sir Branson and now runs the other way with equal flow with Liberty Media. You are kidding Mr. Professor! That is not capitalism Gentleman that is murder and what I post is true and beyond libel. Did Sir Branson sell the virginmobile? I do not know. So that makes a better business person using the news media and the college educated MBA s and lawyers. (my neighbors do not do news so I am not supposed to do news. I think that is indicative of some kind of NOT democratic system where I live) I think you guys, stockholders and especially hedge funders, get to be blamed for the misdemeanors and also some of the vice. Blame the ins and the holders for the overlarge salaries and what do you get. I think these two deals are more than enough evidence that there has been influence pedddling by that Metromedia and News Corp scandal of 1973. I swear it is true and it goes on and on. the election of 1996! bah humbug. wrong result. Sir Branson has the aerospace flight coming up so he needs the time to work on it. I am stockholder but I use a DRIP most of the time so I get sick of getting blamed for everything and anything! bye</Msg><Username>slaptwins</Username><Timestamp>1360207752067</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-06 22:29:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360207801611-122</Id><Title>what bidder wants another $53 billion revenue??

Like I said, the easier of the 2 is Roth, and Im not saying its the best thing to do, I was just answering the original posters question, and that answer is yes, there are ways. Close out all of your Roth IRA accounts and the total amount you receive has to be less than your basis in the account. The basis = the total amount youve contributed plus any money converted into a Roth minus any earlier withdrawals and blah blah blah. There are similar steps for traditional. Im no expert in this area at all, but there are ways for both. But quite frankly, its all mumbo jumbo to me.</Msg><Username>orieljudy</Username><Timestamp>1360212182018</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-06 23:43:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
