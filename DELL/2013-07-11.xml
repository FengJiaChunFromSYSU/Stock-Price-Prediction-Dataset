Approval needs a majority of the votes eligible to vote. No vote means a negative vote. Michael Dell's shares are excluded from voting. Therefore, for the proposal to fail, Icahn needs 50% of the eligible votes to vote no, or not vote at all. Icahn is now going for the appraisal rights. Appraisal rights will only be relevant if the buyout is approved. Therefore, even Icahn is thinking the proposal will pass. He is just saving face now. The upside ($14 - 13.65 = $0.35) is more than offset by the potential downside (appraisal could give a lower number than $13.65) plus the legal costs plus the interest cost to hold out for at least 60 days.</Msg><Username>oldtimer2013</Username><Timestamp>1373564421757</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 13:40:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373565037812-15</Id><Topic><Title>Deal will not be approved</Title><Username>suggp</Username><Timestamp>1373555956516</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 11:19:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Southeastern sold plenty of shares to Icahn at below $13.65.

My question is why ? Southeastern is nothing more than a disgruntled shareowner which paid too much for its DELL shares. Southeastern has no capability of helping itself (or other stock holders) in any way, other than voting yes to the current $13.65 buyout offer. Otherwise, DELL stock trades down to the $9.50 per share range and Southeastern's (as well as all stockholders) shares are worth about 30% less than they are today.
