We don't know how this will work out for Dell Inc., but it's definitely good for the Dell family. MessageOne was founded by Adam Dell, brother of Dell founder Michael Dell. MessageOne was owned, in part, by two investment funds, Impact Venture Partners and Impact Entrepreneurs Fund, both managed by Adam Dell. Michael Dell, his wife Susan, a trust for the Dell's minor children, and Michael Dell's parents are also investors in Impact.</Msg><Username>linfc1</Username><Timestamp>1348411420568</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-23 10:43:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348418697643-2</Id><Topic><Title>will dell bottom at $6-7?</Title><Username>kenberthiaume123</Username><Timestamp>1348267616005</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 18:46:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>at that price, xrx or hpq may want to take it over!</Msg><Username>linfc1</Username><Timestamp>1348418697643</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-23 12:44:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
