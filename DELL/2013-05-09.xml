I'm going to vote "yes" on the deal but it's undervalued either way. I'll take the easy 3% plus by the end of July with the vote. If not I'm comfortable getting more later.</Msg><Username>whiskycat26</Username><Timestamp>1368081490017</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 02:38:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368081605892-2</Id><Topic><Title>What is going on with DELL?</Title><Username>greymattermatters</Username><Timestamp>1367861020756</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 13:23:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Probably due to Window tweaking 8 or whatever they told you.</Msg><Username>whiskycat26</Username><Timestamp>1368081605892</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 02:40:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368108856836-3</Id><Topic><Title>DEAL!!</Title><Username>joeyd72</Username><Timestamp>1367868339359</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 15:25:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Based on the performance of dell stock price, it looks like no deal.</Msg><Username>linfc1</Username><Timestamp>1368108856836</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 10:14:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368123116319-4</Id><Topic><Title>If is wasn't the take-private biz going on, Dell will be $25</Title><Username>alexbbb33</Username><Timestamp>1368071509701</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 23:51:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Check what happened after no deal with BBY.

Dell's core business operational results are deteriorating and the new business line initiatives have failed to gain any materially significant traction. Without the current $13,65 buyout proposal, DELL shares would likely be trading in the $9.75 to $10.50 per share range right now. Hope this helps.</Msg><Username>bashfordcapital</Username><Timestamp>1368123756272</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 14:22:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368124820465-6</Id><Title>I hope Silver Lake has a back up plan.....</Title><Msg>Michael Dell is going to run this company into the ground. His only success is coming up with a strong supply chain to launch this company. Since then he has continued to move the pieces around the board and replace the players and with no success. Now he wants full control and is leveraging the company for debt to get out of the Wall Street scrutiny. I really hope Silver Lake has a plan for failure here because his M&amp;A success has been horrible and the company is headed for a cliff in the market outside of servers. This could bankrupt 2 companies with this much debt going bad. Yikes.</Msg><Username>kavack</Username><Timestamp>1368124820465</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 14:40:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368157769378-7</Id><Title>Carl Icahn is partnering with Southeastern Asset (8.4% stake) to wage a proxy battle to acquire...</Title><Msg>Carl Icahn is partnering with Southeastern Asset (8.4% stake) to wage a proxy battle to acquire Dell (DELL), CNBC reports. Icahn and Southeastern will reportedly offer $12/share in cash, and finance the rest of the deal with debt. No details yet on what the exact premium will be relative to Silver Lake and Michael Dell's $13.65/share LBO offer.
