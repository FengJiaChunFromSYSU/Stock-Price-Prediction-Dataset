Dell is badmouthing his own company and keep the price low so he can purchase it for the 13.65. He is not going to do anything to improve the company until he has private ownership. Why not make a deal to pay the 13.65 or a little less and then offer to share a little of wealth later on. Not going to happen. He wants to keep all the future profits for himself. Doing what he thinks is best for the shareholders? I don't think so.</Msg><Username>pet2401</Username><Timestamp>1364599254058</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-29 19:20:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364600385070-12</Id><Topic><Title>Dell is trying to drive price down</Title><Username>pet2401</Username><Timestamp>1364599254058</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-29 19:20:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I agree for the most part. I think that at $13.65 there would need to be a decent public portion... significantly larger than there would be with the other suitors because they already have that sort of deal on the table. Also, M Dell can likely finance the deal, so he has no incentive to keep part public. Why by half of a good investment when you can buy the whole thing? Also, I'm not sure that what M Dell (really the special board committee) is up to will end up driving down the price. As it stands, he would still likely have to beat Blackstone, if not Ichan, just to try to get shareholder approval. Even that may be tight. That won't happen so fast though. First we need to understand that the board ruled in favor of the M Dell/Silverlake proposal. Blackstone, perhaps with Ichan, will make a stronger proposal because (if for no other reason) they would look like dopey pains in the rear (in all of the money circles in the world) if they didn't even make a solidly competitive bid in the eyes of the board. This is not a small company sneaking under the radar. Everyone is watching, so there's no room for sissies (excluding Lenovo and that other free look firm--- but they didn't say anything) Then come the real work on the crystal ball... Will M Dell settle for a buyout from Blackstone that retains him as CEO? Will he put up a strong NO because he thinks the company can be retooled and doesn't want to see his firm sent to be scrapped for parts?</Msg><Username>btv104</Username><Timestamp>1364600385070</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-29 19:39:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364601053191-13</Id><Title>$3.5-4.5 billion initial valuation...</Title><Msg>...for the financial arm of Dell. I saw that there was a "strategic" somebody that came to Dell during the go-shop and offered to buy the finance arm at BOOK VALUE net of debt, and came out with $3.5-4.5 billion. I'm not positive, but book value pricing sounds like someone thought they were coming to a fire sale, or at least trying to see of they could get hold of this piece on the WAY cheap. Any reasonably sound opinion on wether $3.5-4.5 is fair, cheap, or expensive? Would be good to get a sense of how far that element could really go for Blackstone. Board said that a stand alone transaction like that wouldn't be a good, and naturally anyone would agree... Why not let someone buy the whole nut, then let them sort out what to keep and what to toss. Also, the board said that the M Dell/Silverlake proposal wins for now. Anyone think there won't be a rebid by Blackstone (with or without Ichan)? Anyone think M Dell has the faintest hope that he will really get this done anywhere near $13.65? I'd love to know what you think!

They are shooting at less than that without figuring for the cash. That's why every time that they say that it's the biggest M&amp;A deal in however many years, they mention that the $13.65 price tag is 9.something times FOREWARD earnings... AND, those analysts don't assume the same drop in income that Dell is claiming will come to pass. I couldn't agree with you more and I think that what will happen is that the buyer will pay for the cash, then get the rest of the firm for something on the order of 5-7 times earnings... That's a target around $16-18. I really like your analysis, and have been wondering what happened to P/E valuation on this deal. Nobody, not even the bulls are making that point to assertively. Maybe the stock was so under-priced that it just sounds dumb to talk about buying a firm for such a ridiculously low multiple.</Msg><Username>btv104</Username><Timestamp>1364601825350</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-29 20:03:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364602181107-15</Id><Topic><Title>Deal Valuation</Title><Username>btv104</Username><Timestamp>1360688262346</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 11:57:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hope you weren't betting against a nice deal.</Msg><Username>btv104</Username><Timestamp>1364602181107</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-29 20:09:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364602267924-16</Id><Topic><Title>Deal Valuation</Title><Username>btv104</Username><Timestamp>1360688262346</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 11:57:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Note the date</Msg><Username>btv104</Username><Timestamp>1364602267924</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-29 20:11:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364602579085-17</Id><Topic><Title>Reality Check</Title><Username>starcushing</Username><Timestamp>1364489435266</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 12:50:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A deal takes FOREVER to close, you'll get that dividend, and if you want to do the risk arbitrage part to get the whole deal price, then you'll likely get another one too.</Msg><Username>btv104</Username><Timestamp>1364602579085</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-29 20:16:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364603016059-18</Id><Topic><Title>Reality Check</Title><Username>starcushing</Username><Timestamp>1364489435266</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 12:50:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Bashford will get bashful in a very short while. For now, the board committee said that $13.64 is the best bid because the other proposals present significant risk in the future. Nobody really believes that $13.64 goes to a vote, even if there were not another peep from competing bidders. I see you still won't capitulate Bashy. Well, I wonder.... if I click on your name, will I find that you have any bullish sentiment anywhere, or are you kind of just a perma-bear? Just trying to understand where you are coming from.
