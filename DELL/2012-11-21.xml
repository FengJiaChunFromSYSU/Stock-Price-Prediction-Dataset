(DELL)</Title><Msg>Good Afternoon: It seems to me that time to get into thid undervalued company has arrived. Dell Inc. financials must play a bottom feeding for this company; free cash flow and cash on hand could help DELL to lure new investors at today depressed market price. Apocalypse for PC era will wait for a while in my humble opinion. PC and laptops are still good tools in factories, offices and nice toys at homes; servers are the heart that store in the cloud and pumps data towards wide world web in our information technology society. DELL tech speaking is drawing, what it seems a Bullish Harami pattern triangle with heavy volume, so it could be a nice short positions drain with fresh money pouring into this company. I recommend buying some for the long term, iÂ´m sure patient investors will be rewarded from this level. Have a nice day.

If you did listen and bought, you would have lost everything. Like many analysts, Cramer will shift your personal wealth to Wall Street, so Wall Streeters make money every year, money from almost most of us little guys. When HPQ was in its hey days, it was expensive. I didn't buy it. We witnessed it falling from about $50 all the way to $20, and then $18, and probably a lot of people started buying into it thinking it was a bargain. Those who got in at that level are now completely burned. Margin killed everyone. My self restraint allows me to be able to steer clear of this stock. I never owned a single share of HPQ. Now even at this level of under 12, it is still a wait and see situation. Becasue of the many years that it needs to turn itself around, both top and bottom lines wise. Huge debts burden is a big negative, and a lot of it coming due starting in the next two years. The techland has been down quite severely lately. It shows how important diversification is. Dell is only one of my few tech stocks in a portfolio that stretches across different industry segments. As Dell is a situation that is so obvious and easy to understand, and offers the most compelling risk/reward ratio (in the whole universe where we live), I therefore bring it up here on this message board so everyone can make quite a lot of money with this stock going forward. This could be a major winner among the many losers that we may have had. Big boys KNOW. They are accumulating in full force. No matter what, tremendous amount of money will be made in this stock, as will be in other stocks that I am holding now. I buy drugs, as well as biotech too. Like someone said in an interview, it is crazy not to be on equity. Dividend, inflation, low PEs, and other indicators all point to rising stock prices in the next two years. Housing cannot stay like now forever. There has to be a way out. Happy Thanksgiving And Smart And Confident Investing.</Msg><Username>value_oriented_123</Username><Timestamp>1353550224221</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 21:10:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
