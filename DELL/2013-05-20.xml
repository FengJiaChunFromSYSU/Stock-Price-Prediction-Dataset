Pure profit? Because his deal is a scam. Its a $12 special dividend in disguise.

Icahn will never get seats on the board of directors, his stake and those of others is under 20%. Furthermore if Michael/Silverlake/Msft offer were not accepted via shareholder vote, then the stock would plunge and Icahn would have already sold and run for the exits before anyone will even know it.</Msg><Username>cspanosmwc</Username><Timestamp>1369081170919</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-20 16:19:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
