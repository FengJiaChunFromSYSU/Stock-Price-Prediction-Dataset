Dell Inc. (DELL): Provides integrated technology solutions in the information technology (IT) industry worldwide. Market cap at $19.01B, most recent closing price at $10.85. Diluted TTM earnings per share at 1.47, and a MRQ book value per share value at 5.86, implies a Graham Number fair value = sqrt(22.5*1.47*5.86) = $13.92. Based on the stock's price at $10.94, this implies a potential upside of 27.26% from current levels. Dividend yield at 2.93%, payout ratio at 5.33%. Performance over the last quarter at 12.55%.</Msg><Username>chart_rules</Username><Timestamp>1357574532704</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 11:02:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357582513527-3</Id><Topic><Title>Do You Think DELL is a BUY?</Title><Username>savannahmwd380</Username><Timestamp>1357333073441</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 15:57:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm subscribed.

Windows XP Service Pack 3 end of mainstream support was April 14, 2009. End of extended support is April 8, 2014. That gives IT departments a year to upgrade, not a whole lot of time left! PCs that will need upgrading in the near future - Healthcare, Banking and Government, all big buyers of Dell products, especially desktop PCs and Servers..Sonicwall security systems are also widely used by Healthcare and small to mid size businesses out there. Windows 8 is catching on as it intergates beautifully with all the widely used Micrsoft Applications such as Lync, Outlook, Word,Excel, One Note etc. Comparing Dell to the major indicees shows that it has been severly oversold in relation to most stocks. While it may be true that the overall market may adjust lower, Dell while rise to meet that decline halfway. My guess is $12.50 to $13.50 range in the next month.
