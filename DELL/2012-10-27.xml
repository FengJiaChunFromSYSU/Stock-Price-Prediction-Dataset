While the PCs and Laptops powered by Windows 8 may take a few weeks to get momentum, the Tablets are being sold like hot cake.... AS Michael DELL said in NYC on Thursday, Windows 8 will be picked up by the small Enterprise and Consumers in the first phase and will be followed by the big business who are still using Windows XP and have been waiting for a major breakthrough for an upgrade.... The smart money says that in Q1/2013 the large Enterprise adoption of Windows 8 will be in full swing. Stay tuned.</Msg><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1351368725530</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 16:12:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351371741848-3</Id><Topic><Title>If Apple met Dell in a Gay bar in 1999 and then again in 2012</Title><Username>cyrixborg</Username><Timestamp>1351349090165</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 10:44:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Then? ...Could dell be recovered and apple down?</Msg><Username>cwade87</Username><Timestamp>1351371741848</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 17:02:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351373457735-4</Id><Topic><Title>DELL Tablets are sold out....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1351368725530</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 16:12:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hey Osso I think DELL has a loyal customer base and having seen the DELL Tablets, I am sure the purchasing managers will be favoring DELL-Pods as it will make it easier to interface with their IT system when they transition to Windows 8 as the OS is seemless across PCs, Laptops and Tablets.... Also the market sold out after HP CEO's tragic performance, the October earnings syndrome and all the nonsense by the PC death panel(s).... As MSFT CEO said, PCs, Ultrabooks and Tablets are complimentary devices and anyone who is a serious businessman can not operate by his Cell phone or Tablet unless they are pushing drugs and are operating out of their car! WE will be around $20.00 in 2013 as Windows 8 gets on its way and our Enterprise/Cloud/Software business becomes over 50-60% of our sales with much higrer margins. And I would say as well Sir, Stay Tuned!</Msg><Username>longsrboss</Username><Timestamp>1351373457735</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 17:30:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351378748574-5</Id><Topic><Title>DELL Tablets are sold out....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1351368725530</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 16:12:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Last quarter the Enterprise side was 1/3 of Rev. with 50% of Earnings. So this quarter we will grow the Enterprise side by 8-10% while PC shipments were down 6.25%. So net we should gain on sales and the EPS. Add to that more Cloud, Servers and other peripherals, I think the analysts are going to eat a lot of crow on Nov. 15. For Q4/2012 and beyond as Windows 8 takes hold, we should be on our way to higher grounds.</Msg><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1351378748574</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 18:59:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351384492091-6</Id><Topic><Title>DELL Tablets are sold out....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1351368725530</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 16:12:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>We are already getting good Press on Windows 8 and DELL PCs and Tablets with the new OS. DELL will be shipping the pre-ordered units on Monday and by mid-November the game will be in full swing. Looks like DELL has done several innovations on their machines as AAPL will be following to see how it would affect their toys as DELL is a 90% Enterprise focused company.</Msg><Username>longsrboss</Username><Timestamp>1351384492091</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 20:34:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message></Date>
