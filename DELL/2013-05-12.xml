(~8.27 DELL shares) 3. you can just sell it all like you can today. DELL shares will trade at $1.65/share. so if you have 500 shares today and roll over your entire position you will have ~4,150 shares trading at $1.65/share. please someone correct me if i'm wrong.</Msg><Username>johndeansmith</Username><Timestamp>1368364905236</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-12 09:21:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368368192232-3</Id><Topic><Title>Whats Dell share price after Icahn's $12 divident/distrubution?</Title><Username>drexlerdue</Username><Timestamp>1368311260688</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-11 18:27:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks, In this case the total $$ Amt. is wash..? 500*13.65 = $6825 4150 * 1.65 = $6847 So the proposal is participating on upside on more shares? what are the risks this becomes penny stock if it trades at $1.65</Msg><Username>drexlerdue</Username><Timestamp>1368368192232</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-12 10:16:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368368795192-4</Id><Topic><Title>Whats Dell share price after Icahn's $12 divident/distrubution?</Title><Username>drexlerdue</Username><Timestamp>1368311260688</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-11 18:27:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>1. yes total dollar amount is a wash at the onset. my numbers were approximate. 2. yes Icahn gives you the right to participate in whole or in part in the upside. Michael Dell was forcing you to sell and shutting you out. 3. Ichan has stated that he is in it for the longer term and he will support the stock at/above $1.65. Icahn will not make any money unless the stock goes up considerably. he has his own funding as well as partners. IMO God bless Ichan. he is keeping management and board of directors honest and looking out for himself AND shareholders. if it wasn't for Icahn, Michael Dell would be stealing the company from shareholders. i only own 500 shares but i plan on rolling it all over and taking 100% stock and casting my lot with Icahn.</Msg><Username>johndeansmith</Username><Timestamp>1368368795192</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-12 10:26:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368386627175-5</Id><Title>SE Mgmt Would Have $2 Billion LOSS with Mickey Dee's $13.65 ALL Cash Offer</Title><Msg>And therein lies the crux of overpaying Wall St to mis-manage money for big fat fees.</Msg><Username>debbie_downer_does_dallas</Username><Timestamp>1368386627175</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-12 15:23:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368403699262-6</Id><Topic><Title>Makin' a deal with the Devil...</Title><Username>jensen111111</Username><Timestamp>1368206333362</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 13:18:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>getting 12 dollars cash and getting to keep your shares, should suit anyone. And if Michael Dell wants to buy the company he can do it on the open market. I sure hope stockholders see the merit in this.</Msg><Username>jayhawk2134</Username><Timestamp>1368403699262</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-12 20:08:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368403877883-7</Id><Topic><Title>Michael Dell can offer $15.50 and make Icahn drama go away</Title><Username>sulur</Username><Timestamp>1368197812076</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 10:56:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And Michael Dell and the board gets booted , should save 50 million a year</Msg><Username>jayhawk2134</Username><Timestamp>1368403877883</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-12 20:11:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
