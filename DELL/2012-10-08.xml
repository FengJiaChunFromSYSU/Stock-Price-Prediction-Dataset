"It's critical for us to get a critical mass of apps," said Keith Lorizio, VP of U.S. sales and marketing for Microsoft Advertising, in an interview with online tech channel Beet.TV. "We're expecting to aggressively pursue 100,000-plus apps over the first three months." The exec said the company is working closely with publishers to boost the number of Windows 8 apps, and has committed significant cash to the program. "We know that we have to have a very healthy ecosystem of apps, and we're putting millions of dollars against the effort and working with publishers in order to get their apps live as quickly as possible," said Lorizio. Lorizio was equally optimistic about Windows 8's sales prospects. He predicted that there will be 400 million computers, including desktops, laptops, and tablets, running the operating system by July 1 of next year. Lorizio cited three factors he said will make Windows 8 "a guaranteed success." Microsoft's "massive distribution" network, the fact that Windows 8, with its Live Tiles interface, promises to deliver "the same experience across all devices within the Microsoft family. Not just across the PC, but across mobile, across Xbox, and across the phone." And third, "we're going to have beautiful, relevant, useful apps," Lorizio said. He added that Microsoft's own Windows 8 apps would carry advertising integrated with content, and that the company will split revenue from those ads with the content providers. "All of our apps that appear on the home page--weather, news, sports--they're going to be executed by us, and we're going to have advertising integrated across each one of the apps," said Lorizio. Windows currently holds about 92% of the PC operating system market, not including tablets, according to the most recent data from Net Applications.</Msg><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1349736769121</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 18:52:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349739348062-23</Id><Title>BUY rating from me</Title><Msg>EPS for sure to go up and more shareholder incentive to come up in coming Qtr</Msg><Username>markhwang2003</Username><Timestamp>1349739348062</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 19:35:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349740399524-24</Id><Topic><Title>BUY rating from me</Title><Username>markhwang2003</Username><Timestamp>1349739348062</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 19:35:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I agree as DELL can easily up the Div. to 50-60 cents and buy up $5.3 billion worth of shares which at this price would reduce shares outstanding by 550 million shares to 1.15 billion shares and boost the EPS to $2.35-2.50.</Msg><Username>longsrboss</Username><Timestamp>1349740399524</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 19:53:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349741754216-25</Id><Topic><Title>Update: 100,000 Windows 8 Apps Coming</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1349736769121</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 18:52:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hey Osso, here is what I like the best: "Lorizio was equally optimistic about Windows 8's sales prospects.
