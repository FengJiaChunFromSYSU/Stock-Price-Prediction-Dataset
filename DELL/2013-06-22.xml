If you want someone to destroy Dell, let him take over. He will carve it up and spit it out piece by piece until there is nothing left but him and his NYC cronies. Your property will be in his pocket and you will think you still own it, but you won't. Do not trust him.</Msg><Username>mud_raker3</Username><Timestamp>1371906348442</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-22 09:05:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371906445683-2</Id><Topic><Title>Carl Ichan will end up owning this company and i am all for it.</Title><Username>jayhawk2134</Username><Timestamp>1371867202877</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-21 22:13:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Everything he touches turns to #$%$.</Msg><Username>mud_raker3</Username><Timestamp>1371906445683</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-22 09:07:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371918938280-3</Id><Topic><Title>Carl Ichan will end up owning this company and i am all for it.</Title><Username>jayhawk2134</Username><Timestamp>1371867202877</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-21 22:13:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Icahn has no other interests beyond his own. He has seen the books, and like a good poker player he will play along and keep appearance that he wants to recap the company. He knows he cannot get the funds for it. He knows the company is sick, the stock market is toppy, cost of borrowing money is rising fast. He has no love for Dell. He just saw an opportunity, which is gone now. So he will make his 30 cents on the stock, collect a dividend of 8 cents and go away. He still makes a couple percent. His real chance to profit from this deal is gone. When the stock was over $14. He would not run Dell, he would strip it to the bone, saddle it with debt, all to make an extra 35 cents per share. If the Silverlake offer is declined, the stock goes to 9, not even Icahn wants that.</Msg><Username>cspanosmwc</Username><Timestamp>1371918938280</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-22 12:35:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371921602321-4</Id><Topic><Title>Carl Ichan will end up owning this company and i am all for it.</Title><Username>jayhawk2134</Username><Timestamp>1371867202877</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-21 22:13:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Apparently Dell has no interest in stockholders .20.9 billion offer for the company that has 10 billion in cash and more than that in assets.

He robbed Blockbuster debt holders and of course shareholders of all stakes while he worked out some BS backdoor scam with Charlie Ergen. He pushed, no forced through the 363 sales despite countless objections by all parties. I have no idea how Judge Burton R. Lifland allowed this. Literally every objection was denied. He shafts everyone in the end, he is parasite who lives of undermining, coercion and other lowlife means to accomplish his end goal. He has built nothing! His empire is built on years of shady dealings. This is a guy who should be sharing a bunk with Madoff. Voting for Icahn is like a vote against America. Heck I wouldn't care if his offer was double keep this guy out of everything until he leaves for good!</Msg><Username>susan.mcan</Username><Timestamp>1371947519887</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-22 20:31:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371954841987-6</Id><Title>Apparantly Ichan is getting his financing from jeffries</Title><Msg>If anyone has destroyed this company its the management that is in place now.
