This is how much the stock is really worth. Insiders were dumping shares like madmen when it was over $16. If the COO and the CFO are dumping shares, what should we be doing? http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=DELL+Key+Statistics</Msg><Username>runningblackbeardog</Username><Timestamp>1343646776000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 07:12:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343676110000-2</Id><Title>I think now worth to start buying some shares</Title><Msg>I still have my Dell old laptop and I will surely buy another one when I will change it, yes now it's a time of little money.. I bought last year a beautiful, compact Optiplex with 2 monitors and I'm fully satisfied. Everybody have a Dell computer, especially in the corporate sector, I can't figure out how I can design an engine or whatever with an ipad...

I've never seen a profitable stock trading at book, moreover this stock as a forward p/e of 5.9, that is ridiculos and last but not least a cash per share of $ 7.85.
