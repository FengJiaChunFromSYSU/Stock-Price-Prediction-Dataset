GUARANTEED you will see a bounce of a few dollars before resuming any downtrend. Ideal stock for a short term trade to the upside, especially with a market as manipulated as the one we are in. LOL Worse off than in 2008/2009, and stocks are higher. We have nations on the verge of collapse, US debt at all time highs, most people on government assistance &amp; food stamps in the history of the USA, housing still a disaster, and a horrible jobs situation. Dow should be LOWER than 2008, not higher.</Msg><Username>need2satisfy</Username><Timestamp>1347143577483</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-08 18:32:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
