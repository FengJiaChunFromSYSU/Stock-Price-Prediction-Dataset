The remaining company with be worthless, any profitable pieces sold off. His intention is not to bring Dell private and run it for profit. Its to destroy it to make a few buck. He only has 7%, SE has less than 15%. Their offer is #$%$. If they had a real offer, why not offer $15 for all the stock? Because its NOT a real offer. Its a scheme to trick the shareholders and hijack the board so they can demolish the company and make an extra $1. Because if Icahn gets his deal, Dell will dissolve and go away. Michael Dells legacy will be destroyed. All Michael Dell need to do is wait until the earnings are released, which will be dismal, and Icahn will fold his hand.</Msg><Username>cspanosmwc</Username><Timestamp>1368532573079</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 07:56:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368532856368-4</Id><Topic><Title>dell not able fund buy out back to 9</Title><Username>ron.wallach</Username><Timestamp>1368198609683</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 11:10:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This company is not failing because of leadership.

When we look at small caps, we look for companies trading at cheap valuations that have a stable business and a solid balance sheet. We avoid small caps trading below a $1/share or below a market cap of $100 million. In our opinion, shares below this threshold tend to be too illiquid, too volatile, and generally not worth the risk. If this post reaches a wide enough audience, we may continue to cover the small-cap space in future articles.Stewart Information Services Corp (STC)STC is a real estate transaction management and real estate information services company. STC is primarily in the title insurance business with offices/agents in the United States as well as the U.K., Europe, Mexico, Canada, Central America, and Australia. Title insurance is required by lenders before a loan is made on a piece of real estate. Title insurance protects the lender and the new property owner if some unexpected lien (that is not found during the title examination process) is found after the deal has closed. Using title insurance, the lender is assured primary lien position on the property. Also, the new property owner is protected if the property is found to have title problems due to issues such as, title defects, unrecorded liens, forgeries, and mortgage fraud.STC has a market cap of $576 million with a net cash position of $172 million. STC's cash position is nearly 30% of its market capitalization. With a TTM PE ratio of 5.35 and a forward (2014) PE of 9.2, we believe that STC shares are cheap. Also, STC has a price-to-book ratio of 0.95 and is trading at about 5.5 times free cash flow.We like STC as a play on the recovering United States housing market. As the housing market improves, STC will prosper because the service it provides is critical to all real estate transactions. Shares have risen over 80% during the last year and we believe that STC has more upside potential going forward.Basset Furniture Industries (BSET)Basset is a retailer, manufacturer, and importer of home furnishings in the United States. Sales channels include 53 company owned retail stores, 33 licensee owned stores, as well as other independent furniture retailers. Basset has a market cap of $150 million and a net cash position of $44 million, which is about 29% of Basset's market capitalization. We believe that Basset shares are cheap with a TTM PE ratio of 5.39 and a price-to-book ratio of 0.98. Shares are up over 60% in the last year and we believe that Basset will experience more gains as this year progresses.Much like STC, Basset is a good way to play the recovery in the United States housing market. When people buy a new home they will often buy new home furnishings. Sometimes even someone selling a home will buy new furniture to spruce things up in hopes of attracting a buyer. In any case, more residential real estate transactions should bode well for a home furnishings retailer like Basset.Skullcandy Inc (SKUL)Skullcandy is a designer, distributor, and marketer of audio headphones and various accessories. Skullcandy has a market cap of $143 million with a net cash position of $34 million, which is almost 24% of Skullcandy's market capitalization. With a TTM PE ratio of 8.15 and a forward (2014) PE ratio of 12.9, we see Skullcandy shares as being undervalued. Skullcandy is selling for book value and has an Enterprise Value/EBITDA ratio of just 2.84.Our interest in Skullcandy is primarily focused on Skullcandy's apparent plan to buy back up to $28 million in shares. With a fairly high short interest (22% of float), we believe that if Skullcandy is aggressive with its share buy back program it may cause a short squeeze. A short squeeze would be great for Skullcandy shares, in the short term, making the shares a nice short-term trade candidate. Also, we like that Skullcandy is a small company with attractive assets selling at a compelling valuation. These situations sometimes lead to a company being acquired by a larger competitor or by a private equity firm. With the catalysts of a possible short squeeze or a possible buy out, we believe that the market has overlooked Skullcandy and has not priced in these possibilities into the stock price. In our best-case scenario, we forecast that Skullcandy shares will rise 50% or more if there is a short squeeze or buy out. In our worst-case scenario, we forecast that Skullcandy will have a stable business that will maintain a relatively stable share price. We see this as a heads we win, tails we do not lose much type of investment.</Msg><Username>dariodbest</Username><Timestamp>1368550543080</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 12:55:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368550626866-32</Id><Title>Remember to Take ALL Shares, NO $12 Cash When Selecting Clueless Carl's Offer</Title><Msg>Nothing better than owning a debt bloated company with sales plummetting off a cliff.</Msg><Username>debbie_downer_does_dallas</Username><Timestamp>1368550626866</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 12:57:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368550840281-33</Id><Title>Who's Spending Million$ with a Company That Might Not Be Around Next Year?</Title><Msg>Customers are fleeing Dell in droves.</Msg><Username>debbie_downer_does_dallas</Username><Timestamp>1368550840281</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 13:00:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368551945841-34</Id><Title>DELL 1Q REVENUES ROUGHLY $1.4 BILLION!!</Title><Msg>FAT LADY STILL HAS NOT SUNG!! 18 POSSIBLE!!</Msg><Username>prasena55</Username><Timestamp>1368551945841</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 13:19:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368553225773-35</Id><Topic><Title>Left for dead.</Title><Username>i_gotta_have_more_cowbell</Username><Timestamp>1368494292117</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 21:18:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That was an interesting move today to advance the CC to Thursday. This reminds me of divorce paties disputing the value of assets. Dell wants to take it private, and might have incentive to get a bad report out quickly and call Icahn's bluff. But if Icahn isn't bluffing, and actually has a plan, and it sounds like he does, then this move could backfire. It will be interesting to see the aftermath that will surely bring about discovery, and then we'll get a better peak at the cards in everyone's hand.</Msg><Username>i_gotta_have_more_cowbell</Username><Timestamp>1368553225773</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 13:40:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368553936182-36</Id><Title>Dell Must Go</Title><Msg>Michael Dell has decimated this Co........WTFUP......I want Carl!!!</Msg><Username>mother.jones</Username><Timestamp>1368553936182</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 13:52:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368557201624-37</Id><Title>Only 20 Cents EPS x 4 = $0.80 Annual EPS, P/E $13.65 / $0.80 = 17</Title><Msg>A 17 P/E is very generous considering EPS will be plummetting during the next 5 years.</Msg><Username>debbie_downer_does_dallas</Username><Timestamp>1368557201624</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 14:46:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368559624659-38</Id><Topic><Title>DELL 1Q REVENUES ROUGHLY $1.4 BILLION!!</Title><Username>prasena55</Username><Timestamp>1368551945841</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 13:19:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think you mean $14 Billion, which would be about flat with both the last quarter and 1Q last year. CNBC mentioned $14B with lower EPS. If true, customers must NOT be leaving dell "in droves" and it'll be interesting to see what dropped the EPS...higher cost of sales, SG&amp;A or something else. Let's see if I have this right... MDell is a buyer and he has help with the LBO from astute people who have an interest in making money with an exit plan, but that won't be possible unless they get the deal. Standing in their way is Icahn, who is focused on future income from recent acquisitions (and who seems to want to replace the current Board of Directors AND MDell) and at least one major investor who bought into MDell's business strategies and management of the company and now stands to lose a lot of money (reportedly $2 Billion) with the MDell, et al offer. So on the heels of the Icahn, et all offer here comes a Dell announcement of an early release of earnings which was almost immediately followed with a high volume of OTM call activity...was this reactionary to the announcement or in accompanyment with it? Maybe MDell knows $13.65 won't win it.

MDell and Co trying to scare investors with this earnings leak. Top line revenue exceeded expectation. We all knew bottom line net income would be weak. This goes to show Dell still has a solid customer base. Nice try at the scare tactics, but the street isn't buying it. Stock will move higher after earnings when the real battle come back into focus.</Msg><Username>md208</Username><Timestamp>1368562208206</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 16:10:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
