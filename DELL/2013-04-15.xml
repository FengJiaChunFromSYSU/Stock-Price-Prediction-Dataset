Just in the last 4 years, Dell has spent over 13 Billion in acquisitions in companies mainly within software, information technology, networking, servers and services (positioning to have an arm more like IBM) with the purchase of in this four years of Perot Systems, KACE Networks, Force 10, Sonic Wall, Credant Technology and 14 others. Dell still has much cash on the books and can and will continue to move even more in this direction away from PC. If Michael Dell ups the price and is able to take company private, this financial structure of being private will save the company 4-5 Billion in taxes (no more double taxation) which will provide even more money for Dell to build up its enterprise solutions and cloud computing. Years ahead, it would not surprise me if Dell spins off the personal PC business like IBM did years ago. Conversely, if the company keeps, Dell will radically restructure the legacy PC. Bottom line, Dell has done a great job investing cash flow in moving away from the PC with companies like Perot Systems. Due to this, analysis from firms like Southeastern only place the Dell PC business at $3 share with the rest of the company valued at $19. On the above statement/s, Put your money where your mouth is and short this stock. if more people had your position, why is stock selling above Michael Dell's offer? Time will tell ,but if you short, you will lose your shirt. This stock is going higher and there will be another offer coming in. Taking cash out - the buy out offer is below 8 times earnings - a company like Dell does not sell this cheap. Southeastern has already hired firms to make sure if no higher offer/s come in - Michael Dell's current offer will be rejected.</Msg><Username>dogwood1855</Username><Timestamp>1366079686068</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 22:34:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message></Date>
