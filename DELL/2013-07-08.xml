Rowe Price, Yacktman Asset Management and Pzena Investments are against the offer from Dell and Silver Lake. Combined, these shareholders own around 18% of the company, and may still provide a road block to getting a deal done. Dell, who owns 16% of the company, may still not get the opportunity to take his company private, since he is not allowed to vote in the deal. Proxy firm Glass Lewis still has to make its decision on whether Dell's offer is best for shareholders, or whether they should consider alternatives. That decision is expected to come sometime within the next week. Excluding Dell's ownership stake in the company, approximately 43% of shareholders need to vote in favor of the deal for it to pass.</Msg><Username>johndeansmith</Username><Timestamp>1373285668670</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-08 08:14:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373287783005-13</Id><Topic><Title>Bought 5K @ $12.98 On Friday, Sold In Premarket for $13.40 Thank-You</Title><Username>ready2findhern2005</Username><Timestamp>1373285235487</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-08 08:07:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hey Mr "Big-TimeI If you are such a big "player" why are you spending your time on a chat board making cheap insults?

Are their actions and statements criminal in the First Degree? Should they immediately vacate their position in the company, confess and surrender to authorities at the earliest time and place? Is the fraud being perpetrated on shareholders beyond anything ever seen in the history of publicly traded companies? Maybe not, but they are being disingenuous by their actions.</Msg><Username>filtered_out</Username><Timestamp>1373313259768</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-08 15:54:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373313485421-41</Id><Topic><Title>Michael Dell needs to be fired from Dell</Title><Username>billberggren</Username><Timestamp>1373311903255</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-08 15:31:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Agree.

If you vote "NO" to Mike Dell's very generous $13.65 per share buyout offer then you will have the opportunity to keep your shares. They will likely be trading at $9 or so per share, but you will get to keep your shares. That is capitalism at work. Hope this helps.</Msg><Username>bashfordcapital</Username><Timestamp>1373334765328</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-08 21:52:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373335073464-49</Id><Topic><Title>Class action suit</Title><Username>charlesmangarella</Username><Timestamp>1373284447354</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-08 07:54:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>For months and months now DELL has been open to , even inviting, buyout offers.
