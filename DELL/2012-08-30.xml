Wow, what a combo!!!</Title><Msg>Should Dell buy Research In Motion? Triangle Business Journal by Chris Baysden, Web Editor Date: Thursday, August 30, 2012, 9:14am EDT Enlarge Image Research in Motion makes the Blackberry. Chris Baysden Web Editor- Triangle Business Journal Email Dell Inc. and Research In Motion Ltd. both have struggled lately. Both are seeing Apple Inc. (Nasdaq: AAPL) products hurt their top lines. And both are once-sexy technology companies that don't have quite the allure of a few years ago. Could the solution for the troubles of both be a combination of the two companies? A new article in The Street makes the argument that such a deal could work with Dell (Nasdaq: DELL) buying RIM. "In RIM, not only will Dell be able to leverage its existing enterprise presence, it will acquire assets such as RIM's BB10 software, a growing music service as well as RIM's Mobile Fusion, a product that supports the collaboration of enterprise mobile devices, even that of competing models such as iPhones and Android devices," writes Richard Saintvilus in the piece. "Dell becomes relevant again." RIM (Nasdaq: RIMM) is based in Canada but also has a facility in Research Triangle Park.</Msg><Username>balak_joshi</Username><Timestamp>1346343982431</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 12:26:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346345714951-5</Id><Title>The smart people have already sold DELL stock</Title><Msg>This albatross is heading to $1 dollar within 12 months.</Msg><Username>schule7607</Username><Timestamp>1346345714951</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 12:55:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346351718288-6</Id><Title>3 1/2 year low for Dell.</Title><Msg>I sure hope the stock buyback program is taking advantage of these low prices.

The Reason DELL will survive and more than double Everyone sees the constant news about the death of the PC but that is false news. Sure; the PC is not going to be what it was in the 90s in popularity with the younger generation in the west but it is least expensive and China is coming of age and those and other people will want the PC for years to come and even Americans over age 45 are going to want to use the PC the rest of their lives because they are used to it and do not like change or learning to use something else of a different size. I am in that crowd. I know and understand the tablet and other gadgets but I will always have a laptop and a desktop because I learned on those, way back in the 80s when dial up Internet was a black screen and you typed in a few words and waited an hour for a response. I worked on Systems One for Eastern Airlines way back in the early 80s and it was on a PC too. There is no such thing as death of the PC and as great as Apple is, younger people want the next best thing and when the tablet is replaced by something new, out the window it goes. This is why Buffett is not into the tech stocks so much. He is not alone insofar as our great investors. I invest in tech stocks like Apple and I am buying DELL each time it hits a new low because it is going back to 20 or 30 if not bought out first for 30 bucks per share. I think it would bring $28 at this point. Most here are using a PC! Most here are not going to give up their PC either. We might use other things but we are going to keep our laptops. Besides that and most important; government centers that need large amounts of graphics and teaching centers cannot do it without the PC which death of the PC articles fail to tell us about. Remember; the Holidays are coming up again and guess what many will get? A new PC and that will lift sales for our winter boom and in the next 36 months with the economy fully improves, these low prices will be high prices which is why my 24 month price target for DELL is $30. My one year price target is nearly double these prices. I think year three will see an averaging out in prices between $26-$36 here. DELL is not going to $50 imo but a double or triple is good enough for me. JMO and I pity anyone who would go short here now.</Msg><Username>investing30yrs</Username><Timestamp>1346356965216</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 16:02:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346358721538-10</Id><Title>margin calls continue to cause avalanche</Title><Msg>the bloodletting will not cease until $4</Msg><Username>adwt53535</Username><Timestamp>1346358721538</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 16:32:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346358820069-11</Id><Topic><Title>mike, you reap what you sow</Title><Username>je747br</Username><Timestamp>1346212905863</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 00:01:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I feel bad for the employees about to be fired</Msg><Username>je747br</Username><Timestamp>1346358820069</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 16:33:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346359713911-12</Id><Title>All longs will make money on DELL.

At these levels, Dell is a steal. Michael Dell should take this/his company private. When the next batch of stimulus and/or business tax incentives roll out, gov't and companies are going to be upgrading their PCs...not to mention the hardware upgrades associated with getting Windows 8. Dell stock is being punished because it's not Apple and punished some more because of HP's woes. While many people are getting Apple "toys," PCs still dominate for work and home. HP is losing market share, and worse, HP is losing money. Although Dell is also losing some market share, Dell continues to make money every quarter.</Msg><Username>smb_gt</Username><Timestamp>1346361453756</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 17:17:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346363069190-16</Id><Title>Steve was great, God rest his soul</Title><Msg>But Michael is obviously the one to surpass him.

Debt - Dell is carrying quite a bit. Granted, there's more cash than debt, but debt/equity at 0.86 is still quite high. Why carry $8.4B debt if you have $11.4B cash? We all know that with interest rates near zero no money is being made on the cash, yet interest is being paid on the debt. There's no need for keeping that amount of cash in this environment, unless the company is scared that it may well need that kind of cash hoard. If not, and they aren't going to pay down debt, then pay it out to shareholders. 2. EPS is being engineered with stock buyback - we all know this. Granted, lots of companies do it these days (e.g. IBM and Exxon), but it's about as good as cutting expenses to make your numbers. Sales are falling and without the buyback, EPS would be falling as well. 3. Goodwill + intangibles is pretty huge. On the one hand, Dell is doing the right thing making some acquisitions and diversifying the business. However, I think they may be overpaying to some extent. Much of that goodwill is going to have to be written down, and it will take a toll on EPS. Lots of people will say that goodwill writedowns are non-cash charges and so it's not a big deal. But, it is a big deal, because we still have the long-term debt to show for it. I am a firm believer that at some point Michael is going to step in and take the company private should the stock continue lower. But, do you invest knowing that Michael is the backstop, or do you buy because you believe the stock is undervalued and should be trading much higher? To be honest, I don't want to throw my money down at $10.75, watch it fall to $6, and then have Michael step in and buy the whole thing for $8. The stock was higher when Michael made his massive purchases last year. Yes, business is slightly down, but as you rightly point out, there's only so much you can do on i* devices. i*devices cannot run enterprise infrastructures, Dell can. And no matter what devices you use on the go, at home you still need a desktop machine of some sort. You can't easily do word processing, spreadsheets, and taxes very well on your i* device and likely won't be able to for some time. As good a system as Linux is, it is not for most home users - Wintel still has great advantages. And, as good as Apple is, most users still choose Wintel because they get more for their money. Gamers will still want/need high end performance, peoples home theaters will need home theater appropriate machines, and the PC is not going to disappear. I think there will be some consolidation due to lower demand, and less frequent upgrade cycles among home users, but the PC is definitely not disappearing, and the majority of home users are not going to be slapping together their own machines - not when Dell is around. Anyhow, I'll likely wait for the price to stabilize, then purchase some. It almost seems that the stock has to dip below $10 at this point.</Msg><Username>o08o.ugh64w</Username><Timestamp>1346368668309</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 19:17:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346371636528-22</Id><Topic><Title>I took a 1/3rd position today</Title><Username>uncle_argyle100</Username><Timestamp>1346214835273</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 00:33:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I took a 50 position today.
