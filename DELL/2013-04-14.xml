But if you think Southeastern and /or T. Rowe Price is going to look after the small investor , then you need a rethink. SE and TRP are going to look after themselves only.</Msg><Username>ellerbebil2</Username><Timestamp>1365967547917</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 15:25:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365993679018-3</Id><Topic><Title>Offer Going Higher and here is why...</Title><Username>dogwood1855</Username><Timestamp>1365905005967</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-13 22:03:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Whose money is T Rove mutual funds investing - mainly individuals, 401k's, pensions, etc. The higher the return and rating of the fund/s, the more money that flows into them over time. The more money that flows in, the higher mangement fee revenue for its T Rove advisors. Regardless, of whose interest, T Rove mutual funds are in business of yeilding a return and are not going to vote for Michael Dell's current offer due to the above. Offer either goes up, another better offer comes in, or stock stays just like it is.</Msg><Username>dogwood1855</Username><Timestamp>1365993679018</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 22:41:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message></Date>
