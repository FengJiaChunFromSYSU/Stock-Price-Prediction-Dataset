Blackstone's offer includes selling off major assets, assuming heavy debt, paying absurd dividends to shareholders etc.... All designed to seriously harm DELL's ability to compete well within its various business line markets. Ichan's "offer' would likely bankrupt DELL. In contrast, Mike Dell and his LBO partner, Silverlake, are willing to invest in DELL's business, and sustain short term losses, in the hopes of eventually transforming the company to one well positioned for future business growth.</Msg><Username>bashfordcapital</Username><Timestamp>1364710585017</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 02:16:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364731494285-3</Id><Topic><Title>bashford</Title><Username>ellerbebil2</Username><Timestamp>1364562081101</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-29 09:01:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I well understand that longterm BX's buyout of Dell might be a bad thing. However, that has nothing to do with me. I want the best price for my shares now. Why should I care what BX does after taking Dell private? I also do not care what hapens to Dell if MDell takes them private. I'd also say neither BX nor Dell gives a damn about me, other than can they use me to raise capital. You are mixing subjects: what is a superior price for the shares and what is best for the company ( Dell )?</Msg><Username>ellerbebil2</Username><Timestamp>1364731494285</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 08:04:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364737206631-4</Id><Topic><Title>Cramer trying to manipulate Dell Stock Price</Title><Username>twellman2</Username><Timestamp>1364511340553</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 18:55:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Agreed. Barron's has been spot on with concise, accurate reporting during this entire ordeal. Cramer is shameless in his distorting the facts in an effort to drive the share price down for his buddy at Southeastern. Cramer reminds me of an out of control short seller with a microphone. He is on a panel with Jeff Macke at OptionMonster later in June who also seems to be spewing misinformation. Disturbing to see these guys having a public forum to deceive. Cramer is probably getting money from Chanos or some other short to publicly do his best to badmouth. In Cramer's case, it has become blatantly obvious he has a mission to drive the price down. Wonder what he is being paid to do this?????????????</Msg><Username>twellman2</Username><Timestamp>1364737206631</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 09:40:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364753265574-5</Id><Title>MD, you need to face the reality.</Title><Msg>The reality is that there is no way for the majority of the shareholders to approve your deal of $13.65 per share. We are very dissappointed that your timing was too good, 25-30% premium to the bottom price was way too easy. Dell's core business, desktop and laptop computers are not dying, you knows that. The decrease of the shipping number has been resulted from the macro environment of the economy, but not because your core business is dying. Shorts and longs, check yourself, your family member and your colleague, do you think smart phones and tablets can replace the use of desktop or laptop? No way. Yes, the economy is sluggish, but the good time will come back for sure. In our company, everybody has more than one dell desktop and one dell laptop, we did not replace with the new ones as often as before. But, absolutely, we will continue to use and continue to replace them year by year, The good time will come back.</Msg><Username>yakimariver</Username><Timestamp>1364753265574</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 14:07:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364754021962-6</Id><Topic><Title>DELL Crash Predicted, BOUNCE COMING !!</Title><Username>stanley.joshua</Username><Timestamp>1362515325397</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 15:28:45 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>good work</Msg><Username>tgrunge</Username><Timestamp>1364754021962</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 14:20:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364757557196-7</Id><Topic><Title>MD, you need to face the reality.</Title><Username>yakimariver</Username><Timestamp>1364753265574</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 14:07:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well said.

The BOD has no responsibility to greedy short term stock speculators. Furthermore, the absurd "offers" put forth by Blackstone and, or Ichan hold the risk of public market share price decline. In contrast, Mike Dell's offer is guaranteed cash.

In the Dell case, the original firm that broached the idea of going private with Michael Dell last summer was frozen out of the deal. In the literally 1000 pages of documents filed in the proxy statement, Mr. Dell told Southeastern Asset Management that he would consider the idea. He surely did but used their concept to proceed with Silver Lake Partners and not Southeastern. This is the big leagues and when it comes to doing what is best for MOI, Mr. Dell chose to take Southeastern’s concept and rework it to suit himself, leaving them out in the process. Barron’s suggests that with Carl Icahn and Blackstone Group now in the bidding the plot has thickened a bit. You can regard the Blackstone offer as the Trojan Horse bid as the recently departed head of Dell’s acquisition strategy is now at Blackstone and spearheading that effort. He knows what is there to buy better than most. Barron’s cover story this week suggests that Michael Dell and friends aren’t likely to be able to steal the company at $13.65. That’s close to half its estimated present value with little included for the crumbling PC business. On the other hand, it is noteworthy that none of the other offers rise to a price consideration that is much higher than the $13.65. Besides all those massive fees that the deal machinery on Wall Street stand to make over this particular one, the bidding investors must see still see a sizeable return to make it worth their interest. Whether Micheal Dell has the skills or not to lead the company going forward also remains to be seen. Nothing he’s done in recent years has provided the magic formula which is why we are at this particular Dell crossroads.</Msg><Username>chicadee75</Username><Timestamp>1364767240251</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 18:00:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364767346772-11</Id><Topic><Title>Barrons</Title><Username>chicadee75</Username><Timestamp>1364767240251</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 18:00:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Selfish.

Like many of the stocks they own, Southeastern paid way too much. Naturally, Southeastern believes DELL, and all the other stocks they overpaid for, is worth double current trading price. The "analysis" Southeastern does for stocks is absurd, and the primary reason Southeastern is such a well known bag holder of underperforming stocks.
