CCUR's enterprise value is only 0.74X revenues of $63.23mm, 6.55X operating cash flow of $7.13mm, and 8.34X free cash flow of $5.6mm. CCUR's EPS was up 175% last quarter! CCUR just increased its dividend by 100% to $0.48 per share for a HUGE yield of 6.1%. CCUR leads the video on demand (VOD) delivery business with over 2.4mm VOD streams deployed worldwide and 4 of America's 6 largest cable TV operators as clients.

An enterprise value of 1.68X revenues would value CCUR at $14.69. An enterprise value of 15.05X operating cash flow will value CCUR at $14.81. An enterprise value of 19.32X free cash flow will value CCUR at $14.91. In addition, CCUR provides the #1 Big Data Analytics software solution used by cable TV service providers. CCUR tracks the viewing behavior of 35 million cable TV customers and has already processed 15 billion transactions. Big Data Analytics is the #1 hottest tech space on Wall Street.

Vote count is a function of the votes cast. If Michael Dell does not cast his shares &amp; votes, his number of shares will not be counted either way. 2. For the votes that count, Icahn needs to win the majority. 3. Every time Icahn opens his mouth (like now), the share price goes DOWN. 4. Anybody in the sane mind (like myself, and all other institutions) will vote FOR the deal. Everyone wants the deal to close. Uncertainty is bad for us. 5. Therefore, the vote will go FOR the proposal. 6. Icahn will lose big. Not in $$ but in his reputation. He mis-calculated this time. Michael Dell has more gut that he thought. You cannot win every time.</Msg><Username>oldtimer2013</Username><Timestamp>1373474692674</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-10 12:44:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373478089027-18</Id><Title>Just wondering who's been buying for the last 2 months ?</Title><Msg>those who will vote for ... or against ? ... and how many shares have changed hands at about 13,40</Msg><Username>jankoros</Username><Timestamp>1373478089027</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-10 13:41:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373478538319-19</Id><Topic><Title>Just wondering who's been buying for the last 2 months ?</Title><Username>jankoros</Username><Timestamp>1373478089027</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-10 13:41:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I bought some at $13 &amp; below.
