"It's like they are both standing on the dock watching boats that have already sailed," Gordon said. "They are going to have to swim very fast just to have chance to climb back on one of the boats."</Msg><Username>tonygin</Username><Timestamp>1346072875822</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-27 09:07:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346079696197-2</Id><Title>If I see a Dell selling one cent lower than an Apple computer I buy the Dell.</Title><Msg>I think a lot of people disliked Steve Jobs.

(DELL), which has $6 billion of debt due before 2016, is being treated like a junk-rated borrower as its cash falls to the lowest level in a decade with customers favoring tablets and smartphones over personal computers. Credit-default swaps tied to the fourth-largest PC maker are trading at levels that imply Dell should be rated Ba1, or six levels below its current grade, according to Moody’s Corp.’s capital markets research group.

HP shares are especially undervalued, reflecting an uncertain future with little expectation for growth. Weak results from related companies in the sector, including Intel, Dell, and AMD, confirm that HP will be under substantial pressure for the rest of the year. Investors are clinging to one bright spot for the industry: the launch of Windows 8 on October 26, and the Windows Surface tablet. Investors should recognize that HP plans to focus on a Windows 8 tablet at the commercial level. Increasing sales in this space should help improve margins, as compared to the lower margin consumer space. A re-design of HP's line-up concurrent with the Windows 8 will provide an unexpected boost for HP shareholders. Along with reducing operating costs, HP is set to be a more nimble company. Shareholders with the patience to ignore the short-term weaknesses will be rewarded in the long-run. Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in HPQ over the next 72 hours.</Msg><Username>ron.wallach</Username><Timestamp>1346085838470</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-27 12:43:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346086155873-7</Id><Title>Comanies in transition tend totrade at larger discounts than its peers, because uncertainty in its future is elevated.

It was lent to the National Archives in Washington, D.C., where it was displayed alongside the Declaration of Independence and the United States Constitution. In 2007, it was sold by the Perot Foundation, in order to provide "for medical research, for improving public education and for assisting wounded soldiers and their families."[13] The document sold for US$21.3 million on December 18, 2007 to David Rubenstein, managing director of the Carlyle Group and kept on display at the National Archives.[14] As Steve Jobs lost the original power struggle at Apple and left to found NeXT, his angel investor was Perot who invested over 20 million dollars because he believed in Jobs and did not want to miss out as he had when had the chance to invest in Bill Gates' fledging Microsoft.[15] In 1988 he founded Perot Systems Corporation, Inc. in Plano, Texas. His son, Ross Perot, Jr., eventually succeeded him as CEO. In September 2009, Perot Systems was acquired by Dell for $3.9 billion.[16]</Msg><Username>ron.wallach</Username><Timestamp>1346093637595</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-27 14:53:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346095317034-15</Id><Title>H.
