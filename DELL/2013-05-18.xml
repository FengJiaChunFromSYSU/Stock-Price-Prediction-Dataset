Ichan and Southwest have stated that they plan to persue option 2 According to the offer the Stub could earn between $0.50-$0.89 per share..Applying a 6 multiple gives value of $3.00 to $5.34 or $24.80 to $44.16 per Dell share.While entirely theoritical.one cannot deny that the Ichan offer gives Dell shareholders a huge upside potential as an alternative to giviing all the future upside to Michael Dell.</Msg><Username>islandbrook2000</Username><Timestamp>1368878367339</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 07:59:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368884723991-2</Id><Topic><Title>Ichan deal offers huge upside.</Title><Username>islandbrook2000</Username><Timestamp>1368878367339</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 07:59:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Does Icahn make an official offer yet?

I think that number will be higher, maybe even closer to 50% which means there will be alot more shares outstandings and EPS will be lower (of course the flip side of that is that Icahn doesn't need to use as much debt and/or cash to pay the dividend, so the balance sheet will look better). Irregardless, if Michael Dell wants to keep his company (and who wouldn't), he is probably busy right now talking with Silver Lake or Microsoft about inje cting additional money and raising his offer price. IMO, his current offer will not pass. But an offer at $15 or more I think would get the needed votes.</Msg><Username>starcushing</Username><Timestamp>1368934206972</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 23:30:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368934397990-7</Id><Topic><Title>Ichan deal offers huge upside.</Title><Username>islandbrook2000</Username><Timestamp>1368878367339</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 07:59:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Just as food for thought, one year ago the stock price was $14.70, two years ago $15.66, three years ago $14.83, so raising their bid to somewhere between $14.70 and $15.66 takes the cake.</Msg><Username>redgem264</Username><Timestamp>1368934397990</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 23:33:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
