He is a cancer and the only think he has ever done was come up with a more efficient supply chain than anyone else in the beginning of home PC's. Now he wants to develop his own IP and be a technology leader. Keep in mind this is the same guy who spent $M developing a smart phone a couple years ago that was late, expensive and a complete failure against the competition in features and usability. He did this while the market was already saturated and the competition was far beyond them in product. Do you really trust this guy with you investments? Seriously?</Msg><Username>kavack</Username><Timestamp>1369410436868</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-24 11:47:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369413270398-8</Id><Topic><Title>I found the secret to the markets.

The stub trades at $1.65 initially and may move up rapidly. But like your thinking. You'd only be giving away upside north of $3 on the stub.</Msg><Username>redgem264</Username><Timestamp>1369425953592</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-24 16:05:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
