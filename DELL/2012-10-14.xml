This will make all the ipads and kindles obselete. Who would ever pay $500 for ipad, when they can get a laptop for merely $7-800 which has the capability of a laptop and touch screen ipad. Imagine a laptop which a screen can turn 180 degree, making into a touchpad or a touchpad that has capaility of laptop with keyboards. Buy all you can at these price, cheap, dirt cheap dell.</Msg><Username>cameleonman</Username><Timestamp>1350232203723</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 12:30:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350239357105-3</Id><Topic><Title>Dell Puts Its Windows 8 Line-up Up for Pre-order</Title><Username>longsrboss</Username><Timestamp>1350153714527</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-13 14:41:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I agree as they have great functionality, are well built and are solid for business travel or accident prone school/student use....

TechCrunch: "Forbes reports the campaign costs between $1.5-$1.8 billion, making it the largest product launch in the history of the industry." The Verge: "It's no secret that Microsoft is planning a big marketing campaign around Windows 8, but one estimate suggests that the company could be willing to spend between $1.5 and $1.8 billion. The huge sum, reported by Forbes, would be around triple the amount that the company allegedly spent on its Windows Phone 7 launch two years ago."</Msg><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1350243614903</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 15:40:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350253188130-5</Id><Title>Windows 8 Ad Campaign - Starting With Pro Football Games on Sunday</Title><Msg>As The Wall Street Journal reported earlier Microsoft MSFT kicked off what is expected to be an extensive marketing campaign for Windows 8, the company’s high-stakes effort to overhaul its flagship operating system. A slew of new computers and tablets are rolling out that run on Windows 8, which is designed to work on touchscreen devices and traditional computers with keyboards and mice. The Microsoft ad, which aired Sunday during NFL games, showcases some touchscreen computers from the company’s computer-making allies, including DELL, Acer, Samsung, Lenovo and Sony. The Ad starts with a countdown clock (stopping at 8, of course) and includes rapid-fire images of Windows 8’s touch interface and a gray, chunky laptop that is destroyed–a bit evocative of Apple’s iconic “1984” ad, during which an athlete throws a sledgehammer through a droning Big Brother image then widely associated with IBM. The last images shown in the ad are a tagline, “Windows Reimagined,” and the date Oct. 26, the official launch for Windows 8-powered computers.</Msg><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1350253188130</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 18:19:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350257695133-6</Id><Topic><Title>Windows 8 Ad Campaign - Starting With Pro Football Games on Sunday</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1350253188130</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 18:19:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Microsoft blew it ten years ago.
