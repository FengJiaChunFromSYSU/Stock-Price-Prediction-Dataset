But the economic impact of cutting capital gains rates and lowering the top marginal tax rates never materialized for working families.

Berenberg, Gossler &amp; Co. KG, commonly known as Berenberg Bank, is a German multinational financial institution, primarily a merchant bank and a private bank, set up under the legal form of a limited partnership (Kommanditgesellschaft) with personally liable partners and based in Hamburg. Founded by the Berenberg family, emigrants from Antwerp in modern Belgium, in 1590, it is the oldest bank in existence in Germany and the second oldest bank in the world.[1] Since its establishment, the bank has been continuously owned by a Hanseatic family dynasty comprising the three related families Berenberg, Gossler and Seyler, making it the world's oldest family owned bank.[2] The Berenbergs were originally members of the Dutch merchant colony in Hamburg and received the same rights as the Hamburg burghers in 1605. They were hereditary grand burghers of Hamburg and thus members of its ruling class from 1684 and members of the Senate from 1735. Ennobled in 1888 and raised to baronial rank in 1910, the von Berenberg-Gossler family, descendants of Johann Hinrich Gossler and Elisabeth Berenberg, still owns a significant share of the bank.</Msg><Username>travisthechimp.obama</Username><Timestamp>1370616121930</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 10:42:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370616226160-37</Id><Topic><Title>I am not a fan of "fair" or flat taxes, but this huge IRS scandal may open the door for Congress</Title><Username>gr8d84f8</Username><Timestamp>1370612318817</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 09:38:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Repeal the 16th Amendment and replace it with one that clearly makes any income tax unconstitutional.</Msg><Username>travisthechimp.obama</Username><Timestamp>1370616226160</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 10:43:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370616410787-38</Id><Topic><Title>Judith Miller: Obama criminalizing news-gathering</Title><Username>caliente.zorra</Username><Timestamp>1370532257248</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 11:24:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Looks like UK Guardian is the only real news source in the world.

The New York Times editorial board, which has generally has been a propaganda machine for the democratic party, wrote a scathing denunciation Friday of the Obama administration’s use of data mining, claiming that “the administration has now lost all credibility" on the issue of balancing civil rights with national security. Every progressive with even a shred of moral consistency should side with the New York Times against the White House. The events of the past month – from the Associated Press subpoena to the James Rosen search warrant to the revelation that our government has been indiscriminately collecting phone records data – have forced liberals to make a choice between complacency and outrage, between keeping silent because one of our own is in the White House and calling him out on betraying the principles for which we have fought for so long. Every progressive with even a shred of moral consistency should side with the New York Times against the White House. Consistency has never been the fiber of political discourse but it is nonetheless a vital ingredient of credibility.</Msg><Username>onedinosaur</Username><Timestamp>1370630642070</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 14:44:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370632201524-72</Id><Topic><Title>data mining and data mining</Title><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1370600136379</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 06:15:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>good grief, oh so now you claim to be on the "left".......jeez..... and #$%$..... it was always done in the USA....jeez......are you just plain STUPID or what?</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1370632201524</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 15:10:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370632595823-73</Id><Title>gop trying to weasel out of cuts to the military from the sequester they forced on the USA</Title><Msg>some pubs here claim that the sequester cuts haven't really cut anything or hurt anyone..(while they whine about lower US growth caused by the sequester as predicicted).....................so why then does bag&amp;pub Puaul Ryan want to restore billions to the military?
