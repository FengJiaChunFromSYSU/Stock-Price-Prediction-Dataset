Boxing is no longer shown on network TV. Relegated to cable. Weightlifting...superheavyweights, not to be seen. Instead we get all that up close and personal stuff that only women care about. They eat it up. Now we get beach volleyball on primetime network TV. Don't know how that ever became an olympic sport. We get tennis. Tennis is a fine sport but it's just another tournament for the pros. is it a big deal seeing Serena William win? Basketball? NBA that's all. I am watching very little olympics.

Just one for me. You're right drop. It takes too much energy to sitch between IDs. What's the point? Further, Phil says I sit in front of the computer posting all day. True on occasion, but hardly ever true and certainly not lately. Too much going on. For example, my father 8 days ago. He was 87. Came down with pink eye that developed into pneumonia. Maybe the other way around for all I know about medicine. Dead in less than a week after pink eye. What a shock. Great man, my dad. Haven't posted much at all until today.</Msg><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1344114202000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 17:03:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344114406000-42</Id><Title>Russian playing beach volleyball</Title><Msg>like they really have beaches in Russia that are good enough and warm enough to play beach volleyball.
