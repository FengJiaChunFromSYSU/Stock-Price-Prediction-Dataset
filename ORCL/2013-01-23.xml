The Bureau of Labor Statistics says the unionization rate fell from 11.8 percent to 11.3 percent of all workers, the lowest level since the 1930s. Total union membership fell by about 400,000 workers to 14.4 million. Teachers unions were among the hardest hit, with the ranks of public school teachers and educators falling sharply. Unions also saw losses in the private sector, even as the economy expanded modestly. The private sector unionization rate fell from 6.9 percent to 6.6 percent. Unions have steadily lost members since their peak in the 1950s, when about one of every three workers was in a union.</Msg><Username>econ_meister</Username><Timestamp>1358957198619</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 11:06:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358965449973-9</Id><Title>Post Inaugural Humor</Title><Msg>Nothing much can be done about the circumstances the pols have produced.

She contradicted herself several times and the best was when she reiterated the need for the US to continue to have a presense in the mideast as the terrorist groups are behind much of the civil strife, AFTER she makes excuses about why we weren't there to protect the embassy in Libya but now we need to be there for terrorists threats. What does she think she is, foolproof? What difference does it make? Maybe those killed would still be alive??? I nearly fell out of my chair when some of her Dem colleagues praised her for her competent leadership. She is all mouth and no brains.

No where is this historically recorded. Lincoln made it clear that ALL men are created equal. But it was the southern Democrats who fought to keep slavery.
