BY DUMPING IT</Title><Msg>and this trend began a LONG time ago In the past, retirees could often count on their employers to provide health insurance until Medicare kicked in, or sometimes even after they were eligible for Medicare. But in 2007, only a third of large employers offered retiree health insurance, down from 66% in 1988, according to a survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research &amp; Education Trust. Only 5% of employers with fewer than 200 employees offered retiree health insurance last year.

Under this gang the Kenyan is supporting Christians will be robbed, raoped and murdered. The Chaldean Christian community in San Diego has attested to this fact. Saddam let them live in peace. We sold Saddam the poison gas and biologicals. I've heard young troopers that helped destroy the ammo dump at Kamiseyah in So. Iraq tell of the U.S. ordinance markings on the canisters they destroyed there in Gulf War I. You are lied to about everything by these criminals that run this government. Why choose any side? Let alone arm and support such as the Muslim Brotherhood and Al Queda.
