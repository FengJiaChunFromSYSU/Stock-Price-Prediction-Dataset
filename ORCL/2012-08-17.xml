Romney seems to think he plays by a different set of rules than every other presidential candidate for the last thirty years, all of whom lived up to the standard of transparency set by Mitt Romney's father and released their tax returns." .................................................................. Romney should just hold fast. I think hewill. Romney knows the dems don't are about how much tax he's paid. They want to use tax returns for more attacks. Romney is smart not to give it to them.</Msg><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1345199465000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 06:31:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345206386000-2</Id><Topic><Title>Romney talks about his taxes</Title><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1345142893000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 14:48:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nonprofit raises eyebrows with mailings seeking to increase voter registration By Eric Shawn Published August 17, 2012 "Register to vote today!" instructs the envelope of the mailer, which notes: "Voter registration documents enclosed." For help, the brochure instructs people to "Please visit the Texas Secretary of State website," and the return address for the enclosed voter registration form is: "The Voter Participation Center, Office of Secretary of State, Elections Division, PO Box 12060, Austin, TX, 78711-9904." What has concerned some recipients, though, is that Texas elections officials did not send it. These voter registration forms, and others like them in other states, are being mailed nationwide by a nonprofit in Washington, D.C., called the Voter Participation Center. The organization says it is working to help register the estimated 73 million Americans nationwide who are currently not on the voting rolls, specifically targeting what it describes as underrepresented voting blocs. But officials in states like Florida, Texas, Louisiana and others report that the mailers are causing confusion among residents and that they’ve shown up in mailboxes addressed to dead people, children and even dogs and cats. "It's just ridiculous, and I think needs to be exposed for what it is," Louisiana Secretary of State Tom Schedler said. He said the mailings in his state have been rife with problems, and only about 10 percent of those his office has received have actually been valid registrations. "This is happening all over the country prior to the presidential election," said Schedler, a Republican. "It needs to be stopped, and folks need to take a look at it because the integrity of the election ... is utmost in my mind." "This is America, it's their right," he added. "But I don't know why they would try to, in my opinion, disrupt the process and cause undue work on states." Schedler has charged that the Voter Participation Center's mailings also "open the door to voter fraud." Several people contacted Fox News with concerns about the mailers. One man reported that he received a voter registration solicitation in his mother’s name. The problem is, his mother has been dead for 12 years. "This all looks like a total fraud to me," says another viewer, who contacted Fox News to investigate why the group was pitching a voter registration form that, he said, appeared to be an official government mailing to, in his case, someone who cannot even legally vote.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1345206386000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 08:26:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345206673000-3</Id><Topic><Title>SEALs Swift Boating Obama?</Title><Username>whycantphiligetawoman</Username><Timestamp>1345204237000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 07:50:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>About F'ing time...

How's About A Hand For Poor George! Your Brother!</Title><Msg>Actually, George has a real life brother who just happens to be the President of the United States. (George Obama is the youngest of eight children sired by Barack Obama Sr.) George’s brother is a multimillionaire and the most powerful man in the world. Moreover, George’s brother has framed his re-election campaign around the “fair share” theme that we owe obligations to those who are less fortunate. One of Obama’s favorite phrases comes right out of the Bible: “We are our brother’s keeper.” Yet he has not contributed a penny to help his own brother. And evidently George does not believe, even in times of emergency, that he can turn to his brother in the White House for help. So much for spreading the wealth around.... So what’s the real story here? Where’s George Obama’s “fair share”? George’s tragic situation exposes President Obama as a hypocrite. Here is a man who demands that others pay higher taxes to help the poor—even poor people who are not related to them—while Obama himself refuses to help a close relative like George. Barack is a total F'ing hypocrite to the core!</Msg><Username>charlie59603</Username><Timestamp>1345233209000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 15:53:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345234382000-53</Id><Topic><Title>these voter id laws,,, clearly show what SCUM repubs are</Title><Username>dropkickuuuuuuu</Username><Timestamp>1345173312000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 23:15:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Right on!

That aside, Romney is smart not to release his tax returns. You libs don't especially care what he had paid. You want to see his reuturns to attack him further. Ifhe turned over his taxes, you wouldn't be satisfied. You'd want more.

Congrats! It was the Dems who started dipping into SS funds years ago. How did they manage to get away with it? They outvoted the Repubs. If it wasn't for them stealing from seniors, SS wouldn't be where it is today, and the government wouldn't be rubbing nickels together until the buffalo s**ts. You distinctly said that Clinton left Bush with a 6T debt. When did you have fits about that, you dumb wop. Now you tack it on Bush, is that right? You blithering goon, contradicting yourself is nothing new, I regard it as babbling nonsense more suited for a round table discussion on MSNBC. In reality, Reagan put us on the road to fiscal responsibility and was sweeping up after Carter. Clinton was subdued by a Republican Congress that held the reins from spending out of control. The war with Iraq did not bury us, the US has always recovered financially after wars, because we had a workforce that kept the country from resorting to printing money like toilet paper. Where are those jobs, do you think that wouldn't make a difference? It's really too bad you've been suckered to believe it was "everyone but Obama". Again, Congrats!
