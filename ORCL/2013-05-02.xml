The Sarin gas Saddam had in Gulf War I came from the U.S. I've heard young troopers that destroyed the ammo dump at Kamiseyah in So. Iraq say that the cannisters bore U.S. ordnance markings.

I used current, Total Employment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. You can go look it up. You dig up the same, old stale articles that have been debunked 27 times and just use them over and over. Simple facts are: Total Employment end of Clinton: 136.6 million Total Employment end of Bush_43: 142.2 million Change: 143.2 - 136.5 = 5.6 million new jobs under Bush_43 Which proves that your WSJ article is flatly WRONG! (As well as old and stale!) The BS about how unemployment rate jumped by 2.8% at end of Bush Presidency is old, tired and stale. You will note THAT IT HAS NEVER COME DOWN AGAIN EITHER! Which is more proof that Obama is a FAILURE! Obama holds the record for longest period of Unemployment over 8% since 1948! It's currently under 8% now (like 7.6%), but that is CLEARLY because people have been dropping out of the labor force. People on SSI disability have jumped from about 7 million to 14 million. People opting out for early retirement (age 62) are at an all time high too! More people than ever in poverty. (In fact, there is a greater percent of Americans in poverty now, than when Lyndon Johnson started his "War on Poverty" and "Great Society!") More people than ever on food stamps. Every day in every way, Obama is a FAILURE! Total Employment is marginal. The Employment participation rate is the lowest SINCE the Reagan era, before women really entered the employment market! Here's a fact for ya: Obama's increase in Total Employment Jan-09 to Mar-13 (50 months) is 1.133 million jobs. That works out to an average of 22,660 new jobs per month, during his entire term, through Mar-2013! THIS IS DISMAL &amp; HOPELESS!

You might be French. From, The Christian Science Monitor In Southern Europe, unemployment is rampant. In the north, particularly Germany, the public is grumbling that they are bailing out the fiscally irresponsible. And everywhere on the continent, Europe's vaunted welfare states are under threat. Austerity, disillusionment, joblessness: across Europe the mood is dour. But while devoid of the panicking and protesting sweeping other countries with a safety net still tightly woven, it is France where – psychologically – the crisis appears to be felt the most. A staggering 80 percent of French say they’ve been personally impacted by the economic crisis, according to a new poll by the academic pollster YouGov-Cambridge. [. . .] The French consistently rank as some of the least upbeat citizens on the globe, despite a 35-hour work week and generous social benefits that range from free preschools and swimming pools to universities and healthcare. A 2011 WIN-Gallup poll revealed the French to be less optimistic than war-torn Iraqis and Afghans. “You will realize that the French are never happy. Complaining should be a national sport,” says political journalist Christian Malard, who was partly educated in the UK and Canada, has traveled and worked extensively in the US, and sums up his nation as one of "whiners." And it’s a nationality trait that goes far beyond the current business cycle. A low-level of life satisfaction of the French, especially when adjusting for GDP, has been recorded since the 1970s.</Msg><Username>beelzebufo_ampinga_10048</Username><Timestamp>1367531145771</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 17:45:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367531375516-52</Id><Topic><Title>higher tax Clinton era was the longest period of peacetime economic expansion in American history</Title><Username>granniefritz</Username><Timestamp>1367452336607</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 19:52:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>good grief.... the data was in for both Clinton and Bush when the wsj reported in 2009 that WSJ Staff Bush On Jobs: The Worst Track Record On Record The Bush administration created about three million jobs (net) over its eight years, a fraction of the 23 million jobs created under President Bill Clinton‘s administration and only slightly better than President George H.W.

Ibama now has the worst employment record since 1948. I just proved to you TWICE that during Bush_43s term, Total Employment increased by 5.5 to 5.6 million. The current BLS data says so. Go look FOOL! Obama now has 51 months of Unemployment rate over 7%. That's not quite the worst since 1948, but he is sure working for the tie. Technically, the jump in unemployment at the end of Bush's term was NOT exclusively from Bush's policies. He was a Lame Duck President with a Democrat majority Congress FOOL! The high U/E rate was from Democrats sabotaging the economy to get Obama elected! For most of Bush's term the U/E rate was between 4.2% and 5.8%. When the Democrats took over Congress in Jan-2007 it was 4.6%. By the next year, Jan-2008, it was 5.0%. It started increasing over 6% in Aug-2008 and was 7.3% by Dec-2008 and 7.8% when Obama took over in Jan-2009. It is well known that the Democrats committed treason to sabotage the economy in 2008 to get Obama elected. THEY were the dominant party in Congress. AND Obama participated (both as Senator and later as President elect) in corrective legislation during the last quarter of 2008. So the point is that the unemployment rate was NOT caused (exclusively) by Bush policies. There were a LOT more Democrats involved! So we come back to the fact that you are a liar, a jerk and an IDIOT! But what else is new? And why are you so dumb as to keep challenging me? You know I always crush you with THEE TRUTH!

Do you remember the mid-term electio0ns of 2006, with Nancy Pelosi screaming "DRAIN THE SWAMP!" (This was due to "bath room toe tappers" if you recall!) Now when the Democrats took over Congress in Jan-2007, the U/E rate was 4.6%!!!!!! The unemployed were only 7.1 million people! The total employment level was 146.0 million people. The Labor Participation rate was 66.4%! What are those numbers today, after six years of Democrat dominated Congresses including four plus years of a Democrat President? The U/E rate is 7.6% which is 3.0 points higher! There are 11.7 million people unemployed, which is 4.1 million more unemployed people! Total Employment is 143.2 million which is 2.8 million people LESS! The Labor Participation rate is 63.3% which is 3.1 points LESS! Meanwhile, the numbers of people on SSI disability has doubled since 2009. The number of people who have retired early has increased drastically, endangering Social Security. (Meanwhile, Obama created what he calls, "The Payrool Tax Cut," which decreases the SSI Tax, destabilizing the SSI program!) The number of people on SNAPS (food stamps) is at an all time high! People are running out of their 99 Weeks of Unemployment (which is itself at an all time high, long, benefit!) More families than ever are classified as being "in poverty!"
