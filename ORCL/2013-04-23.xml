Murder rates in most of the Muslim world are very low compared to the United States. As for political violence, people of Christian heritage in the twentieth century polished off tens of millions of people in the two world wars and colonial repression. This massive carnage did not occur because European Christians are worse than or different from other human beings, but because they were the first to industrialize war and pursue a national model. Sometimes it is argued that they did not act in the name of religion but of nationalism. But, really, how naive. Religion and nationalism are closely intertwined. The British monarch is the head of the Church of England, and that still meant something in the first half of the twentieth century, at least. The Swedish church is a national church. Spain? Was it really unconnected to Catholicism? Did the Church and Francisco Franco’s feelings toward it play no role in the Civil War? And what’s sauce for the goose: much Muslim violence is driven by forms of modern nationalism, too. I don’t figure that Muslims killed more than a 2 million people or so in political violence in the entire twentieth century, and that mainly in the Iran-Iraq War 1980-1988 and the Soviet and post-Soviet wars in Afghanistan, for which Europeans bear some blame. Compare that to the Christian European tally of, oh, lets say 100 million (16 million in WW I, 60 million in WW II– though some of those were attributable to Buddhists in Asia– and millions more in colonial wars.)</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1366735609942</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-23 12:46:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366735626862-24</Id><Title>There is waaaaaay too much evidence all around the country AND WORLD of places with more controls and less violence..</Title><Msg>I don't want you or me to hand over our guns and don't expect we'll be asked but we should accept some more controls that won't bother us other than taking a moment of our time or something that shouldn't matter but will keep maybe some guns aways from those that shouldn't have them.</Msg><Username>dropkickpubs4321</Username><Timestamp>1366735626862</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-23 12:47:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366736839860-25</Id><Topic><Title>30,000 gun deaths in USA per year, gop does nothing.

For example, at the Syracuse Gun Show on the New York State Fairgrounds last weekend, so many people showed up that some had to wait in line more than two hours just to get into the gun show. Those that waited did so on a windy day, amid sleet and snow flurries. Moreover, for this specific gun show, few people came to sell guns; most came to buy them and find the ammo they needed for their guns at home. Jeff Dillard, who runs the National Armory in Pompano Beach, FL, said the combination of the "terrorist attacks" and possible gun control legislation put people into a "panic situation" again. He said acquiring ammunition and ammunition components is getting more and more difficult: "Our [ammunition] vendors are telling us not only are they out of stock but some are two to three million [bullets] in back order. They won't even take our orders because they don't know when they'll be able to fill them."</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1366737777820</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-23 13:22:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366737968587-28</Id><Topic><Title>30,000 gun deaths in USA per year, gop does nothing.

Same thing has happened with guns which are smuggled into this country by the thousands and can be bought on a street corner.

Senator Rand Paul (R-Ky) in a letter to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid today urged him to reconsider immigration legislation because of the bombings in Boston. “The facts emerging in the Boston Marathon bombing have exposed a weakness in our current system,” Paul writes. “If we don’t use this debate as an opportunity to fix flaws in our current system, flaws made even more evident last week, then we will not be doing our jobs.”Senator Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa). Senator Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), senior Republican senator on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is responsible for an immigration reform bill, is using much the same language – suggesting that the investigation of two alleged Boston attackers will “help shed light on the weaknesses of our system.” Can we just get a grip? Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is a naturalized American citizen. He came to the United States when he was nine years old. He attended the public schools of Cambridge, Massachusetts, not far from where I lived.</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1366752066821</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-23 17:21:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366752860402-39</Id><Topic><Title>Obama, Napolitano, Holder, Clapper Just Can't Get Anything Right...

Think Dresden, Hiroshima and Nagasaki. None were military targets They were singled out for sheer terror against civilians. The Japanes were seeking to surrender when the two A-Bombs were dropped. Many people aren't aware of it but a number American POW's were killed in one of the blasts. No telling how many Iraqi civilians were killed by George Bush. They are still paying a toll due to the depleted uranium spread all over the place.
