"Unless the Romney campaign has gamed this crisis out in some manner completely invisible to the Gang of 500, his doubling down on criticism of the President for the statement coming out of Cairo is likely to be seen as one of the most craven and ill-advised tactical moves in this entire campaign," opined Time's Mark Halperin. That instant conventional wisdom is a pretty fortunate turn of events for Obama, given that it diverted focus from his administration's bungled handling of the entire situation and the failure of his broader foreign policy posture. When President Obama came into his office, he vowed to repair the damage to the U.S. image abroad that was done by the Bush administration. In April 2009, less than three months into his presidency, he boasted to the Turkish government of having ordered the closure of Guantanamo Bay and prohibited the use of torture. "The United States is still working through some of our own darker periods in our history," he went on, referring to the legacies of slavery, segregation and the treatment of Native Americans. In June, Obama delivered a speech in Cairo in which he called for "a new beginning" between the U.S. and the Muslim world. Taken together, such instances became known in conservative circles as the "apology tour." Though fact checkers have pointed out that Obama never literally issued an apology, it's clear that Obama was trying to make a break with the past. Especially in the Middle East, he wanted to send the signal that his approach would be more conciliatory and sensitive to Islamic values than what preceded it. Yet, on Tuesday, the breach of the U.S. Embassy in Cairo on Sept. 11 and replacement of the American flag with one resembling the flag of al Qaeda represented an example of the type of anti-American sentiment that Obama's more conciliatory posture was meant to quell. Later, we learned that an American ambassador had been killed in an attack in Libya, along with three other diplomats. When a statement surfaced from the U.S. Embassy in Cairo condemning, "the continuing efforts by misguided individuals to hurt the religious feelings of Muslims" and "firmly [rejecting] the actions by those who abuse the universal right of free speech to hurt the religious beliefs of others," it looked like weakness in the face of the attack. There are conflicting reports as to whether this statement -- a reference to an online American-made film mocking Islam -- was issued before or after the assault on the embassy started. But on its Twitter account, the Embassy later reiterated that its statement "still stands." Back in Washington, the Obama administration distanced itself from its own embassy's statement, which isn't some minor outpost but the representative of U.S. policy in arguably the most important Arab nation. Soon, the Embassy began deleting messages from its official Twitter account, including the one standing by its initial statement. This looked like amateur hour, and it also fed into the broader critique many Republicans have made of the Obama administration. So it seemed natural that Romney would release a statement Tuesday night condemning both the attacks and Obama's weak response. But Obama campaign press secretary Ben LaBolt shot back and said he was "shocked" Romney would play politics at such a time. And the media fell into line. When Romney gave a press conference Wednesday, the questions focused on whether it was appropriate for him to criticize Obama at the time he did. Romney's responses didn't really matter, because reporters had already decided their narrative. Obama did not take any questions in his own press conference moments later. In 2004, John Kerry routinely attacked President Bush's handling of Iraq when things weren't going well in the country. And the media dutifully reported on Bush's foreign policy blunders in Iraq. But now, instead of scrutinizing Obama's handling of a foreign policy crisis, the media has decided that the real story in Egypt and Libya is a Mitt Romney gaffe.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1347535966714</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-13 07:32:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347537626958-6</Id><Topic><Title>Obama Regime Naturally Blames ME Riots On "American Bigotry"!!</Title><Username>moveon_moveoutnow</Username><Timestamp>1347535569898</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-13 07:26:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And there is no way in Hell that Hillary and someone in the White House did not approve that "American Bigotry" statement before it went out!!

"Last week we registered 100,000 dead voters," Obama said. "Those are some big numbers." In poll after poll, the Obama campaign has persistently done better among registered voters or the general adult population than likely voters — pointing an electorate that supporters the president but only tepidly. One poll even found Obama leading among unlikely voters — a major incentive for the campaign to identify likely supporters, register them to vote, and get them to turn out on election day. It's a political cliché — but Obama told supporters that the election was going to come down to turnout. "There are a bunch of states where if turnout is like it was in 2010, we lose. if turnout is like it was in 2008, we win," Obama said. Praising volunteer efforts, Obama said that voting turnout efforts and registration drives were the most important tools in the campaign's arsenal. "A lot of people care deeply about the direction of our country but they're not in the habit of voting," Obama said. "Sometimes the rules are purposely made difficult in terms of voting and they haven't been asked to register to vote."</Msg><Username>onedinosaur</Username><Timestamp>1347545975324</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-13 10:19:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347548109163-13</Id><Topic><Title>Obama's Entire Coddle Islam-Blame America Policy Exploding Across The Middle East !</Title><Username>moveon_moveoutnow</Username><Timestamp>1347530531697</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-13 06:02:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Kenyan tribal clashes leave 116 dead Violence in volatile coastal region gives rise to suspicions of political motives and Somali involvement as elections approach Thursday 13 September 2012 10.19 EDT Kenyan tribal clashes Two men carry their belongings away from an area near Chamwanamuma village in the Tana river delta in Kenya.

COMMENTS (667) SHARE: In an interview with Telemundo Wednesday night, Obama said that the U.S. relationship with the new Egyptian government was a "work in progress," and emphasized that the United States is counting on the government of Egypt to better protect the U.S. Embassy in Cairo, which was attacked by protesters on Sept. 11. "I don't think that we would consider them an ally, but we don't consider them an enemy," Obama said. "They're a new government that is trying to find its way. They were democratically elected. I think that we are going to have to see how they respond to this incident." That comment had Egypt watchers scratching their heads, especially since technically, Egypt was designated as a Major Non-NATO Ally in 1989 when Congress first passed the law creating that status, which gives them special privileges in cooperating with the United States, especially in the security and technology areanas. White House spokesman Tommy Vietor told The Cable Thursday that the administration is not signaling a change in that status. "I think folks are reading way too much into this," Vietor said. "‘Ally' is a legal term of art. We don't have a mutual defense treaty with Egypt like we do with our NATO allies. But as the president has said, Egypt is longstanding and close partner of the United States, and we have built on that foundation by supporting Egypt's transition to democracy and working with the new government." Vietor referred to Obama's Wednesday phone call with Mohamed Morsy, during which Obama pressed the Egyptian president to ensure the safety and protection of U.S. personnel and facilities in Egypt. Morsy agreed to do so, according to a White House statement on the phone call. "The President said that he rejects efforts to denigrate Islam, but underscored that there is never any justification for violence against innocents and acts that endanger American personnel and facilities," the statement said. "President Morsi expressed his condolences for the tragic loss of American life in Libya and emphasized that Egypt would honor its obligation to ensure the safety of American personnel." Administration sources told The Cable that Obama's "ally" comment was not pre-arranged or prepared by staff and that the question was not anticipated. Nevertheless, Middle East experts said Obama's word choice and tone is likely a reflection of the administration's feeling that Morsy's reaction to the attacks has not been forceful enough. "I think it's a message from Obama that taking a less than assertive position on this is going to cost the [Egyptian] leadership at least rhetorically in the short term," said Andrew Tabler, senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Studies. "We heard that the Muslim Brotherhood was going to be a cooperative partner and their actions and statements yesterday were not a good example of that." Pre-planned or not, the comments carry weight, Tabler said. He also noted that Obama was surely crafting his message not only for the Egyptians, but also for his American audience as well. The White House has come under fire for a press release from the Cairo embassy issued before the protest started that Republican challenger Mitt Romney slammed as an "apology for our values." As The Cable reported Wednesday, State Department officials in Washington objected to that statement before it was issued -- and the White House later disavowed it -- but it has nevertheless become an issue in the presidential campaign. "It's important to remember, Obama's comment happened in both a security and political context," Tabler said.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1347563827837</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-13 15:17:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347564468718-22</Id><Topic><Title>Obama's Entire Coddle Islam-Blame America Policy Exploding Across The Middle East !</Title><Username>moveon_moveoutnow</Username><Timestamp>1347530531697</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-13 06:02:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You seek nothing but Pigshyt, comprende chumpo!

September 13, 2012 1:20 pm U.S. Marines defending the American embassy in Egypt were not permitted by the Obama Administration to carry live ammunition, limiting their ability to respond to attacks like those this week on the U.S. consulate in Cairo. Ambassador to Egypt Anne Patterson “did not permit U.S. Marine guards to carry live ammunition,” according to multiple reports on U.S. Marine Corps blogs spotted by Nightwatch. “She neutralized any U.S. military capability that was dedicated to preserve her life and protect the US Embassy.” U.S. officials have yet to confirm or comment on the reports. Time magazine’s Battleland blog reported Thursday “Senior U.S. officials late Wednesday declined to discuss in detail the security at either Cairo or Benghazi, so answers may be slow in coming.” If true, the reports indicate that Patterson shirked her obligation to protect U.S. interests, Nightwatch states. “She did not defend U.S. sovereign territory and betrayed her oath of office,” the report states. “She neutered the Marines posted to defend the embassy, trusting the Egyptians over the Marines.” While Marines are typically relied on to defend U.S. territory abroad, such as embassies, these reports indicate that the Obama administration was relying on Egypt’s new Muslim Brotherhood-backed government to ensure American security, a move observers are questioning as violence in Cairo continues to rage. Marc Toner, the State Department’s deputy spokesperson, did not respond to a request for comment from the Free Beacon. White House National Security Council spokesperson Tommy Vietor also did not respond to a request for comment. The U.S. ambassador to any nation ultimately decides whether Marines are authorized to carry ammunition, according to a GOP national security adviser knowledgeable about American embassy protocols. “In the end, the ambassador of any country has the final call on what to do in a country,” the source said. “The buck stops with you. You make every decision.” Security procedures are subjective and subject to change depending on locale, the source said. Each ambassador, in consultation with their Regional Security Officer (RSO), sets the policy regarding the rules of engagement, according to the adviser. The RSO is responsible for coordinating all security measures and reports directly to the ambassador in any given nation. “A decision or order to set rules of engagement that you can’t carry live ammunition and can’t engage violent crowds climbing over your walls and tearing down your flag stems from direct orders from the Chief of Mission and possibly whoever the Chief of Mission reports to,” the source explained. Given that the siege of the Cairo embassy unfolded over many hours, the source wondered if new orders pertaining to the rules of engagement were ever issued. Ambassador Anne Patterson was in D.C. during the attacks, according to reports. “I cannot believe that over an eight hour period that nobody … in that chain of command did not ask those questions of their superiors,” the source said. “These protestors did not just appear and within 20 minutes climb the wall.” The Free Beacon will continue to update this report as events warrant.</Msg><Username>onedinosaur</Username><Timestamp>1347564792288</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-13 15:33:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347564902409-25</Id><Title>The Only Fact Proven By QE3 Is That The Obama Economy Is Tanking!!</Title><Msg>And naturally, with the Stock Market butt-heads having a long-term horizon of Four weeks, it's going higher!

Don't take new debts.</Title><Msg>It's a demand problem they say. People aren't spending enough they say. Of course this flies in the face of the fact that, in aggregate, Americans are spending too much: the US account deficit shows that the US as a whole is spending more than it earns. And most people just don't have the money. So Bernanke wants them to borrow more. Now households in the US already have way too much debt. And companies and government too: they all have too much debt. But that doesn't matter to Bernanke you see: he wants them to borrow more and more, regardless on how much debt they have. They shouldn't be allowed to pay back debts, they must take on more. Every way to force people to go in debt will be used: pump money, lower rates, make sure students don't leave college before they are loaded like donkeys. Make sure home buyers are loaded up to the eyeballs. All these are calculated moves to grow debt. They seem oblivious to the fact that what is missing is not demand, it is production: with more production and therefore more earnings, Americans might have the actual means to spend. But the authorities don't want to do anything about this. And who profits: people already rich see their assets pumped up. People owning the debts see less defaults and more returns... People take debt because they think there will be inflation. But since the money never flows to most people, there won't be inflation and debts won't be eroded. These moves profit banks, while they are catastrophic for the idiots who take the debt. In the face of this heresy, there is only one defense: Save more. Don't take new debts.</Msg><Username>nazyoyo</Username><Timestamp>1347575453602</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-13 18:30:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347576121490-34</Id><Topic><Title>The Feds are insane: Save more.

The killings of the US ambassador to Libya and three of his staff were likely to have been the result of a serious and continuing security breach, The Independent can reveal. American officials believe the attack was planned, but Chris Stevens had been back in the country only a short while and the details of his visit to Benghazi, where he and his staff died, were meant to be confidential. The US administration is now facing a crisis in Libya. Sensitive documents have gone missing from the consulate in Benghazi and the supposedly secret location of the "safe house" in the city, where the staff had retreated, came under sustained mortar attack. Other such refuges across the country are no longer deemed "safe". Some of the missing papers from the consulate are said to list names of Libyans who are working with Americans, putting them potentially at risk from extremist groups, while some of the other documents are said to relate to oil contracts. According to senior diplomatic sources, the Obama Administration had credible information 48 hours before mobs charged the consulate in Benghazi, and the embassy in Cairo, that American missions may be targeted, but no warnings were given for diplomats to go on high alert and "lockdown", under which movement is severely restricted. Mr Stevens had been on a visit to Germany, Austria and Sweden and had just returned to Libya when the Benghazi trip took place with the US embassy's security staff deciding that the trip could be undertaken safely. Eight Americans, some from the military, were wounded in the attack which claimed the lives of Mr Stevens, Sean Smith, an information officer, and two US Marines. All staff from Benghazi have now been moved to the capital, Tripoli, and those whose work is deemed to be non-essential may be flown out of Libya. In the meantime a Marine Corps FAST Anti-Terrorism Reaction Team has already arrived in the country from a base in Spain and other personnel are believed to be on the way. Additional units have been put on standby to move to other states where their presence may be needed in the outbreak of anti-American fury triggered by publicity about a film which demeaned the Prophet Mohamed.</Msg><Username>hikemanymiles</Username><Timestamp>1347586068497</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-13 21:27:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347586223847-45</Id><Topic><Title>GM is Alive, and OSAMA is DEAD!, so says Joe Biden</Title><Username>ourfirstpantroglodytepresident</Username><Timestamp>1347586002942</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-13 21:26:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Shouldn't Obama apologize for killing Bin Laden, instead of bragging?</Msg><Username>ourfirstpantroglodytepresident</Username><Timestamp>1347586223847</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-13 21:30:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347586556077-46</Id><Topic><Title>GM is Alive, and OSAMA is DEAD!, so says Joe Biden</Title><Username>ourfirstpantroglodytepresident</Username><Timestamp>1347586002942</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-13 21:26:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>September 13, 2012 at 6:17 pm Organized Crime leader compares GOP to Cambodian dictator By David Shepardson International Brotherhood of Teamsters Mafia President James Hoffa discussed the presidential election, state of the organized labor in the United States and trade policy during a luncheon at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. on Thursday. Zoom International Brotherhood of Teamsters President James Hoffa discussed the presidential election, state of the organized labor in the United States and trade policy during a luncheon at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. on Thursday. (Chuck Myers/MCT) Washington — Teamsters President James Hoffa on Thursday compared the Republican Party to genocidal Cambodian leader Pol Pot and likened the tea party to the John Birch Society. In remarks before the National Press Club, the fiery Detroit-born leader in his fourth term of running the 1.4-million member union also said the future of organized labor is at stake. He said the GOP at its national convention in Tampa, Fla., two weeks ago didn't talk about "what they really believe in" or highlight former leaders like President George W. Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin. "The Republicans are rewriting history," Hoffa said, saying the party is ignoring Bush's eight years in office. "There is no eight years. There was no recession. There were no wars. Nothing every happened during those eight years." The GOP wants to suggest "history began" with President Barack Obama and ignores all of the problems before 2009. "We're starting from Day One. It's like Pol Pot — basically start the Day One, the new calendars." Pol Pot led the Khmer Rouge which was responsible for the deaths of about 2 million people in Cambodia. Hoffa said the GOP has become "the far, far right." He compared the tea party to the John Birch Society, the radical anti-Communist group that opposed civil rights legislation and wants to dismantle the Federal Reserve System and exit the United Nations. "New John Birch Society — now it's called the tea party but it's basically again to go to a far-off place and roll the clock back to about 1890," Hoffa said. Hoffa noted the attacks on public sector workers' rights to collective bargaining in states. "There's a war on workers," Hoffa said. "We are the only ones standing in the way of this movement to turn the country to the far right. They're taking us on because they realize if they can knock out labor … they'll have a free run because we are the only ones that stand in the way." Hoffa said unions are working hard to ensure the right to organize. "We really are fighting back," he said. Opponents are out to destroy unions, Hoffa said. "The right wing knows and believes that labor is the backbone of the Democratic (Party). … We are strong. We are organized. We have money and we have boots on the ground. " Hoffa hopes the federal government will soon end an anti-corruption consent decree against the union that's been in place since 1989. "We've been working on this for a long time," Hoffa said. "We would like to see it lifted. We're talking to the government. … Our union is a clean union. There's no corruption in our union." Compliance with the decree costs the union about $3 million to $4 million annually, money Hoffa would like to use for organizing new members. "We're looking forward to settling our case," Hoffa said. "We're ready to enter into a very good settlement for both sides and both of us declare victory." He also called for a constitutional amendment to overturn the Supreme Court's "Citizens United" decision that allows unlimited money to be spent on elections. "Otherwise (the decision) is going to destroy America," Hoffa said, saying labor will be outspent 8 to 1. "We do not have enough money to do what we want with regard to this campaign." Hoffa, one of the first national labor leaders to back Obama in 2008, recounted the union's efforts to work with President George W. Bush in 2000, but he said the GOP wasn't really interested. "We just want to use you," Hoffa said of the GOP's approach to labor. "It didn't last very long. We found out that they really weren't sincere about helping labor, helping people get their jobs back. After that we got a divorce."</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1347586556077</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-13 21:35:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347587057187-47</Id><Topic><Title>Ben Bernake claims Barack Obama's blithering incompetence is surprising.</Title><Username>ourfirstpantroglodytepresident</Username><Timestamp>1347585796588</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-13 21:23:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Long live Uncle Ben!
