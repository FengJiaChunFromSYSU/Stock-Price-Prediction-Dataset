They doctor all the reports, compare apples and oranges and lie if need be. I've read a lot on the vsubject and talked to people at the UC campus in San Diego that track such things. "Global Warming" AND cooling have occurred over and over in the past. It has gone to much greater extremes than anything we have seen in the past few hundred years. Long before man could have had any effect on it. "Igor" lied through his teeth as he teamed up with George Soros in a "Carbon Exchange". Had it not flopped both would have made many millions of dollars on our backs. *** Current civilization on Earth developed after the last Ice Age. Yes, the climate warmed up on Earth after the Ice Age. It had nothing to do with humans, gasoline exhaust or factories.

Don't know why I even reply to estupidos that think they know something. Grrenland was much warmer a thousand years ago and simultaneously Europe had a "Little Ice Age". I can bet you don't know why. Greenloand cooled and Europe warmed since then.

LBJ started stealing money from SS during the 'Nam thing and it's been going on ever since. SS funds have been used so government can spend more. They will lie about everything. I took my statement showing all I had paid into SS an. d doubled it (employers cont.) then compounded it year by year by the average long term gain of the Dow Industrials. I started drawing SS at age 62 . At that time it would have amounted to $250,000. See what kind of an annuity you could have for that much money.</Msg><Username>lewcor</Username><Timestamp>1357750792483</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 11:59:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357757318859-9</Id><Title>What Recovery?</Title><Msg>Dennys and Wendys cutting worker hours to avoid Obamacare.
