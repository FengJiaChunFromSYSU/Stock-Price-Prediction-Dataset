They pride themselves on their "diversity." But they don't rate weather Obama is a successful president who is good for the USA. For some reason the Mormon religion is NOT considered "diversity." Nor is a successful, international businessman considered a man of "diversity." Nor do they consider that a successful man could be a success for the USA.

In many metro areas, the advantage comes much sooner. In Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and Tampa, for example, owning beats renting after 1.6 years, the study finds. Zillow determined the breakeven horizon—the point at which owning becomes more financially advantageous than renting the same home--for more than 200 metro areas and 7,500 cities around the U.S. Unlike a simple purchase price-to-rent ratio, the breakeven horizon takes into account such other data as taxes, tax deductions, down payments, utilities, appreciation, maintenance, opportunity costs, and fluctuations in the rental market."

Unfortunately, it is also broken. That's right. For all its stature, the payroll report (which will be released Friday) has a major flaw — and it's a doozy. The headline unemployment rate is essentially a bunch of bunk. The current 8.2% figure you hear about so often is wildly inaccurate and doesn't fairly reflect the true state of the nation's labor force. It's a deficiency that Wall Street-types have long adjusted for with a wink-wink sort of acceptance, knowing full well that the so-called "U-3" headline number is actually a quagmire of exclusions and adjustments that under-reports the real situation by as much as 50%. "It's simply a matter of Congress saying, 'We're not going to use this number. We're going to use the other numbers that you've calculated that we think are more representative of what the unemployment situation really looks like in this country,'" says Congressman Duncan Hunter in the attached video. He points out that changing the calculation wouldn't cost a thing, since the data is already available. It's a problem that he and a growing number of lawmakers want to fix, and it's why the California Republican has sponsored the Real Unemployment Calculation Act — a legislative fix that would require the Department of Labor to get real about what it tells the American people. In fact, unbeknownst to most people, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) tabulates not one but six different unemployment rates, ranging from U-1 to U6 (4.2% to 14.9%). Hunter's bill would make the U5 result the new official unemployment rate through what he calls "a little magic along with the math." According to the BLS website, the U-5 rate includes "discouraged workers, plus all other persons marginally attached to the labor force." Other carve-outs include categories such as "underemployed" and "part-time for economic reasons," as well as the roughly 87 million people who have dropped out of the labor force altogether. That final fact alone has cut the so-called labor participation rate to 63.8% — the lowest it has been in 30 years.
