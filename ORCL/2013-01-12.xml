Employers value employees based on weather they can get more back from their labor than they can from tier costs. If costs increase then maybe the employer can not afford as many employees, even if he likes them and values them as persons. It's a simple equation: Revenue - Costs = Net Profit or Loss The theory of marginal income/loss states that an employer will continue to hire new employees until: Revenue - Costs = 0 Net Income If the government enforces new regulations or new costs of employment (say ObamaCare) the employer will reduce employee count until Net Income = 0 again. This is really simple economics stuff.</Msg><Username>chronosthegrimreaper</Username><Timestamp>1358006795360</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 11:06:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358008772304-16</Id><Topic><Title>is retail worthless, are restaurants worthess,? not a necessary and important part of the economy?</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1358003497049</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 10:11:37 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>it's futile to post logic to Mesa.

How many times do we have to go over this? An employee's only value to an employer is the profit he can make on the employee's labor. According to marginal income theory an employer will hire new employees until marginal income = marginal costs and net profit is zero. If stupid communist government imposes new regulations or laws or employer give-a-ways then these will change the balance between marginal income and marginal costs. The employer will lay off employees until marginal income = marginal costs again. This is simple basic economics 101 stuff. Even a #$%$ like you should be able to understand it.

Haven't you figured out that Bush is not President anymore? Geee, figure it out dude! It's been in all the newspapers! You do recall that Bush was fighting a just war against enemies of our country? Some of his spending was increased because of that. You do recall that lots of Conservatives complained about Bush over spending too. We went over the Budget passed in 2008 for FY 2009 before: 1) The Congress was controlled by Democrats. And they agreed to it. If you read our Constitution you will find that BUDGETS properly start in the House of Representatives (which was controlled by the Democrats in 2008.) It was also passed by the Senate, which was also Democrat controlled. 2) Obama was President elect by the time this was passed and he was consulted and concurred on this budget. And Bush passed it with his consent. It included budget bills for the economic crisis that the treasonous Democrats started to get Obama elected. 3) Once Obama was in office he had a super majority in the House &amp; senate and COULD have recalled and changed any items in this budget that he disagreed with. He did not. 4) In fact, Obama and his Democrat Congressional super majority ADDED significantly to the costs of Budget Yer FY 2009. 5) That by the way was also the LAST national budget the USA has had, even though the democrats controlled the Presidency &amp; the Congress in 2009 &amp; 2010. They STILL controlled the Presidency &amp; the Senate in 2011 &amp; 2012. And Harry Reid and the Democrat controlled Senate would not allow any budget to pass, not even Barack Obama's! So quite lying about Bush you despicable pile of excrement!</Msg><Username>bullwinkle.themoose</Username><Timestamp>1358043525231</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 21:18:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358043606571-48</Id><Topic><Title>dickless345 - What a #$%$!</Title><Username>bullwinkle.themoose</Username><Timestamp>1358042396625</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 20:59:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>We've had no national budget at all for the last four years and that is all Pelosi, Reid &amp; Obama's fault. With Bush we at least HAD a national budget every year! *** The 2008 Budget for FY 2009 was the LAST budget we had. Since then has been only spending. And you keep ignoring that Budgets come from Congress and in 2008 the Congress was in Democrat control. And you keep ignoring that President Elect Obama was consulted about the budget and the financial crisis and cooperated and consented with the FY 2009 budget. And you keep ignoring that after Obama became President he COULD have modified that budget to cut spending (he had a Democrat controlled Congress) but he did not. In fact Barack Obama &amp; the Democrat controlled Congress significantly added to the FY 2009 Budget. So stop you lying you sleazy #$%$! And please don't start this same thread all over because you know you've just gotten you butt soundly whipped. Saying lies over and over does not make it true.
