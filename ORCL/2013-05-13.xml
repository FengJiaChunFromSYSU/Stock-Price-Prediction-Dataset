You aren't going to win the argument on this no matter how many times you babble it. One Brit does not a consensus make. LA Times reports that it's not all rosy in the British health care system. An editorial in the IBD points to continuing problems. Government involvement is destroying healthcare in Britain. They've had 60 years to show socialized medicine works, but it has actually shown the opposite. The British Daily Mail reported a survey that showed 40% of national healthcare workers, doctors, nurses, paramedics would not recommend their own workplace to friends and family. Overall the program has more negatives than positives, so say the people who are directly responsible for administering it. Do some homework instead of your usual cherry picking.

In fact, many of its full-time working moms will spend this Mother’s Day on duty at the retail mammoth’s many stores, receiving unsubstantial wages and hoping their next government assistance check arrives on time. A Huffington Post report on one mother’s struggles working for Walmart highlights the chasm between its employees and the top executives at a company bringing in $444 billion annually. The story of Charlene Fletcher, a California resident who works the phones at a Pasadena Walmart, is especially telling. Fletcher and her husband work full-time but cannot afford to care for their two children. Instead, they must rely on government assistance for food and medical benefits.</Msg><Username>dropkickpubs4321</Username><Timestamp>1368423167126</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 01:32:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368423303471-3</Id><Title>Put it to rest messy.

McConnell noted that he had raised the issue of IRS targeting of conservatives in 2012, and further noted that the Washington Post “dismissed it as a bunch of red herrings.” The scandal, McConnell said, extends up the chain. “The Obama effort to shut up opponents isn’t limited to the IRS,” he stated. “It applies to the FCC [Federal Communications Commission], SEC [Securities and Exchange Commission], FEC [Federal Elections Commission], HHS [Department of Health and Human Services] …. And you remember, the Obama campaign last year published a list of eight businessmen who it believed were enemies.” McConnell further noted reports that the Department of Health and Human Services had been contacting businesses “skeptical about the implementation of Obamacare and asking them to contribute money to sell the program to the American people. That’s absolutely improper if not illegal. This administration will stop at nothing to get its way. It will do anything it can to silence its critics.” McConnell said would not trust any Democrat-led investigation into the IRS scandal. He added with regard to a House investigation of the IRS’ activities, “I’m confident they will do it in the way in which it ought to be conducted, with a high level of skepticism about an agency trying to silence the critics of the Obama administration.” He also added that the recent IRS revelations were “just the beginning of the story. This is no little thing. This is a big thing. The good news about it is they finally got caught. They finally messed with an agency everybody fully understands.

The good news about it is they finally got caught. They finally messed with an agency everybody fully understands. When they try to quiet the critics through other agencies, it doesn’t get attention. This does. Everybody understands the IRS and how powerful they are. This is just one example of an administration-wide effort to silence critics.” The IRS admitted Friday it subjected the applications of conservative groups for nonprofit status to tougher scrutiny. That tougher standard later spread to other political groups, according to an Inspector General report obtained by POLITICO. President Barack Obama called the targeting “outrageous” during a press conference Monday. IRS officials blamed the targeting on career staffers in an Cincinnati, Ohio office where non-profit applications were centralized — a statement McConnell refused to believe. “Of course not,” he told Breitbart when asked if he believed the story.</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1368475838163</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 16:10:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368475854316-66</Id><Title>np such thing as a conservative repub..</Title><Msg>Don't even pretend!

Darrell Issa on Monday said that the House Judiciary Committee will “have the lead” on looking into revelations that the Justice Department might have secretly taken telephone records of AP reporters and editors. “From a constitutional standpoint, the First Amendment, it’s very clear Judiciary will have the lead on this,” Issa (R-Calif.), a member of that committee, said on CNN’s “The Situation Room.” “And Chairman Goodlatte and I will be happy to work together.” Issa chairs the House Oversight Committee. His comment came after host Wolf Blitzer asked whether he would take action on the issue. “And this is a constitutional question and a question of DOJ once again,” continued Issa, who has clashed with the Justice Department and Attorney General Eric Holder over a number of issues. Late Monday afternoon, the AP reported that the “Justice Department secretly obtained two months of telephone records of reporters and editors for The Associated Press.” “DOJ monitoring @AP phone lines is more disturbing news from the Administration. The House will take appropriate action,” tweeted GOP Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.). “One of the amazing things is, they have the ability to listen very transparently to all the government phones, and all the government activity,” Issa said, adding, “They had an obligation to …look for every other way to get it before they in fact intruded on the freedom of press.”</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1368494233394</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 21:17:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368496988582-89</Id><Title>90% of Canadians ‘very satisfied’ or ‘somewhat satisfied’ with their healthcare</Title><Msg>poll shows Canadians overwhelmingly support public health care Group says advocates of private system are out of touch with most Canadians OTTAWA, Canada — In a last-ditch effort to convince Canadians that their public health care system should be privatized, Canadian Medical Association (CMA) President Robert Ouellet has promised to “pull out all the stops” during the association’s annual meeting next week. Trouble is, Ouellet’s mission to lead the change to privatization is exactly the opposite of what 86 percent of Canadians want. A poll conducted by the Toronto-based Nanos Research points to overwhelming support — 86.2 percent — for strengthening public health care rather than expanding for-profit services. “With more than 8 in 10 Canadians supporting public solutions to make public health care stronger, there is compelling evidence that Canadians across all demographics would prefer a public over a for-profit health care system,” said Nik Nanos, president of Nanos Research. Nanos Research was commissioned by the Canadian Health Coalition (CHC), a nonpartisan group that supports Canada’s public health system, to conduct a random telephone survey of 1,001 Canadians between April 25 and May 3. The margin of accuracy for a sample of 1,001 is ±3.1 percentage points. Meanwhile, Canada’s government just released a report titled “Healthy Canadians — A Federal Report on Comparable Health Indicators 2008.” Its findings almost identically mirror the CHC polling results. In that report, a leading indicator points to the fact that “Most Canadians (85.2 percent) aged 15 years and older reported being ‘very satisfied’ or ‘somewhat satisfied’ with the way overall health care services were provided, unchanged from 2005.”</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1368496988582</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 22:03:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368498515382-90</Id><Topic><Title>Obamacare On Lifesupport</Title><Username>passthebuckaroo</Username><Timestamp>1368490704316</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 20:18:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>#$%$ does WMDs have to do with healthcare? Your habit of blending unrelated topics is nonsense and using bullscht to make accusations is as trite as it gets. I didn't predict anything, Making up things for the sake of looking stupid, great tactic. You're a chronic liar. Nothing you post has any merit whatsoever. Reagan did not give illegals free healthcare, it was for citizens who for the most part were low income and unable to afford insurance. It's Obamacare that expanded that benefit to include the flotsam from other countries we give amnesty to. It doesn't surprise me that you would infer that Bush did a terrible thing as free healthcare. What's the problem?.
