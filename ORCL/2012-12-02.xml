That's 330 mm in 100 years, about 33 cm around 13 inches. In 100 years. Do you think modern technology can keep up and build houses maybe one cement block higher? In 100 years? Actually, a lot smarter would be to build not less that 1000 meters from the shore line. Yup. about 1 km. And make sure there are some grass covered sand dunes between you and the ocean. Yup. FEMA use to be about mitigation: don't rebuild in places that get destroyed everytime there is a rain storm. But no, modern Americans want to be able to dangle their big toe in the ocean as they eat their Cheerios each morning. And then they wonder why a storm surge blows their house away.</Msg><Username>caliente.zorra</Username><Timestamp>1354435989675</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-02 03:13:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354445594688-7</Id><Topic><Title>Does alsmith = = droopydick????</Title><Username>renew_aileen_again_again</Username><Timestamp>1354401333318</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-01 17:35:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Always knew you were thicker than a brick.like all Pukes.</Msg><Username>alsmith581</Username><Timestamp>1354445594688</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-02 05:53:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354445828177-8</Id><Topic><Title>Same PUKE politicians post election</Title><Username>alsmith581</Username><Timestamp>1354221022344</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 15:30:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Dumb liberals weren't as dumb as those dumb Pukes that just lost another national election BOY?Tell me how much that hurt BOY?</Msg><Username>alsmith581</Username><Timestamp>1354445828177</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-02 05:57:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354462396655-9</Id><Topic><Title>Times are appropriate to keep an eye on ORCL dealing</Title><Username>sheilaboyer71</Username><Timestamp>1354116943744</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 10:35:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>good job! thanks</Msg><Username>edwardsbrandon838</Username><Timestamp>1354462396655</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-02 10:33:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354463261763-10</Id><Topic><Title>Same PUKE politicians post election</Title><Username>alsmith581</Username><Timestamp>1354221022344</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 15:30:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Do some checking sometime if you have the brains to. Most of the pols are fronts for the same people that control the banking and financial interests in this country. They play the "Tweedle Dee, Tweedle Dum" game on gullible fools. Two groups are very powerful in this respect. Membership lists are available on the web. One is the Council On Foreign Relations and another is the Skull and Bones Society. As an example both John Kerry AND George Bush are members of Skull and Bones. Kerry is not the name he was born with. Just some more deceit to make Irish Catholics in Mass. think he is one of them. He's another poor starving billionaire "liberal".</Msg><Username>lewcor</Username><Timestamp>1354463261763</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-02 10:47:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354466345774-11</Id><Title>Hey Obama! 63,000,000 Real Americans Voted Against Your Nanny State PC Pigshyt!</Title><Msg>and that includes the Great Majority of Income Tax-Paying Americans who have to fund every penny of your Stupid Ludicrous Deficit Spending!!
