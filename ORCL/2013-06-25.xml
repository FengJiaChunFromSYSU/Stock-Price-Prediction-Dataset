WASHINGTON (AP) -- For President Barack Obama, National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden's globe-trotting evasion of U.S. authorities has dealt a startling setback to efforts to strengthen ties with China and raised the prospect of worsening tensions with Russia. Indeed, Russia's foreign minister on Tuesday called U.S. demands for Snowden's extradition "ungrounded and unacceptable."</Msg><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1372162203564</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-25 08:10:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372163983462-3</Id><Title>irs "scandal" now totally debunked</Title><Msg>IRS "scandal" now completely debunked . POLITICS The IRS Targeted Progressive Non-Profits, Too By Aviva Shen on Jun 24, 2013 (Credit: AP) After weeks of conservative outrage over the Internal Revenue Service’s improper targeting of Tea Party groups applying for 501 (c)(4) status, newly released documents obtained by the Associated Press showed that the agency was also targeting progressive groups. Conservatives and Republican lawmakers charged that the IRS was operating under directions from the White House to target the president’s political enemies. But these internal documents show screeners were not only using the term “tea party” to scrutinize applications, but also the keywords “Israel,” “Occupy,” and “Progressive.” The new acting chief of the IRS, Danny Werfel, told reporters that an internal investigation had uncovered a much broader use of the “Be On The Look Out” (BOLO) lists that flagged certain groups. While these lists contained “inappropriate criteria,” a preliminary examination has not found any suggestion of improper screening outside of the office that examines groups seeking tax-exempt status and affirmed that there was no “evidence of intentional wrongdoing by anyone in the IRS or involvement in these matters by anyone outside the IRS.” In order to prevent more inappropriate targeting of both conservative and liberal groups, the IRS is implementing a new fast-track process for applications that have not gotten a response from the IRS within 120 days. No conservative groups’ applications were ultimately denied, but Republicans have still likened the IRS to Al-Qaeda and called for its abolishment. Many lawmakers have seized on the scandal to argue that the IRS be stripped of its power to implement the Affordable Care Act lest the agency deny health care access for conservatives.</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1372163983462</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-25 08:39:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372164187520-4</Id><Title>What would Mitten's done?</Title><Msg>probably the same as Boenner and most all pubs and denounce Snowden for what he is a traitor and a defector.

Mere hours before the fiery car crash that took his life, journalist Michael Hastings sent an email to friends and colleagues urging them to get legal counsel if they were approached by federal authorities. “Hey [redacted] the Feds are interviewing my 'close friends and associates,'" read the message dated June 17 at 12:56 p.m. from Hastings to editors at the website BuzzFeed, where he worked. "Perhaps if the authorities arrive 'BuzzFeed GQ', er HQ, may be wise to immediately request legal counsel before any conversations or interviews about our news-gathering practices or related journalism issues.” Hastings added that he was onto a big story on Obama and that he would, “need to go off the radat [radar] for a bit,” according to sources in Los Angeles. Fifteen hours later, in the early morning of June 18, Hastings was driving a Mercedes C250 at a high speed when he lost control in Los Angeles’ Hancock Park neighborhood, causing the car to fishtail and crash into a palm tree. The impact caused the car to burst into flames, trapping the 33-year-old inside.</Msg><Username>onedinosaur</Username><Timestamp>1372174921896</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-25 11:42:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372175398934-18</Id><Topic><Title>Every American relies on government in a variety of ways.

The good news, is that some major players are casting it as a BUY with many Holds -- but notice the paucity of SELL ratings. That being said Id recommend a long BUY Limit at 29.58 to click just in case.

The only question is whether or not he committed any form of treason. Given the FACTS, not our emotions, right now the answer is Yes, he committed treason via stealing NSA property and disseminating it outside the country. The only way he gets around this is if, in fact, he ends up qualifying as a legitimate "whistleblower", which itself has specific definitions. if so, he escapes jail. Of course, taking the "obvious" freedom road of China to Russia to Cuba is suspect.</Msg><Username>cykdelic</Username><Timestamp>1372182078875</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-25 13:41:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372182212136-35</Id><Topic><Title>crux of Voting Rights decision</Title><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1372178746241</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-25 12:45:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Best ruling from the Roberts court to-date.</Msg><Username>coughingredink</Username><Timestamp>1372182212136</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-25 13:43:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372182225689-36</Id><Title>Weird movement in price, no??</Title><Msg>This strategic partnership with Sales Force is actually a really good thing for ORCL.

Obama has lied, stamped on the constitution, used the IRS against his enemies, covered up Benghazi, pays millions per month to keep his childhood records concealed from the public, lied about who his real father was and warned the American people before he became elected that our Constitution was old and not for today and that he could and would just bypass it using the judicial system, of which of course he did in many instances. Holding a rogue run-away government to account is all Snowden is doing. It's one thing to be a good protective government but another to be living and wasting taxpayer monies on a lavish lifestyle government lives, all the while being involved in drugs, prostitution and thievery all on the backs of hardworking Americans. Haven't you been paying attention to Brazil? Same thing there is going on and the people are finally sick of it and have woke up and now are holding their corrupt government to account for their law breaking, treasonous ways. I cannot wait until this comes to the USA. Why else do you think Obama wants to open the boarders to illegal? That way the real Americans will not have any power to elect anyone other than a democrat. Laraza is putting together the immigration Bill for Obama!!! OMG...Mexicans are telling the USA how we are going to accept illegal immigration and we will love it.
