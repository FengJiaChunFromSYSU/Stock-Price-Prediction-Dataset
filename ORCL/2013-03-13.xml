Don't you just hate when this happens? A day ahead of the papal conclave, faces at the scandal-struck Vatican were even redder than usual after it emerged that the Holy See had purchased a €23 million (£21 million) share of a Rome apartment block that houses Europe’s biggest gay sauna. Oh, how very awkward. While the Church is busy spending so much of its time shaking its bejeweled fist at The Gays, turns out the Church accidentally—accidentally, you guys, accidentally!—invested in some fabulous gay real estate. So how did this happen? The senior Vatican figure sweating the most due to the unlikely proximity of the gay Europa Multiclub is probably Cardinal Ivan Dias, the head of the Congregation for Evangelisation of Peoples, who is due to participate in tomorrow’s election at the Sistine Chapel. This 76-year-old “prince of the church” enjoys a 12-room apartment on the first-floor of the imposing palazzo, at 2 Via Carducci, just yards from the ground floor entrance to the steamy flesh pot. There are 18 other Vatican apartments in the block, many of which house priests. A 12-room apartment for one dude sure seems pretty posh, doesn't it? Especially a dude who supposedly took a vow of poverty? Guess if he hadn't, it would be a 24-room apartment, eh? At least it sounds like the perfect investment for the Church: The sauna’s website promotes one of its special “bear nights”, with a video in which a rotund, hairy man strips down before changing into a priest’s outfit. It says Bruno, “a hairy, overweight pastor of souls, is free to the music of his clergyman, remaining in a thong, because he wants to expose body and soul”.

Marois and James Nash - Mar 12, 2013 Wearing bulletproof vests and carrying 40-caliber Glock pistols, nine California Justice Department agents assembled outside a ranch-style house in a suburb east of Los Angeles. They were looking for a gun owner who’d recently spent two days in a mental hospital. They knocked on the door and asked to come in. About 45 minutes later, they came away peacefully with three firearms. California is the only state that tracks and disarms people with legally registered guns who have lost the right to own them, according to Attorney General Kamala Harris. Almost 20,000 gun owners in the state are prohibited from possessing firearms, including convicted felons, those under a domestic violence restraining order or deemed mentally unstable. “What do we do about the guns that are already in the hands of persons who, by law, are considered too dangerous to possess them?” Harris said in a letter to Vice President Joe Biden after a Connecticut school shooting in December left 26 dead. She recommended that Biden, heading a White House review of gun policy, consider California as a national model. As many as 200,000 people nationwide may no longer be qualified to own firearms, according to Garen Wintemute, director of the Violence Prevention Research Program at the University of California, Davis. Other states may lack confiscation programs because they don’t track purchases as closely as California, which requires most weapons sales go through a licensed dealer and be reported. “Very, very few states have an archive of firearm owners like we have,” said Wintemute, who helped set up the program. Funding Increase Harris, a 48-year-old Democrat, has asked California lawmakers to more than double the number of agents from the current 33. They seized about 2,000 weapons last year. Agents also took 117,000 rounds of ammunition and 11,000 high-capacity magazines,</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1363183384143</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-13 10:03:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363183869280-11</Id><Title>Econ edification for then weak-minded progressive nuts</Title><Msg>You are incorrect in applying the term "Keynesian" to Bush,,et.al.

The Army has already announced that it plans to phase out the cold-war era tank, and had sought to wind down production in Lima. Last May, the Obama Administration, citing a "fiscally constrained environment," formally objected to the new funding. And the tank goes on.

Liberal are still bringing up that the ME wars were the main cause of deficit spending. This is a myth the left hold onto for the sake of never mentioning that Obama is still in Afghanistan speniding twice what Bush did. Whatever nonsense liberals pass back and forth in their love fest for Obama, it boils down to overlooking and dismissing Obama's poor leadership.. None of them are very bright when it comes to the grit of politics.</Msg><Username>passthebuckaroo</Username><Timestamp>1363198673271</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-13 14:17:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363200068293-38</Id><Topic><Title>IN DEPTH ORCL Analyst Report .</Title><Username>zelmastafford</Username><Timestamp>1361112271314</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-17 09:44:31 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>awesome report.

A commander-in-chief given to "dithering" on critical wartime decisions. A suspicious and devious White House staff erecting a "Berlin Wall" around a secluded and standoffish president, shielding him from those advisers -- particularly at the Department of State -- willing to convey unpleasant truths. It all sounds rather like the sensational literature that proliferated in the mid-to-late 1970s to chronicle the collapsed presidency of Richard Nixon -- including the description of a White House "Berlin Wall," originally applied, with great fanfare, to those much-maligned (and eventually imprisoned) Nixon aides H.R. Haldeman and John Ehrlichman. Instead, it is President Obama's turn to watch as former aides and journalists rush into print -- with a warp speed that eluded the insider memoirists of the 1970s -- their detailed and dishy accounts of the first Obama term. A forthcoming book by former foreign policy aide Vali Nasr paints the above portrait, describing a president whose decisions "from start to finish were guided by politics." Nasr was a rising academic star, one of the leading scholarly voices on Iran and the Mideast, when the late Richard Holbrooke tapped him, at the dawn of the Obama administration, to join Holbrooke at a newly created office of the State Department: SRAP, short for Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan.</Msg><Username>liberals_plague_humanity</Username><Timestamp>1363203541867</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-13 15:39:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363207009564-49</Id><Topic><Title>ORCL Report and Stock Poll</Title><Username>moyasefangelina</Username><Timestamp>1361889545234</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 09:39:05 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I love this report.</Msg><Username>nolemieuxthisyeareitherjeannie</Username><Timestamp>1363207009564</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-13 16:36:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363207174042-50</Id><Topic><Title>Oracle Corporation on MAD MONEY TODAY!!</Title><Username>efrain.mercer</Username><Timestamp>1362394647203</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 05:57:27 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>thanks</Msg><Username>gutierrezdavid933</Username><Timestamp>1363207174042</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-13 16:39:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363208211350-51</Id><Topic><Title>Where will Oracle Corporation?
