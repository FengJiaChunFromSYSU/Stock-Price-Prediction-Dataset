Here's another way of looking at it. Things like moral stances and issues that used to be so important to repubs are no longer that important...to many pols and many voters. Sooner or later moral decay works its way throughout. Shoot, there was a time when dems were as morally upright as anyone. That changed over time. Dems used it to their advantage and hammered repubs with it when one messed up...like Sanford. It was effective. BUt now I'd say dems no longer have an automatic advantage in this regard as people get used to it. More equal footing. Not saying that I agree, mind you. Just making observation of what is.</Msg><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1368014818585</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 08:06:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368016808762-4</Id><Title>work week hours are about the same now as in 2006</Title><Msg>"The length of the average workweek fell by 0.2 hours to 34.4 hours in April.

Jeffrey (CNSNews) - The total number of people in the United States now receiving federal disability benefits hit a record 10,962,532 million in April, which exceeds the 10,815,197 people who live in the nation of Greece. According to newly released data from the Social Security Administration, the record 10,962,532 total disability beneficiaries in April, included a record 8,865,586 disabled workers (up from 8,853,614 in March), 1,936,236 children of disabled workers, and 160,710 spouses of disabled workers. According to its latest census, Greece had only 10,815,197 residents. April was the 195th straight month that the number of American workers collecting federal disability payments increased. The last time the number of Americans collecting disability decreased was in January 1997. That month the number of workers taking disability dropped by 249 people—from 4,385,623 in December 1996 to 4,385,374 in January 1997. As the overall number of American workers collecting disability has increased, the ratio of full-time workers to disability-collecting workers has decreased. In December 1968, 1,295,428 American workers collected disability and, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 65,630,000 worked full-time. Thus, there were about 51 full-time workers for each worker collecting disability. In April 2013, with a record 8,865,586 American workers collecting disability and 116,053,000 working full-time, there were only 13 Americans working full-time for each worker on disability.</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1368026901440</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 11:28:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368029925081-20</Id><Title>FBI stats: gun murder rate down by 39% over last 20 years</Title><Msg>WASHINGTON (AP) -- Gun homicides have dropped steeply in the United States since their 1993 peak, a pair of reports released Tuesday showed, adding fuel to Congress' battle over whether to tighten restrictions on firearms.

You cannot tax your way to prosperity, that's been proven by Japan for the last twenty years. The best thing now is for govt to get the hell out of the way and let free enterprise take over. Private sector is not perfect, human behavior is not perfect. But there is not much that govt does that cannot be done better by the private sector.</Msg><Username>vanzinf</Username><Timestamp>1368044984868</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 16:29:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368045227088-33</Id><Topic><Title>Uh, CBO current estimate of costs for Obamacare rose $50 billion since last year</Title><Username>coughingredink</Username><Timestamp>1368020942694</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 09:49:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Cough, this guy is a libiot.

" and FURTHERMORE they also say: " On balance, CBO and JCT have estimated that the legislation as a whole will reduce deficits over a 10 year period" this is from the CBO march 13, 2013.........................

It's a non profit organization. I had it since 1971. I and my family had excellent care at reasonable cost. First with phone co. benefit and later with Medi-care. I now have a for profit program. My monthly for my wife and I is about $250 plus some pretty hefty co-pays. These insureance companies get in bed with state officials (both Dem. and Rep.) and pass laws that make it almost impossible for competition to move into their states. "Free Enterprise?"

He passed on taking Osama Bin Laden (on a most wanted list) twice when foreign intelligence offered him. To this day he won't even discuss his negligence in responding to a potential threat especially after all the attacks on US interests. Hillary did the same with Benghazi, you would think she would have had some awareness of what could happen. It's better that you not babble about things you know nothing about.
