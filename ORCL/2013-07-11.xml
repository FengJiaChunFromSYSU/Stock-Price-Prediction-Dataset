Washington DC and Walmart had a deal. Waldmart was going to build 6 stores in some of poorest neighborhoods of DC. 3 stores are already under construction. So the DC council has the bright idea that it would be right and just to pass a law the requires Walmart and similar large stores to pay a minimum wage of $12.50 her hour which is $4 over the current min. wage of $8.50. Mind you all of this came up after Walmart had a deal and started contruction on 3 stores. Walmart threatened to leave if the bill passed. DC council didn't care. Yesterday it passed 8-5. The mayor might veto but already the DC council is looking to override that veto. True to its threat, Walmart cancelled plans to build the 3 stores not already under construction. And the ones currently under construction may be doomed as well. This is how liberals think folks. Now DC residents will not have access to low prices and a lot of people won't have jobs. Good thinking DC. That's the way you help folks.</Msg><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1373537217173</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 06:06:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373544777607-2</Id><Topic><Title>DC sends Walmart packing</Title><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1373537217173</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 06:06:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Just goes to show that you can never trust any Government in PC Trash Nanny State Democrat town that sucks up taxpayer dollars by the boatload 24/7... and would go broke in a week without it!</Msg><Username>econ_meister</Username><Timestamp>1373544777607</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 08:12:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373545021692-3</Id><Topic><Title>DC sends Walmart packing</Title><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1373537217173</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 06:06:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>why does the DC city Council hate the poor so much?</Msg><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1373545021692</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 08:17:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373549698413-4</Id><Title>the largest food stamp recipient in the nation is walmart</Title><Msg>walmart, the largest food stamp recipient Alan Grayson says more Walmart employees on Medicaid, food stamps than other companies the politifact truthmeter rates that claim Mostly True. walmart, the largest food stamp recipient Their low wages force employees to need approximately $420,000 per year, per store, totaling $2.66 BILLION annually in food stamps and other taxpayer assistance…to survive. low wages cost the country HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS of dollars in payroll tax deductions for Federal, State, and Local taxes. low wages cost our communities the ability to hire and retain important public service workers like firefighters, police officers, maintenance workers, and teachers. low wages cost our communities with their increased need for those same public services they are underfunding. low wages and lack of covered benefits cost taxpayers over $1.02 BILLION a year in healthcare costs. low wages cost taxpayers as much as $225 MILLION in free and reduced price lunches for school-age children. low wages cost taxpayers over $780 MILLION in tax deductions for low-income families.</Msg><Username>dilemmabroccoli</Username><Timestamp>1373549698413</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 09:34:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373549942853-5</Id><Topic><Title>Seriously... the prosecution has presented as good a case FOR Zimmerman....</Title><Username>central_scrutinizer_fz</Username><Timestamp>1373485471592</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-10 15:44:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I thought that's what I said...

Couldn't at least one other person in a family of four be able to work? This study was done for DC, where the average household has an average of 2.1 people. For the USA it is only 2.6 persons per household (Census Quick Facts). So why are we assuming that Walmart pay for one person must support a family of four? Q2: When people blabber about the "Federal Poverty Level" it allows them to obscure what numbers they are implying. Here are the Federal Poverty Levels for 1, 2, 3 &amp; 4. Notice the pay rate they work out to using 2000 hours per year (a standard 40 hour week X 50 weeks.) 1, $11,490, $5.75 2, $15,510, $7.76 3, $19,530, $9.77 4, $23,550, $11.78 Note that the Federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour. It USE TO BE $5.25 per hour. So the Federal Poverty Levels have not bee upgraded sine the Federal Minimum wage was increased to $7.25 as of July 24, 2009. (BTW: $7.25 per hour X 2000 hours = $14,500 for one person. So in theory, no one person in America can work full time and be under the Federal Poverty Level for 1.) Note also that the Walmart wage of $8.81 per hour is 26% higher than the Federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. It is also about 13.5% higher than the federal Poverty level for a household of 2. It is only about 10% under the poverty level for a family of 3. Note also that if both of the 2 people in a household of 2 worked at Walmart, they would jointly earn $31,152 which is 32.2% higher than the poverty level for a household of 4.</Msg><Username>ourfirstpantroglodytepresident</Username><Timestamp>1373562253133</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 13:04:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373563135590-17</Id><Topic><Title>Walmart is a Job Killer</Title><Username>dilemmabroccoli</Username><Timestamp>1373555220382</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 11:07:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So why are we worried about this in DC anyway?
