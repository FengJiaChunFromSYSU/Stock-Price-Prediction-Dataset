It massively under-samples independents while it also over-samples Democratic voters. The CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll official reports Obama at 52 to percent and Mitt Romney at 46 percent. Unskewed, the data reveals a 53 percent to 45 percent lead for Romney. This new CNN/ORC survey, unlike many other analyzed, not only over-samples Democratic voters, but also massively under-samples independent voters, to produce a result more favorable to Barack Obama. This survey's sample includes 397 registered Republicans and 441 registered Democrats. But the survey included a total of 822 registered voters, leaving only 37 independent voters at most. The survey clearly under-sampled independent and Republican voters. Among the Democrats survey, 97 percent favored Obama while three percent support Romney. The Republicans surveys chose Romney by a 96 percent to two percent margin. Those margins display a high degree of party loyalty in each party for its candidate, which is plausible in a campaign like this one where both sides are focusing heavily on boosting turnout among their base. Independents, who are massively under-sampled in this survey, support Romney by a 54 percent to 40 percent margin. The sample for the CNN/ORC poll includes 50.4 percent Democrats and 45.4 percent Republicans and appears to have only 4.2 percent independents. This means independents are under-sampled 25 percent while Democrats are over-sampled 12.1 percent. Both of those are larger variations in sampling than seen in most polls that are likewise skewed by such sampling variations. Rasmussen Reports recent reporting of partisan trends among voters, based on tens of thousands of voters surveyed, showed the voting electorate made up of 35.4 percent Republicans, 34.0 percent Democrats and 30.5 percent “Unaffiliated” or independent voters. Clearly 6.5 percent of a sample as independents is a large under-sampling of those voters compared to 30.5 percent. Unskewing this data to make up for the likely 25 percent under-sampling of independent voters shows the results are quite different. With the weightings of independents, Democrats and Republicans conducted by the Rasmussen numbers, this poll's data would indicate a Romney lead over Obama of 53 percent to 45 percent. That is almost exactly the reverse of the 52 percent to 46 percent lead it reports in favor of Obama. The sampling skew of this poll actually reverses the result that should be shown by the data.</Msg><Username>onedinosaur</Username><Timestamp>1347370130988</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 09:28:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347371051536-5</Id><Topic><Title>Obama SURGING in the polls since Democratic</Title><Username>whycantphiligetawoman</Username><Timestamp>1347363576008</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 07:39:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>At this point in the race Carter had an 12 pt lead in the polls over Reagan.

Fast forward to the 2012 Democratic National Convention. Obama, now the president, accepted his party's nomination for a second term by touting his experience as a steady leader in the face of overseas crises and mocked his Republican challenger as "new to foreign policy." How times have changed. But the president's new tactic -- to incorporate into his campaign message the sense that he is the tested leader, and that Mitt Romney is a newbie -- could be a risky one. For starters, it recalls the very criticism against Obama, like the above line from Clinton, when he first ran. "Obama had probably less foreign policy experience (when he first ran for president) than Romney has," said Steffen Schmidt, political science professor at Iowa State University. Schmidt also noted that Romney is hardly alone among non-incumbent candidates in not having a tremendous foreign policy background. "The truth of the matter is, presidents learn on the job," he said. Obama, in an official sense, may have had a bit more foreign policy experience when he first ran than Romney does today. Obama, as a first-term senator, was a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. And he took several foreign trips. He traveled in 2005 with Republican Indiana Sen. Richard Lugar to Russia and Eastern Europe to visit nuclear and biological weapons facilities. The following year, Obama traveled to the Middle East. Obama, the senator, made another foreign trip to several African countries in late 2006 as well. Obama, though, downplayed the value of that experience during his 2008 primary run. "Experience in Washington is not knowledge of the world," he said in April 2008, according to an account from the time in The New York Times. "This I know. When Sen. Clinton brags, 'I've met leaders from 80 countries,' I know what those trips are like. I've been on them. You go from the airport to the embassy. There's a group of children who do a native dance. You meet with the C.I.A. station chief and the embassy and they give you a briefing. ... And then, you go." Obama instead had stressed his time living abroad in Muslim Countries as well as a visit to Pakistan back in the 1980s.</Msg><Username>hikemanymiles</Username><Timestamp>1347372695311</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 10:11:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347374271440-7</Id><Topic><Title>Obama SURGING in the polls since Democratic</Title><Username>whycantphiligetawoman</Username><Timestamp>1347363576008</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 07:39:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Phil.

Jumping out of his limousine, Vpotus immediately encountered Deputy Chief Brad Shober, 44, of Shanksville, whom he had met the year before when hosting the department at the Vice President’s Residence in Washington and then again a few days later in Shanksville on last year’s 9/11 anniversary. Vpotus was talking about having Shober and the other firefighters back to Washington and pointed to an aide. “He’s going to call you, no #$%$” Vpotus said. Then noticing the pool, said, “I didn’t know you guys were here.” Turning back to Shober, he cleaned up the language. “This is no malarkey. You come to the White House. I’ll buy you a beer.” Shober, holding a Coke Zero, told your pool that Vpotus last year had given him one of his vice presidential challenge coins and told him, “’Next time I see you, if you have that coin, drinks are on me. If you don’t have it, drinks are on you.’ Now knowing that he might come, I made sure that was on my pocket.” Since Vpotus didn’t have his coin to show him back, he made the spontaneous invitation to come back to DC. Vpotus worked the group of firefighters as he typically does, gripping their shoulders, joking with them, telling them Delaware stories. One firefighter said, “You got my vote.” Vpotus replied, “Thank you, man. That’s not why I’m here but thank you.” He talked again about hosting them after the election. “Win, lose or draw, I’m still going to be vice president in January.” They should come, he said. “That’s a deal.” He added: “I give you my word. I’m not just saying it.” He introduced Sec Salazar and suggested a certain insecurity. “He’s probably smarter than you and two, he’s probably tougher than you.” He gathered the firefighters and posed for pictures in front of a red fire truck with a banner “United We Stand” in red white and blue. Looking at the clear sky, he said, “Isn’t it eerie? The day’s just like it was.” Then he headed over to the grill. “Come on, let’s go get one. I want a hot dog.” He actually served himself a hamburger and put a slice of American cheese on it. He pulled a $20 bill out of his wallet and put it in a firefighter’s boot that was used to deposit donations. “I want the record to show,” he said. Then noting Sec Salazar behind him in line, he added: “My twenty covers both of us.” Asked what Dr. Biden would think of his diet, he said, “She’s going to say, ‘Joe, what the hell are you doing?’ I just ate a peanut butter sandwich between here and there.” He posed again for pictures with retired Chief Terry Shaffer in front of a cross made out of steel beams from the World Trade Center. The cross had the numbers 9 11 01 on it and a plaque: “NEVER FORGET. We honor those who saw their untimely fate before them and chose to defeat evil to ensure America’s freedom. FLIGHT 93.” “Pretty cool, isn’t it?” he said to the cabinet secretaries. Then he stroked the cross, talking about how it came from an I-beam. The firefighters presented him and the two secretaries with blue Shanksville Volunteer Fire Department T-shirts. A firefighter introduced his girlfriend. Vpotus cupped her face in his hands. “Dangerous to date a volunteer firefighter,” he playfully warned her. Somehow he then got into a discussion of racing. “I’m a frustrated-“ and then he stopped himself and said he shouldn’t say so in front of the pool but went ahead anyway, “dragster.” As your pool was then ushered away, Vpotus was saying something about the feel of the road.</Msg><Username>liberals_plague_humanity</Username><Timestamp>1347384626718</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 13:30:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347387758199-17</Id><Topic><Title>Romulus and Ryanulus promise more Bush tax cuts on top of the previous bush tax cuts</Title><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1347023457307</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 09:10:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>White House declines Netanyahu request to meet with Obama The White House's response marks a new low in relations between Netanyahu and Obama, underscored by the fact that this is the first time Netanyahu will visit the U.S. as prime minister without meeting Obama.

Yet it’s the G.O.P.’s best chance for victory in November. ...........Anyway, do Republicans really believe that government spending is bad for the economy? No. Right now Mitt Romney has an advertising blitz under way in which he attacks Mr. Obama for possible cuts in defense spending — cuts, by the way, that were mandated by an agreement forced on the president by House Republicans last year. And why is Mr. Romney denouncing these cuts? Because, he says, they would cost jobs!

For instance, Obama said that repealing Obamacare, which cut Medicare and helped extend the life of the program by eight years, would cause the program to go “bankrupt by 2016.” That’s not really true. If the cuts were repealed, a main hospital trust fund for Medicare would start to take in less than it pays out. But that’s not bankruptcy. On the whole, Obama stayed on message, dropped a few pop culture references and reached an audience that seldom pays close attention to politics. He also avoided talking about 9/11 on 9/11’s anniversary, but made time to mock the Dolphins bad record. The intro: Obama: DJ Laz. Laz: O-Bama! Obama: “What’s going on, man?” Laz: “How are you, sir?” Obama: “Less than highly favored.” Laz: It is an honor and pleasure to have the president of the United States. I’m humbled Obama: “I’m the one who should be humbled. You’re big time. You’ve got Pitbull and Flo Rida and all these guys just beating a path to your door. And so I’m hoping I can get a little of that magic from you in this interview.” Laz: I’m wearing a Miami Dolphins jersey Obama: “You’ve got to start with that Dolphins thing. Did you see that HBO special Hard Knocks. That’s a pretty good show. As I recall, you guys didn’t win any… in the preseason” Laz: Now I’m getting ragged on by the president of the United States Obama: “I’m just saying you brought it up. My Bears – I’m feeling pretty good about them.” The rest was standard campaign fare.

An Israeli official told Reuters on condition of anonymity that Netanyahu's aides had asked for a meeting when he visits the United Nations this month and "the White House has got back to us and said it appears a meeting is not possible. It said that the campaign president's schedule will not permit that." Netanyahu has met Obama on all but one of his U.S. trips since 2009. The president was on a foreign visit when the prime minister came to the United States in November 2010. He argues that setting a clear boundary for Iran's uranium enrichment activities and imposing stronger economic sanctions could deter Tehran from developing nuclear weapons and mitigate the need for military action. In comments that appeared to bring the possibility of an Israeli attack on Iran closer, Netanyahu had earlier taken Washington to task for rebuffing his call to set a "red line" for Iran's nuclear programme, which has already prompted four rounds of U.N. sanctions. "The world tells Israel 'wait, there's still time'. And I say, 'Wait for what? Wait until when?'" said Netanyahu, speaking in English. "Those in the international community who refuse to put red lines before Iran don't have a moral right to place a red light before Israel," he added, addressing a news conference with Bulgaria's prime minister. "UNPRECEDENTED ATTACK" The website of Israel's daily newspaper Haaretz called his words "an unprecedented verbal attack on the U.S. government". Iran makes no secret of its hostility to Israel, widely assumed to be the region's only nuclear-armed power, but says its nuclear programme is purely peaceful.</Msg><Username>hikemanymiles</Username><Timestamp>1347395032985</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 16:23:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347395710960-28</Id><Topic><Title>Obama SURGING in the polls since Democratic</Title><Username>whycantphiligetawoman</Username><Timestamp>1347363576008</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 07:39:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>screw the whiny ajole netanyahu and his band of thugs, his apartheid state and their illegal occupation.

Letterman's nightly monologues mostly spare the president from satirical ribbing, saving his most cutting remarks for the Romneys ... or even former President George W. Bush. The news comes on the same day Obama told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu he couldn't meet with him due to a scheduling conflict.

According to U.S. officials, the head of the Egyptian General Intelligence Service, Maj. Gen. Murad Muwafi, met in early August with a senior official of Iran’s Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS). Disclosure of the Egyptian-Iranian intelligence meeting comes as the Obama administration is planning to provide $1 billion in aid to bail out Egypt’s new Islamist government. The administration is said to be seeking closer ties to the new regime in Cairo, following the ouster in February 2011 of long-time ally Hosni Mubarak. Many members of the pro-democratic, anti-Muslim Brotherhood opposition in Egypt believe the Obama administration has made a covert pact to support the Morsi regime. Meanwhile in Cairo, Islamic protesters on Tuesday stormed the U.S. Embassy and pulled down the American flag to protest what they said was a U.S. film production the protesters claimed insulted Islam. U.S. intelligence gathering targeting Egypt has been stepped up over the past year as the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist party, came to power in June. The group’s credo includes the phrase, “Allah is our objective; the Quran is our law, the Prophet is our leader; jihad is our way; and death for the sake of Allah is the highest of our aspirations.” Since the revolution that led to the ouster of the pro-U.S. regime of Hosni Mubarak, a large number of radical Islamists have been released from prison and have gone back to preaching anti-Western and anti-Israel jihad, or holy war. The meeting between Muwafi and the Iranian, identified by officials only with his last name, Gerami, set off security concerns because the Iranian spy service is a key player in Tehran’s international support for terrorism, as well as anti-U.S. and anti-Israel operations. Within days of the meeting, however, Egypt’s new President Mohamed Morsi replaced Muwafi in a political shakeup following a terrorist attack in the Sinai Peninsula that killed 16 Egyptians in August. It is not known if the meeting with Gerami was the cause of Muwafi’s ouster, or if it was the result of the Sinai attack. News reports in Egypt quoted Muwafi as saying his service had some advance intelligence warning of the Aug. 5 Sinai attack but failed to alert other military and security authorities. Asked about the Egyptian-Iranian intelligence meeting, a U.S. official told the Free Beacon: “The Egyptians are still skeptical of Iranian motives. There’s a lot of baggage to overcome with Tehran, so for now any efforts to expand outreach and build a new relationship are likely to be cautious and fairly limited.” Reuel Marc Gerecht, a former CIA officer who specialized in Middle Eastern affairs, said it is difficult to gauge the significance of the Gerami-Muwafi meeting, and noted that liaisons between spy agencies are common. “Sometimes those meetings are significant,” said Gerecht. “Other times, not much at all.” “If they are meeting it is probably different than in the past,” he said, noting that it is possible the Egyptians met with the Iranians under the regime of Hosni Mubarak. “I’d guess they would be chatting about Syria and Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad,” said Gerecht, now with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. “The U.S. would certainly be in that mix. A Muslim Brotherhood-guided service will be more open to Iranian contact than was the case under Mubarak. But Syria is and will remain a huge problem.” U.S. officials said Morsi’s firing of several security officials following the Sinai attack was a clear sign the Muslim Brotherhood, which publicly advocates nonviolent jihad, is moving to take control of key power centers. Muwafi was a key figure during the Mubarak regime and the intelligence service he headed remains one of the most powerful elements within the Egyptian government. Muwafi is known to U.S. and western officials. He met Defense Secretary Leon Panetta in Egypt last July. Officials believe Muwafi’s ouster is part of Muslim Brotherhood efforts to purge the government of pro-military elements. The news outlet Ahram Online quoted Egyptian presidential office sources as saying Muwafi was fired as the culmination of disputes between Muwafi, the military, and Morsi over the handling of intelligence affairs. The new Egyptian intelligence chief is Maj. Gen. Mohamed Raafat Shehata, Muwafi’s deputy who was reportedly involved in the October 2011 prisoner swap between Israel and Hamas that resulted in the freeing of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. Iran’s foreign minister said Aug. 22 that Iran and Egypt were moving toward restoring diplomatic relations, which they severed more than 30 years ago. Ali Akbar Salehi told Egypt’s state-run Al-Ahram newspaper that Tehran wants ties of “friendship and brotherhood” with Cairo. Iran’s MOIS and the paramilitary Islamic shock troops known as the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) are considered the lynchpin of the Islamic regime in Tehran. The MOIS has conducted aggressive intelligence operations, including assassinations, and is known to support terrorist groups in the Middle East, including al Qaeda, Hezbollah, and Hamas. It is also backing the regime in Syria of Bashar al-Assad. The U.S. Department of the Treasury said in a Feb. 16 statement that the MOIS is “Iran’s primary intelligence organization.”</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1347411825007</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 21:03:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347419207852-38</Id><Topic><Title>Corzine Is A Criminal, Thief &amp; Liar Protected By Obama &amp; Holder!</Title><Username>inherited_myazzs</Username><Timestamp>1347407941725</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 19:59:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You are right But it's not just Corzine There are plenty of fraudsters in the finance arena that should have been indicted.
