He has been doing penance by exposing tax perfidies, from 2007 to 2009 as chief of staff for Congress’s Joint Committee on Taxation and since then as a tax law professor at the University of Southern California. Kleinbard shows Ryan would turn individual and corporate income taxes into the equivalent of two large payroll taxes with the burden falling almost entirely on workers, not owners and executives. The Roadmap “is a mechanism for redistributing tax burdens down the income scale,” Kleinbard wrote. “Most ordinary Americans would see their tax burdens increase by around 50 percent,” he concluded, “while the most successful individuals would see reductions in their labor income tax rates, and elimination of all capital tax burdens – including the elimination of the gift and estate tax.” Every independent and credible tax expert whose reports I have read, as well as my own analysis, reaches the same basic conclusions about the Romney and Ryan vision: lower taxes for the already rich and highly paid; heavier burdens on the middle class along with cuts in government services."

Nevermind. He doesn't need to. We know it will be more debt, more unemployment, less capitalism. On the other hand, we know what Romney will do in terms of domestic energy. He will open more oil drilling. No doubt you'lldismiss that. But the industry employs plenty with good paying job. Obama's answer? More roads, bridges and schools. You stinking lefties are shameful. We'll be glad to be rid of your ilk in power.

Now do tell were the jobs are? the bush tax cuts have been in place for a decade and where are the jobs?, and how will more tax cuts for the rich create jobs? The “Job Creators”: Let’s do the two-second version of this. A millionaire gets a $340,000 tax cut. And this translates into a job how? Maybe he’ll hire another housekeeper, maybe buy some more from Tiffany’s, but the vast majority of that money will not be spent on goods that drive the economy – it will be put into savings. Usually, that can be a good thing, but in a stagnant economy, the people whose financial activity creates jobs are the middle class. Give a middle class family $10 during a rough economy, they spend it. And that is how an economy gets moving. What we need is more tax cuts for the middle class, not tax cuts for the wealthy. (And, again, you have to look at actual numbers. The Bush tax cuts went into place in 2002: employment remained fairly stagnant until the financial crisis of 2008, when unemployment skyrocketed. They cuts have remained in place throughout the Obama Administration; so if the tax cuts fuel hiring, where the hell are the jobs?"

It wasn't hit by an airplane, but had a fire. It collapsed hours after the 2 towers. Look at the video: 1 - it collapses very straight and symmetric. 2 - it collapses at the speed of gravity. These buildings are made of dozens of steel holding the building. historically no such steel building has fallen because of fire. If some columns are damaged by fire, most of the building would still hold. Even if it fell, it wouldn't fall straight and in a perfectly symmetric way. Also if some of the collapse energy was going into breaking more columns, the acceleration would be less than gravity. If you look at the video, it seems 1 moment all columns are supporting the building, and 2 seconds later. It seems very suspicious.</Msg><Username>nazyoyo</Username><Timestamp>1347226268550</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 17:31:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347229004120-11</Id><Topic><Title>Romney says screw specifics and details------ just shut up and trust me---no details are needed</Title><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1347209682170</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 12:54:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>what a #$%$ you are, the fact is more oil and gas were produced the USA than during W's tenure, ................................................................................................................................................................. yes.
