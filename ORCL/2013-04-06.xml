Your boy Obama has now taken the American economy and "Employment" back to the days of Jimmy Carter... destroying 30 years of employment growth in just 4 years!! The interest on the debt, while high, pales by comparison to Obama's totally Insane Wasteful Deficit spending... with most of it going to his PC Pigshyt cronies, his fat-azzs lazy loser constituencies and his left-wing whack-job fantasies! And most of the Federal Debt over the last 50 years has been generated by Big Spending Big Taxing Big Government Congressional "Democrat Sluts"!! Moreover, Reagan and the Bush's actually accomplished things... Reagan especially! Reagan pulled the Country our of it's worst economic disaster since the Great Roosevelt Depression and went on to destroy the Soviet Union... Obama is now destroying America! And he's doing a Great Job! Indeed, Obama has done Jackshyt for America save to put us on the very edge of Bankruptcy and get even More guys killed and maimed in Stupid Wars! In both cases, in Iraq and Afghanistan, he has skillfully snatched utter Defeat from the jaws of Victory!!! A Total Waste.... and thanks to him, America is now on nothing but Life Support!</Msg><Username>moveon_moveoutnow</Username><Timestamp>1365245099061</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 06:44:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365247302955-4</Id><Title>Maryland passes tough gun control law, something Congress won't do/Is that your state seebe?

CCUR is extremely undervalued with a 30% market share of the video-on-demand (VOD) market and is beginning to capture a huge share of the multi-screen video delivery market (video delivery to tablets/smartphones) CCUR closed last week at $7.24 with an enterprise value of only $42mm or just 0.67X revenue with huge gross margins of 58.81%. CCUR has been profitable four straight quarters, with EPS last quarter up 100% vs. the previous quarter and up 300% vs. two quarters ago. CCUR's competitor HLIT has gross margins of only 44.59% and is losing money, yet is trading with an enterprise value/revenue ratio of 0.83. CCUR's competitor SEAC has gross margins of only 50.18% and is losing money, yet is trading with an enterprise value/revenue ratio of 1.81. For CCUR to match SEAC's multiple it needs to trade for $15. CCUR needs to reach $9.50 just to trade with an enterprise value/revenue ratio of 1. CCUR's short-term upside potential is here. CCUR ran from $7 to $200+ when they became first company ever to launch a commercial VOD service. CCUR's first VOD client was Time Warner Cable (TWC), the 2nd largest cable TV company in the U.S., and they are now using their 6th generation of CCUR's technology. CCUR today has 212 deployments across 4 continents with a reach of 50 million homes worldwide! CCUR just signed a huge multi-screen deal with Virgin Media (VMED) the largest cable TV operator in the UK, CCUR will power VMED's new Virgin TV Anywhere service for tablets/smartphones. CCUR is already powering the Xvie multi-screen service of Jupiter, the largest cable TV operator in Japan. It was just announced this weekend that March Madness online streams are up 158% this year with 60% to mobile devices and CCUR could be best way to capitalize on this booming trend!</Msg><Username>goodwe212</Username><Timestamp>1365305142985</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 23:25:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
