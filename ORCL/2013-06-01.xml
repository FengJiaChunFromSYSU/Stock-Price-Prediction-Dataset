The video of the IRS workers practicing their dance moves, which lasts just under three minutes, comes weeks after it was revealed that agency workers produced two other videos parodying the "Star Trek" and "Gilligan's Island" TV shows. All three videos were provided to Congress Friday in response to a request issued by Rep. Charles Boustany, R-La., a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee, after learning that the videos were recorded at IRS offices in New Carrollton, Md., outside Washington, D.C.</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1370090928578</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-01 08:48:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370092806268-5</Id><Topic><Title>male prostitute/WH coordinating: over 200 WH visits by the male prostitute/conservative 'reporter'</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1369918967477</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 09:02:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>doofus, blather and investigate all you want so what... there was no wrong doing, These two idiots,seebug and dumbazzbuck,must be one and the same.There couldn't be two posters on the same board with IQs of 8,could there?</Msg><Username>alsmith581</Username><Timestamp>1370092806268</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-01 09:20:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370094046823-6</Id><Title>In texas they arrest homeless people for eating</Title><Msg>(It would have been cheaper to give the guy some money and a bus ticket to where he was going) "James Kelly, a 44-year-old Navy veteran, was passing through Houston on his way to connect with family in California.

Spotted by police, Kelly was promptly charged with “disturbing the contents of a garbage can in the [central] business district.” Seriously. “I was just basically looking for something to eat,” he told the Houston Chronicle.

Abortion is outlawed under any circumstances in El Salvador. Beatriz, who has a 14-month-old son, suffers from a chronic health condition that worsens during pregnancy. Without the abortion, doctors say she runs a “high risk of death.” “I don’t want to die,” Beatriz said in a telephone interview with The New York Times. “I want to be with my boy, taking care of him.”</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1370106378927</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-01 13:06:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370111691170-8</Id><Topic><Title>"Benghazi" only occurred once-under Obama-due to three levels of  failure and negligence of leadership</Title><Username>jomoredux</Username><Timestamp>1370037848365</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-31 18:04:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What a cluster by Obma</Msg><Username>sanswealthnow</Username><Timestamp>1370111691170</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-01 14:34:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370111781513-9</Id><Topic><Title>Benghazi consisted of three screw-ups:/when another 9/1/01 happens and Obama ignored tons of warnings</Title><Username>dropkickpubs4321</Username><Timestamp>1370041525176</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-31 19:05:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Byte moi, beeotch!</Msg><Username>jomoredux</Username><Timestamp>1370111781513</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-01 14:36:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370113328071-10</Id><Title>whiny,pathetic, loser gop to impeach Obama for the 100th time, and repeal Obamacare for the 200th time</Title><Msg>loser gop is going to impeach Obama every few days for the next 1000 days or so...... ha ha ha ha just like they waste everyone's time repealing Obamacare for the nth time plus one.....jeez.... ha ha ha and hey, did you hear that Obama is really a foreigner? a mau mau anti colonial Kenyan? ha ha ha</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1370113328071</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-01 15:02:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370115805961-11</Id><Topic><Title>Pregnant El Salvador Woman Denied Life-Saving Abortion (the gop wants the USA like this)</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1370106378927</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-01 13:06:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Even many years ago abortions were allowed in the USA if the woman's life was in danger.

The group states: “Today’s report from the Social Security Trustees shows that our Social Security system has a large and growing surplus. Unlike the banks, which nearly brought the economy to ruin, Social Security didn’t need a bailout. Its surplus has grown year after year, even during the Great Recession. The result of decades of foresight and planning, its cumulative surplus is projected to be $2.8 trillion in 2013, growing to $2.9 trillion by 2020. Social Security does not and cannot contribute to the deficit. Social Security will take in more money than it pays out, roughly $28 billion more in 2013. Social Security has a large surplus in 2013 because it has more than enough income from its three sources of revenue to cover its expenses — payroll contributions, interest payments on the $2.8 trillion invested in U.S. Treasury bonds and taxation of benefits. … “Social Security financing can be improved and made more fair by closing the payroll tax loophole for high income earners. Congress should raise the Social Security payroll tax cap so that the 6 percent of workers who make more than $113,700 a year contribute on all of their wages just like everyone else. “Also, currently modest annual benefits averaging $15,200 can be improved. Tom Harkin (D-IA) has introduced legislation that would expand Social Security benefits; and the centrist New America Foundation has proposed increasing Social Security benefits by $11,669 per year. They know it’s time to expand, not cut, Social Security!”</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1370120970536</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-01 17:09:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370121496771-13</Id><Title>from repub to indy to dem</Title><Msg>Charlie Crist plotting a comeback.

Never mind if they're liars, perverts, incompetent or former lawyers. A side note----Leftwing goons never tire of telling conservatives that the private lives of liberal politicians are none of the public's business. They contend that their personal life has no bearing on their performance in office. Really? Why is it different for conservatives? We get updated on the latest scandal that involves a Repub, courtesy of that tolerant, objective crusader and master goon, messy. WH male prostitutes, if it were true, should have no bearing on official performance. I'm guessing that if they were female sluts, as with Clinton, it would not be mentioned.
