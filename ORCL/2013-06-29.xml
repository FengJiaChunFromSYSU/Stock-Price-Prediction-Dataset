The town flooded, and the police came in, evacuated the population … and then confiscated the residents’ guns out of their empty houses. The residents of High River, Alberta, population nearly 13,000, are still awaiting authorities’ permission to return to their homes. Dozens have been engaged in a standoff with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police at a checkpoint at the edge of town since floodwaters prompted a forced evacuation last week. Several news sources report tensions are high since news broke police have also been gathering residents’ firearms. “I find that absolutely incredible that they have the right to go into a person’s belongings out of their home,” resident Brenda Lackey told the Calgary Herald. “When people find out about this, there’s going to be untold hell to pay.” The guns will be returned to owners after residents are allowed back in town and they provide proof of ownership, Topham added. ........................................................................................... really? Proof of ownership? Maybe Canada is different. Here, I'm not sure I could provide such proof.</Msg><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1372503314544</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-29 06:55:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372503394393-2</Id><Title>beat the daylights out of those that tried picking on me.

Mostly FALSE: Jerry Patterson says the majority of Texans support failed abortion legislation "There was a lot more in that bill than the 20-week ban," Henson of UT said "..More broadly, the Tribune said, the poll indicated a general divide on abortion that it described as evident in past polls. "Some 46 percent of Texas voters say it should never be permitted or permitted only in cases involving incest, rape or when the woman's life is in danger," the article said, while "49 percent say it should be allowed after the need for an abortion has been clearly established, or that the choice should be completely left to the woman. Within those numbers, 16 percent said abortion should never be allowed, and 36 percent said that a woman should always be able to get an abortion as a matter of personal choice." By telephone, UT’s Jim Henson, the poll’s co-director, said the poll did not ask respondents directly about the proposal that ultimately fell short of final approval in the Senate. Nor, Henson said, were there questions touching on the bill’s provisions for abortion clinics to meet surgical hospital standards and for each provider physician to have admission privileges at a nearby hospital...." "There was a lot more in that bill than the 20-week ban," Henson said.</Msg><Username>hydroponicoctopus</Username><Timestamp>1372537980445</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-29 16:33:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372539590238-39</Id><Topic><Title>"Abstinence works," Perry said</Title><Username>hydroponicoctopus</Username><Timestamp>1372534457595</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-29 15:34:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>repubs,,just shut UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
