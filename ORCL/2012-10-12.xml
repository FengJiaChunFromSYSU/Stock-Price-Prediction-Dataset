But the GOP itself has cut funding to protect diplomats around the world. Mitt Romney and his fellow Republicans insist that America can’t afford PBS, though the station pulls “little more than one-hundredth of 1 percent of federal spending.” They call for the elimination of Obamacare, though doing so would increase the budget deficit. They say they’ll cut more than $5 trillion in federal expenses over the next decade. But they fail to say exactly how they’ll do it, says Dana Milbank at The Washington Post. And their proposed tax breaks for the rich, increases in defense spending and their party’s history of reckless spending over the last 30 years require a tremendous leap of faith if their claims are to be taken seriously. —Posted by Alexander Reed Kelly.</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1350051076459</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 10:11:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350051393606-30</Id><Title>the path to staying in afghanistan forever &amp; a day by eddie munster</Title><Msg>Eddie Munster says trust Mitt, we can stay in afghanistan forever and it will be self financing and deficit reducing, the math adds up, really.</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1350051393606</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 10:16:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350051864587-31</Id><Topic><Title>there is no competition in america, so you better listen to me, the billionaire in a 90000 sq ft house</Title><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1350048662171</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 09:31:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>that's right I did post his letter a few days ago.

Or are you still working on it, and that's why you won't tell voters?" —Martha Raddatz, debate moderator In the most remarkable exchange of the only vice presidential of 2012 came when moderator Martha Raddatz said to Ryan: “You have refused... to offer specifics on how you pay for that 20 percent across-the-board tax cut. Do you actually have the specifics? Or are you still working on it, and that's why you won't tell voters? That's where Ryan borrowed a political page from "Tricky Dick": RYAN: Different than this administration, we actually want to have big bipartisan agreements. You see, I understand the... RADDATZ: Do you have the specifics? Do you have the... Do you know exactly what you're doing? RYAN: Look -- look at what Mitt Romney -- look at what Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill did. They worked together out of a framework to lower tax rates and broaden the base, and they worked together to fix that. What we're saying is, here's our framework. Lower tax rates 20 percent. We raised about $1.2 trillion through income taxes. We forego about $1.1 trillion in loopholes and deductions. And so what we're saying is, deny those loopholes and deductions to higher-income taxpayers so that more of their income is taxed, which has a broader base of taxation so we can lower tax rates across the board. Now, here's why I'm saying this. What we're saying is, here's the framework... We want to work with Congress -- we want to work with the Congress on how best to achieve this. That means successful. Look... RADDATZ: No specifics, again. RYAN: Mitt -- what we're saying is, lower tax rates 20 percent, start with the wealthy, work with Congress to do it... RADDATZ: And you guarantee this math will add up? RYAN: Absolutely. That was it. No specifics. No plan. Just a plea for voters to trust Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan to “fill in the details.”</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1350057177611</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 11:52:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350057878647-46</Id><Title>Is the 600 ship navy back?</Title><Msg>mittens is promising ships galore! self financing and deficit reducing government jobs paid for by commie redistribution!

Joe Biden behaved like Hugo Chavez on stage yesterday and liberal lemmings are out there today defending Joe the Clown are a man of substance. They have gotten used to the new normal of things generally being miserable. Prolong the misery. 4 more years.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1350076239509</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 17:10:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350077182366-100</Id><Topic><Title>Mittens said it's not his job to represent half of Americans the 47%</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1350068965546</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 15:09:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Everybody should contribute,"................. about time you served your county, when do you ship out?....... and just think, you and the other rightie bimbos here were demanding obama get out of afghanistan..... and now Romney says we are staying there forever, and he will kill the Obama plan to get out by 2014.</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1350077182366</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 17:26:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350082816995-101</Id><Title>Showdown after the election</Title><Msg>Joe Biden is the type of a whole who will cause the fiscal cliff.

This is Obama's Watergate. It's over. The clown and Obama should resign now. When asked whether the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya had asked for more security ahead of the attack, Biden said: "Well, we weren't told they wanted more security again. We did not know they wanted more security again." Two State Department officials gave sworn testimony on Wednesday at a congressional hearing in Washington saying they had repeatedly requested beefed-up security for the compound before U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans were killed in the assault at the site on September 11. "The vice president directly contradicted the sworn testimony of State Department officials." "When the vice president of the United States directly contradicts the testimony, the sworn testimony of State Department officials, American citizens have a right to find out what's going on," he said. Obama and Biden lied. People died.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1350096954924</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 22:55:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message></Date>
