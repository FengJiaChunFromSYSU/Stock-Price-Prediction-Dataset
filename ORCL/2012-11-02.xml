We hear constantly our crumbling roads, bridges, schools and energy grid. This was highlighted even more by Hurricane Sandy this week. But at least one multi-millionaire has come out against bridge improvement. The man is Manuel "Matty" Moroun. He owns the Ambassador Bridge, which connects Detroit and Windsor, Ontario and is the busiest commercial crossing in the United States. Ambassador handles more than 7,100 trucks a day at an average price of $15 per truck. The only privately owned border crossing in the United States, it collects more than $60 million in tolls each year. Moroun and his related companies have reportedly spent more than $30 million to oppose a new government-funded bridge that would compete with the Ambassador. The new bridge, called the NITC (New International Trade Crossing), would be two miles from Ambassador and be funded by Canada and paid off with toll collections.</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1351863205975</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 09:33:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351863788931-8</Id><Title>Obama's Wants New "Department Of Busiess"!

I feel obliged to unambiguously restate our position: Jeep production will not be moved from the United States to China. North American production is critical to achieving our goal of selling 800,000 Jeep vehicles by 2014. In fact, U.S. production of our Jeep models has nearly tripled (it is expected to be up 185%) since 2009 in order to keep up with global demand. We also are investing to improve and expand our entire U.S. operations, including our Jeep facilities. The numbers tell the story: We will invest more than $1.7 billion to develop and produce the next generation Jeep SUV, the successor of the Jeep Liberty -- including $500 million directly to tool and expand our Toledo Assembly Complex and will be adding about 1,100 jobs on a second shift by 2013. At our Jefferson North Assembly Plant, where we build the Jeep Grand Cherokee, we have created 2,000 jobs since June 2009 and have invested more than $1.8 billion. In Belvidere, where we build two Jeep models, we have added two shifts since 2009 resulting in an additional 2,600 jobs. With the increase in demand for our vehicles, especially Jeep branded vehicles, we have added more than 11,200 U.S. jobs since 2009. Plants producing Jeep branded vehicles alone have seen the number of people invested in the success of the Jeep brand grow to more than 9,300 hourly jobs from 4,700. This will increase by an additional 1,100 as the Liberty successor, which will be produced in Toledo, is introduced for global distribution in the second quarter of 2013. Together, we are working to establish a global enterprise and previously announced our intent to return Jeep production to China, the world’s largest auto market, in order to satisfy local market demand, which would not otherwise be accessible. Chrysler Group is interested in expanding the customer base for our award-winning Jeep vehicles, which can only be done by establishing local production. This will ultimately help bolster the Jeep brand, and solidify the resilience of U.S. jobs. Jeep is one of our truly global brands with uniquely American roots. This will never change. So much so that we committed that the iconic Wrangler nameplate, currently produced in our Toledo, Ohio plant, will never see full production outside the United States. Jeep assembly lines will remain in operation in the United States and will constitute the backbone of the brand. It is inaccurate to suggest anything different.

NEW YORK Alabama power companies are denying a local TV station's report that linemen who had traveled to New Jersey from Alabama (a right to work state) to help restore power to those hit hard by Superstorm Sandy were told they could not work there because they were non-union. The report by WAFF TV quotes a worker from Decatur Utilities saying he was told by crews in New Jersey they could not work there, after the utility receiving a call to assist in Seaside Heights, N.J. The Decatur employee told WAFF that crews were told to stand down, and that linemen from Trinity, Ala.-based Joe Wheeler are already headed back home. Moore said they are frustrated being told, "Thanks, but no thanks." However, Decatur Utilities, based in Decatur, Ala., denied the report. ......</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1351889783844</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 16:56:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351889966046-75</Id><Title>Alabama workers were NOT turned away</Title><Msg>Ala. utilities: Our crews not turned away from N.J Huntsville Utilities also said their workers were not turned away and are working in storm-ravaged areas.

You're a riot. If you can't dazzle them with your brilliance, baffle them with your #$%$. That describes messy. The highest award? You mean like a 5 star rating? They took that away from you.
