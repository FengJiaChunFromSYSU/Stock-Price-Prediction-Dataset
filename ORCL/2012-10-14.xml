Under the auspices of George P. Shultz's Princeton Project on National Security, the Rohatyn Center for International Affairs at Middlebury College, and the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University, jointly sponsored a conference promoting "The Privatization of National Security," at the Middlebury College campus in Vermont. The conference brought together a dozen or so academics, former government officials, and retired military officers to chart out the vast expansion of the privatization of military functions, through PMCs—private military companies. According to the Rohatyn Center's annual report of 2004-05, Shultz is the co-chairman of the Princeton Project, which is funded by the Ford Foundation, and "aims to move beyond the ... standard ways of thinking about national security." Translated into plain English, Shultz and Rohatyn are leading the drive to eliminate the sovereign nation-state, by outsourcing to private multinational corporations, virtually all national security and military functions, including all non-combat and some core combat functions of the military itself. In line with the Shultz-Rohatyn scheme—and under the umbrella of "privatization"—the so-called Global War on Terrorism (GWOT of Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, former Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz (now president of the World Bank), and Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence Stephen Cambone, has already transformed segments of the U.S. military into a carbon-copy of Hitler's Allgemeine SS [see article], deploying quasi-private bands of commandos around the globe with a license to kill, and engaging in a massive spying campaign against American citizens, far beyond anything Richard Nixon envisioned in his most paranoid moments.</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1350221414131</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 09:30:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350226929071-6</Id><Topic><Title># ORCL Featured on Squawk Box #</Title><Username>tonyjefferson976</Username><Timestamp>1348245999301</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 12:46:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>was great</Msg><Username>coolstockk</Username><Timestamp>1350226929071</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 11:02:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350227506509-7</Id><Topic><Title>Romney and Ryan want you to serve in afghanistan</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1350093032342</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 21:50:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Id love to see you hanging from the same tree as the chimpanzee in chief ;)</Msg><Username>harryschmoe</Username><Timestamp>1350227506509</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 11:11:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350227549506-8</Id><Topic><Title>Its Obamas Fault!

Nine years ago, the company bought two camshaft factories that employed about 500 people in Michigan. By 2007 both were shut down. Now Asimco manufactures the same components in China on government-donated land in a coastal region that China has designated an export base, where companies are eligible for the sort of subsidies Mr. Romney says create an unfair trade imbalance. But there is a twist to the Asimco story that would not fit neatly into a Romney stump speech: Since 2010, it has been owned by Bain Capital, the private equity firm founded by Mr. Romney, who has as much as $2.25 million invested in three Bain funds with large stakes in Asimco and at least seven other Chinese businesses, according to his 2012 candidate financial disclosure and other documents.
