Two groups are targeting state Rep. Mike McLachlan and state Sens. Angela Giron, Evie Hudak and John Morse. The Democrat-controlled legislature passed bills that ban magazines holding more than 15 rounds and require background checks for all gun transfers. They were signed into law in March by Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper. Morse, the Senate president, pushed a more far-reaching proposal that called for holding owners, sellers and makers of assault-type weapons liable for havoc inflicted by their guns. He pulled the bill upon realizing he didn’t have enough votes. But his efforts have still drawn the ire of the groups. The petition drives are being organized by the organizations Pueblo Freedom and Rights Group. They will need signatures from 25 percent of the vote in each lawmaker’s district to trigger a special election.</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1368301206125</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-11 15:40:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368311320150-19</Id><Title>Yes, Democrat Presidents did cause 55k Kennedy was there for about 100 deaths..Nixon 300 TIMES MORE DEAD!</Title><Msg>Give up ya got NUTHIN!</Msg><Username>dropkickpubs4321</Username><Timestamp>1368311320150</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-11 18:28:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368311346280-20</Id><Title>....and IKE STARTED IT!</Title><Msg>Give up ya got NUTHIN!</Msg><Username>dropkickpubs4321</Username><Timestamp>1368311346280</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-11 18:29:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368311545476-21</Id><Title>Anthony Wiener tweeted his to women who Who had the affairs?</Title><Msg>Weiner of Sanford?</Msg><Username>dropkickpubs4321</Username><Timestamp>1368311545476</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-11 18:32:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368312522604-22</Id><Topic><Title>pubs elect proven liar &amp; cheat</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1368291446796</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-11 12:57:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Smackaroo, buckaroo.
