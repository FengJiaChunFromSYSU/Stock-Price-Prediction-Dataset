In an interview with Telemundo that aired Wednesday night, the president said of the Egyptian government, “I don’t think that we would consider them an ally, but we don’t consider them an enemy. They’re a new government that is trying to find its way.” “ ‘Ally’ is a legal term of art,” said White House spokesman Jay Carney. “But as the president has said, Egypt is a long-standing and close partner of the United States.” Meanwhile, Mitt Romney yesterday turned away from his searing criticisms of Obama’s handling of the crisis in the Middle East, instead focusing on the victims of the tragedy at the US consulate in Libya. “I know that we have heavy hearts across America today,” Romney told a crowd of a few thousand at a park in northern Virginia, where he is waging a fierce political battle for votes with Obama. “We’re in mourning,” Romney said. “We’re thinking about their families and who they left behind.” It was a turnaround from Wednesday, when Romney slammed Obama for “sympathizing” with those who stormed the US Embassy in Cairo and accused the administration of “apologizing” to US enemies. At one point yesterday, Romney was interrupted by a heckler who said the killings of Americans in Libya could have been prevented. “I would offer a moment of silence, but one gentleman doesn’t want to be silent — so we’re going to keep on going,” Romney said. Even as Romney pivoted back to other topics, his surrogates provided cover for his earlier criticism of the White House. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) ripped Obama for his “feckless foreign policy.” “What this is all about is American weakness and the president’s inability to lead,” McCain said on NBC’s “Today” show. Romney did accuse Obama of moving to scrap a national strategy of having the resources to fight two full-scale wars at once. “The world needs American leadership. The Middle East needs American leadership. And I intend to be a president that provides the leadership that America respects and will keep us admired throughout the world,” said Romney, who later jetted to two Long Island fund-raisers where donors paid up to $50,000 each. Obama, in Colorado, engaged in saber rattling over the embassy attacks, saying: “I want people around the world to hear me: To all those who would do us harm, no act of terror will go unpunished. It will not dim the light of the values that we proudly present to the rest of the world. No act of violence shakes the resolve of the United States of America.”</Msg><Username>liberals_plague_humanity</Username><Timestamp>1347620519015</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 07:01:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347623698709-2</Id><Topic><Title>Obama WIDENS lead in battleground states OHIO,FLORIDA and even</Title><Username>whycantphiligetawoman</Username><Timestamp>1347623306002</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 07:48:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What fools these mortals be!!!!!</Msg><Username>vanzinf</Username><Timestamp>1347623698709</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 07:54:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347624446905-3</Id><Topic><Title>Quote of the campaign by Mittens Romney:</Title><Username>whycantphiligetawoman</Username><Timestamp>1347622804070</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 07:40:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Untrue?

Two percent (2%) prefer some other candidate, and five percent (5%) are undecided. See daily tracking history. The recent numbers may have been impacted by a number of factors. Clearly, one is the fading of the president’s convention bounce. Last week, Scott Rasmussen anticipated this fade by noting that the conventions would have no lasting impact on the race. Additionally, last week’s jobs report was disappointing. However, consumer confidence did not fall in the wake of that report. That may be due to the fact that the poor results were no surprise to consumers. Confidence also may have been impacted by the Fed decision to provide additional stimulus. That decision boosted both the stock market and investor confidence. Nearly half of all consumers are also investors. Finally, it is way too early to evaluate the political impact, if any, from recent events in the Middle East. Today’s tracking data shows that despite the extensive news coverage of Arab attacks on U.S. embassies, only six percent (6%) of voters consider national security issues the most important during this election cycle. That’s little changed from five percent (5%) before the attacks began. Additionally, voters currently trust the president more than Romney on national security issues by a narrow 46% to 43% margin. That, too, is little changed following recent events. In Ohio Obama leads by a point. In Florida, the president is up two. Romney has edged back into the lead in Missouri and now earns 51% of the vote in North Carolina. See the latest Rasmussen Reports Electoral College Projections.

Ninety-one percent of CFOs said a 1 percentage point drop in interest rates would not change their capital spending plans, according to a survey of 1,500 CFOs conducted before the QE3 Fed announcement by Duke University and CFO Magazine. Congress is going on leave until the election starting next week. They won't fix the fiscal cliff before the election. Both sides are digging in. Congress won't be able to head off looming federal tax increases and spending cuts that will push the nation back into deep recession early next year. In fact, the recession has already started. Profits for the S&amp;P barely showed growth in Q2 and Q3 earnings are expected to be negative. Uncle Ben knows this. That is why he pulled out all the stops with a massive inflationary loosest Fed policy ever. There's no way Obama is gonna be able to hang his 2012-2013 Depression on Uncle Ben. Obama and his leaders in Congress have done nothing or prevented bills from being brought up for vote. Impeach Reid and Pelosi now and put Barney Frank in jail. Regime change will give us a fresh start. Obama has done little for the last 2 years. He's spent like a drunken sailor with no budget for 4 years. Now he's gonna tax everybody like crazy so he can keep spending. He's an irresponsible tax and spend liberal. Scott Walker and Paul Ryan know how to run a government on a budget. Obama has never ran a government and American voters captivated by a snake oil salesman put him in charge of the biggest economy in the world. No wonder we have a global recession. This should have been like the S&amp;L bust in the 80's. Obama is a community organizer college professor who is secretly implementing his vision of a socialist society in America. He's not what the American free enterprise system needs. Do we need a Socialist Democrat who wants America to have a green economy like Spain? NO! BTW, the Spanish bailout could happen this weekend. Things are heating up. Katla will blow.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1347666216108</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 19:43:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347666341473-45</Id><Topic><Title>MUST CHECK - Oracle Corporation.
