However, when a bullcrap-spewing pretend environmentalist makes even more money not by creating a useful product but by using his influence to lie, create fear among the population, convince idiot youngsters such as OWS and others, into parlaying his stature built on lies into influeced laws, you want to see him as a victim (think Goracle)? You have drank too much KoolAid, my little red friend!</Msg><Username>coughingredink</Username><Timestamp>1357402775814</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 11:19:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357403821292-6</Id><Topic><Title>Gore Sucks Up Oil Money Like A Pig On Slop!</Title><Username>moveon_moveoutnow</Username><Timestamp>1357255966365</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 18:32:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Gore sold his business to the group that praised the 9i/11 crowd. Of course he AND his father were in bed with Armand Hammer and his oil company. Hammer made his start by fencing stolen art works out of Russia for his #$%$ friends. He also helped Khadaffi Duck through his oil business. You and others still haven't figured out that thieves that run this country control BOTH parties. They play Americans for the fools that they are.</Msg><Username>lewcor</Username><Timestamp>1357403821292</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 11:37:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357404114499-7</Id><Topic><Title>The Goracle ---- just another hypocrite, Dem punk!</Title><Username>coughingredink</Username><Timestamp>1357310621684</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 09:43:41 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Is your real name Abdullah? I've no more use for Cheney and Bush than I do for Gore and other mega millionaire "liberals". They all would sell their own mothers down the chute for a buck.

Surly you remember Pelosi's famous words concerning Obamacare, just sign the bill and read it late.
