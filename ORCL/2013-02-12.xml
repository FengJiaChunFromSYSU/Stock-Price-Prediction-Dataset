Look at the state we're in.

No more tap dancing, no more averting and diverting his part in the financial downfall. The economy may have been down with Bush but we weren't under water.

Everything is set for a 3 year rally. Reasons you ask? 1) The average investor believes hovering around all time highs will lead to a correction, or worse another catastrophic sell off. 2) With all the QE the fed has been pumping into this system during Obama's presidency (which it will continue to do until Obama exits), hyper inflation and rising indexes may be inevitable. 3) Investors will flee from bonds and precious metals. Where will they put there money, under the mattress? Whether you like Obama or not, the end result will be that from a wall street perspective he will be a glorified poster boy. The one who dug us out of the real estate and banking crisis, and guided the DOW toward 20,000 by the end of his 8 year term. Get in now, or you may just watch your un-invested dollars wash away and erode due to inflation. Stay in the game, and you might have a penny to spare.

According to data compiled by the FBI, the number of Americans purchasing guns has skyrocketed since Obama was elected. In 2009, there were 13,984,953 background checks for Americans buying firearms. If we subtract the 1,212,860 checks completed in the month of January, the total checks for the year under Obama were 12,772,090. For 2010, background checks totaled 14,320,489. In 2011, checks were 16,336,732, and in 2012, 19,463,832. Background checks for the month of January 2013 were 2,483,230. This totals 65,376,373 background checks completed since President Obama's first full month in office, or 44,748 background checks per day! By comparison, the number of background checks in Obama's first term is 91.1% higher than President George W.
