The conservative Drudge Report displayed the video at the top of its website last week, and radio host Rush Limbaugh pointed to the video to argue that Obama is making people dependent on the government. "So these are the people that don't like Romney because of what he said about the 47 percent? No, these are the 47 percent," Limbaugh said. "She knows how to get this free Obama phone. She knows everything about it. She may not know who George Washington is or Abraham Lincoln, but she knows how to get an Obama phone, and she knows that Romney sucks, and she ends up at a Romney rally." Although there is no such thing as an "Obama phone," there is a federal program to help low-income people get access to phones. The program, called Lifeline, is managed by the Federal Communications Commission and began long before President Obama took office. Congress first enacted the Lifeline program in 1985, during the Reagan administration. In 2005, under President George W. Bush, the FCC expanded the program to cover low-cost cellular service.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1349190675109</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 11:11:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349190748467-27</Id><Topic><Title>your dessage horse must be shown on the new gop voter id</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1349188524015</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 10:35:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Don't forget the Kenyan's donations from Goldman-Sachs.

Hope and change, dope in charge.</Msg><Username>passthebuckaroo</Username><Timestamp>1349192677947</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 11:44:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349193657150-36</Id><Topic><Title>New Update in ORCL</Title><Username>berenicerfh988</Username><Timestamp>1349185300038</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 09:41:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>this is what i exactly need at the moment *** No my friend, what you really need is some cleansing hydro therapy treatment.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1349193657150</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 12:00:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349194261031-37</Id><Title>Obama hits JP Morgan Chase with $2B Fraud Law Suit</Title><Msg>Bash the banks baby!!!

What happened? How did we go from a significant federal budget surplus to a massive deficit? Frankly, it is not that complicated. President George W. Bush and the so-called deficit hawks chose to go to war in Afghanistan and Iraq and put the funding for those wars on our nation’s credit card. By the time the last wounded veteran is cared for, those wars will end up adding more than $3 trillion to our national debt. During this same period, Bush and the “deficit hawks” provided huge tax breaks to the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans who were already doing phenomenally well. These tax breaks for the very rich will increase our national debt by about $1 trillion over a 10-year period. In addition, Bush and the “deficit hawks” established a Medicare prescription drug program written by the pharmaceutical and insurance industries. This program, which is far more expensive than it should be because it prohibits the federal government from using its purchasing power to negotiate cheaper drug prices, was not paid for. As a result, about $400 billion will be added to our national debt over a 10-year period. Further, as a result of the deregulation of Wall Street, and the greed, recklessness and illegal behavior of the major financial institutions, this country was driven into the worst recession since the 1930s, which resulted in a massive reduction in revenue coming into the federal government." well said</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1349203434313</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 14:43:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349204097748-61</Id><Title>delucks has love affair with Romney's horse, and</Title><Msg>and Obama's #$%$!</Msg><Username>ourfirstpantroglodytepresident</Username><Timestamp>1349204097748</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 14:54:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349204354128-62</Id><Title>Sixteen Tons, and What do You Get?</Title><Msg>A stupid commercial from a stupid union.</Msg><Username>ourfirstpantroglodytepresident</Username><Timestamp>1349204354128</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 14:59:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349204421220-63</Id><Topic><Title>delucks has love affair with Romney's horse, and</Title><Username>ourfirstpantroglodytepresident</Username><Timestamp>1349204097748</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 14:54:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>and Obama's skinny derriere!</Msg><Username>ourfirstpantroglodytepresident</Username><Timestamp>1349204421220</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 15:00:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349204466777-64</Id><Topic><Title>delucks has love affair with Romney's horse, and</Title><Username>ourfirstpantroglodytepresident</Username><Timestamp>1349204097748</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 14:54:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Do recall that the symbol fo the Democrats is a Jack-derriere!</Msg><Username>ourfirstpantroglodytepresident</Username><Timestamp>1349204466777</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 15:01:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349204583758-65</Id><Title>At least 16 attacks, mabe 61 attacks on our Embassy in Libya</Title><Msg>Our Failure in Chief refused to beef up security.

The term insinuated that corporations and business owners were so greedy and profit-hungry that they shared little of their revenues with living wages for their employees and were very selective with their investments... to the detriment of economic growth. Of course, the "trickle down" mantra was a complete failure. By today's standard, we would give ANYTHING to achieve the growth and employment levels of 20 years ago... and the ability of American capitalism to Deliver that growth. But still, the american socialist movement was able to use the trickle-down term to win elections and convince people that capitalism wouldn't work... in spite of the fact that capitalism CREATED our country's wealth 100 years ago when taxes were low and America was becoming the world's premier economic power. Today, Obama slams capitalism and wealth EVERY DAY from behind the microphone and spends far more on social programs and government spending than at anytime in history. Still, despite record fiscal stimulus ($1.2 trillion deficits) and record monetary stimulus (0% short term rates and QE-infinity), our economy is barely growing at 1.3% GDP and un-employment is permanently stuck above 8% with record numbers of americans dropping OUT of the workforce. We are clearly experiencing "trickle down" economics TODAY... because nobody is INVESTING anything. In fact, they're LEAVING the U.S. like Apple's Wozniak and facebook's Saverin... $Billionaires both. We have "trickle down" because Obama has everybody AFRAID to invest. It really is a term that defines the hard left... NOT the right, as it's socialist inventors originally planned on. It's been 6 years since the democrat left seized control of congress and declared everything Bush sent them "dead on arrival"... ... what will 4 more years of Obama's "trickle-down" economics give us???? GREECE, that's what!

In the end, they pulled back moments before we toppled into the abyss. But by then, they had already done serious damage to the recovery. Early in the year, the economy seemed to be gathering momentum. In February, it added 220,000 jobs. In March, it added 246,000 jobs. In April, 251,000 jobs. But as markets began to take the Republican threats on the debt ceiling more seriously, the economy sputtered. Between May and August, the nation never added more than 100,000 jobs a month. And then, in September, the month after the debt ceiling was resolved, the economy sped back up and added more than 200,000 jobs."

Bottom line: Nobody who ever became rich did so without employing a lot of people to help him. In economics, we call that "human leverage". When the economic incentives are bigger, they aspire more and hire more people. That's called "gush-down" economics. Over-tax people, and they either take their investment capital overseas or they dive into un-productive, economic shelters... neither one of which involves employing american labor... thus the "trickle-down" effect of Obamanomics.</Msg><Username>bjspokanimal</Username><Timestamp>1349216958949</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 18:29:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349217176724-88</Id><Topic><Title>Obama, And "Trickle Down" Economics</Title><Username>bjspokanimal</Username><Timestamp>1349210863126</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 16:47:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>... in a posting of his own.

President Obama and Mitt Romney are deadlocked among likely voters as they prepare to square off in their first presidential debate, according to the latest United Technologies/National Journal Congressional Connection Poll. The survey showed that voters remain resistant to either Obama or Romney holding full control of the federal government. Obama and Romney each pulled in 47 percent support in the poll among likely voters. It is among the narrowest margins of several presidential surveys published ahead of the debate this week. Other polls have shown the president with a slim lead. In this survey, while the race is tied among likely voters, Obama has a 5-point lead, 49 percent to 44 percent, among registered voters. The survey was conducted Sept. 27-30 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.7 percentage points.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1349225784821</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 20:56:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349228201858-95</Id><Topic><Title>Obama says fiscal cliff is INEVITABLE!!!
