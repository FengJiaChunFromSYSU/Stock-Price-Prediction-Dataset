ALBANY — The explosion of Capitol corruption scandals in recent years has turned a bunch of campaign accounts into legal defense funds. Twenty elected officials since 2004 spent a combined $6.78 million on legal fees related to criminal and ethical investigations against them, a Daily News/New York Public Interest Research Group analysis shows. The list has included some of the most powerful elected officials in Albany, including former Gov. David Paterson, convicted former Controller Alan Hevesi, former Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and pervy Assemblyman Vito Lopez. In the past two years alone, state lawmakers spent nearly $2 million in campaign funds on legal fees, led by the $1.5 million paid by former state Sen. Carl Kruger.

While the talks seemed to be going well, by October, South Vietnam had dropped out, just as Johnson was about to negotiate an end to all bombings in North Vietnam. The Democratic nominee, Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey, belatedly called for a bombing halt, and closed the gap with Nixon in the final days. The reason for the Saigon government's withdrawal? Richard Nixon had convinced the South Vietnamese delegates that they would get a better peace deal under his presidency. Nixon’s campaign relied heavily on the war continuing, and he saw an end to the bombings as an grave threat to his campaign. (and Nixon 36% of USA kia were in Nixon's first 4 years... the rest were over the 15 years or so since the Eisenhower 50s)</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1366289065161</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 08:44:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366289444945-12</Id><Title>2 persons of interest</Title><Msg>have been identified.

The attempt to cover up a possible Saudi connection to the Boston attack could explain why authorities are scrambling to get their official narrative straight after photos emerged yesterday on the Internet showing numerous suspects carrying large backpacks, some of them middle eastern in appearance and two of the individuals having been almost certainly identified as employees of private military/security firm Craft International. The FBI had set a press conference for 5pm EST yesterday afternoon but the event was cancelled hours after the photos were seen by millions of people online. The federal agency blamed the media for erroneous reporting, stating, “these stories often have unintended consequences.” CNN also had to backtrack after they announced that a suspect had been arrested, a report that was subsequently denied by authorities. Reports of a “dark skinned man” being arrested were later mothballed. According to terrorism expert Steve Emerson, 20-year-old Abdul Rahman Ali Alharbi, the Saudi national first suspected of being involved in Monday’s twin bomb attack, is being hastily deported. Alharbi was put under armed guard in hospital after the bombing, was visited by Saudi diplomat Azzam bin Abdel Karim, and later had his apartment raided by federal and state law enforcement agents. “I just learned from my own sources that he is now going to be deported on national security grounds next Tuesday, which is very unusual,” Emerson told Fox News last night.

Now, authorities say Internal Revenue Service employees in Tennessee were stealing unemployment and other benefits while fully employed. On Thursday, 13 of those employees were indicted on federal charges that they lied to get unemployment, food stamps, welfare and housing vouchers. An additional 11 have been indicted on state charges of theft greater than $1,000. In all, authorities say the workers improperly received more than $250,000 in government benefits. “You’ve got these employees that are taking advantage of the system that they are so intimate with it by virtue of their jobs,” said Shelby County District Attorney General Amy Weirech, whose office is handling the state prosecutions. “It’s doubly frustrating.” The investigation originated with the U.S. Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, a Treasury Department agency that is responsible for oversight of the IRS. The agency in recent years has been focusing on IRS employees who illegally draw government benefits as part of what they call “Operation Double Dip.”</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1366293266542</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 09:54:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366293494349-20</Id><Topic><Title>crazy white man arrested for ricin letters.</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1366292561103</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 09:42:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you seem to have a lot in common with the crazy white man ricin letter sender who was arrested.

You said Nixon cause half of casualties, and he did not. If fact most of the casualties during his term occurred during 1969, the change over year between Johnson &amp; Nixon. Losses during 1970 &amp; 1971 were WAY DOWN over losses during Johnson's Admin. Only 16% of the KIAs occurred from 1970 to 1972. And you're still trying with that myth about Eisenhower, when a total of 9 people were killed during Eisenhower's presidency. You can't ever really blame Kennedy, only 91 soldiers died due to VietNam during his term, Slightly more than 63% of the casualties occurred during Johnson's Administration, because Johnson was a FAILURE! You are stuck with the fact that the Vietnam War was JOHNSON'S WAR and he FAILED! You also can't avoid the fact that Nixon WON THE WAR! And that the Democrats later threw the win away and stood by while 4 million people were mass murdered by their commie buddies!

Ericsson (ERIC) just announced they are paying Microsoft (MSFT) almost $200mm to purchase their Mediaroom multi-screen video software business in order for ERIC to increase their multi-screen reach by 11mm households to 16mm. CCUR's MediaHawk multi-screen software is superior to Mediaroom and CCUR has multi-screen contracts signed with the #1 pay-TV companies in Germany, the UK, and Japan. These multi-screen clients will give CCUR an initial reach of 14.8 million multi-screen subscribers, which is even larger than Mediaroom's reach, and ERIC is paying MSFT almost $200mm to acquire it! CCUR ris receiving absolutely no value for its video business at its current share price of only $6.75! CCUR has 8.72mm shares outstanding and a big cash position of $24.6mm. CCUR's enterprise value is only $34.26mm, which is just 0.52X its annualized revenues of $66.4mm and only 3X its cash flow from operations over the past 9 months annualized! CCUR's video business, which has also captured the largest video-on-demand (VOD) market share in the pay-TV industry with a reach of over 50 million pay-TV subscriber households, is receiving no value after subtracting the value of CCUR's Media Data Intelligence (MDI) and real-time businesses from its enterprise value! CCUR's MDI business was acquired by CCUR for $15mm. It tracks in real-time the viewing behavior of 35 million pay-TV subscribers across all screen types. CCUR's "real-time" ultra high performance computer technology business has annualized revenues of $27.6mm with 4 of the 5 largest defense contractors as clients. It is most likely worth at least $25mm by itself. This means CCUR's video delivery solutions business, with annualized revenues of $33.8mm, is receiving zero value! CCUR's EPS is rapidly ramping up faster than almost any other tech stock on the NASDAQ!</Msg><Username>tejsmf63</Username><Timestamp>1366312700952</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 15:18:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366312859673-65</Id><Title>Huge billboard in Boston has a message: COWARDS</Title><Msg>Less than 10 miles from the finish line of the Boston Marathon, where three people were killed and more than 170 injured in dual blasts on Monday, lies a billboard with a one-word message: "Cowards."

You can't tell what they are. Don't know if it's a different vid but one I've seen other than on the lamestream media shows two guys, both with black caps.. The caps have a Navy Seals emblem on them. They both have black jackets and black back packs. Strange no one stopped them and questioned them. I wear a fanny pack sometime. After 9/11 I was asked many times to open it and let cops or security personnel look. But really it kinda looks like two Black Panthers to me.</Msg><Username>lewcor</Username><Timestamp>1366335211164</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 21:33:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366335453612-77</Id><Topic><Title>Huge billboard in Boston has a message: COWARDS</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1366312859673</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 15:20:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Anyone that hurts innocent people, little kids or animals without cause is worse than a wild beast.
