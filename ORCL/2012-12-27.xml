How can you tell if the 300-lb woman with 4 kids and an EBT card is a blind, disabled vet? Grandma voted for Romney. Isn't it really about Jose and K'shanda? Has the committee ever been surpassed as a method of doing nothing? Since Kerry was the head of Obama's Supercommittee that set up the cliff, why can't we kick him over it? How did we live with ourselves when we helped the unemployed for only 26 weeks? Who decided not to send gunships to save the heroes of Benghazi? If the innovative and hardworking few are going to improve our economy, should we just hand that to the undeserving now? Will the Fast &amp; Furious impeachment hearings be televised?</Msg><Username>kollesieral</Username><Timestamp>1356622269445</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 10:31:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>18</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356626729010-2</Id><Topic><Title>gop fiscal plan burdens the middleclass to spare the 2%</Title><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1356624420501</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 11:07:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you are an idiot....</Msg><Username>tomballz_butt_is_sore</Username><Timestamp>1356626729010</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 11:45:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356629238465-3</Id><Title>senate to intoduce gun ban bill...</Title><Msg>Sen. Feinstein is on the move. Any semi-automatic weapon that loads more than 10 rounds will be banned if the pols get their way. Interesting observation. The felon in Rochester NY who laid in wait for firemen used a .223 rifle. As a felon it was illegal for him to possess a firearm. Did that fact stop him? Would gun ban laws stop any criminal? Not a chance. Gun ban laws are for the lawful cits. For the left, I think that is precisely the point.</Msg><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1356629238465</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 12:27:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356634159340-4</Id><Topic><Title>senate to intoduce gun ban bill...</Title><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1356629238465</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 12:27:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>the pols want anti-gun laws that they say are meant to prevent Newtown murders.
