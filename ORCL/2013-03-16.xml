Rob Portman on Thursday announced he has reversed his longtime opposition to same-sex marriage after reconsidering the issue because his 21-year-old son, Will, is gay. Portman said his son, a junior at Yale University, told him and his wife, Jane, that he's gay and "it was not a choice, it was who he is and that he had been that way since he could remember." "It allowed me to think of this issue from a new perspective, and that's of a Dad who loves his son a lot and wants him to have the same opportunities that his brother and sister would have -- to have a relationship like Jane and I have had for over 26 years," Portman told reporters in an interview at his office.

This means that the use of the chained CPI would amount to a hit to their income of approximately 2.0 percent (two-thirds of 3.0 percent). By contrast, if we assume that a couple earning $500,000 a year is the typical household affected by the tax increase [enacted at the beginning of the year], then their additional tax burden will be 4.6 percent of their income over $450,000 or $2,300. If we assume that this couple had not unusual exemptions (or even usual ones), then their after-tax income before the tax increase would have been around $350,000. This means that the Obama tax increase would reduce their after tax income by a bit less than 0.7 percent. This means that the hit to Social Security beneficiaries from the chained CPI will be around three times as large as the hit to the typical affluent taxpayer from the Obama tax increase."</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1363454515360</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-16 13:21:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363455984864-36</Id><Topic><Title>IN DEPTH ORCL Analyst Report .</Title><Username>zelmastafford</Username><Timestamp>1361112271314</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-17 09:44:31 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Great report !</Msg><Username>oyolam</Username><Timestamp>1363455984864</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-16 13:46:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363463089386-37</Id><Title>Obama Refuses To Eat A Meal Prepared By A US Senator...

The only thing dumber than liberals who post rubbish 365 days a year that is neither important or only liberals believe, is a conservative who replys expecting an honest, mature response. You DA. How many times are you going to set yourself up to get SMACKED, you said repubs here weren't worth your time. Stick to it, pleeease.</Msg><Username>passthebuckaroo</Username><Timestamp>1363481237641</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-16 20:47:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363481468625-50</Id><Topic><Title>repubs,, WHEN will UN take our GUNS!</Title><Username>dropkickpubs4321</Username><Timestamp>1363478731381</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-16 20:05:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Oh btw, the UN idoes not have the power to override OUR constitution.

Has 4 of top 6 U.S. cable TV companies as clients as well as leading cable TV companies in Canada, Japan, China, and throughout Europe. About to see its business explode from clients upgrading to provide unified VOD services to all screens (tablets, smartphones, laptops, etc.). Also about to launch cloud based DVR technology that will revolutionize industry. Net income was quarter was double the quarter before and triple two quarters ago. Very bullish chart. Pays largest dividend in its space. CCUR's top competitor SEAC has lower gross margins than CCUR yet is trading with enterprise value of 1.9x fiscal year 2013 revenues. This multiple would value CCUR over $15!</Msg><Username>frankf4u489</Username><Timestamp>1363486372492</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-16 22:12:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message></Date>
