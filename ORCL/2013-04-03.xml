At the time it was reported that Lanza fire 140 rounds in about 5 minutes. The math is only a little different for 156 rounds in 4 minutes. My conclusion was that the difference between shooting &amp; reloading 5, 30 round clips versus 14, 10 round clips would be about 21 seconds. Either it would have taken Lanza about 21 more seconds to commit the same crime with more clips, or maybe an additional 2 or 3 persons might have escaped. OR (if Lanza had been a little more clever) he could have shot each victim 2 or 3 times instead of 5 or 6 times and thus could have killed even more victims, even with lower capacity magazines. He killed 26 people shooting 156 shots, about 6 per victim. If he limited his shots to 3 per victim he might have killed 52 people with the same number of shots. The blabber about magazine sizes is uninformed.</Msg><Username>bullwinkle.themoose</Username><Timestamp>1365005668211</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 12:14:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365006180603-22</Id><Topic><Title>Eleven children escaped Newtown classroom while Adam Lanza was reloading</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1364999862870</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 10:37:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The real problem here is that his nutty mother bought the guns for him, and she would have easily passed a background check. None of the proposed laws would have stopped her from buying the guns for her son. Thus the focus on background checks is not logically related to this crime. Further, out of the 12,000 gun deaths in the USA every year only perhaps 770 are committed with rifles of ANY type. Thus the focus on the AR-15 is not related to the over all gun-crime problem. Furthermore, Chicago, IL is earning a reputation as "Murder City." And they have some of the strictest gun laws in the country. Many of which the Mayor, Rahm Emanuel and his police force do not bother to enforce. What is the point of having more gun laws that no one enforces? The bottom line is that the Newtown killings are being played up as a crisis by liberal media so liberals can pass gun laws that they want to pass anyway, even though they are unrelated to the event.</Msg><Username>bullwinkle.themoose</Username><Timestamp>1365006180603</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 12:23:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365006391517-23</Id><Topic><Title>Eleven children escaped Newtown classroom while Adam Lanza was reloading</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1364999862870</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 10:37:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>OK, if magazine size makes no difference then out law them....and why not outlaw them? they make no difference, you say, so why even have them? and since they make no difference as you say why not make the parents happy who want them outlawed?....... after all, you lose nothing... and they gain some peace of mind...</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1365006391517</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 12:26:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365006822051-24</Id><Topic><Title>Eleven children escaped Newtown classroom while Adam Lanza was reloading</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1364999862870</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 10:37:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Pure Pigshyt!!

The article argues that the 2011 peak of $1921 was the top, and that now the run of the cult metal is coming to an end. The argument essentially boils down to two arguments, which are related. The first is that we're seeing rate normalization. When real interest rates are ultra-low, gold does well historically. The second is that the era of crisis is over, and so the impulse to hedge against collapse (or massive volatility) is diminishing.

Years ago, my Dad was a hunter and prided himself in taking only one shot to kill a deer. He was using a 30 caliber rifle. A typical white tailed deer is larger than a child and about the same size as an adult woman (i.e. a teacher.: 110 pounds to 140 pounds.)

Korea approves nuclear strike on United States By Jung Ha-Won (AFP) – 51 minutes ago SEOUL — North Korea dramatically escalated its warlike rhetoric on Thursday, warning that it had authorised plans for nuclear strikes on targets in the United States. "The moment of explosion is approaching fast," the North Korean military said, warning that war could break out "today or tomorrow". Pyongyang's latest pronouncement came as Washington scrambled to reinforce its Pacific missile defences, preparing to send ground-based interceptors to Guam and dispatching two Aegis class destroyers to the region. Tension was also high on the North's heavily fortified border with South Korea, after Kim Jong-Un's isolated regime barred South Koreans from entering a Seoul-funded joint industrial park on its side of the frontier. In a statement published by the state KCNA news agency, the Korean People's Army general staff warned Washington that US threats would be "smashed by... cutting-edge smaller, lighter and diversified nuclear strike means". "The merciless operation of our revolutionary armed forces in this regard has been finally examined and ratified," the statement said.</Msg><Username>liberals_plague_humanity</Username><Timestamp>1365033251588</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 19:54:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365034530823-59</Id><Topic><Title>Obama adds debt at 6x the rate of Reagan!</Title><Username>dropkickpubs4321</Username><Timestamp>1365027932912</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 18:25:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That's total BS.
