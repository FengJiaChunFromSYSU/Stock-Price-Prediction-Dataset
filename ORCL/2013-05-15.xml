Bush, helped raise money for it; the group is run by a cadre of experienced political hands; it has spent millions of dollars on television commercials attacking Democrats in key Senate races across the country. Yet the Republican operatives who created the group earlier this year set it up as a 501(c)(4) nonprofit corporation, so its primary purpose, by law, is not supposed to be political. The rule of thumb, in fact, is that more than 50 percent of a 501(c)(4)’s activities cannot be political. But that has not stopped Crossroads and a raft of other nonprofit advocacy groups like it — mostly on the Republican side, so far — from becoming some of the biggest players in this year’s midterm elections, in part because of the anonymity they afford donors, prompting outcries from campaign finance watchdogs.</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1368637368990</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 13:02:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368637485121-41</Id><Title>huge surge in PAC tax exempt requests in last few years (and pubs say no questions can be asked)</Title><Msg>Between 2010 and 2012, in the wake of the 2010 Citizens United V.

That figure was included in data provided by the IRS in response to a Freedom of Information Act request by The Washington Examiner. Lerner is director of the IRS exempt organizations division, which processes and approves or denies applications from groups seeking tax-exempt status. Lerner received $17,220 for 2009, $24,691 for 2010 and $10,620 for 2011, the most recent year for which the IRS said data was available. The newspaper's FOIA was dated Aug. 21, 2013, but the tax agency said it only received the request on Nov. 21, 2012. The response, including the data, was postmarked May 10, 2013. Sign Up for the Politics Digest newsletter! Lerner admitted last week that her agency had singled out conservative groups with words like "Tea Party" and "Patriot" in their names. Being singled out reportedly delayed resolution of their application for many months for most of the groups, while applications from liberals groups were typically processed in only a month or two.</Msg><Username>hikemanymiles</Username><Timestamp>1368648091241</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 16:01:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368648582386-60</Id><Topic><Title>IRS Commissioner: Rogue employees in Cincy did it</Title><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1368647884764</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 15:58:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>the same rogues who during the bush years went after the NAACP?</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1368648582386</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 16:09:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368648842122-61</Id><Title>it wasn't rogue US military who raped and murdered in Bushraq and Bushghanistan, right wingnuts?</Title><Msg>sure.. like Bush and the gop didn't personally order the rapes and murders, sheesh. same with the notion of rogue priests raping children, the Pope and church leaders were ordering it, right pubbies, isn't that your view of how things work....... or is it only Obama who is supposed to be in charge of every single action of every single person in the US government?</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1368648842122</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 16:14:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368650280590-62</Id><Title>Anyone who doesn't get an ill chill when the IRS breaks the law is stupid.</Title><Msg>'nuff said.</Msg><Username>blackmesainterloper</Username><Timestamp>1368650280590</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 16:38:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368650551582-63</Id><Topic><Title>The bottom line on the dishonest, lying Obama Presidency............</Title><Username>blackmesainterloper</Username><Timestamp>1368560272748</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 15:37:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Honest news would be a nice start</Msg><Username>jomoredux</Username><Timestamp>1368650551582</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 16:42:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368650740509-64</Id><Topic><Title>Obama and Hllary have screwed the pooch on Bengjazi, directly caused 4 deaths.</Title><Username>cockedlockedtorock</Username><Timestamp>1368374277332</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-12 11:57:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ome people, especially Dems, prefer incompetence.</Msg><Username>blackmesainterloper</Username><Timestamp>1368650740509</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 16:45:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368653714585-65</Id><Topic><Title>revelations undo GOP Benghazi political attack</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1368644382284</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 14:59:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How did Mr Issa overlook this fact: " U.S. Ambassador J.

These are the type of people that Liver Lips (and Bush) cosied up to. Goldman-Sachs was the main spring behind the housing bubble, Justice department says there were lies told about housing derivatives. Thats fraud. Why no arrests or prosecutions? In spite of this, between Liver Lips and Bush they appointed about 50 of these people from Goldman-Sachs to run every facet of government money. Even the worst moron should begin to suspicion something.</Msg><Username>lewcor</Username><Timestamp>1368669107332</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 21:51:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368669318414-85</Id><Topic><Title>Really.....dropkick can't REALLY bt that stupid, can he?
