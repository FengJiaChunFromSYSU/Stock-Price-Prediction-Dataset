Allred told Fox News on Oct. 7 that she had “just had a few words with the president” backstage that night at the Los Angeles gala, entitled “30 Days to Victory,” at the Nokia Theatre. “He had some very kind words for me,” she told Fox that night. “And he knows of my work for women's rights,” she added, Fox reported on Wednesday. Allred, a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in Tampa, Fla., last month, declined to elaborate further on their conversation, Fox reports. Now, Allred is hoping to unseal testimony that Romney gave in the divorce case of Staples Inc. founder Tom Stemberg, Fox reports. The company, based in suburban Boston, was founded with seed money from Romney's firm, Bain Capital – and Stemberg is a Romney surrogate, Fox reports. Allred appeared in a Massachusetts courtroom on Wednesday representing Maureen Stemberg, his former wife. They said they did not object to a motion from the Boston Globe to unseal Romney's testimony in the case. It was the second hearing on the Globe’s motion, Fox reports. Attorneys said Romney's testimony dealt with financial issues. Robert Jones, representing Romney, said he does expect to object to the Globe’s request but would like time to review the entire transcript of the case. The court move is raising concerns whether Allred is trying to execute an “October surprise” – and whether the Obama campaign might have any role in such an action, Fox reports.</Msg><Username>liberals_plague_humanity</Username><Timestamp>1351146810536</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 02:33:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351147218937-2</Id><Topic><Title>Obama: Companies &amp; Wealthy Investors Sitting on Tons of Cash</Title><Username>bjspokanimal</Username><Timestamp>1351017853410</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 14:44:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Republican lawmaker Jeff Denham wants to sue over DCCC ad Jeff Denham is pictured. | AP Photo 'This is personal,' Denham said. | AP Photo By JAKE SHERMAN | 10/24/12 3:56 PM EDT RIPON, Calif. — Republican Rep. Jeff Denham says he plans to sue the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in local court here for an advertisement that portrays him as voting to cut pay for veterans. The Republican says he’s taking his complaint about the ad further than most candidates who send cease-and-desist letters. He’s planning to sue the DCCC to take the advertisement down and for damages. “I am going after the Democrat Party because it is such a blatant lie,” Denham told POLITICO. The advertisement, released Wednesday, claims that Denham voted to keep his salary if the government shut down, but against a bill that would guarantee soldier pay. “With a government shutdown looming in Washington, Denham voted against a measure to guarantee our troops would still receive their pay,” the ad says. “But Denham did vote to protect his own paycheck.” The campaign said Denham voted for legislation that would shut off lawmaker pay if the government shut down and has consistently voted to pay soldiers. “It comes as no surprise that Congressman Denham doesn’t want voters to know he voted to protect his own pay but not pay for the troops, but he can’t run away from his record no matter how hard he tries,” DCCC spokesman Jesse Ferguson said. A campaign aide said they believe the ad is defamatory. “This is personal,” Denham said. “I’m a veteran.” Denham is in a close race here, south of Sacramento against Democrat José Hernandez.</Msg><Username>hikemanymiles</Username><Timestamp>1351147218937</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 02:40:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351163073899-3</Id><Topic><Title>i will pay 20$ to glenn beck if he pees on Tush Limpbalz</Title><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1351129988315</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 21:53:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Very important post.

FBI officials said Wednesday the FBI will focus on letters received by voters in 18 counties in central and southwest Florida. According to the Republican Party of Florida, Chairman Lenny Curry received one of the fake letters on Tuesday. "This type of activity is not only disgusting, it is criminal, and must be prosecuted to the full extent of the law," Curry said in a release. "I call on Florida Democrats to join me in condemning this false letter writing campaign that appears to target likely voters in Florida, and help RPOF get the word out about this false campaign." Local 6 first reported the bogus letter scam on Monday, which claim to be from county supervisors of elections but are postmarked from Seattle. They raise questions about the voter's citizenship and appear intended to intimidate people. The FBI says voters who get a letter should contact their supervisor of elections and then keep the letter for the FBI. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement is also investigating.

The paper reports that Halevy is very respected man who served under 3 Israeli Prime Ministers and led the secret negotiations with Jordan’s King Hussein that made way for Israel’s historic 1994 peace treaty with that country. In the interview, it becomes clear that Halevy thinks Romney is a liar who suffers from Romnesia: Al-Monitor: Many observers believe there is a nuclear deal to be had. But it's very hard to do, to even talk to them. Do you think it's possible to narrow the huge gulf between the two sides? Halevy: ... Negotiating with Iran is perceived as a sign of beginning to forsake Israel. That is where I think the basic difference is between Romney and Obama. What Romney is doing is mortally destroying any chance of a resolution without war. Therefore when [he recently] said, he doesn’t think there should be a war with Iran, this does not ring true. It is not consistent with other things he has said. […] Halevy goes on to say that Romney's stated Foreign policy stance with Iran has dealt a heavy blow against the interests of America and Israel. Halevy: Obama does think there is still room for negotiations. It’s a very courageous thing to say in this atmosphere. In the end, this is what I think: Making foreign policy on Iran a serious issue in the US elections — what Romney has done, in itself — is a heavy blow to the ultimate interests of the United States and Israel. It is not as if, if he wins the election, and gets into the White House, he can back up. The Iranians are listening attentively to what he says. When he says, he would arm the opposition in Iran. They understand. Halevy says Romney has a Cold War mentality: Al-Monitor: Are the Iranians paranoid the US policy is regime change, even as I don’t think for the Obama administration it is true? Halevy: They are certainly convinced the policy [is regime change]. And that is not the only regime the US has problems with in the field of values. The regimes in Beijing, North Korea, Moscow […] Romney has been very costly on Russia [...] If you want to create situation, where the only way to go about things is to go back to the Cold War, that is what is being done here. It’s very dangerous. I don’t think the US public wants to go to another world war over values in this way. If it persists, it will be a slide down a very slippery slope. It’s a question of concept. Where are we going in the 21st century? Are we going to try to propagate policies on the battlefields? Halevy then infers Romney is full of crap when he said anyone would have called for Bin Laden to be killed. Al-Monitor: Beyond the heated US campaign rhetoric, what do you make of the wider perception that, even though Obama has actually used force quite a bit, and successfully oversaw the operation that killed Osama bin Laden, that he is perceived, or mis-perceived, as not wanting to use force, and the US is seen therefore as weak. Halevy: I think nobody who has been involved in ordering the use of force can forget the angst, the days and nights of concern, as to what and how it can be done. Romney has said, Anybody could have decided to finish bin Laden. Even [Jimmy] Carter. This again was a mistaken concept. President Obama didn’t just decide [one day to kill bin Laden]. The operation to end the life of bin Laden necessitated multiple points of decision by him. I know from operations I have been involved with on a smaller scale. They are very intricate. You don’t just give the order and wait in your office for commanders to come three months later and say it’s done. No. This kind of operation, which is accident prone, hands on operation, one has to make one decision after the other […] It took courage and cool headedness and leadership. Anyone who says it was an easy thing to decide, doesn’t understand what he’s talking about. [Such comments] show a total lack of understanding of what this kind of operation means. Once I was in charge of an operation and Netanyahu was Prime Minister. One day, because of the intricacy of what we were doing, I talked to him 10 times on the phone […] Ten times. It was a Friday, a day I will not forget. This kind of operation, every minute, an issue comes up, that sometimes requires a decision on the political level. Halevy then implies that Romney is politicizing the 4 American deaths in Libya Halevy: The Libya story, the way it’s being used, is a sordid manipulation. […] Well, after reading this, it seems to me that serious thinkers around the Globe think Mitt Romney is a liar and a warmonger who has no idea what he talking about, and would have a Foreign Policy that would be a disaster in part because Romney has a Cold War mentality.</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1351172656270</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 09:44:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351172672130-25</Id><Topic><Title>Utah Republican activist facing rape charges found dead after jail release</Title><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1351172306347</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 09:38:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>well Mesa, it sounds like this guy did the right thing, didn't he?</Msg><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1351172672130</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 09:44:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351173025785-26</Id><Topic><Title>Utah Republican activist facing rape charges found dead after jail release</Title><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1351172306347</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 09:38:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>per you , he would have had a great future in the gop, but he got caught.

Romney noted that ship numbers for the Navy are at their lowest level since 1917. Obama responded that "we have these things called aircraft carriers, where planes land on them. We have these ships that go underwater, nuclear submarines." Journal editors weren’t impressed. “Yes, Mr. President, and we have fewer of all of those things, too,” they write. The navy’s ship inventory when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 was 529, including 15 aircraft carriers and 121 nuclear submarines. As of last year, those numbers had slipped to 285 ships, including 11 carriers and 71 subs. “The president is right that the ships the U.S. puts to sea today are, for the most part, much more capable than they were 20 or 30 years ago,” the editorial states. “But that's true only up to a point.” In addition, the smaller fleet has put more stress on the Navy and makes the loss of a single ship more problematic. “Concerns about ship numbers may seem passé,” Journal editors write. But, “if we've again become cavalier about maintaining the freedom of the seas, it's because a powerful U.S. Navy has accustomed us to indifference. Weaken the Navy further, and that's a luxury we'll lose.”</Msg><Username>hikemanymiles</Username><Timestamp>1351182087865</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 12:21:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351182100509-43</Id><Topic><Title>Three Things Obama Has To Mend</Title><Username>passthebuckaroo</Username><Timestamp>1351181633330</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 12:13:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hillary took no, zero, nada blame!

The survey of the Obama-Romney face-off in swing state Virginia was conducted Monday, Oct. 22, through Wednesday, Oct. 24, and is the second in a series of three. The first poll, conducted Sunday, Oct. 21 through Tuesday, Oct. 23, had Romney behind 3 points: 49 percent to 46 percent. The polls place the candidates in a statistical dead heat. The president saw a reversal of appeal among Catholic respondents in Virginia: 49 percent said they’d vote for him in the latest poll, down from 64 percent who said as much in Wednesday’s results. Romney picked up the slack: 45 percent said they'd vote for him in the latest data, up from 32 percent in the previous polling. Only 39 percent of Catholics polled “strongly” or “somewhat” approve of Obama's performance compared to his previous strong showing of 54 percent. His disapproval rating, combining “strongly” and “somewhat,” climbed 12 percentage points from Wednesday’s data — 49 percent to 37 percent. Obama’s overall approval rating took a hit among the 832 likely voters polled: 46 percent said they “strongly” or “somewhat” approve of the job he’s doing as president, while 51 percent said they “strongly” or “somewhat” disapprove of his performance. Wednesday’s results were 48 percent and 50 percent, respectively. Though Obama retains a razor-thin lead over his Republican opponent for now, the race for Virginia will be a tight one. “There is no question that this all-important state is up for grabs,” said pollster John Zogby. “No huge shifts, but some groups are moving; it won’t take much movement to flip this race.” Obama made some inroads among seniors, the latest data show: 40 percent said they “strongly” or “somewhat” approve of his performance, up from 36 percent in the previous data. But he has a long way to go: 59 percent disapprove, though slightly down from Wednesday’s results, which pegged him at a 63 percent disapproval rating. His approval rating rose slightly among whites: 36 percent “strongly” or “somewhat” approve of his performance, up from 34 percent in the previous data, though 63 percent said they “strongly” or “somewhat” disapprove. That number improved slightly from Wednesday’s 65 percent. Obama lost some of the male vote among likely voters: 46 percent said they’d vote for him, compared to 48 who reported they would in the previous poll. Romney picked up some of those votes: 49 percent now, up from 46 percent on Wednesday. But Obama gained a percentage point among women in the latest data: 52 percent, up from 51 percent. Romney lost a point: 45 percent, down from 46 percent.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1351182123466</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 12:22:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351182333040-45</Id><Title>Balance the budget?</Title><Msg>It cannot be done without causing the money supply to shrink and a massive depression to follow.

James Batmasian, an influential Florida developer and philanthropist, was among the well-heeled crowd at this $50,000-a-plate dinner, which was held at the home of private equity mogul Marc Leder. According to his wife, Marta Batmasian, a member of Romney's Florida finance committee, her husband had attended as her guest after she was "invited for being a donor at the required level." Weeks before the event, she had contributed $50,000 to the Romney presidential effort. In 2008, James Batmasian pled guilty to a felony tax evasion charge for failing to pay more than $250,000 in federal taxes for employees at his company, Investments Limited. He was sentenced to eight months at a South Carolina federal prison and a subsequent two years of supervised release. Along with serving prison time, he had to pay the outstanding taxes and was also fined an additional $30,000. At the time, he was the largest property owner in downtown Boca Raton. Following his conviction, Batmasian, an attorney, was suspended from practicing law by the Florida Supreme Court.</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1351186302735</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 13:31:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351186419683-61</Id><Topic><Title>Obama at 290.9 electoral votes, and Romney at 247.2.... 10/ 24: In Polls, Romney’s Momentum Seems to Have Stopped</Title><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1351179070455</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 11:31:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You are delusional.

My father lost his faith by the time I was two and my parents returned to the US for grad school. My father, his brother, and their father raped and sexually abused all of the girls of my generation. My father saw it as his mission to train me in my job as a woman – to sexually please men. I could go into details about the abuse, but that’s not the point of this post. (I spent my early 20s in intense therapy, up to three times a week, and I can say that PTSD is not a life-sentence.) At age 14 my father impregnated me. I can’t tell you whether it was “forcible rape” or not because while I fought many times, sometimes I just lay there crying. Sometimes I was distracting him from my sister, who seemed more fragile than I; sometimes his threat to ruin something I loved was credible enough that I didn't fight; sometimes I was in too much pain to fight. But it was always rape. Perhaps my “magical lady parts” hadn’t yet learned the whole “shut it down” trick; perhaps I lived in the real world and not in fantasy land. But in no world and at no time was that fetus a gift from God. Fortunately for me, my father was only crazy in one way. He liked to have sex with minor girls; he didn’t want them to give birth. He took me to the “abortionist” – my mother had her own insanity and I was clueless about how my cycle was supposed to work – so he realized I was late, he took me to the doctor, he chose not to pay for anesthesia. Lucky me. Tangent: I have always found the phrase, “exceptions for rape, incest, and the health of the mother” bizarre. Given my experience I tend to think of rape and incest as synonymous. However, I guess siblings who were given up for adoption could meet as adults, fall in love, get pregnant and only then find out about the blood relationship and then want to abort the issue. Anyway, that God (should s/he exist) allows evil to happen is unquestionable. That does not make it his/her intent – if you accept that God created free will. If you don’t accept free will then I guess that if I go out and castrate every guy with a glint in his eye that I don’t like that would be God’s gift as well. Bullpucky. As a parent, I allowed my children to climb on monkey bars. That my daughter fell and broke her arm was an accident – not my intent and certainly not my “gift” to her. That my son didn’t fall was also an accident – he actually didn’t tend to climb as high at as young an age (he sledded into a fence post for a concussion instead). My actions and intent were the same in both cases - age appropriate supervision of risk-taking and dealing with the consequences of choices and random chance. In my early 20s I was discussing abortion with my (evangelical, “charismatic”, right wing) mother. I asked her, “Hypothetically, if Dad had gotten me pregnant, what do you think I should have done?” Her response, “I would hope you would have the child and give it to me to raise.” I was stunned. I said, in the most serious tone I could muster, “You need to understand. You would not have saved a life, you would have lost two. I would have died before bringing that monster’s child into this world.” We’ve never again discussed abortion – or anything else since shortly after that I cut her out of my life – but I’ve always hoped that she actually heard me. I am astounded, far more than I should be, at the inability of some people to consider circumstances beyond their own experience. I wonder, should, God forbid, Mourdock’s wife be impregnated through stranger rape, would he raise that child with love as God’s gift to him? I certainly don’t wish such a tragedy on the woman, but I wonder what it would take for Mr. Mourdock to consider seriously the pain that others live with on a daily basis. I know that some rape survivors do choose to keep a child due to their own beliefs (or through lack of choice) and I can imagine that it would be possible for such women to take comfort in the thought that this was “God’s gift” to turn a horrible experience into something positive. I would never take that belief from them. I just wish the religious right would do me the favor of giving my experience and beliefs the same respect I give theirs. My daughter, now an adult, recently said, "I never thought I'd become a single issue voter. But you have to be this year. They are taking away my rights and making me a second class citizen." Even if I agreed with Romney on many (or any) other issues, I owe my 14 year old self, and all women everywhere, a vote for freedom for women. I only wish I lived in the right place to vote against this Mourdock fellow.</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1351195108861</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 15:58:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351197079370-71</Id><Topic><Title>Obama at 290.9 electoral votes, and Romney at 247.2.... 10/ 24: In Polls, Romney’s Momentum Seems to Have Stopped</Title><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1351179070455</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 11:31:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Romney didn't load up on Staples stock, devastating Allred's case and Obama#$%$ attempt October 25, 2012 | 3:35 pm Washington Secrets The Washington Examiner Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney not only thought Bain Capital-backed Staples stock was a risky investment, he never exercised all of his options to buy it, according to new testimony that is devastating to Obama backer and celebrity attorney Gloria Allred's bid to use a 1987 divorce and subsequent appeals to torpedo Romney's campaign. A source familiar with the case provided Secrets with testimony from the appeals case in which Romney revealed that he didn't buy all the Staples stock he could because he didn't see it as a sure thing. At issue is the 1987-1988 divorce of Staples founder Tom Stemberg and Maureen Sullivan Stemberg. The ex-wife believes that during the initial divorce settlement, the value of Stemberg's Staples stock was undervalued and her take was cut as a result. Sources said that the former Mrs. Stemberg believes that Romney schemed to devalue the price of Staples stock to help her husband. Despite earlier reports, Romney, then a leader at Bain, a major Staples investor, did not testify in the first divorce case - as there was no actual divorce trial. He did testify during one of Stemberg's efforts to re-litigate the divorce settlement in later years. In October 1991, Romney was called to testify about the valuation placed on Staples in 1987 during the original divorce settlement. At the end of three days of testimony Romney was asked about his own opportunity to buy up Staples stock before the IPO. He was asked if he had purchased the full amount he was allowed to buy - essentially "maxing out" on buying up Staples stock pre-IPO. Romney said he didn't because while he still believed that there was a chance that the company could take off, there was also a chance that the company could fail. A source familiar with the case told Secrets, "This disproves the Allred legislation completely. He put his money where his mouth was." Earlier Thursday, a Massachusetts court ruled that Romney's testimony can be released but the judge did not lift the gag order on Maureen Sullivan Stemberg, which would have allowed her to discuss what transpired during the divorce proceedings. Below is the transcript provided to Secrets. In the questioning, the "Q" is attorney Bernard Dwork, Stemberg's attorney, and the "A" is Romney. Q: "Thank you. Now, you say that before making the investment in Staples round C you read the statement 'Additionally, this is planned to be Staples final equity offering prior to a public offering of mid 1989.' And you say that you did not - Strike that. You say you read that statement. Let me ask you this, sir. Did you, therefore, as a result of that subscribe to the full amount to which you were entitled to subscribe?" A: "I did not." Q: "And why was that, sir?" A: "Because while I believed that there was a realistic probability that we would achieve that outcome, there was also a realistic probability that we would either lose our money or we would achieve something less than that. And my personal assessment and that of my partners was that the risk that we would not achieve the plan was high enough that we should not subscribe to our full amount." Q: "And you did not subscribe to the full amount?" A: "We did not subscribe to the full amount."</Msg><Username>hikemanymiles</Username><Timestamp>1351197079370</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 16:31:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351198658787-72</Id><Topic><Title>Iceland warns of big earthquake</Title><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1351185482052</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 13:18:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>when?

And, Always use trailing stops. it’s the only way to be safe.</Msg><Username>peterthegreat533</Username><Timestamp>1351211853353</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 20:37:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351211949955-79</Id><Topic><Title>germany pulled its gold out of bank of england!</Title><Username>peterthegreat533</Username><Timestamp>1351198874826</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 17:01:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Oh, and low interest rates are a boon for utilities. with fed rates at zero, I would be buying lots of utilities.</Msg><Username>peterthegreat533</Username><Timestamp>1351211949955</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 20:39:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351212535461-80</Id><Topic><Title>Mitt &amp; Anne made millions from the auto industry bail out he ""condemns"" jeez</Title><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1351185416226</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 13:16:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Mitt graduated from Harvard with two advanced degrees in law and business, attaining these degrees at the same time.

Another blatant revision of the facts to boost Obama's falling approval. The fraud distances himself from the Libya fallout but laps up undeserved credit for an operation that was in the works since 2001. And the most bizarre fact in this is the film maker is a Joo. You can draw only one conclusion from that.</Msg><Username>passthebuckaroo</Username><Timestamp>1351214399467</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 21:19:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351220342451-83</Id><Topic><Title>The only way Mittens can beat Obama is by</Title><Username>whycantphiligetawoman</Username><Timestamp>1351198712942</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 16:58:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I heard a woman complaining that in early voting in Ohio the voting machine kept defaulting to Obama until she put Romney in three times.</Msg><Username>bullwinkle.themoose</Username><Timestamp>1351220342451</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 22:59:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351223497639-84</Id><Title>The Word of the Lord!</Title><Msg>Sirach 10: 1 - 5 10 1 A wise magistrate educates his people, and the rule of an intelligent person is well ordered. 2 As the people’s judge is, so are his officials; as the ruler of the city is, so are all its inhabitants. 3 An undisciplined king ruins his people, but a city becomes fit to live in through the understanding of its rulers. 4 The government of the earth is in the hand of the Lord, and over it he will raise up the right leader for the time. 5 Human success is in the hand of the Lord, and it is he who confers honour upon the lawgiver.* NSRV</Msg><Username>thevoiceofbibleprophecy</Username><Timestamp>1351223497639</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 23:51:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351223739870-85</Id><Title>Obama is Abaddon!
