The list provided includes several known liberals and scientists. However, that is not key as, for those of us who read already know, the lies and data manipulation by M. Mann was discovered by a layman in Canada ( he proved the alleged "hockey stick" lie, thus putting a dagger into the side of the entire Goracle argument on the global warming theory). Also, it was a layman who proved the lie of the hottest year on record in the U.S. And forced NASA to change their previous claim.</Msg><Username>coughingredink</Username><Timestamp>1359213356211</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 10:15:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359213794492-5</Id><Title>American businesses grow a set</Title><Msg>Yes, the corporations of America are making money despite the oppressive Obama regs.

This is a specific theory, now disproved, that all, or the lion's share, of warming was caused by human creation of co2 via the burning of carbon based fuels. The solution was to take the first world back to the 16th century, destroy all their economies, and equalize them with the second and third world. Of course, it was all proven to be built on lies and data manipulation, that the brown cloud and volcanos caused more co2 than man, that oceans release co2, etc., etc., etc. So, they change the buzzword to "climate change", and tried to scare us into thinking hurricanes, tornados, etc., are caused by our SUVs. Now we know both are actually down in occurrence and strength, so they have concentrated almost all activities on the U.N. So, dejerks, perhaps you should do a little research and quit your whinin, lying, and repeating verbatim the talking points of your lefty, goose stepping masters at the Democratic National Party HQs.</Msg><Username>coughingredink</Username><Timestamp>1359216502102</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 11:08:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359216887650-13</Id><Title>Obama Regime Tries To Take Guns From Law Abiding Citizens...
