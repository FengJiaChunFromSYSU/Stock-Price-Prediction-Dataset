Tuesday night, the Hill newspaper quoted a spokesman for Treasury’s inspector general, Russell George, saying the group was asked by Issa “to narrowly focus on tea party organizations.” The inspectors knew there were other terms, but “that was outside the scope of our audit.” Darrell Issa and the overblown scandals By Dana Milbank, Friday, June 28, 11:50 AM This is how a scandal implodes: First, the head of the investigation overpromises. “This was a targeting of the president’s political enemies, effectively, and lies about it during the election year so that it wasn’t discovered until afterwards,” Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), chairman of the House oversight committee, said in May of the IRS targeting scandal. He later declared President Obama’s press secretary a “paid liar” for stating otherwise. Next, facts emerge to undermine the investigator’s presuppositions. Documents released by Ways and Means committee Democrats this week show that the IRS, in addition to targeting tea party groups, also had “Be on the Lookout” (BOLO) lists for groups using descriptors such as “progressive,” “health care legislation,” #$%$,” “paying national debt” and “green energy.” Finally, evidence surfaces that the investigator stacked the deck. Tuesday night, the Hill newspaper quoted a spokesman for Treasury’s inspector general, Russell George, saying the group was asked by Issa “to narrowly focus on tea party organizations.” The inspectors knew there were other terms, but “that was outside the scope of our audit.”</Msg><Username>hydroponicoctopus</Username><Timestamp>1372448234929</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-28 15:37:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372449237193-45</Id><Topic><Title>Issa's overblown scandal implodes and he is shown as the fraud he aways was</Title><Username>hydroponicoctopus</Username><Timestamp>1372448234929</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-28 15:37:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Mesa with a new screen name again.

Jon Stewart practically disowned the president. After a long string of failures, it looked like Issa had finally found something real, even if he was a bit overeager in hyping it. How wrong we were. Now it’s clear Issa played us this whole time, thanks to new documents that show the IRS also targeted “progressive” and “Occupy” groups, in addition to Tea Party ones. And if it targeted groups on both sides, it wasn’t really singling anyone out (the only group actually denied tax-exempt status was a progressive one, after all) and the whole scandal falls apart. It’s not that there were no warning signs. In his zeal to implicate the White House, Issa jumped to conclusions unsupported by evidence. Then he selectively disclosed parts of transcripts that supported his narrative, and threw a fit when Democrats wanted to release the rest, which revealed that the IRS official in charge of the program was a conservative Republican. The whole scandal seemed to be falling apart, and now we know for sure. Did Issa know the IRS targeted progressive groups too? Why didn’t the inspector general’s report mention this critical bit of data? Russell George, Treasury’s IG, told lawmakers that the “inspector general launches audits on topics requested by lawmakers. The targeting audit requested by House Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Darrell Issa specifically requested a review of IRS actions related to conservative groups,” Politico reported yesterday.</Msg><Username>hydroponicoctopus</Username><Timestamp>1372449413863</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-28 15:56:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372450217125-47</Id><Title>Frustrated and failed Issa takes it out on Lois Lerner</Title><Msg>as Issa goes down in flames after a month of going in a circle he arrives back at Lois Lerner and whines about her taking the 5th and that is about all his investigation has accomplished and even that is phony: "an exchange between Chairman Darrell Issa of California and the non-voting representative of the District of Columbia, Eleanor Holmes Norton.
