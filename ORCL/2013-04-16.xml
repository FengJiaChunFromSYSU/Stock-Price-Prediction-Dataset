It had to be pretty powerful. Probably not black powder. Some powerful explosives can be made at home but few know how. Old time safe crackers used to cook up nitroglycerine. Very dangerous. to cook and to use. I've worked with dynamite, C3, primacord and nitro-starch. It also seems that it was set off remotely. I remember when a Phoenix nespaperman, Don Bowles was killed by a remote bomb yearsgo. They traced the device to a toy store in San Diego, "Frank The Trainman.'
