The birth control movement in the United States was a social reform campaign from 1914 to around 1945 that aimed to increase the availability of contraception in the U.S. through education and legalization. The movement began in 1914 when a group of political radicals in New York City, led by Emma Goldman, Mary Dennett, and Margaret Sanger, became concerned about the hardships that childbirth and self-induced abortions brought to low-income women. Information about contraception was considered to be obscene at the time, so the activists targeted the Comstock laws, which prohibited distribution of any "obscene, lewd, and/or lascivious" materials through the mail. Hoping to provoke a favorable legal decision, Sanger deliberately broke the law by distributing The Woman Rebel, a newsletter containing a discussion of contraception. In 1916, Sanger opened the first birth control clinic in the United States, but the clinic was immediately shut down by police, and Sanger was sentenced to 30 days in jail.</Msg><Username>sauerlraut</Username><Timestamp>1373893382575</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 09:03:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>18</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373894277900-13</Id><Topic><Title>Transferring to NYSE : Mondays PPS prediction</Title><Username>garrettklein87</Username><Timestamp>1373744776680</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 15:46:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I expect a bounce of Friday's loss.

He said she was the worst prosecutor he had ever seen in a courtroom adding that he has seen some good and some very bad over his career. He thinks she should be disbarred and the deputy she fired, rehired. I love smaking news like this.
