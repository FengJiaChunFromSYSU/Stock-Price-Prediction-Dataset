Xsigo may look more like Citrix’s Netscaler, given that it is combination of hardware and software, but itcompetes in a different part of the market. Netscaler plays in the higher layers of the networking stack, while Xsigo and Nicera focus on the lower layers. Network architectures are built out of layers with the higher the layer, the more abstract the data: going from physical signals (layer 1) to application communication (layer 7) (see Exhibit 1).VMware’s Nicera operates at layers 2 and 3, which are parts of the media layer and Xsigo operates at layers 1 thru 3. Layers 1 through 3 have historically been the purview of network vendors such as Cisco and Juniper. On the other hand, Citrix’s NetScaler operates higher up at the host layers (Level 4 through 7).</Msg><Username>blackoutbuzz</Username><Timestamp>1343677979000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 15:52:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343678501000-31</Id><Topic><Title>why the gop loves bushcare</Title><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1343661512000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 11:18:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>how much would mccain/palin have blown by now? what would they have done differently?

Without providing specifics about the new leaks, Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich., said the damaging release of sensitive information continues. “We’ve seen more leaks, absolutely,” Rogers told Fox News in an interview Monday. “This is an opportunity for the president to be bold, to take a stand, to step up and say, ‘My administration will cooperate fully and that my staff ... should not and will not participate in coordinated or uncoordinated leaking of classified information for any reason. It's a crime.'" Rogers, following up on criticisms of the leaks made last week by Dianne Feinstein, the Democratic chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Rogers agreed that human intelligence assets had been comprised. “We know that sources have self selected out of cooperation around the world,” Rogers explained. “We know that operations have had to change. We know that operations have had to shut down.” Based on the work by his committee investigators, the congressman joined other Republicans by claiming that the classified information came from a small group of people who have access to the White House. “It is very clear that somebody who had access to the White House situation room, had very senior covert action classified material was responsible for some of these leaks," he said. "That is not a big group of people." On the level of cooperation from the White House, Rogers suggested it was lacking.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1343697242000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 21:14:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343697521000-65</Id><Topic><Title>typical vansniff lie</Title><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1343683595000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 17:26:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I meant in spirit.

Dumbocraps like you are all about choice when it comes to killing unborn babies, so why the initiative to tax Americans and prevent them a reasonable choice.

Romney's Romneycare is the blue print for the ACA. also Gingrich passionately defended the idea of an individual mandate and called it “IMMORAL” for those who can afford to have insurance not to buy it. Mittens STILL says the mandate is the best way to go ,btw: “I’m happy to stand by the things that I believe. I’m not going to change my positions by virtue of being in a presidential campaign,” Romney said. “What we did was right for ... Massachusetts,... and it is fundamentally a conservative principle to insist that people take personal responsibility as opposed to turning to government for giving out free care.”..... You are for the "free" bushcare at the ER.....paid for by the middleclass with higher insurance premiums.</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1343701130000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 22:18:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343703618000-71</Id><Topic><Title>The Secret to Finding today’s Best Stock Picks</Title><Username>robertaarsvold46</Username><Timestamp>1343650308000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 08:11:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Really positive on the reward side,lol </Msg><Username>russmontgomery85</Username><Timestamp>1343703618000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 23:00:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
