Work is Freedom! Hey, stupid! How many times do we have to go over this? An employee's only value to an employer is the profit he can make on the employee's labor. According to marginal income theory an employer will hire new employees until marginal income = marginal costs and net profit is zero. If stupid communist government imposes new regulations or laws or employer give-a-ways then these will change the balance between marginal income and marginal costs. The employer will lay off employees until marginal income = marginal costs again. This is simple basic economics 101 stuff. Even a #$%$ like you should be able to understand it. Printing your stupidity over and over as if it was news merely shows what am imbecile you are.</Msg><Username>bullwinkle.themoose</Username><Timestamp>1358095714519</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-13 11:48:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358095758572-7</Id><Topic><Title>Charles Whitman First of these kinds of shootings that I remember 8/1/1966</Title><Username>ourfirstpantroglodytepresident</Username><Timestamp>1355775289871</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 15:14:49 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And Kent State came after that.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1358095758572</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-13 11:49:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358095877191-8</Id><Topic><Title>is retail worthless, are restaurants worthess,? not a necessary and important part of the economy?</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1358092891678</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-13 11:01:31 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Arbeit macht frei!</Msg><Username>bullwinkle.themoose</Username><Timestamp>1358095877191</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-13 11:51:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358095979649-9</Id><Topic><Title>Rangel: White House’s lack of diversity ‘embarrassing as hell’</Title><Username>ourfirstpantroglodytepresident</Username><Timestamp>1357927773451</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 13:09:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What monkeys like to do most is push buttons.

If we have armed guards in our schools, who will protect our children from nutty or stupid armed guards? Do remember the NYC Police have a case right now of a cop, who passed all his psych tests, who wanted to arrange to capture, rape and eat young women. And think of all the great charitable work Gerry Sandusky did for all those vulnerable little boys at Penn State. And that the College looked the other way for more than a decade! Turning our elementary schools into armed concentration camps is NOT the solution!</Msg><Username>cpeepeefuryerself</Username><Timestamp>1358102400131</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-13 13:40:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358104614485-17</Id><Title>DEMOCRATS ....

Background checks are already the rule and most of these cases the weaons were legally owned by the parents or other family member. Yet parents are ruled out. Guns have a mind of their own!! What is baffling is that these chest beating liberals don't have the same reaction to the instruments used to adminster abortions, 333,000 last year, many government funded thru Planned Parenthood. That many would fill a football stadium half way to the brim. It's not just the gun perps who have mental problems.</Msg><Username>annieshenanigan</Username><Timestamp>1358119893216</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-13 18:31:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358121094303-19</Id><Topic><Title>it's a lie that hitler was for gun controls....a typical righty stupid lie</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1358093610083</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-13 11:13:30 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hitler made it easier for NAZI's (National Socialists) to own guns. In fact, he armed all the NAZI's and even issued them brown uniforms so they became known as the Brown Shirts. He sought to and did disarm everyone who disagreed with him. The gun laws in Germany when Hitler was elected (legally) as chancellor were fashioned such as to arm the NAZI's and disarm everyone else. Hitler was not right wing, he was in fact the leader of the National Socialist party (NAZI party for short) and don't you forget it. He was a ''Progressive''. Hitler was a strong believer in Progressive Socialist principles.</Msg><Username>wiech89</Username><Timestamp>1358121094303</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-13 18:51:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358125214905-20</Id><Title>Colin Powell...
