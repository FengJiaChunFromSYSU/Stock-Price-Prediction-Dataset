Calling themselves “the Pigeons” — French slang loosely translated as “the fall guys” — a group of Internet entrepreneurs took to social networking sites to voice their opposition to the measure within hours of its announcement in last Friday’s 2013 budget. The cause of their ire is the government’s plan to tax capital gains at the same rates as earned income. *** This is the same as Obama's tax plan. Putting extra taxes on 30,000 of the USA's most successful people does not solve the deficit or reduce the debt. Obama's plan is socialist grand standing but really solves nothing.

The thumb of socialist taxation will firmly beat down those who voted for the clown again. How big are those federal tax increases? The respected Tax Policy Center is out with a full analysis of the math, and estimates the impact at more than half a trillion dollars next year alone. About 9 in 10 Americans will see their tax bills go up in 3 months under Obama's plan. Obama has done nothing to stop the fiscal cliff. He's out campaigning and telling lemmings all is well (smile.) The average household would pay $3,500 more. The typical middle-income household would pay $2,000 more. An average household in the top 1 percent would pay $120,000 more. The average federal tax rate would climb a whopping 5 percentage points. Americans would have 6.2 percent less after-tax income. Just what Obama wants. He will veto any changes that a Republican Congress passes. You vill pay!!! Tax increases: The payroll tax holiday goes away, raising taxes on America's 160 million wage earners. New provisions from the Affordable Care Act (aka. Obamacare) bump up taxes on the investment income of high-income households, and the Bush tax cuts for capital gains and dividends expire. The Bush-era income tax cuts end as well, with the top rate climbing to 39.6 percent from 35 percent. Without adjustment, the alternative minimum tax affects millions more taxpayers. Tax credits enacted in the stimulus go away. The estate tax jumps. It goes on and on. The Tax Policy Center's analysis shows that the tax increases would be painful for everyone, rich and poor. The very wealthy would have the biggest hit, with the top 1 percent of earners seeing their average federal tax rate climb by seven percentage points. The single biggest tax increase would be on dividend earnings, with the tax rate increasing by 20 percentage points. And Obama is hiring more IRS agents to get ya!</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1349270883980</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 09:28:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349271157360-15</Id><Topic><Title>Bill Cosby *I'm 83 and Tired!*</Title><Username>ourfirstpantroglodytepresident</Username><Timestamp>1349111440173</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 13:10:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm tired of being told that I have to "spread the wealth" to people who don't have my work ethic.

Obama was an F student at Harvard. He just don't get it. Chapter 1. Taking responsibility when you are in charge People make mistakes. Employees don't meet your expectations. Vendors don't deliver on time. So you blame them for your problems. But you're also to blame. Maybe you didn't provide enough training. Maybe you didn't build in enough of a buffer. Maybe you asked too much, too soon. Taking responsibility when things go wrong instead of blaming others isn't masochistic, it's empowering--because then you focus on doing things better or smarter next time.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1349275202410</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 10:40:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349275298684-43</Id><Topic><Title>Obama signed Taxmaggedon 2013 into law -- here it comes</Title><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1349270883980</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 09:28:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Executive orders signed by the Bummer - 932.

He grew up in Beverly Hills 90210 existence but is just desperate to have this angry black person persona. It's rather like reading about, you know, Hitler's musings on his Germanic identity. You know, he graduated from this fancy, fancy school in Hawaii, voted recently the greenest school in America. And yet when he wants to, he just turns it on and suddenly we got Malcolm X speaking to us. Mark Levin: Well, actually, he and his wife, I mean they really have had better than the quote, unquote middle class lives, haven't they? I mean they've gone to great Ivy League schools, as you point out. They live great lives, people have helped take care of them. Now they live like a king and queen. Coulter: Yes, and still angry. It's all an act. It's like his 70% of Twitter followers being fake. The whole thing is just smoke and mirrors. And at least for people of our generation, I mean this is a large part of why we have more child molesters than racists in America. It just isn't part of our existence. During our entire lifetimes, the only affect of being black is that you get benefits, doors open for you. You are more likely to get a position in the Harvard Law School. Anyone who grew up watching the Brady Bunch -- racism and discrimination, at least discrimination against black people, there is some discrimination against white people -- simply isn't a part of our conceptional apparatus. Which is why it is so strange, of all people, this half-black man born in Hawaii in 1961 walking around like he's Martin Luther King.
