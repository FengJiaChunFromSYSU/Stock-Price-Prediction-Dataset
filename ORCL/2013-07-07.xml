Serrano July 5, 2013, 3:45 p.m. WASHINGTON—A high-powered rifle lost in the ATF’s Fast and Furious controversy was used to kill a Mexican police chief in the state of Jalisco earlier this year, according to internal Department of Justice records, suggesting that weapons from the failed gun-tracking operation have now made it into the hands of violent drug cartels deep inside Mexico. Luis Lucio Rosales Astorga, the police chief in the city of Hostotipaquillo, was shot to death Jan. 29 when gunmen intercepted his patrol car and opened fire. Also killed was one of his bodyguards. His wife and a second bodyguard were wounded.</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1373201604310</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-07 08:53:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373202140805-22</Id><Title>a sperm is not a human being, nor is an egg, nor is the zygote</Title><Msg>so stop you lies about that please... zygote is not a person..... ....it is a clump of dividing cells.... common sense should apply. you do not call an acorn an "oak tree", you do not call a a dozen eggs at the store a "dozen chickens".......... you do not call a chunk of your tissue a human being even though it could POTENTALLY be one with cloning.................... also note that a large number of embryos and fetuses result in miscarriages....millions.. perhaps 10 to 30% of all pregnancies ..........god aborts them?......... "Miscarriage in early pregnancy is common.

But the actual rate of miscarriage is even higher since many women have very early miscarriages without ever realizing that they are pregnant. One study that followed women's hormone levels every day to detect very early pregnancy found a total miscarriage rate of 31%." So, if you already know you're pregnant, your risk of miscarrying before 20 weeks is probably somewhere between 10% and 20%, and the rates of miscarriage are highest in the first trimester (the first 12 weeks)."</Msg><Username>hydroponicoctopus</Username><Timestamp>1373202140805</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-07 09:02:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373203074202-23</Id><Topic><Title>a sperm is not a human being, nor is an egg, nor is the zygote</Title><Username>hydroponicoctopus</Username><Timestamp>1373202140805</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-07 09:02:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>does a clump of cancer cells have a "right" to develop into a full blown metastatic cancer? and since perhaps up to 30% of all pregnancies result in miscarriage should we outlaw pregnancy?

Every year, more than half a million women die in pregnancy or childbirth. Natural evolution, not religion, explains the tough compromises forced on the human body, and why few embryos make it to infancy and so many mothers die in the process. Although the odds of a fertilized egg making it to a live birth are less than 1 in 5, another hazardous journey through infancy lies ahead. Before modern medicine, around 20% of children in England and the United States died before the age of five, and that number was much higher in pre-industrial societies. For most of the existence of our human species, over the past one hundred thousand years or so, probably only around half of all born babies reached the age of five. All these poor odds add up to the fact that for most of human existence there had to be 10 pregnancies or more to guarantee the life of a single five year old child. But that’s because humanity came into existence through natural evolution. And for those who think that God used natural evolution to create us, they need to wake up to the way that God could not be anything like the loving person who believers want to worship. And worship and prayer does nothing to help these terrible odds against life. Only in modern industrialized countries using secular scientific medicine do we see infant mortality rates dramatically reduced. However, it remains generally true that countries with higher rates of religious faith have higher rates of infant mortality. Is that part of God’s plan too?

Then God arranged for a murder scenario involving Aaron Hernandez, the Patriots' starting tight end paving the way for Tebow. See, God knew he created an amazing athletic talent in Tim Tebow and also knew that he had a place somewhere in the NFL where he could evangelize in a very public way. In this case, God also knew that some people on earth are born dirt bags with no redeeming human qualities and therefore expendable, including probably the murder victim.

You keep wanting to look at the itty bitty egg stage and say it is not human. But you ignore that most abortions are of a much later stage, at stages where modern medicine could save a prematurely born baby. Kermitt Gosnell was murdering live babies, not preventing cells from being fertilized.</Msg><Username>wearelegion100000</Username><Timestamp>1373219977136</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-07 13:59:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373220050028-67</Id><Topic><Title>the founders allowed abortion in the colonial states... in a manner similar to roe v wade......</Title><Username>hydroponicoctopus</Username><Timestamp>1373205464865</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-07 09:57:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Preventing a fertilized egg from developoing is called "birth control" in most cases.</Msg><Username>wearelegion100000</Username><Timestamp>1373220050028</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-07 14:00:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373220350760-68</Id><Topic><Title>the founders allowed abortion in the colonial states... in a manner similar to roe v wade......</Title><Username>hydroponicoctopus</Username><Timestamp>1373205464865</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-07 09:57:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>that still does not change the fact that a fertilized egg is not a human being, it is a clump of cells...and as per the founders and roe v wade I think abortion should be legal up to about 20 weeks or so and even later in some circumstances...(why force a woman to bear a fetus that after 20 weeks is discovered to be so damaged that there is zero chance it will live when born? as has often been the case? are you just crazy or what to demand that a woman be forced to bear such a mal-formed thing that it could not live after birth?)</Msg><Username>hydroponicoctopus</Username><Timestamp>1373220350760</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-07 14:05:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373220626819-69</Id><Topic><Title>do miscarried embryos go to heaven?</Title><Username>hydroponicoctopus</Username><Timestamp>1373203321958</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-07 09:22:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>One can make a scientific argument that the sperm &amp; ova become a unique human being at the moment of conception (one unique DNA set is assembled during fertilization.)

US infant mortality rate is heavily affected by the method of counting. An example? Well, a child born in the US that takes a breath then dies is a mortality stat. In almost all other countries, it is not. Sweden, as an example, does not count children who die in the first week as a mortality stat.
