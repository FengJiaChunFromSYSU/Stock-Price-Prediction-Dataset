In April, Marcum, an eighth-grader at Logan Middle School in Logan, W. Va., was arrested when he refused to take off his NRA t-shirt. The New York Daily News reports: The clothing kerfuffle began when Marcum wore a shirt bearing the NRA’s logo and a hunting rifle. As he stood in line in the cafeteria, a teacher ordered him to either change shirts or turn it inside out. Marcum declined and was sent to the office, where an officer was dispatched after he again refused to comply with the school’s request. Cops arrested him and charged him with disrupting the educational process and obstructing an officer. Late last week Marcum “appeared before a judge and was officially charged with obstructing an officer,” reports Fox News. If convicted, he could face up to a $500 fine or a year in prison. He will be back in front of the judge on July 11 if his attorney cannot get the charge dismissed before then. One can understand this sort of silliness across the border in Maryland (as we have chronicled here and here) — but in West Virginia? This is, after all, the state whose senator’s campaign ad featured him shooting Obama’s cap-and-trade bill. Ah, those were the days.</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1371553483036</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-18 07:04:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371553728947-7</Id><Topic><Title>this will mess up Mesa</Title><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1371462533521</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 05:48:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>'NSA should come clean about domestic spying': Ray Kelly By JENNIFER BAIN Last Updated: 6:18 PM, June 17, 2013 Posted: 4:09 PM, June 17, 2013 Police Commissioner Ray Kelly launched a stinging rebuke to the federal government’s secret phone and Internet monitoring campaign — and suggested leaker Edward Snowden was right about privacy “abuse.” “I don’t think it ever should have been made secret,” Kelly said today, breaking ranks with US law-enforcement officials. His blast came days after the Obama administration and Attorney General Eric Holder outraged New York officials by endorsing a federal monitor for the NYPD. Kelly appeared to firmly reject Holder’s claim that disclosure of the monitoring campaign seriously damaged efforts to fight terrorism. William Miller Ray Kelly “I think the American public can accept the fact if you tell them that every time you pick up the phone it’s going to be recorded and it goes to the government,” Kelly said. “I think the public can understand that. I see no reason why that program was placed in the secret category.” “Secondly, I think if you listen to Snowden, he indicates that there’s some sort of malfeasance, people . . . sitting around and watching the data. So I think the question is: What sort of oversight is there inside the [National Security Agency] NSA to prevent that abuse, if it’s taking place?” Kelly has been on the receiving side of this kind of criticism.</Msg><Username>liberals_plague_humanity</Username><Timestamp>1371553728947</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-18 07:08:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371555396209-8</Id><Title>this will mess up Mesa,,, signed seebe</Title><Msg>YOU GUYS ARE HYSTERICAL GRASPING FOR STRAWS!

His political action committee spent almost $83,000 on golf events in 2009, and over the past 18 months he has run up a $67,000 tab at the Ritz-Carlton golf resort in Naples, Florida." and btw Boehner publicly campaigned for Kaptur's opponent, Rich Iott, a lunatic whose weekend hobbies included dressing up in #$%$ costumes in military re-enactments. Iott denied that dressing up in the uniforms of the 5th SS Panzer Division meant that he sympathized with #$%$ politics — but that didn't mean there weren't aspects of the #$%$ regime that he could admire. "I've always been fascinated by the fact that here was a relatively small country that from a strictly military point of view accomplished incredible things," Iott said. Yet Boehner quietly continued to campaign for Iott even after his beaming #$%$ photos were blasted over the national airwaves.</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1371568018935</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-18 11:06:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371571699055-18</Id><Title>We Are There</Title><Msg>The book "1984" described the control methods of one party authoritarianism.

I do know the deviousness of government spy agencies. Certain things set off the alarms and this case is one of those. Lee Harvey Oswald was also such a case. He had a top secret clearance and worked in the radar section at Atsugi, Japan Marine Air Base. He tracked the U-2 spy planes over Russia and China. Suddenly he goes to Russia and returns with a wife who is the daughter of a high ranking KGB Col. He then becomes buddy buddy with a close friend of George H. W. Bush who works for Zapata Petroleum which the Bushes control. I think in time you may learn more of Snowden than is out there now. Only the American people were unaware of the massive spying on them.

Last week's leaks by Aurelia Fedenisn, a former State Department inspector general investigator, shined a light on alleged wrongdoing by U.S. officials around the globe. But her attorney Cary Schulman tells The Cable that Fedenisn has paid a steep price: "They had law enforcement officers camp out in front of her house, harass her children and attempt to incriminate herself." Fedenisn's life changed dramatically last Monday after she handed over documents and statements to CBS News alleging that senior State Department officials "influenced, manipulated, or simply called off" several investigations into misconduct. The suppression of investigations was noted in an early draft of an Inspector General report, but softened in the final version. Erich Hart, general counsel to the Inspector General, did not reply to a request for comment. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said last week that "we hold all employees to the highest standards. We take allegations of misconduct seriously and we investigate thoroughly." She also announced that the department would request additional review by outside law enforcement officers on OIG inspection processes.</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1371581537964</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-18 14:52:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371586098491-32</Id><Topic><Title>GOP reps on Congressional junket got drunk and skinny-dipped in the Sea of Galilee</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1371562358902</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-18 09:32:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>UR the hypocrite.

One husband and wife, while testifying, said they spent $180,000 of their own money after not being granted a 501 c. They were individually visited or their family business was visited by four-five different govt agencies. It cost them that much in attorney fees but these govt entities found nothing wrong in their family or business dealings. You libidiots need to read history, like what happened in the 30's Germany or in Russia in 1917.</Msg><Username>vanzinf</Username><Timestamp>1371587914480</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-18 16:38:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371588387572-34</Id><Title>Rioting in Brazil</Title><Msg>Just a precursor of what is coming to America. All the slovenly have nots dependent on the haves will have more difficult times in the future. As the haves nots want more and more, the haves will resent this redistribution and will end up giving less to the have nots. The have nots, who think the haves just happened to be lucky and not really worked years for their wealth, then will think they are entitled to more of the haves wealth, and when it doesn't happen, will resent it and riot. For all you conservative haves, get your guns and cling to your religion like the Bummer said.</Msg><Username>vanzinf</Username><Timestamp>1371588387572</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-18 16:46:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371590551649-35</Id><Title>corporate profits strong, inflation low, economy strengthening, taxes low. no wonder bagsnpubs are whining about bengayhzi bs</Title><Msg>such losers.........................ha ha ha.................</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1371590551649</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-18 17:22:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371593899483-36</Id><Topic><Title>corporate profits strong, inflation low, economy strengthening, taxes low. no wonder bagsnpubs are whining about bengayhzi bs</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1371590551649</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-18 17:22:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>such losers.........................ha ha ha.................

He ripped the Pres for the continuation of the drone program saying it was an act of terror. This from the far left liberal goon who carried out a series of bombings on government buildings in the 60s. Obama has even managed to split the Dems.
