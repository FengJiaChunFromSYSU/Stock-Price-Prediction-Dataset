Who wants to talk about this stock? Here's everything you need to know: the price goes up or down or stays about the same and then the CEO sells a bunch of his shares and muddles the price for awhile.

That's what happened last month when Jennifer Vasilakos guided Ty Warner when he stopped and asked for driving directions in Santa Barbara, Calif. While Warner didn't know exactly how to get to where he was going, Vasilakos didn't realize who she was helping. Warner is the billionaire founder of Ty Inc., the Beanie Baby company. Vasilakos was at the intersection trying to raise $20,000 for a stem cell procedure she needs to help save her life because she suffers from kidney failure and does not qualify for a transplant. She describes their encounter in her blog: I often get asked by random strangers for directions. Not one to miss an opportunity, I handed him my flyer and he made a fifty dollar donation. As he drove off, I thought that was the end of our encounter... He'd returned after an hour or so. Rolling down his window, he reached out his hand and introduced himself. I immediately recognized his name. He was kind and sincere as he looked directly into my eyes... I listened as he repeated over and over that he was going to help me. That my fundraising was done. That I didn't need to worry any longer. He said he would send a check after he returned to his offices during the week. He was true to his word. Vasilakos, an herbalist and Reiki teacher, received a package on July 16 with a $20,000 check and with a handwritten note from Warner. The note read in part, "Someone up there loves you because I was guided to meet you Saturday. I never lose my way, but fate had me lost and ask you for directions. The rest of the story I hope will be a wonderful new life for you!" Obama won't even give his own brother a hand... not even a little finger! He is a total FRAUD!!</Msg><Username>corpusamericana</Username><Timestamp>1345907834000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 11:17:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345908172000-14</Id><Topic><Title>A New Winning Strategy for Obama 2012!</Title><Username>ourfirstpantroglodytepresident</Username><Timestamp>1345750572000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 15:36:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I saw a post yesterday that our troops are safer in Afghanistan than they would be in Chicago!

Nelson, D-Tallahassee, said about 75 senators got that news during a classified briefing before last October's congressional vote authorizing the use of force to remove Saddam Hussein from power. Nelson voted in favor of using military force. Nelson said the senators were told Iraq had both biological and chemical weapons, notably anthrax, and it could deliver them to cities along the Eastern seaboard via unmanned aerial vehicles, commonly known as drones.

He is the most mendacious political figure I have ever witnessed. Even by the low standards of his presidential predecessors, his narcissistic, contumacious arrogance is unequalled. Using Obama as the bar, Nero would have to be elevated to sainthood ... Many in America wanted to be proud when the first person of color was elected president, but instead, they have been witness to a congenital liar, a woman who has been ashamed of America her entire life, failed policies, intimidation, and a commonality hitherto not witnessed in political leaders. He and his wife view their life at our expense as an entitlement - while America's people go homeless, hungry and unemployed." Mychal Massie is a respected writer and talk show host in Los Angeles.

In one gargantuan move, Obama could blow it all out, by presenting Hillary Clinton as his VP. Obama can dispatch Joe Biden to happily serve as secretary of State, a job Biden reportedly has coveted. The Big Switch would rivet every corner of the nation, from the skeptical bookmakers in Las Vegas, to Florida’s Bingo blue hairs, to the drought-weary corn growers of Iowa. This play that would make history, all over again. An Obama/Clinton ticket would, among other things: * Provide the president a huge convention bounce, generate gobs of free media, thus leveling the Republicans’ SuperPAC-fueled advertising advantage. * Bring home disenchanted liberal and independent female voters who wanted a Hillary Clinton presidency in 2008, and remind recession-weary Democratic voters of the golden Clinton years. Lately, Joe Biden seems to have chains on his mind. Obama can liberate Mr. Loose Lips from his vice-presidential shackles and declare victory.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1345945399000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 21:43:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345945984000-96</Id><Topic><Title>Sandra Fluke Agrees to be Legitimately Pimped for Obama</Title><Username>travisthechimp.obama</Username><Timestamp>1345936795000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 19:19:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And his sister-in-law is black.
