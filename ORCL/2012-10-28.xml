No Republican interpreters were present, according to these volunteers. While it’s not unusual for get-out-the-vote groups to help voters get to the polls, the volunteers who talked to Human Events observed a number of troubling and questionable activities. A source, who wishes to remain anonymous, is a volunteer outside the Morse Road polling center. She has witnessed Somalis who cannot speak English come to the polling center. They are brought in groups, by van or bus. The Democrats hand them a slate card and say, “vote Brown all the way down.” Given that Sherrod Brown is the incumbent Democrat Senator in Ohio, one can assume that this is the reference. Non-English speaking voters may use an interpreter. The interpreters are permitted by law to interpret for the individual voting; however, they are forbidden from influencing their vote in any way. Another source who also wishes to remain anonymous has seen Democrat interpreters show the non-English speaking Somalis how to vote the Democrat slate that they were handed outside. According to this second source, there are not any Republican Somali interpreters available. The logical follow-up question is whether a non-English speaking person is an American citizen. Although Republican leadership in Ohio passed a voting reform law, it was repealed by the legislature itself after the Democrats threatened a referendum. According to the Ohio Secretary of State’s web site, someone wanting to vote early in Ohio must supply one of the following in writing on the absentee ballot form, whether voting early by mail or in person: an Ohio driver’s license number; the last four digits of the social security number; or a copy of a current and valid photo identification, military identification, or a current — within the last 12 months — utility bill, including cell phone bill, bank statement, government check, paycheck, or other government document that shows the person’s name and address in addition to the voter registration acknowledgement. The voter is not required to show the driver’s license or social security card, but must merely write it on the absentee ballot request form. While the individual would be required to show a utility bill, bank statement or other printed document if he or she chooses that option, this is in lieu of writing the driver’s license or social security number. Therefore, the information cannot be checked against the Bureau of Motor Vehicles or other state databases. Essentially, a person is asked to check a box stating that they are a citizen, and the poll worker is to trust that they are the person who is listed on the item being shown or the information being written. In other words, someone can be an illegal resident of the state of Ohio and the United States, get an apartment, turn on the heat, bring in the Columbia Gas bill, register to vote by the deadline, and vote by showing that same bill. There is then no verification that this individual is a citizen of the United States. Matt McClellan, the press secretary for Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted, explained, “There is a process to challenge a voter’s eligibility. The point in time for a challenge to be brought ended mid October. A poll worker could challenge a voter if they had questions as to whether or not a voter was registered or eligible to vote.” However, if the poll worker does not raise the issue at the time the voting occurs, that person’s vote will otherwise be counted on election day along with everyone else’s vote. McClellan was not aware of any reports of irregularities at the Morse Road voting place in Franklin County. Two phone calls and a text message to the Public Information Office at the Franklin County Board of Elections were not returned. According to the Somali Community Association of Ohio’s web site, over 45,000 Somalis live in Ohio. Only 40 percent have become citizens of the United States, and only 25 percent speak English well enough to get a job. The second source mentioned has seen voter intimidation at this same voting place. A Mitt Romney bus stopped near the voting center, approximately 30 Democrats who were outside handing out the slate cards rushed over to the bus. They yelled at the bus, and swarmed around its door when anyone attempted to exit the bus. This, from the “tolerant left.” All elements of this story are still developing and will be updated as new information is uncovered. Stay tuned.</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1351428620540</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 08:50:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351428674329-7</Id><Topic><Title>Poll: Majority harbor prejudice against blacks</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1351342328750</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 08:52:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Church sign defaced with anti-Romney message Updated: Saturday, 27 Oct 2012, 8:51 AM EDT Published : Saturday, 27 Oct 2012, 5:03 AM EDT Staff Reports HUNTINGTON, Ind. (WANE) - A viewer used Report !t to send our sister station WANE pictures of the sign in front of the South Broadway Church of Christ in Huntington on Friday. One side of the sign read “Christ voted Democrat” and the other read “Romney hates women”. Luke Jackson, the pastor of the church, said the statements on the sign were vandalism and that the authorities had been contacted. "I had about eight missed calls from church members and people from the community," Jackson said. He said the sign must have been changed late Thursday night, but not by anyone associated with the church. The sign was still up Friday morning, but Jackson said an elder with the church came in and changed it. Jackson said the person responsible used letters that were already on the marquee, and stole the remanding letters that were used Thursday. "One community member in particular had said, 'I don't believe a church should be promoting anything like that in a political way,' and I agreed 100 percent," he said. On one part of the sign, it says "Jesus said forgive". Jackson said that's in reference to he and the church forgiving the person responsible for changing the sign. "I would like for them to come and visit us on Sunday, we'll love to have them," said Jackson.</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1351428674329</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 08:51:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351431237411-8</Id><Title>Benghazi is crowning blow again O</Title><Msg>If Obama had acted in a way Americans expect the Commander-in-Chief to act in such a situation as Benghazi, he'd be a hero.

Sources said that former President Bill Clinton has been “urging” his wife Hillary to release official State Department documents that prove she called for additional security at the compound in Libya, which would almost certainly result in President Obama losing the election. Everyone knew what was happening in Benghazi from the CIA to the National Security Agency and that there’s intelligence cables that have not been released. Wilkow asked, “If everybody knew this including the White House, who would have given the order to go in and save the ambassador?” “The President…he should have given the order to use the rapid reaction force…” “Not Petraeus?” “Well it has to come from the president.” Obama did not pick up the 3 AM call. Valerie Jarrett who is the Senior Advisor to Obama and Assistant to the President for Public Engagement and Intergovernmental Affairs is being questioned for her role in this cover-up.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1351437265319</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 11:14:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351439106076-16</Id><Topic><Title>sweaty shifty weasely Mitt sweating more now that he trailing Obama 4% in Ohio</Title><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1351432476304</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 09:54:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Bet you don't know who's in charge of tabulating votes in Ohio.

They write: Much of what beset America during Obama’s first term lay outside his direct control. The bobsled slide into recession was in full motion when he took office. The economic calamity has been global; recovery, sporadic and weak. Obama’s attempts to reach across the aisle politically were met with unbending resistance, even belligerence… Not impressed with Romney’s ever-changing domestic policies or his inability to reign in the extreme elements of his party (Ohio is very aware of Ryan et al’s obstruction to Speaker Boehner’s deficit and debt deals), it’s Romney’s blustering, swaggering foreign policy that raises even more alarms: Romney’s tendency to bluster on foreign policy provides more cause for doubt. With tens of thousands of young Americans still in harm’s way in Afghanistan, the United States cannot afford to be drawn into new wars without clear national interests at stake or to sap its resources in further open-ended conflicts. The Benghazi killings reveal the risks of an “Arab Spring” in which terrorists have gained new weaponry and new freedom to operate. But these challenges require inventive diplomacy and international engagement, not slogans or swagger. On the auto bailout, they praise Obama’s auto rescue plan and explain the differences between what Romney advocated for and what Obama did, saying Obama’s plan was gutsy as it was unpopular at the time – and it worked: Public opinion opposed another bailout. Romney urged the companies to file for traditional bankruptcy — at a time when private-sector credit was frozen even for healthy firms. Obama told the companies to restructure using the Bankruptcy Court and set conditions for government financing: GM’s chairman had to go. Excess plants and dealerships had to close. Chrysler had to be bought out by Fiat. Contracts had to be renegotiated… It was unpopular but gutsy. And it worked. That’s leadership that deserves a chance to finish the job. Re-elect President Obama. Newspaper endorsements might not seem important in the larger context of an election, but they can have an important impact locally, where they are viewed as a trusted source of information. This is just one of many endorsements flooding in for the President this week, and they’ve all been thoughtful, important reads in the sense that they provide an overview of how newspaper editors, who follow politics closely, view the actions of our elected officials. Editorial endorsements offer us a chance at the big picture, instead of the 24 hour cable news cycle race. For this reason alone, it’s worth noting how many of them mention the President’s calm, steady leadership, the obstructionism of the Republican Congress (specifically the House where Ryan resides), the unnerving changes of Mitt Romney’s positions on domestic issues and his damaging swagger on foreign policy. Another swing state paper has endorsed Obama, and they did it by explaining the auto rescue in a way that debunks Romney’s talking points. This isn’t good news for the Romney campaign."</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1351460937369</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 17:48:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351461217350-53</Id><Topic><Title>Given What We Now Know Of The Benghazi Debacle...</Title><Username>ivleeg_garbage</Username><Timestamp>1351455895913</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 16:24:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Pigshyt!!</Msg><Username>ivleeg_garbage</Username><Timestamp>1351461217350</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 17:53:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351462143166-54</Id><Title>AP analysis: Advantage Obama in hunt for 270 electoral votes</Title><Msg>AP analysis: Advantage Obama in hunt for 270 electoral votes ========== F the popular vote.repubs said that doesn't matter.</Msg><Username>dropkickpubs4321</Username><Timestamp>1351462143166</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 18:09:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351466522401-55</Id><Title>the children</Title><Msg>no surprise at this: A new video from the founders of a celebrated advertising agency features children “of the future” singing about the aftermath of a Mitt Romney presidency: A world where sick people are required to “just die,” the atmosphere is “frying,” gays can be “fixed” and “oil fills the sea.” The children, who stare blankly at the camera throughout the video, even take pains to explicitly mention that they blame “mom and dad” for all those horrors.

The influential paper, Iowa's largest, backed President Obama in 2008, and had not endorsed a Republican candidate since 1972. The editorial focuses primarily on the two candidates' competing economic visions. It criticized Obama's desire for more federal spending, and charged that "the president’s best efforts to resuscitate the stumbling economy have fallen short."

It's definitely doable but not for an inexperienced blowhard who has never run a gubment, who blames everyone but himself for everything and can't work with Congress. Clearly, Obama is a post turtle who was not ready to be President. He should have done the honorable thing -- resign. That said, a 2008 paper by two economists from Brown University suggests newspaper endorsements can in fact change voters’ minds. If a liberal paper endorses a liberal candidate, no substantial change is registered. The paper’s readership, is, after all, liberal. A moderate paper, on the other hand, has more credibility among voters. With that in mind, two newspaper endorsements in particular could prove unusually important this election. According to the American Presidency Project at the University of California-Santa Barbara, already seven of the country’s top 100 newspapers have flipped from Obama in 2008 to Romney this year, and one from McCain to Obama. Many haven’t released endorsements yet!!! Obama suk.
