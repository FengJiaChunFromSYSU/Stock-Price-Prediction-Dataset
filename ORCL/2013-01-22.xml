The intent is not limited to the military, but to a tyrannical government en masse. Try preaching your weak lines to the folks in Syria, tiananmen square, Egypt, etc. As Burke said, "All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing". In your case, it is a weak man preaching nothing can ever be done and encouraging others to be as defeatist as you. In other words, you are part of the problem.</Msg><Username>coughingredink</Username><Timestamp>1358876936727</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 12:48:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358877354308-13</Id><Title>Inauguration speeches - More free stuff for everyone!!!!</Title><Msg>BO was crystal clear that he has no intention of letting debt or deficits, a non-working workforce, or lagging economic growth slow his plans for activist, expansive government.
