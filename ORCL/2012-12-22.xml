I found out later from a retired Army Col. that fought in No. Africa and spent 18 mos. in a POW camp in Poland. Truman, a product of the Pendergast gang in Kansas City, was pulling his punches and dragging the war out. He canned McArthur for trying to end that fiasco. That war and all since have been illegal undeclared wars created to put us into unpayable debt and make money for such as Brown and Root which became part of Halliburton. I opposed the "Nam thing but wouldn't tolerate the swine in the streets with their Viet Cong flags and slogans supporting the ones killing my fellow citizens. Sadly, too many of "Boobus Americanus" support the criminals that run this country when they wave a flag around. Most of what they say is a lie and many times they use "False Flag" operations to fool people into accepting their criminal acts. This includes BOTH Dems. and Reps.</Msg><Username>lewcor</Username><Timestamp>1356188785128</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-22 10:06:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356188972749-3</Id><Topic><Title>My brother just bought ar15, he's an Obama voter twice.

Guarenteed to be more effective than some law the libs are itching to pass. There is zero evidence that such laws work because the bad guys will alwsy find a gun.

You can't. Re Newtowne, perhaps an armed person would not have prevented all the deaths, just most of them. And there is evidence that backs me up. Like when Lanza heard the sirens of law enforcement coming his next act was to kill himself. 2 weeks ago in Oregon, the shooter saw the weapon of a man carrying coming toward him. The shooter's next act was to kill himself.</Msg><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1356194996962</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-22 11:49:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356195474409-7</Id><Topic><Title>loony nra says put armed minimum wage guards in schools</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1356192526148</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-22 11:08:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>didn't miss it at all.

Here's a synopsis: More Guns, Less Crime is a book by John Lott that says violent crime rates go down when states pass "shall issue" concealed carry laws. He presents the results of his statistical analysis of crime data for every county in the United States during 29 years from 1977 to 2005. The book examines city, county and state level data from the entire United States and measures the impact of 11 different types of gun control laws on crime rates. The book expands on an earlier study published in 1997 by Lott and his co-author David Mustard in The Journal of Legal Studies.[1] Lott also examines the effects of gun control laws, including the Brady Law. You ought to acknowledge the work of this author. But you'll blow it off while quickly citing some news network study.</Msg><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1356196563576</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-22 12:16:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356196745571-11</Id><Topic><Title>loony nra says put armed minimum wage guards in schools</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1356192526148</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-22 11:08:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's a book written by John Lott.
