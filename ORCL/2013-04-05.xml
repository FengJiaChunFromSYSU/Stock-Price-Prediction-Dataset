The SIMPLE truth is that the total taxes paid by the top has doubled, and the number of people that make up the top has more than doubled. The major diff from 1980 to now is the lack of ANY total fed income taxes paid by the bottom 49%. As far as unearned income, you are fooling yourself if you refer to the hedge fund practice of carried interest as it is not that big and, hopefully, will be changed. If you refer to normal dividends, interest, and cap gains, then younger a simpleton. Capital is needed to carry capitalism, and punishing said ALREADY TAXED monies again at higher rates is idiotic. Also, for a nation with a dismal savings rate (thus helping drive the fear of politicians to effect any changes to entitlements such as social security as we don't save enough for retirement), adding more disincentive to save would pile on the level of idiocy. As for cap gains, Pres. Clinton had a very strong understanding of exactly what cap gains are and how decreasing taxes on them drove MORE revenues to the treasury. This is evidenced by A) his decision to cut cap gain rates, and B) the resulting windfall to the treasury. I would like to say I am shocked by your lack of understanding of both history and tax-and-effect scenarios, but I am not given your I intellectual dwarf status!</Msg><Username>siriusf8</Username><Timestamp>1365134523135</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 00:02:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365134668609-2</Id><Topic><Title>Reagan added about $200 bil a year, Obama is adding about $1.2 TRILLION a year</Title><Username>gr8mkt</Username><Timestamp>1365087474686</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 10:57:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>S of course your answer is to keep in the guy, and those who actively support his policies, that built up the greatest debt in history and continues to do so?

Therefore can be taxed more? Let's say we raise tax on dividends and capital gains, then what are people with savings going to do? Keep it in cash? Because they prefer not earn anything than give slightly more of it to the government? What you are saying is plain absurd. As far as saving rates, this is a nation that is bent on discouraging saving. Every policy is twisted to discourage saving, and particularly the monetary policy. If you wanted to encourage saving you could easily without giving special rights to people who earn money this way rather than that way. And the truth is what they really encourage is speculation, not investments. That's why we had a housing bubble.

Unlike the U.S. , many countries demand local content and many (see Canada on drugs, as an example) require negative margin pricing and others demand direct " access " to base technologies!

As Einstein intimated, compound interest is the most powerful force in the universe. Your example lacks realistic merit as that is how reinvested stock dividends currently work, yet ZOWIE! Not everyone has a fortune, and every penny has not been sucked out of the economy. One reason, among many, is that your poor example assumes people would be happy with, in your example, a 5% return. If anything is clear in this  world, it is that investors will almost always flock to a little more risk (sometimes a lot) to chase  returns better than the next guy and better than basic interest. There will always be the dream of getting rich, quick, via equities. The result, a simp,e fact of history, is that most will end up on the garbage heap of failed investors, Your dismal tale is neither cautionary nor apocalyptic, just dismal and droll (and more than a tad condescending).</Msg><Username>siriusf8</Username><Timestamp>1365219127412</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 23:32:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
