It's because the only way that new credit and money can be pumped into the system is to go further into debt to the usurors that run the "Fed" and the country. It's a huge Ponzi swindle where debt is monetized but the money to pay the vigorish IS NOT created. Any grade school kid can tell you what that causes. An ever increasing debt load. ALL the crooked politicians know this and go along with it except the phony opposition some put out.

The GOP trusted him and offered concessions in return that led to progress. Obama is ultra-left and unwilling to compromise... in fact, he's proposing MORE spending when he should be offering spending cuts to counter the GOP's offer to raise $800 billion in taxes on the rich. There's NO QUESTION that the GOP would sign off on $1.4 trillion in added taxes on the rich if Obama would correspondingly offer more spending cuts... ... but he's newly elected and never has to face the voters again so he's gone fringe-left and won't compromise on ANYTHING. Even in 2011... no deal... just a fiscal cliff... and a Senate that hasn't passed a budget in years. Clinton balanced the budget... Obama has virtually stopped government COMPLETELY. Without question... Obama and George W Bush are the absolute WORST 16 years of leadership in american history... ... without question.

So, given where we are now, nothing is HAPPENING... there is no leadership, either right now or in 2011 when things first broke down and the "fiscal cliff" was created to kick the can down the road. It's good that the GOP came out of the election offering Obama what Obama wanted in 2011... $800 billion in new taxes on the wealthy... and that's on the table right now... ... but Obama Refuses to offer any spending cuts... in fact, he demanded $400 billion in NEW spending for crying out loud. If obama would simply move from the "far left" to the "left"... then he could probably get something done... but he simply has no leadership skills... he can't work with anybody with his "my way or the highway" attitude. It's snobbish, and it's elitist, and it's NOTHING like folksy Bill Clinton and his ability to work with all who are involved. Bill Clinton accomplished great things... Obama has accomplished NOTHING except for ramming a huge new entitlement down america's throat without a single republican vote. Obama's record speaks for itself... no deal this year or last, huge deficits, and a Senate that hasn't passed a budget it several years...... .... the Obama America is stalled and broken.
