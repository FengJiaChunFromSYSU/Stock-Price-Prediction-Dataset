I think the bombing was because of the Lockerbie incident. The man the British arrested for that event never confessed and there were many that doubted he was involved. "False Flag" event? Quite possibly. But, this tyime around our pilots were used to kill many innocent civilians as in Iraq. What has taken Kaddafi's place is much worse. Those responsible deserve just what "our?" ambassador got. They played him up as a "hero" for going in and helping Muslim fanatics overthrow Kaddafi and murder many innocents. This same thing occurred in Egypt and they are attempting it in Syria.

Obama Admin is subsidizing GM who is building factories in China, that are part owned by the Chinese Gov and subsidized by them to build autos for the Chinese consumers. Somehow this is supposed to magically protect American jobs. Now Obama complains to the World Trade Organization (WTO) because the Chiense Gov is subsidizing auto parts manufactures...like GM...

The Libyan attack was prepared in advance. And just happened to occur (by total coincidence, I am sure) on our 11th Memorial of September 11, 2001. There are indications the Obama Admin was advised in advance that evil was afoot. Maybe Obama never attended his important security meetings. Word is he only pays attention to 45% of them anyway. I heard that the 14 minute video was posted on YouTube for several months and nobody knew about it or took offense until a newspaper of the Muslim Brotherhood made a fuss about it a few days ago. I am also advised that the only real offense is that it is such a poor quality production as to be an artistic affront. It is being used as an excuse, by the Muslim Brotherhood, to attack America &amp; Israel, and to commit mayhem and murder. And there is that quiet link to 9/11/2001.</Msg><Username>ourfirstpantroglodytepresident</Username><Timestamp>1347938983696</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 23:29:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347939693572-39</Id><Topic><Title>Sothe moviemaker is responsible?</Title><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1347924363333</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 19:26:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>..have so many American &amp; Israeli flags handy to burn? I am sure it is a TOTAL coincidence! Not in any way planned in advance! They just happened to have hundreds and thousands of those flags handy for a "spontaneous" demonstration of hate during our 11th Memorial of Sept 11, 2001. It's all because of that stupid 14 minute video. BAD video maker! BAD BOY! NAUGHTY! NAUGHTY! Video maker! And just WHAT does that video have to do with AMERICA or our embassies and consulates is all a "coincidence" too! I am sure.
