And the Pigshyt Democrat Press continues to kiss their azzs! CAIRO (AP) — An Egyptian court on Saturday confirmed the death sentences against 21 people for taking part in a deadly soccer riot but acquitted seven police officials for their alleged role in the violence. Suspected fans enraged by the verdict torched the soccer federation headquarters and a police club in Cairo in protest. The trial over the melee that killed 74 people after a soccer game in the city of Port Said in early 2012 has been the source of some of the worst unrest to hit Egypt in recent weeks. After the court sentenced the 21 people — most of them Port Said fans — to death in late January, violent riots erupted in the city that left some 40 people dead, most of them shot by police. On Saturday, the court announced its verdict for the other 52 defendants in the case, sentencing 45 of them to prison, including two senior police officers who got 15 years terms each. Twenty-eight people were acquitted, including seven police officials. As expected, the court's decision failed to defuse tensions over the case, which has taken on political undercurrents at a time when the entire nation is mired in political turmoil, a worsening economy and growing opposition to the rule of Islamist President Mohammed Morsi.</Msg><Username>itsthepress_stupid</Username><Timestamp>1362838409061</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-09 09:13:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362838495055-12</Id><Title>Is Social Security a good deal?</Title><Msg>Is Social Security a good deal?

That is a canard. Many want to change it for future users, and limit it to those who paid in (ie no immigrants moving here at age 59 and getting full benes). Most changes I have read involve slowly ratcheting up the retirement age (remember when it was first put it into place, the expected lifespan was about 5 years after entering SS), changing the cola adjustment (it was insane to include wage increases in the first place), and a means testing for the wealthier of society. All good things, especially since our economy is basically in ruins, our debt it too high by several trillion, and the Chinese, Japanese, and Brits are currently funding large portions of our debt. However, for those of you are Keynesians, I imagine this is all right up your alley.</Msg><Username>cykdelic</Username><Timestamp>1362871261775</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-09 18:21:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362871318370-28</Id><Topic><Title>More of Pelosi's Crank Yanking</Title><Username>annieshenanigan</Username><Timestamp>1362852796817</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-09 13:13:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>She is the most dangerous person in America.</Msg><Username>siriusf8</Username><Timestamp>1362871318370</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-09 18:21:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362873120998-29</Id><Topic><Title>Is Social Security a good deal?</Title><Username>granniefritz</Username><Timestamp>1362838495055</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-09 09:14:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Most people think so.
