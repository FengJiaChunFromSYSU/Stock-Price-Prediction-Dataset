Debt-To-GDP Nonsense The latest fad in Washington economic policy debates is arguing over the level at which the government should stabilise the debt-to-GDP ratio. The doves are okay with a debt-to-GDP ratio of 73 percent or even 76 percent. The hawks want 60 percent or even less. This is the most fun since the same crew was debating over the year when we would pay off the national debt back in 2000. The good times just keep coming. If you think that this is an incredibly silly debate and that our leading policymakers don't have a clue about how the economy works, you've got the picture right. Remember, these are people who could not see the $8 trillion housing bubble whose collapse wrecked the economy. They haven't learned much economics in the last five years. The argument over the debt-to-GDP ratio is especially annoying because it shows that these people don't have the faintest clue what they are talking about. There are all sorts of obvious reasons why debt is not a good measure of the burden that we are placing on future taxpayers. For example, the government has a huge amount of assets that it could sell at any time and thereby reduce its debt. The Institute for Energy Research, an industry-funded research outfit, claims the government owns more than $120 trillion in energy resources. Let's say they exaggerated by a factor of 10, leaving us $12 trillion in assets. If we sold off half of these resources, it would net the government $6 trillion. This would reduce our debt by almost 40 percentage points of GDP. That should make even the most ardent deficit hawk happy........

Oh well. the fact is: Debt, Deficits, and Demographics: Why We Can Afford the Social Contract November 2012, Dean Baker The emphasis on budget deficits in national policy debates over the last three decades has badly distorted national priorities. There has been an enormous amount of fundamentally confused thinking on budget deficits that has made its way into mainstream political debates. This paper shows that the potential harm from budget deficits has been seriously misrepresented and it is implausible that future generations of workers will see a decline in living standards due to the effects of an aging population. It also shows that the long-term deficit horror stories that appear frequently in public discussions are driven almost entirely by projections of exploding health care costs.

Remember that time that Texas lawmakers cut $73 million of family planning funding and thought that wouldn't have an effect on the overall birth rate in the Lone Star state? As it turns out, proving fewer alternatives to having babies means... that there will be more donut holes. I mean, paper clips. Wait, no, I mean babies. More babies. The Health and Human Services commission is now projecting that over 20,000 unplanned births are on the horizon for women in poverty on Medicaid, at a $237 million cost to taxpayers. Although the Texas Women's Health Program admittedly boasts an entertainingly tacky old-school Sweet Valley High-cover-style logo, Republican lawmakers have finally decided that its inadequacies will cost them more than the benefits of "defrauding the abortion industry."</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1363033811405</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 16:30:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363034320218-44</Id><Topic><Title>Oracle Corporation on MAD MONEY TODAY!!</Title><Username>efrain.mercer</Username><Timestamp>1362394647203</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 05:57:27 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>awesome</Msg><Username>kevinking935</Username><Timestamp>1363034320218</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 16:38:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363035741970-45</Id><Topic><Title>Panicked Texas Republicans May Throw $100 Million Back At Women's Health</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1363033811405</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 16:30:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Michelle Obama Entertains Senate Hopeful Ashley Judd, Now Playing the First Lady in a New Movie Ashley.Judd1 03/10/13 8:38pm admin 7 Past Oscar nominee and movie star Angela Bassett just had lunch with First Lady Michelle Obama. In her new movie, “Olympus Has Fallen,” Bassett plays the tough head of the Secret Service. (Only in a movie could a woman have such a job.) In real life, Bassett was a surrogate (meaning, an active supporter) last year for President Obama. Guests at the luncheon, she said, included other “surrogates” ( active supporters), including make up artist Bobbi Brown, Phylicia Rashad, Cynthia Nixon and Ashley Judd, Bassett told our PAULA SCHWARTZ. “The First Lady sat between me and Ashley Judd, running potentially for Congress,” Bassett said. Judd plays the First Lady– and since our interview declared her intention to run for the US Senate, from Kentucky, as a Democrat. (Gerard Butler is the president and the star of the film.) Bassett told Mrs. Obama that she and Ashley Judd, are in a movie together — “and it’s about the White House. We started talking about females in the secret service agency.” The First Lady told Bassett and Judd about the Secret service women who protect her and the girls and how they joke around.. So did Bassett tell the First Lady the movie was about terrorists taking down the president and his family? “Oh no, I didn’t tell her about that part,” she laughed.</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1363035741970</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 17:02:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363036350878-46</Id><Topic><Title>Panicked Texas Republicans May Throw $100 Million Back At Women's Health</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1363033811405</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 16:30:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>After a safari weekend, Laura Bush stepped out of a dusty SUV with her twin daughters ...The first lady’s whirl through South Africa, Tanzania and Rwanda Mrs. Bush and her 23-year-old daughters, Barbara and Jenna, spent the weekend at the Madikwe Game Reserve on the South African-Botswana border…. A recently-released videotape shows Bush failed to respond to urgent warnings about Hurricane Katrina. The Washington Post describes the scene: “Bush was dialed into the conference Sunday at noon Eastern time from a meeting room at his ranch in Crawford.” Though President Bush has famously spent a great deal of his presidency vacationing at his ranch in Crawford, the White House has always maintained that he is not distracted when he is down there The New York Times noted that Laura Bush took a vacation every year of her husband’s presidency, with Secret Service agents and a government plane. Also, Media Matters calculated the cost of President Bush’s frequent trips to his ranch in Crawford, TX, Camp David, and the family compound in Kennebunkport — he took more vacation time than any president — and put the tab at $20 million for air travel only.</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1363036350878</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 17:12:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363037135555-47</Id><Topic><Title>Panicked Texas Republicans May Throw $100 Million Back At Women's Health</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1363033811405</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 16:30:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Black House shut down for visitors.

There has been an enormous amount of fundamentally confused thinking on budget deficits that has made its way into mainstream political debates. This paper shows that the potential harm from budget deficits has been seriously misrepresented and it is implausible that future generations of workers will see a decline in living standards due to the effects of an aging population................ The first section of this paper discusses the economy’s recent growth and projected future growth. It compares the projected gains from continued growth and contrasts these with the impact of an aging population. Under any plausible scenario, the benefits from growth will swamp any negative impact on living standards from an aging population. The second section examines how deficits can pose a drain on the economy. Specifically, it will point out the distinction between a deficit when the economy is near full employment and a deficit run when the economy has a large number of unemployed workers and a large amount of excess capacity. In the latter case, there is really no way that the deficit can be seen as imposing a drain on the economy. In fact, deficits in the latter case are likely to increase the well-being of future generations</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1363038048397</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 17:40:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363038063781-54</Id><Topic><Title>gop nonsense on debt (the US government is actually rich...$128 trillion in oil and gas alone)</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1363006700350</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 08:58:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Goodness, the wacko envoirmental left would never permit that much energy put into play.

But there are dozens of senior employees and other presidential "assistants" to choose from if the administration were to look at cutting the six-figure salaries from its payroll. In the field of energy and climate change alone, President Obama in 2012 employed three advisers making at least $100,000 -- though one has since left. The president kept on staff a "deputy assistant" for energy and climate change, Heather Zichal, making $140,000; a "special assistant" for energy and environment, Nathaniel Keohane; and a "deputy director" for energy and climate change, Dan Utech. Together, their salaries totaled over $370,000 last year, according to White House records. Climate blogger Steven Goddard said it's unlikely the administration will scale back its circle of advisers, at least on this issue. "It's a very important point to his political base," Goddard said. "Whether he believes it or not himself, he has to make the effort to appear that he's working on controlling the climate." Zichal, who previously worked in the 2008 Obama campaign, during the president's first term helped craft administration policy on fuel economy standards and mercury pollution regulations. Keohane worked via his post on the White House Domestic Policy Council. Keohane left the White House last year to join the Environmental Defense Fund. The White House is being scrutinized after a decision -- driven in large part by Secret Service staffing considerations -- to end public tours of the "people's house." That decision took effect this past weekend, outraging lawmakers and spurned tourists alike.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1363045361542</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 19:42:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363049814154-69</Id><Topic><Title>Panicked Texas Republicans May Throw $100 Million Back At Women's Health</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1363033811405</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 16:30:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Just as it is here in Fl with repubs that have recently decided being a repub isn't such a good idea for your political fortunes starting with the ugly Fl. repub GOV!</Msg><Username>dropkickpubs4321</Username><Timestamp>1363049814154</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 20:56:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363049858727-70</Id><Topic><Title>Panicked Texas Republicans May Throw $100 Million Back At Women's Health</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1363033811405</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 16:30:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>As George PAINTS!</Msg><Username>dropkickpubs4321</Username><Timestamp>1363049858727</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 20:57:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363052083892-71</Id><Topic><Title>Oracle Corporation on MAD MONEY TODAY!!</Title><Username>efrain.mercer</Username><Timestamp>1362394647203</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 05:57:27 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>.
