Easy --- by allowing the hard left to make the argument center on the fictional issues of marginal rates and the evils of being successful, the deductions of the past have been legislated out while they are trying to legislate back in the higher rates of the  past. So the comparisons to past marginal rates are wasted effort and breath.</Msg><Username>siriusf8</Username><Timestamp>1354724173858</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 11:16:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354724230996-21</Id><Topic><Title>Mitt goes out shopping</Title><Username>kollesteral</Username><Timestamp>1354555751722</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 12:29:11 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Does Obama comprehend that companies will not pay dividends? if what?

The income tax in 1913 started at $3,000 which was taxed 1%, $500K was taxed 6%. the income tax then began at almost 4 times the avg wage..... the avg income now is about $50K a yr so , if as above the income tax would not start until about $200K. ONLY the 1% or so and above paid the income tax then! I guess they were realists. You can only get taxes from where the money is. why are people amazed or indignant that so much taxes come from the top? That IS where the money IS. The top 1% take in more income than the entire bottom 40 some percent.</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1354745578535</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 17:12:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354745768041-39</Id><Title>After promising to work harder to pass legislation</Title><Msg>to help the gridlock in Washington politics in a bipartisan way,the Pukes are obstructing the Obama administration just like they did before Obama kicked their useless #$%$ in Nov. election.These turkeys can never be trusted to do what they say they'll do.They are true Pukes.</Msg><Username>alsmith581</Username><Timestamp>1354745768041</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 17:16:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354753388029-40</Id><Topic><Title>1st income tax in USA taxed only the rich</Title><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1354743007631</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 16:30:07 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Fool.

But eventually, they expand them to apply to almost everybody. There never was "class warfare" in the USA it is totally a liberal myth. If the Republicans were smart they would make the "Bush Tax Cuts" go away 100% for 100% of everybody. Not even one penny of "Bush Tax Cut" anywhere! Make Obama do his own, new tax &amp; spend plan. You goobers can do 2700 pages of nonsense, in no time, so it shouldn't be a problem. Call it the Obama Excessive Tax &amp; Spend Plan. Libs are all convinced that all of civilization would be fixed if we got rid of the "Bush Tax Cuts" so lets get rid of them! (I am sure even our problems with Islam, Iran, Russia &amp; China would go away if we just got rid of the "Bush Tax Cuts.") If Clinton tax rates were so marvelous, lets also go back to Clinton SPENDING levels too! I hear that back then SPENDING was around 21% of GDP, today it is around 23% of GDP. Since Clinton, at the instigation of the Republicans in Congress, had an approximately balanced budget, I guess Tax &amp; Spending were around 21% of GDP. (Note that Bush's Medicare Part D, Prescriptions and ObamaCare were NOT included in Clinton's budget, so lets AXE them both! Bill Clinton did not have four wars active either. So lets chop those too! And prohibit Obama &amp; McCain from getting involved in anymore in Syria or Iran! Or elsewhere! If the ChiComs, Ruskies &amp; Eurozonners are happy to allow Iran to have nukes, why should we complain? And if they're unhappy, let them raise and pay for their own armies to do something about it!) I say even better, lets go back to Clinton nominal dollars too, in taxing and spending! No increases for inflation! No percent relativities to modern GDP. Use Clinton's numbers EXACTLY as they were! During Clinton's day everything was PERFECT so why mess with perfection? Cut unemployment back to six months as it was in Clinton's era. Cut welfare &amp; food stamps back to Clinton levels. Discontinue ObamaPhones! Etc, etc, etc.</Msg><Username>caliente.zorra</Username><Timestamp>1354765955085</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 22:52:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354766117176-45</Id><Topic><Title>1st income tax in USA taxed only the rich</Title><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1354743007631</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 16:30:07 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>These days I hear tax levels are around 18% of GDP.

Somebody plans for $160 billion of cuts and claims it is a $1.6 trillion cut over 10 years. Firstly, Our annual deficit, today, is around $1.6 thrillion abd $160 billion is only 1/10th of the cuts we need to balance the budget, NOW! Further, do you realize that 10 years ago, we had not entered the Iraq War yet? Invasion started March 2003!!!! And the most recent Great Recession didn't begin until 2008 (four years ago.) So what would be the point of a Ten Year Plan from December 5, 2002? Even Stalin &amp; Mao only proposed Five Year Plans and those always failed too! So what the blazes are our "Progressives" in government planning Ten Year Plans for?</Msg><Username>caliente.zorra</Username><Timestamp>1354766570558</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 23:02:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
