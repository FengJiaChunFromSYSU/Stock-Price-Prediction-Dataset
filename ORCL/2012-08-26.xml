When tax experts charged that he benefited from legally dubious tax avoidance strategies employed by Bain, his campaign noted that the investments are kept in a blind trust completely out of his control. "As we have said many times before, Governor and Mrs. Romney's assets are managed on a blind basis. They do not control the investment of these assets. The investment decisions are made by a trustee," spokeswoman Michele Davis said. But according to his 2010 tax return, when the Internal Revenue Service comes calling in April, Romney has a different answer: The presumptive GOP nominee reaps lucrative tax breaks for "active" participation in the private equity firm he founded, as well as a host of other investments.</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1345997535000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 12:12:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345997678000-11</Id><Topic><Title>fmr gop gov of Florida endorses Obama</Title><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1345997164000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 12:06:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>lots of pubs are falling for the romneyann pie in the sky.... they get more tax cuts, and most boomers get the full medicare and social security and the neo cons get increased military spending..... all this is "deficit reduction" of course......</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1345997678000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 12:14:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345998296000-12</Id><Topic><Title>Romney is such a liar</Title><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1345996683000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 11:58:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Should any political party attempt to abolish social, security, unemployment insurance, and eliminate labor law and farm programs, you would not hear of that party again in our political history.
