So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.

I suppose you think social services should never intervene and take children away from parents who are criminally abusive or negligent..... since the kids "belong" to the parents. "you guys are like that, right" ( I guess your parents never educated you on the value of civic or community duty. Too bad. "Republicanism, especially in the sense of civic duty and equality of sacrifice, was a major theme in World War II. Lee reports that, "Long after the war, the generations who had lived through it would wax nostalgic about their equality of sacrifice and of suffering, and about the resurgence of a sense of civic duty and community participation."[63] "Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country!" demanded President John F.

I don't think usage of "promote" is communist language. However, the word and phrase "collective" and "kids belong to whole communities" (I substitute word "state for communities") certainly is. That's why I say if you guys don't like the communist label stop using communist language. In your defintion of promote, nowhere does it say provide, which is the way you mean it.</Msg><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1365451004666</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-08 15:56:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365451209247-42</Id><Topic><Title>W looked behind curtains for WMD.. did he check for N.
