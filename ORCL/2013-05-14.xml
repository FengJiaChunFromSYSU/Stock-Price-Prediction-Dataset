Elijah Cummings of Maryland wrote in a letter to Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., the panel’s chairman. In a Sunday talk show appearance, Issa said he would seek sworn testimony from veteran diplomat Thomas Pickering and retired Adm. Mike Mullen, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

Some wealthy Manhattan moms have figured out a way to cut the long lines at Disney World — by hiring disabled people to pose as family members so they and their kids can jump to the front, The Post has learned. The “black-market Disney guides” run $130 an hour, or $1,040 for an eight-hour day. “My daughter waited one minute to get on ‘It’s a Small World’ — the other kids had to wait 2 1/2 hours,” crowed one mom, who hired a disabled guide through Dream Tours Florida. Dr. Wednesday Martin, social anthropologist who discovered scheme. “You can’t go to Disney without a tour concierge,’’ she sniffed. “This is how the 1 percent does Disney.” The woman said she hired a Dream Tours guide to escort her, her husband and their 1-year-old son and 5-year-old daughter through the park in a motorized scooter with a “handicapped” sign on it. The group was sent straight to an auxiliary entrance at the front of each attraction. Disney allows each guest who needs a wheelchair or motorized scooter to bring up to six guests to a “more convenient entrance.” The Florida entertainment mecca warns that there “may be a waiting period before boarding.” But the consensus among upper-crust moms who have used the illicit handicap tactic is that the trick is well worth the cost. ................................................

Ads by Google Cal Thomas Tribune Media Services 4:30 a.m. CDT, May 14, 2013 In his defense of President Obama, Press Secretary Jay Carney is beginning to sound a lot like Ronald Zeigler, Richard Nixon's spokesman. Carney only has to use the word "inoperative," as Ziegler did when incriminating evidence surfaced that proved his previous statements untrue. Following what appears to be a cover-up in the Benghazi attack, the Washington Post has obtained documents from an audit conducted by the IRS's inspector general that indicate the agency targeted for special scrutiny conservative groups with "tea party" and "patriot" in their names, as well as "nonprofit groups that criticized the government and sought to educate Americans about the U.S. Constitution." IRS official Lois Lerner described the targeting efforts as "absolutely inappropriate," but said IRS actions were not driven by partisanship. How, then, would she explain why no groups with "progressive" in their titles were similarly targeted? Carney labeled Lerner an "appointee from the previous administration." In other words: Bush's mistake, not Obama's.</Msg><Username>onedinosaur</Username><Timestamp>1368542604593</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 10:43:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368543164319-40</Id><Topic><Title>seaburgc throws a fit over special privleges the 1% can afford</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1368538820664</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 09:40:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>your silly circle jerk is a joke no matter how much the gop pumps it.

The commendable admission lends further evidence to the lengths the IRS went during an election cycle to silence tea party and limited government voices. ProPublica says the documents the IRS gave them were “not supposed to be made public”: The same IRS office that deliberately targeted conservative groups applying for tax-exempt status in the run-up to the 2012 election released nine pending confidential applications of conservative groups to ProPublica late last year... In response to a request for the applications for 67 different nonprofits last November, the Cincinnati office of the IRS sent ProPublica applications or documentation for 31 groups. Nine of those applications had not yet been approved—meaning they were not supposed to be made public. (We made six of those public, after redacting their financial information, deeming that they were newsworthy.) The group says that "no unapproved applications from liberal groups were sent to ProPublica.” According to Media Research Center Vice President for Business and Culture Dan Gainor, ProPublica’s financial backers include top progressive donors:</Msg><Username>hikemanymiles</Username><Timestamp>1368565695089</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 17:08:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368566111045-79</Id><Title>House to vote to impeach!!!</Title><Msg>not... ha ha ha ha........... pubs always pull this loser BS... they did the same with Clinton....... ha ha ha ha big waste of tax dollars...................all the loser gop does is whine about Obama....ha ha ha....</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1368566111045</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 17:15:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368566249210-80</Id><Title>gop gets no traction: Voters don't trust GOP on Benghazi...ha ha ha ha</Title><Msg>Voters trust Clinton over GOP on Benghazi . May 13, 2013 PPP's newest national poll finds that Republicans aren't getting much traction with their focus on Benghazi over the last week. Voters trust Hillary Clinton over Congressional Republicans on the issue of Benghazi by a 49/39 margin and Clinton's +8 net favorability rating at 52/44 is identical to what it was on our last national poll in late March. Meanwhile Congressional Republicans remain very unpopular with a 36/57 favorability rating. Voters think Congress should be more focused on other major issues right now rather than Benghazi. By a 56/38 margin they say passing a comprehensive immigration reform bill is more important than continuing to focus on Benghazi, and by a 52/43 spread they think passing a bill requiring background checks for all gun sales should be a higher priority. While voters overall may think Congress' focus should be elsewhere there's no doubt about how mad Republicans are about Benghazi. 41% say they consider this to be the biggest political scandal in American history to only 43% who disagree with that sentiment. Only 10% of Democrats and 20% of independents share that feeling. Republicans think by a 74/19 margin than Benghazi is a worse political scandal than Watergate, by a 74/12 margin that it's worse than Teapot Dome, and by a 70/20 margin that it's worse than Iran Contra. One interesting thing about the voters who think Benghazi is the biggest political scandal in American history is that 39% of them don't actually know where it is. 10% think it's in Egypt, 9% in Iran, 6% in Cuba, 5% in Syria, 4% in Iraq, and 1% each in North Korea and Liberia with 4% not willing to venture a guess. At any rate what we're finding about last week's Benghazi focus so far is that Republicans couldn't be much madder about it, voters overall think Congress should be focused on other key issues, and Hillary Clinton's poll numbers aren't declining on account of it.</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1368566249210</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 17:17:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368569681804-81</Id><Title>Passing IRS info to uber-progressive group means criminal charges are likely.</Title><Msg>The IRS may finally get a serving of its own tactics?</Msg><Username>blackmesainterloper</Username><Timestamp>1368569681804</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 18:14:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368569771775-82</Id><Title>As Benghazi grows and mainstream media covers it, the public trust will deteriorate quickly.</Title><Msg>Watch and weep, leftmeister.</Msg><Username>blackmesainterloper</Username><Timestamp>1368569771775</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 18:16:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368570623720-83</Id><Topic><Title>gop gets no traction: Voters don't trust GOP on Benghazi...ha ha ha ha</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1368566249210</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 17:17:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No, no, no.
