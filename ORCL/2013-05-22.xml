Machen - the man responsible for the aggressive surveillance and phone record scrutiny at Fox News - is also a big donor to the Obama Campaigns. At the time of his appointment, the Washington Post wrote a profile on Machen including this tidbit: Over the years, he has donated $4,350 to Obama's campaigns. He gave $250 to Obama's U.S. Senate campaign in 2003, a year before Obama, then an Illinois state senator, emerged on the nation's political radar, according to campaign finance records. Furthermore, in June of 2012, Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) questioned Attorney General Eric Holder about the appointment of Mr. Machen to head-up the leaks investigation. During the questioning Sen. Cornyn revealed that not only was Machen a donor to the Obama campaign, he was also a volunteer for Obama for America. Cornyn called into question whether he could conduct the leaks investigation in a fair and non-partisan way.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1369228511502</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 09:15:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369228737656-21</Id><Topic><Title>Bush IRS official to take the 5th, obviously she is a gop operative</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1369225679860</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 08:27:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>N.Y. Times editorial board: Obama administration threatening press freedom By DYLAN BYERS | 5/22/13 8:25 AM EDT The New York Times editorial board has condemned the Obama administration for threatening press freedom in the wake of revelations that the Justice Dept. seized phone records belonging to Fox News reporter James Rosen. "With the decision to label a Fox News television reporter a possible 'co-conspirator' in a criminal investigation of a news leak, the Obama administration has moved beyond protecting government secrets to threatening fundamental freedoms of the press to gather news," the board wrote in an editorial published on Wednesday. Noting past Obama administration intrustions into press freedom, including the Justice Dept.'s seizure of Associated Press phone records, the board accused the Obama administration of "a heavy tilt toward secrecy and insufficient concern about a free press." Dana Milbank, The Washington Post columnist, also condemned the Obama administration on Wednesday. "The Rosen affair is as flagrant an assault on civil liberties as anything done by George W. Bush’s administration, and it uses technology to silence critics in a way Richard Nixon could only have dreamed of," Milbank wrote. "[T]he administration’s actions shatter the president’s credibility...," he argued. "If the administration is spying on reporters and accusing them of criminality just for asking questions — well, who knows what else this crowd is capable of doing?"</Msg><Username>onedinosaur</Username><Timestamp>1369228737656</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 09:18:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369228738056-22</Id><Title>Massive Profit Growth</Title><Msg>Do you believe ORCL has strong fundamentals? Check out the income statement for Concurrent (CCUR) over the past four quarters: http://finance.yahoo.com/q/is?s=CCUR They have seen huge growth every quarter in revenues, gross profit, operating profit, and net income! In fact, CCUR's net income last quarter was up 450% from three quarters ago while its operating income was up 559% from three quarters ago! The company has reduced operating expenses from 56.2% of revenues three quarters ago to only 51.8% of revenues last quarter, while increasing gross margins from 57.4% up to 59.1%. This allowed CCUR's operating profit margin to rise over the past year from 1.2% all the way up to 7.3%! Last quarter, CCUR earned GAAP EPS of $0.11 and non-GAAP EPS of $0.16. CCUR's fundamentals will continue improving as they are now beginning to power Virgin Media's Virgin TV Anywhere platform for video on demand (VOD) delivery to the tablets and smartphones of their 3.8mm video customers. Time Warner Cable (TWC) just launched their new iOS and Android apps, and CCUR's CDN technology is now powering VOD delivery to the mobile devices of their 12mm video subscribers. CCUR's video business will continue to boom as pay-TV companies launch multi-screen services to better compete with Netflix (NFLX). NFLX has gained 347% over the past year and their quarterly operating income is only up 97% vs. CCUR's operating income up 559%. NFLX's operating margin has improved from 1.8% to 3.1%, while CCUR's has improved from 1.2% to 7.3%. CCUR operating margins are now 235% higher than NFLX and NFLX has an enterprise value/revenue ratio of 3.48, which would value CCUR at $27.69 per share up 299% from Tuesday's closing price of $6.94 per share!</Msg><Username>asj48493</Username><Timestamp>1369228738056</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 09:18:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369229493280-23</Id><Title>i'm gonna ask IRS for Tax exemption &amp; whine if they ask any questions</Title><Msg>but first I am gonna cut the IRS budget, and demand a smaller IRS and refuse to let them hire more people, then, when my Tax exempt application takes too long, i'm gonna whine about that too! and of course I will continue to whine about taxes! ...... plus ...

Jeffrey Subscribe to Terence P. Jeffrey RSS House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Rep. Dave Camp, R-Mich., left, and the committee's ranking Democrat, Rep. Sander Levin, D-Mich., want answers from the IRS. (AP File Photo) (CNSNews) - What did the White House know about the IRS targeting conservative groups and when did it know it? Crucial evidence needed to develop an accurate answer to that question would include the records of any communications that went back and forth between the IRS and the White House on the topic. In a May 14 letter signed by Chairman Dave Camp and Ranking Member Sander Levin, the House Ways and Means Committee demanded precisely those records from the IRS. In the same letter, the committee also demanded the records of any communications between IRS and the Treasury on the matter, plus other information and records that would help the committee understand the facts about IRS actions that subjected to heightened scrutiny conservative groups applying for tax-exempt status. Chairman Camp and Ranking Member Levin gave the IRS a deadline of Tuesday, May 21 to comply with their committee’s demand for the information and records.</Msg><Username>hikemanymiles</Username><Timestamp>1369232253247</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 10:17:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369232289456-44</Id><Topic><Title>no dissent</Title><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1369229552857</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 09:32:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Mesa, you missed the point big time there boy.

Rep. Darrel Issa, the committee's chairman, said that the committee learned just yesterday that the IRS completed its own investigation a year before a Treasury Department Inspector General report was completed. But despite the IRS recognizing in May 2012 that its employees were treating right-wing groups differently from other organizations, Issa said, IRS personnel withheld those conclusions from legislators.</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1369233719851</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 10:41:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369234042119-50</Id><Title>Bush &amp; gop banned the press from showing coffins.</Title><Msg>A great example and a repub DROPKICK!</Msg><Username>dropkickpubs4321</Username><Timestamp>1369234042119</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 10:47:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369235376181-51</Id><Title>If you haven’t seen MISM you need to drop everything else</Title><Msg>MISM has proven gold reserves and trades at just .08 cents.

No investigation needed to answer that one. Of course it was. President Obama and Co. are in full deniability mode, noting that the IRS is an "independent" agency and that they knew nothing about its abuse. The media and Congress are sleuthing for some hint that Mr. Obama picked up the phone and sicced the tax dogs on his enemies. Assistant editorial page editor James Freeman on Friday’s IRS congressional hearing. Photo: Associated Press .But that's not how things work in post-Watergate Washington. Mr. Obama didn't need to pick up the phone. All he needed to do was exactly what he did do, in full view, for three years: Publicly suggest that conservative political groups were engaged in nefarious deeds; publicly call out by name political opponents whom he'd like to see harassed; and publicly have his party pressure the IRS to take action. Mr. Obama now professes shock and outrage that bureaucrats at the IRS did exactly what the president of the United States said was the right and honorable thing to do. "He put a target on our backs, and he's now going to blame the people who are shooting at us?" asks Idaho businessman and longtime Republican donor Frank VanderSloot. Enlarge Image CloseGetty Images At the White House, President Obama addresses the IRS scandal, May 15. .Mr. VanderSloot is the Obama target who in 2011 made a sizable donation to a group supporting Mitt Romney. In April 2012, an Obama campaign website named and slurred eight Romney donors. It tarred Mr. VanderSloot as a "wealthy individual" with a "less-than-reputable record." Other donors were described as having been "on the wrong side of the law." This was the Obama version of the phone call—put out to every government investigator (and liberal activist) in the land. Twelve days later, a man working for a political opposition-research firm called an Idaho courthouse for Mr. VanderSloot's divorce records.

The California Republican said Lerner’s Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination was voided when she gave an opening statement this morning denying any wrongdoing and professing pride in her government service. “When I asked her her questions from the very beginning, I did so so she could assert her rights prior to any statement,” Issa told POLITICO. “She chose not to do so — so she waived.”</Msg><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1369252780890</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 15:59:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369255279611-96</Id><Topic><Title>same pubs who Nixed Sandy Aid, Wants Tornado Aid</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1369243409688</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 13:23:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Oklahoma’s Senators Opposed 2011 FEMA Funds, Sandy Aid Oklahoma’s two Republican senators, Tom Coburn and James Inhofe, may be in an awkward position: their tornado-devastated state needs help from the U.S. disaster relief agency whose plea for funds</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1369255279611</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 16:41:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369255765613-97</Id><Title>The Latest Lie: IRS Targeted Conservatives (it is just a BIG LIE)</Title><Msg>The Latest Lie: IRS Targeted Conservatives by Dave Johnson Remember the video of the guy in the “pimp costume” who got advice from ACORN employees on how to run his prostitution ring? Turns out the whole story was just a lie, a doctored-video smear job on an important organization. The guy never wore a “pimp costume” and the real, undoctored videos showed that ACORN employees did nothing wrong. But a lie travels around the world before the corporate media bothers to check the facts. The “news” media blasted the story everywhere, and Congress was so outraged they forced ACORN to close its doors. And here we are again. The corporate media is blasting out the story that the IRS “targeted conservative groups.” Some in the media say there was “IRS harassment of conservative groups.” Some of the media are going so far as claiming that conservative groups were “audited.” This story that is being repeated and treated as “true” is just not what happened at all. It is one more right-wing victimization fable, repeated endlessly until the public has no choice except t believe it. Conservative Groups Were Not “Targeted,” “Singled Out” Or Anything Else You are hearing that conservative groups were “targeted.” What you are not hearing is that progressive groups were also “targeted.” So were groups that are not progressive or conservative. All that happened here is that groups applying to the IRS for special tax status were checked to see if they were engaged in political activity. They were checked, not targeted. Only 1/3 of the groups checked were conservative groups. Once again: Only 1/3 of the groups checked were conservative groups. Conservative groups were not “singled out,” were not “targeted” and in the end none were denied special tax status — even though many obviously should have been.</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1369255765613</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 16:49:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369256028148-98</Id><Topic><Title>Lois Lerner: OBAMA made me do bad!!!!</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1369249540319</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 15:05:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In a First, U.S. Admits Drones Have Killed 4 Americans By CHARLIE SAVAGE 21 minutes ago One day before President Obama is due to deliver a speech on national security, his administration formally acknowledged that the United States had killed American citizens in Yemen and Pakistan.</Msg><Username>hikemanymiles</Username><Timestamp>1369256028148</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 16:53:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369257168774-99</Id><Topic><Title>The Latest Lie: IRS Targeted Conservatives (it is just a BIG LIE)</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1369255765613</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 16:49:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes just keep closing your eyes and covering your ears and read nothing but media Matters and watch MSNBC.

The IRS commissioner admitted to the charges but pointed to employee's over zealousness to harass tea party groups. Plain and simple, these groups were put thru hoops, intimidated, stalled. Even Chris Matthews was uncharacteristically critical. It's not just the right who wants answers. Too funny, now they got the ACORN video guy in a "pimp costume", whatever that is. He along with his partners didn't appear any different than the average person on the street. Plus you can hear on the video exactly what the conversation was about and there was no mistaking the reference. There was no editing and that was ruled out early on. Has a liberal ever accepted the real story rather than the opinion of some goon who babbles nonsense to save face? It's a pathetic, desperate effort that only shows how scared they are.</Msg><Username>passthebuckaroo</Username><Timestamp>1369267106356</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 19:58:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369269572874-115</Id><Topic><Title>The Latest Lie: IRS Targeted Conservatives (it is just a BIG LIE)</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1369255765613</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 16:49:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>IInteresting you mention ACORN. Know what the "A": stands for? Arkansas. It was billionaire shyster George Soros who set it up to get Cocaine snorting Bill Clinton in as Governor of Arkansas.It went on to bigger and better things after depending on your definition of "better". Why would an IRS agent ask a religious group what they prayed about? Interesting as that is one of the questions asked one group along with other inanities. "None were denied special tax status?" You are lying. I've heard several groups that applied years ag and STILL do not have that exemption/ Some are political but many are religious groups. I subscribe to a Christian publ;ication. The manager choose NOT to apply for tax exemption just so he would be free to say what he feels is true. Truth tellers have always ended up in trouble with authorities as most authorities are corrupt and can't abide truth.</Msg><Username>lewcor</Username><Timestamp>1369269572874</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 20:39:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369270186193-116</Id><Title>Nothing Would Be Finer</Title><Msg>than seeing Eric Holder charged with multiple counts of unethical conduct by the DOJ. Even the liberal media is wondering how much latitude the agency has in tapping phone records of reporters, and even spying on their parents as was the case with a Fox reporter. This gets more sordid every day. And they say conservative whites are more likely to abuse their power. Progressive socialists are just as capable as we see now.
