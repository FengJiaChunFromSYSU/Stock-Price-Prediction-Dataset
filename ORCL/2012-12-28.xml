It means that one would be "married" to it and could not be sold or passed down to, for example, a family member. These lefties are too too much.</Msg><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1356701039821</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-28 08:23:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356703545270-2</Id><Topic><Title>Gun Ban Bill</Title><Username>annieshenanigan</Username><Timestamp>1356650801011</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 18:26:41 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It means that one would be "married" to it and could not be sold or passed down to, for example, a family member --------------------------------- most probably unconstitutional on 2 counts...... the commerce clause because you cannot inhibit the sale of a legally held possession.... from an ex post facto perspective... you cannot pass a law that makes something that was legal... illegal... secondly it would be the the taking of legally owned property if it could not be handed down.... eminent domain is a concept that does not apply to anything but Real Estate The most disturbing part of the discussion is the way they are talking they want to make 2 classes of citizens.. those that currently own... and those that will never own.... clearly unconstitutional under the 2nd amendment The talk of the liberals on this topic endangers the entire Bill Of Rights and the very foundation of the Constitution The Supreme Court made it clear during the Obama administration... the 2nd amendment stands and is stronger than ever Any legislation will be challenged and struck down by lower courts long before it would ever have the chance to go back to the Supreme Ct</Msg><Username>howie_is_long</Username><Timestamp>1356703545270</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-28 09:05:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356703904349-3</Id><Topic><Title>Gun Ban Bill</Title><Username>annieshenanigan</Username><Timestamp>1356650801011</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 18:26:41 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm not so confident in the courts including the SC. The courts seems to ever issue and black/white ruling. They pick it apart, strike down some parts while upholding other parts. In the end, the 2nd amendment will be eroded. I doubt this bill would pass the senate or House much less reach the prez's desk. Obama would simply issue an Executive Order to get what he wants. What will the people have to say and do about this? That's a very interesting question.</Msg><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1356703904349</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-28 09:11:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
