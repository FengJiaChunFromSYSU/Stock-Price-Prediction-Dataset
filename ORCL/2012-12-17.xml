Banning guns will not stop a disturbed person from committing this kind of crime. Anyone can buy any gun on the black market. I don't know if the mother of this kid in Conn knew he had guns and if she did, what does that say about a parents responsiblity? I recall the Kinkle kid in Ore who shot his mother and father and 13 classmates. They bought him the guns even tho they knew he had some personality problems. The Hollywood liberals are all for gun control yet the movies and video games produced there are more and more violent and bloody. It's all about how many bad guys you can kill and buildings you can blow up. Getting large doses of that from an early age might just be a trigger for a kid who has mental problems like schitzoprenia. Years ago, they were committed to state hospitals, today they are on the streets and can't be put away unless voluntarily or if they hurt someone. Liberals say it's against their rights to force being sequestered. I have never heard of a kid who was brought up hunting, and taught the rules of gun safety, go out and massacre dozens of people.</Msg><Username>passthebuckaroo</Username><Timestamp>1355771794151</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 14:16:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355771967026-54</Id><Topic><Title>Lanza could have used the two 9mm pistols to the same effect,</Title><Username>dropkickpubs4321</Username><Timestamp>1355770568454</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 13:56:08 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Pure Pigshyt Drivel... that only a fool could admire!</Msg><Username>ivleeg_garbage</Username><Timestamp>1355771967026</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 14:19:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355772046485-55</Id><Title>Guns in the hands of responsible citizens don't kill people says assbuckeroo,, THEY DID THIS TIME YOU SIMPLETON!</Title><Msg>The guns were purchased and owned by th kids RESPONSIBLE PARENTS you EXTREME DUMMY!

Also reports that he had lots of ammo, maybe 1000 rounds, and could have shot up the school more. He must have been in a rage, You don't need to shoot anybody eleven time to kill them. That's just obliterating them. And helpless children! My family had rifles and shot guns at home for hunting. Small game &amp; deer. My Dad's attitude was not to waste bullets: one shot one kill. Why do you need more on a deer? And besides, each shot spoils some meat. So I can see having guns for shooting, hunting &amp; home defense. But I don't see why we need semi-automatic rifles that can shoot 20 children and 6 adults, up to eleven times each, in quick order. How many bullets could he hold in a clip, or magazine or drum? (Why do we need DRUMS of bullets?) And of course, how much armed resistance was he expecting in a kindergarten class? NONE!

Three persons were killed inside the university's tower, with 11 others murdered after Whitman fired at random targets from the 28th-floor observation deck of the Main Building. Whitman was shot and killed by Austin Police Officer, Houston McCoy. Prior to starting the shootings at the University of Texas, Whitman had murdered both his wife and mother in Austin. END QUOTE: Whitman took a small arsenal of weapons &amp; bullets with him up the tower but seemed to prefer a "Universal M1 Carbine" (semi-automatic military rifle.) The M1 could hold 14 bullets in its loading chamber and could fire as fast as you could pull the trigger.</Msg><Username>ourfirstpantroglodytepresident</Username><Timestamp>1355775289871</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 15:14:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355775663482-68</Id><Topic><Title>[EXCLUSIVE] ORCL CEO on MAD MONEY!

But I heard the kid had aspergers or autism and the Mom found that the ONLY thing that drew him out was shooting guns. So she legally bought the guns and ammo and trained the kid how to use them. How smart is that? "Here, my little psycho kid, here is a nice semi-automatic rifle you can shoot up the whole neighborhood with!" Seems children with those sorts of disorders are hard to draw out of their "dark" moods. One must find some hobby or pet to attract them and draw them out.

Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., sought to amend the bill to stop the Veterans Affairs Department from putting the names of veterans deemed too mentally incompetent to handle their finances into the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, which prohibits them from buying or owning firearms. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., objected, saying the measure would make it easier for veterans with mental illness to own a gun, endangering themselves and others. "I love our veterans, I vote for them all the time. They defend us," Schumer said. "If you are a veteran or not and you have been judged to be mentally infirm, you should not have a gun."

These psychotropic drugs are known to cause such behaviour and yet the big drug companies and the phony psychiatrists keep pushing them.

It's the criminals who don't. Every law on the books regarding legal guns means nothing to the perps who commit crimes. Look at Chicago, homicides there for 2012 exceeded 2011. 504 murders or about 42 per month. 75% are black. Violence has increased there while other cities like NY and LA have decreased. It was reported in the Chicago Tribune that Mayor Rahm's first order of business each day is not the budget or pending proposals, but e-mails from the Chicago PD listing the homicides from the night before. Assualt rifles are already banned, but if a criminal wants to aquire any automatic or semi-automatic weapon, it's just a matter of arranging it with the right goons. You think they get them thru mail-order? The police confiscate thousands of guns each year in raids. The laws are revokeable on "the street", you DA. The only people who can legally use assault weapons are the police and only after the shootout in LA when the cops were outgunned.</Msg><Username>passthebuckaroo</Username><Timestamp>1355796825169</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 21:13:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
