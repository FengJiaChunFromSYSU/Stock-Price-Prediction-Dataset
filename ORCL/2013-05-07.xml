Who would mistake that he gets his talking points from moron.org. and the huff and puff post.</Msg><Username>passthebuckaroo</Username><Timestamp>1367942116624</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 11:55:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367942223930-36</Id><Title>this guy who rescued the missing girls in Cleveland</Title><Msg>have you heard this guy...Charles Ramsey from Cleveland?

President Obama and Michelle Obama held the hush-hush, swanky, ultra-A-list party to celebrate his second term the night he took the oath of office. The party was not announced or listed on his official schedule, but a few of the guests tweeted about the event, which is what publicly revealed its existence. The guest list that reveals who attended was never released though the White House visitors log from January, which came out at the end of April and was examined by The Hill: a mix of rock stars, actors, top campaign donors, White House aides, Obama friends and leading Democratic politicians. Some of the names include actor Jamie Foxx; Obama adviser David Axelrod; Rep. Joaquín Castro (D-Texas) and his twin brother, San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro; singer Kelly Clarkson; Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.); actress Eva Longoria; singer James Taylor; former NBA player Alonzo Mourning; Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley (D); and former White House spokesman Robert Gibbs. Clinton aide Huma Abedin was on the list, but her husband, former New York Democratic Rep. Anthony Weiner, was not. Obama has a voluntary visitors records release policy, and more than 3.2 million entries have been made public. There is typically a three-month delay in the release of names. The visitors log doesn’t give a detailed reason a guest is at the White House, but it does say who the person is there to see and where the meeting took place. The names The Hill used to compile the guest list for the post-inaugural party were under a grouping of visitors who were at the White House to meet with “POTUS/FLOTUS” in the “residence” on Jan. 21.

The revelations appear to contradict the description of events as provided by the Pentagon, the White House and then-secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton. Among them: â?¢ The U.S. military refused to send jets over a raging battlefield in Benghazi in an attempt to scatter the attackers. â?¢ The Pentagon's Africa command refused to let a Special Forces team in Tripoli fly the short distance to Benghazi in an attempt to rescue U.S. personnel. â?¢ The CIA told the White House the attack was a coordinated assault by al-Qaeda-linked terrorists. But the White House and State Department publicly blamed the attack on a spontaneous mob angered over an anti-Islam video, and claimed the reports of terrorists was not learned until later. â?¢ The State Department never activated a foreign emergency response team, which assists diplomats under attack. A State official will testify this was done to avoid the appearance that a terrorist attack had happened. The revelations come from witnesses who will appear in public Wednesday before the House oversight committee. Scheduled to speak are Mark Thompson, acting Deputy Assistant Secretary for Counterterrorism; Gregory Hicks, former deputy chief of mission and chargÃ© d'affairs in Libya, and Eric Nordstrom, the former regional security officer in Libya. All are current State Department employees.</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1367954436202</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 15:20:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367958660113-48</Id><Topic><Title>the reason this economic recovery is slow: the crash of the Bush era housing bubble</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1367857650895</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 12:27:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Who are you to say there is no bubble?

On November 7, 2012, Nakoula pleaded guilty to four of the charges against him in an apparent plea bargain. He was subsequently sentenced to a year in prison and four years of supervised release.[13] Nakoula Basseley Nakoula AKA Sam Bacile Mark Basseley Youssef[2] Yousseff M. Basseley Nicola Bacily Robert Bacily and several other Nakoula was arrested by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department in 1997 after being pulled over and found to be in possession of ephedrine, hydroiodic acid, and $45,000 in cash.[20] Nakoula was charged with intent to manufacture methamphetamine.[19] He pleaded guilty and was sentenced in 1997 to one year in Los Angeles County Jail and three years probation. According to the Los Angeles County District Attorney, he violated probation in 2002 and was re-sentenced to another year in county jail.[25] In 2010, Nakoula pleaded no contest to federal charges of bank fraud in California. Nakoula had opened bank accounts using fake names and stolen Social Security numbers, including one belonging to a 6-year-old child,[3] and deposited checks from those accounts to withdraw at ATMs.[26] The prosecutor described the scheme as check kiting: "You try to get the money out of the bank before the bank realizes they are drawn from a fraudulent account. There basically is no money."[4] Nakoula’s June 2010 sentencing transcript shows that after being arrested, he testified against an alleged ring leader of the fraud scheme, in exchange for a lighter sentence.[27][28][29] He was sentenced to 21 months in federal prison, followed by five years probation (supervised release), and ordered to pay $794,701 in restitution.[4][30] He was sent to prison, then to a halfway house,[31] and was released from custody in June 2011. A few weeks later, he began working on Innocence of Muslims.[31][32]</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1367959152797</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 16:39:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367959317619-50</Id><Topic><Title>the reason this economic recovery is slow: the crash of the Bush era housing bubble</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1367857650895</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 12:27:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>anyone who looks at stock valuations can see there is no bubble. warren buffet just yesterday said valuations are reasonable........ too bad your preaching doom and disaster has left you out of making any money owning stocks for years now...... you have been waiting for the "hyperinflation" since when, about 1933 or so?</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1367959317619</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 16:41:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367961473491-51</Id><Topic><Title>maker of anti-muslim video still in jail</Title><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1367925451403</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 07:17:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>lol. seeburgc must be some kind of buddy of Nakoula Basseley Nakoula AKA Sam Bacile Mark Basseley Youssef[2] Yousseff M.

May 7, 2013, 12:46 p.m. Gun crime has plunged in the United States since its peak in the middle of the 1990s, including gun killings, assaults, robberies and other crimes, two new studies of government data show. Yet few Americans are aware of the dramatic drop, and more than half believe gun crime has risen, according to a newly released survey by the Pew Research Center. In less than two decades, the gun murder rate has been nearly cut in half. Other gun crimes fell even more sharply, paralleling a broader drop in violent crimes committed with or without guns. Violent crime dropped steeply during the 1990s and has fallen less dramatically since the turn of the millennium. The number of gun killings dropped 39% between 1993 and 2011, the Bureau of Justice Statistics reported in a separate report released Tuesday. Gun crimes that weren’t fatal fell by 69%. However, guns still remain the most common murder weapon in the United States, the report noted. Between 1993 and 2011, more than two out of three murders in the U.S. were carried out with guns, the Bureau of Justice Statistics found. The bureau also looked into non-fatal violent crimes. Few victims of such crimes -- less than 1% -- reported using a firearm to defend themselves. Despite the remarkable drop in gun crime, only 12% of Americans surveyed said gun crime had declined compared with two decades ago, according to Pew, which surveyed more than 900 adults this spring. Twenty-six percent said it had stayed the same, and 56% thought it had increased. It’s unclear whether media coverage is driving the misconception that such violence is up. The mass shootings in Newtown, Conn., and Aurora, Colo., were among the news stories most closely watched by Americans last year, Pew found. Crime has also been a growing focus for national newscasts and morning network shows in the past five years but has become less common on local television news.</Msg><Username>liberals_plague_humanity</Username><Timestamp>1367975880941</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 21:18:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367976882948-68</Id><Topic><Title>the reason this economic recovery is slow: the crash of the Bush era housing bubble</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1367857650895</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 12:27:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama attends secretive fundraiser By DONOVAN SLACK | 5/7/13 6:32 PM EDT President Obama is attending a DNC fundraiser at the St. Regis Hotel in Washington.
