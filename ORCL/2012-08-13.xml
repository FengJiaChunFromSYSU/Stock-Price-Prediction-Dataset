He hates the constitution as well as the white men who wrote it more than 200 years ago.How sick is a person who hates people who lived that far back. I guess Nobama was too high on drugs during his American Histoey classes in high school. Guess he was also high during the constitutional classes in law school also, because he sure don't know what the Constitution is about. The only things Nobama likes are Unions, lazy people who will not work, anti-white racist,gays, illegal immigrants, drug gangs,and on and on and on.

Andrew Malcolm over at Investor's Business Daily points us to the hard numbers: three dozen Obama executive advisers and aides owe hundreds of thousands of dollars in back taxes - and federal workers as a whole owe the IRS $3.4 billion in unpaid taxes. A new report just out from the Internal Revenue Service reveals that 36 of President Obama's executive office staff owe the country $833,970 in back taxes. These people working for Mr. Fair Share apparently haven't paid any share, let alone their fair share.

An article published by CNN entitled “The 86 million invisible unemployed” may shed some light – along with some simple math, which can also be found at whatreallyhappened.com. The U.S. government officially admits that 8.3 percent of the labor force is “visibly” unemployed. The total US population is approximately 330 million. 24 percent of those, however, are young people not eligible to work and 13 percent are retired. So the total population of available workers in the United States is 100% – (24% + 13%) = 63% of 330 million people, or 208 million workers. Out of the pool of available workers, therefore, 8.3 percent accounts for about 17.3 million people. Together with the 86 million “invisible” that means 103.3 million Americans are available to work but do not have a full time job. And with 103.3 million workers not working or underemployed, the true jobless rate in the U.S. right now is closer to 49 percent, not the 8.3 percent the U.S. government and media is propagandizing about."</Msg><Username>econ_meister</Username><Timestamp>1344875779000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 12:36:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344875781000-62</Id><Topic><Title>teaparty OK on Mitt's taxes lowered to 0.8%</Title><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1344809505000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 18:11:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>mitt the hawk on nam....... who toured France with his maid.. get it?....

TARP was a slam dunk! How it got manipulated was a crime! "Over the past few years, however, Ryan has soured on the same bailouts that he voted for, arguing that they’ve been diverted from their original purposes and manipulated by administration officials for political purposes. In his 2013 budget, the House Budget chairman accuses the Treasury Department of having diverted TARP from its original purpose of “providing targeted assistance to unlock credit markets” and turning the program “into an ad hoc, opaque bailout and a slush fund for large private institutions.” Although Ryan’s budget acknowledges that TARP “succeeded in halting a systemic panic,” the budget also concludes that TARP has “morphed into crony capitalism at its worst.” Ryan has also used his recent criticism of TARP to justify his vote for the auto bailout: ”The whole purpose of voting for that auto bill was to prevent the auto companies from getting TARP dollars,” he told Fox Business Network in 2010. Ryan has subsequently turned the auto bailout into a political weapon as well: In his 2013 budget, he accuses the Obama administration of using the auto bailout “to give politically favored groups a better deal than they were entitled to under bankruptcy law” and using the bailout as political leverage to “strong-arm automakers into supporting new fuel-economy regulations.” What really happened under the bailouts? It’s true that TARP funds have been diverted to non-financial institutions: In late 2008, the Bush administration decided to divert TARP funds to General Motors, Chrysler, and other auto giants to prevent looming bankruptcy. Under the Obama administration, TARP funds were also designated to prop up the housing market."</Msg><Username>econ_meister</Username><Timestamp>1344900009000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 19:20:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344901020000-147</Id><Topic><Title>Why dont the poor pay tax on</Title><Username>central_scrutinizer_fz</Username><Timestamp>1344892272000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 17:11:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The poor are not poor today.
