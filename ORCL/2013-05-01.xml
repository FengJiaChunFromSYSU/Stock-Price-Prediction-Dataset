The Rev. Kevin Johnson, a Morehouse alumnus and the senior pastor of Bright Hope Baptist Church in North Philadelphia, Pa., wrote an opinion column earlier this month in the Philadelphia Tribune accusing Obama of neglecting the black community in his cabinet picks–they’re overwhelmingly white–and broader political agenda. The day after the article ran, Johnson said, Morehouse President John Silvanus Wilson, Jr. phoned to express reservations about his “untimely” comments regarding President Obama. Johnson asked administrators to honor their invitation, but learned days later he had been replaced by three alternate speakers. Now, a group of two dozen pastors who lead churches across the country are demanding Morehouse re-invite Johnson.</Msg><Username>hikemanymiles</Username><Timestamp>1367414693887</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 09:24:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367415674758-4</Id><Title>warning</Title><Msg>Saudis’ Boston warning Told US last year Last Updated: May 1, 2013 Posted May 1, 2013 Saudi Arabian officials gave the United States a written warning about Boston bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev months before the attack, a new report says. Officials in the oil-rich kingdom sent a letter to the US Department of Homeland Security in 2012, detailing their concerns about Tamerlan Tsarnaev and indicating he might have been planning an attack, the Daily Mail reports today. “It was very specific” a Saudi official told the Mail. He said the letter mentioned Tsarnaev’s name and warned that “something was going to happen in a major US city.” The information arose through Saudi intelligence- gathering in Yemen, the paper said, although the specific source of that info was not revealed. The warning was also delivered in person to President Obama in January 2013.</Msg><Username>hikemanymiles</Username><Timestamp>1367415674758</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 09:41:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367418059765-5</Id><Topic><Title>ORCL Downgraded Avoid $9 Target</Title><Username>nasdaqczar2</Username><Timestamp>1367306378574</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 03:19:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yeah.

The confirmation from multiple sources comes more than seven months after the assault on two U.S. locations in Benghazi, Libya, where four Americans -- including Ambassador Chris Stevens -- were killed. President Obama pledged after the attack that "justice will be done." But one source said the government is "sitting on" information. "We basically don't want to upset anybody, and the problem is, if Ambassador Stevens' family knew that we were sitting on information about the people who killed their son, their brother, on and on, then, and we could look them as a government in the face, then we're messing up.

And their only impact is that their insurance is stronger, better, more secure than it was before. Full stop. That’s it. They don’t have to worry about anything else.” -- President Obama at a press conference President Obama had some gnarly news for the Democratic campaign committees: This is as good as it gets for his signature health law. In a press conference on the 100th day of his second term, Obama found himself on the defensive and short on answers. Syria genocide? We’re looking into it. Benhgazi whistleblowers? Never heard of them. Intelligence gaps on the Boston Marathon bombing? “This is hard stuff.” Presidents usually don’t have press conferences unless they have something they want to say, especially Obama who much prefers batting practice to swinging at fastballs when it comes to media queries. So why did insular Obama step to the podium on Tuesday if he didn’t have more definitive answers to the pile of policy and political questions reporters would surely lay at his feet? Had he wanted to push a topic, Obama might have just beckoned Steve Kroft or Matt Lauer back to the White House. The reason for the press conference instead seemed to be for Obama to assert that despite a string of defeats, he is still relevant. Having been twice brushed back by Senate Democrats and with his second-term agenda looking like a dead letter, Obama wanted to show he was still the man.</Msg><Username>onedinosaur</Username><Timestamp>1367429598808</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 13:33:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367430164058-15</Id><Topic><Title>Only In America.....</Title><Username>passthebuckaroo</Username><Timestamp>1367428720597</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 13:18:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Only in Obama's America!</Msg><Username>pt_bama_nation</Username><Timestamp>1367430164058</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 13:42:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367432079714-16</Id><Topic><Title>Only In America.....</Title><Username>passthebuckaroo</Username><Timestamp>1367428720597</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 13:18:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Carney: 'Benghazi Happened a Long Time Ago' 1:59 PM, May 1, 2013 White House spokesman Jay Carney said in response to a question about the September 11, 2012 Benghazi terror attack that it "happened a long time ago."

According to a new YouGov poll, it's the rich -- not the poor or middle class -- who back Obama more despite his 2012 campaign attacking the rich. The poll for the Economist found that fewer than half of those with incomes less than $100,000 per year approve of Obama's performance, while he enjoys a 54 percent approval rating among those with incomes higher than that. Those earning less than $40,000 a year disapprove of the president's performance, 51 percent to 45 percent. Those earning $40,000 to $100,000 disapprove by a rate of 50 percent to 48 percent. "A largely jobless recovery coupled with a Quantitative-Easing-fueled stock market rally seems to earn more smiles from the upscale among us, fewer from the working class," said the pollsters.</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1367438213719</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 15:56:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367440322314-22</Id><Topic><Title>Obama doesn't know about Benghazi, whistle blowers being threatened, Saudis warning about</Title><Username>coughingredink</Username><Timestamp>1367434972543</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 15:02:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>NBC Ignores Todd Grilling President Over ObamaCare 'Train Wreck' to Hit From the Left on Gitmo By: Kyle Drennen | May 01, 2013 | 14:43 While NBC's chief White House correspondent and political director Chuck Todd pressed President Obama during a Tuesday news conference on the possibility of ObamaCare being a "train wreck," the network coverage of the presser completely avoided any mention of the question, instead seizing on Obama being pressured from the left to close the Guantanamo Bay prison. Anchor Brian Williams lead off Tuesday's Nightly News by declaring: "The hunger strike at Guantanamo that's now gotten so bad prisoners are being force fed, as the President faces tough questions." Introducing a report on the topic, Williams lectured: "We don't get to see them or know their names, and most Americans actually prefer not to spend a whole lot of time thinking about the men who've been rounded up as enemy combatants and imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba."</Msg><Username>onedinosaur</Username><Timestamp>1367440322314</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 16:32:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367442301889-23</Id><Title>proof there was no such thing as Iraq weapons of mass destruction</Title><Msg>Just ask about them at the new Bush Library.
