Russia &amp; China want a "blue water" port on the Mediterranean Sea in Syria. This will be Russia's only "blue water" port and having one has been a goal of Russia's for several centuries, regardless of the kind of government they have. Syria is also a satellite state of Iran and an ally against Iraq, long before the USA was on the scene. Thus they have strong national interests in Syria. Direct supply lines to Syria, over land. (Ours will be by sea &amp; air.) China has more troops and population than the USA. Russia &amp; China have more manufacturing, better credit and more cash than the USA. Iran will be the front troops for this proxy war. Russia &amp; China will happily allow us to waste our best against their Iranian proxy. Meanwhile our "allies" in Syria will be Al Qida &amp; Hezbollah rebels. #$%$??? Our troops &amp; positions in Afghanistan &amp; Iraq will be plucked like low hanging fruit. We stand to lose everything in the Middle east and I don't see anything for us to gain in Syria. This a war that we can not win. Our best choice is to stay out of Syria. One day, Iran will get nuclear weapons...let Russia, China &amp; the EU worry about it! (Personally, I think it is way too late to do much about that now.) IMHO! OH BY THE WAY! There is no longer any computer chip manufacturing in the USA. It is all done in Asia now. If we want a new computer chip to win the war in Syria, we must ask China to make it for us!</Msg><Username>bullwinkle.themoose</Username><Timestamp>1371444341841</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 00:45:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371462533521-2</Id><Title>this will mess up Mesa</Title><Msg>Holly Paz, an IRS supervisor in Washington had admitted to reviewing tax exempt applications from conservative groups.

Instead, a "tea party" case could refer to an application for tax-exemption from any group -- including liberal ones -- believed to be engaging in political activity, one IRS official told congressional investigators. "Since the first case that came up to Washington happened to have that name, it appeared to me that that's what they were calling it that as a shorthand, because the first case had been that," said Holly Paz, the Internal Revenue Service's director of rulings and agreements. She said "tea party" could mean any political group, just like "Coke" is used as a generic term for soda, or people refer to tissues as "Kleenex." Paz, the highest-ranking IRS official with knowledge of the targeting to thus far cooperate with the congressional investigation. Paz said liberal groups were mentioned by name, alongside the Tea Party, on an IRS BOLO -- or "be on the lookout" -- list. Screeners in Cincinnati, where all applications for tax-exemptions are processed, used the list to identify sensitive or complex cases that should be sent to specialists in Cincinnati and Washington. "And I was aware of, you know, other cases at that time that were working their way through the D.C. office that involved proposed denials of exemption to liberal organizations that supported the Democratic Party. So I had no indication that we were not being balanced in what we were doing," Paz said.</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1371475628008</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 09:27:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371478023761-8</Id><Topic><Title>the rest of the story (seabugger always leaves out the important details)</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1371473293509</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 08:48:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I left out nothing.

Screeners in Cincinnati, where all applications for tax-exemptions are processed, used the list to identify sensitive or complex cases that should be sent to specialists in Cincinnati and Washington. She said "tea party" could mean any political group, just like "Coke" is used as a generic term for soda, or people refer to tissues as "Kleenex." "And I was aware of, you know, other cases at that time that were working their way through the D.C. office that involved proposed denials of exemption to liberal organizations that supported the Democratic Party. So I had no indication that we were not being balanced in what we were doing," Paz said.</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1371521882188</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 22:18:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371523662486-40</Id><Topic><Title>ISSA is told that the IRS was balanced in what we were doing," Paz said.</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1371475628008</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 09:27:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>By JAKE SHERMAN and JOHN BRESNAHAN | 6/17/13 3:46 PM EDT Eric Cantor and Nancy Pelosi are once again the two wealthiest members of the House leadership, according to just released financial disclosure reports for all members.
