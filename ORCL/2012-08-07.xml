Franciscan University’s vice president of advancement Michael Hernon said: We find it particularly troubling that an out of town and out of touch group targeted the University for removal from the logo solely because of our religious identity. For more than 65 years, Franciscan University of Steubenville has proudly served as an integral part of this community and we were honored to have our chapel included in the new city of Steubenville logo. Annie Laurie Gaylor, co-founder of the atheist group, said a Steubenville native contacted her and asked her foundation to fight against the new logo. Gaylor pontificated: It is about the Constitution. We are a nation of laws and the Steubenville city council has taken an oath of office to uphold the federal Constitution which bars establishment of religion and the Ohio Constitution which is even more specific that no preference by law should be shown to religion. And when you place what you say is a very identifiable in your … community Catholic emblem on your city seal that shows preference for religion. That is singling out that Franciscan University, that cross, what it stands for, Christianity, on the city seal and it is not necessary. Gaylor also said: Steubenville is a theocracy and is a Christian city where non-Christians or non-believers are not favored citizens. While we understand that Franciscan University is a part of the city, the city may not depict the university chapel and cross because to do so places the city's imprimatur behind Christianity. Before the reference to Franciscan University was deleted, the logo featured images of downtown Steubenville and various landmarks, such as Fort Steuben, the Veterans Memorial Bridge and Franciscan University’s Christ the King Chapel. Mark Nelson, who designed the logo, made the point that Los Angeles County, when challenged by the ACLU in 2004 about the cross on its official seal, was able to retain the chapel and only lose the cross. The bottom line was conceded by Steubenville’s legal expert Gary Repella, who said that redesigning the logo minus any reference to religious faith was easier and cheaper than going head-to-head in court with the FFRF. When an out-of-town group can bully a city about what it can or cannot put on its logo by twisting the Constitution and get away with it, it’s time for those of faith to gin up and fight back.</Msg><Username>chronosthegrimreaper</Username><Timestamp>1344319357000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 02:02:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344319449000-8</Id><Title>Obama-Holder seek to deny all military a fair right to vote!</Title><Msg>Because they will not vote got Obama!</Msg><Username>chronosthegrimreaper</Username><Timestamp>1344319449000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 02:04:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344342370000-9</Id><Topic><Title>rightwingers are big on religious freedom, huh?</Title><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1344282425000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 15:47:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>christian ayatollahs are here, who cares what egyptians do , moron? and the right wing christain ayatollahs here preach hate , intolerance and racism everday. they denounce other religions, they claim THEY are the only true religion, they burn down mosques, the rant about "sharia", yet they want to kill separation of church and state, they refuse to marry blacks and some of their lunatic members go on racist murder rampages.</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1344342370000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 08:26:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344345564000-10</Id><Topic><Title>If he had an honest tax certificate, why wouldn't he show it?</Title><Username>dropkickuuuuuuu</Username><Timestamp>1344290049000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 17:54:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That must explain why Harry Reid has never released any tax returns and refuses to do so.</Msg><Username>goodnicknamesaregone</Username><Timestamp>1344345564000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 09:19:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344345853000-11</Id><Topic><Title>Did you see this report (ORCL)?</Title><Username>jacquidgi06180</Username><Timestamp>1344265673000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 11:07:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I will be waiting for more great news to come.</Msg><Username>townsend_heather596</Username><Timestamp>1344345853000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 09:24:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344347654000-12</Id><Topic><Title>I don't care but presidential candidates relese things others don't and they should.</Title><Username>dropkickuuuuuuu</Username><Timestamp>1344345791000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 09:23:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You mean like college transcripts.</Msg><Username>goodnicknamesaregone</Username><Timestamp>1344347654000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 09:54:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344347721000-13</Id><Title>Obama Has Never Run On "His Record"...

Every week one of them has to retract something they called news. You believe their lies, what's the problem? That's rich, a seasoned liar like messy calling Fox liars. As much as you lie, I suspect you're distorting what Fox really said in protecting it's freedom of press. You are like most Obamanites, I don't believe much of what you babble.</Msg><Username>passthebuckaroo</Username><Timestamp>1344375215000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 17:33:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344375626000-63</Id><Topic><Title>Fox news license to lie</Title><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1344371930000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 16:38:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>what a laugh you are.

A single home in Florida filed 741 different tax returns in a single year, receiving more than $1 million in refunds. The Sun Sentinel says the findings were released in a report issued by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration. The independent watchdog group oversees the IRS. "The report really underscores just how bad a problem ID tax fraud is in Florida and around the country," said U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, who asked the Treasury Inspector General last year to investigate the extent of the problem. "It's become an epidemic that's costing law-abiding U.S. taxpayers billions of dollars. And it's one we've got to fix. That's why I've filed legislation aimed at putting a stop to these fraudsters." http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/sideshow/florida-home-files-741-tax-returns-single-gets-232459645.html</Msg><Username>free2491</Username><Timestamp>1344392239000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 22:17:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
