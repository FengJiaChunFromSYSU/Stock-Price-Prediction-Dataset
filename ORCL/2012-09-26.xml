I am conscious that an equal division of property is impracticable. But the consequences of this enormous inequality producing so much misery to the bulk of mankind, legislators cannot invent too many devices for subdividing property, only taking care to let their subdivisions go hand in hand with the natural affections of the human mind. Another means of silently lessening the inequality of property is to exempt all from taxation below a certain point, and to tax the higher portions of property in geometrical progression as they rise. Whenever there is in any country, uncultivated lands and unemployed poor, it is clear that the laws of property have been so far extended as to violate natural right. The earth is given as a common stock for man to labor and live on." --Thomas Jefferson to James Madison, October 28,1785.

Omran Ben Shaaban, 22, was kidnapped by armed men in July in the oasis town of Bani Walid, which was a final bastion of Kadhafi loyalists in the 2011 conflict, his brother Walid told AFP. Shaaban tried to escape his assailants but they caught up with him and shot him in the neck and stomach, Walid added. The Misrata native was freed 50 days later in critical condition thanks to the mediation efforts of Mohammed Megaryef, president of the ruling General National Congress (GNC), who visited Bani Walid last week. But he later died in a French hospital where he was sent for treatment, Walid said. On Tuesday, a private plane flew Omar Ben Chaaban's corpse to the coastal city of Misrata where his family, friends and well-wishers were waiting. This former rebel had shot to fame last year with several photographs and videos showing him grabbing Kadhafi at the moment of his capture on October 20, 2011 in Sirte, before he was killed. His death puts an added strain on the already tense relationship between Misrata and Bani Walid, neighbouring but historically rival towns which found themselves on opposite sides of the 2011 conflict. Former rebels from Misrata and other Libyan cities consider that Bani Walid was not "liberated" of the "remnants" of former regime loyalists. "We will take revenge militarily but legitimately," said Walid Ben Shaaban who commands a brigade made up of ex-rebel fighters. "We will give the authorities an opportunity to tackle the issue but if they fail to act, we know how to make our move," he told AFP. Late Tuesday, the GNC, which is the highest political authority, ordered the ministries of defence and interior to find those who kidnapped Shaaban and "use force if necessary." It also issued a statement published on the official LANA news agency lamenting the "loss of a brave hero" and vowing to take all necessary measures to bring the perpetrators to justice. In July, fighters in Misrata threatened to attack Bani Walid after two journalists from their city were kidnapped there. A crisis was averted thanks to intense mediation by the authorities who obtained the men's release.</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1348666463854</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 09:34:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348666499353-6</Id><Topic><Title>gop nonsense of "broadening the base"...Romney camp says Romney will "give on his tax cuts"</Title><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1348603051452</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-25 15:57:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In an interview with Carl Cameron of FOX News today, Mitt Romney and his running mate Paul Ryan implied that President Barack Obama is attempting to cover up the details of what happened during the assault on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya.

We expect candor, we expect transparency, particularly, as it relates to terrorism," Romney said. "Why is he (Obama) not on the same page with his own administration officials who are saying that this is a terrorist attack?

Had this error not been corrected, thousands of Wisconsin servicemen and women could have been disenfranchised in this key swing state this November. The FVAB website incorrectly stated ballots must be returned by November 16. The actual deadline is 4 p.m. November 9. Any military ballots received in that intervening week would not have been counted by local and state election officials. MacIver News Service contacted the Wisconsin Government Accountability Board about the error on Tuesday and requested comment. "All Wisconsin absentee ballots are due by 4 p.m. the Friday after the election. The FVAP site was incorrect," said Reid Magney, GAB spokesman in an emailed response to the inquiry. Ballots must be postmarked no later than Election Day, which in 2012 is Tuesday, November 6th. According to their website, The FVAP provides U.S. citizens worldwide a broad range of non-partisan information and assistance to facilitate their participation in the democratic process - regardless of where they work or live. The FVAP also administers the Federal responsibilities of the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA), which designates armed forces recruiting offices nationwide as voter registration agencies allowing eligible U.S. citizens to apply for voter registration, or apply to change voter registration data.</Msg><Username>liberals_plague_humanity</Username><Timestamp>1348666521846</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 09:35:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348668968134-8</Id><Topic><Title>gop nonsense of "broadening the base"...Romney camp says Romney will "give on his tax cuts"</Title><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1348603051452</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-25 15:57:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Lib media using false projections will lower Dem voter turnout.

Low-wage work force grows 30% as number of jobs shrinks... Household Incomes Down 8.2% Under Obama... 55 percent of small business owners would not start company today, blame Obama September 26, 2012 | 10:39 am Fifty-five percent of small business owners and manufacturers would not have started their businesses in today’s economy, according to a new poll that also reports 69 percent say President Obama’s regulatory policies have hurt their businesses. “There is far too much uncertainty, too many burdensome regulations and too few policymakers willing to put aside their egos and fulfill their responsibilities to the American people,” said Jay Thomas, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, which commissioned the poll along with the National Federation of Independent Businesses. “To fix this problem, we need immediate action on pro-growth tax and regulatory policies that put manufacturers in the United States in a position to compete and succeed in an ever-more competitive global economy.” The poll reports another ominous statistic for job creation: “67 percent say there is too much uncertainty in the market today to expand, grow or hire new workers.” Why? Because “President Obama’s Executive Branch and regulatory policies have hurt American small businesses and manufacturers,” according to 69 percent of the business owners surveyed. Here are the key findings in the poll, as highlighted by NAM: 67 percent say there is too much uncertainty in the market today to expand, grow or hire new workers. 69 percent of small business owners and manufacturers say President Obama’s Executive Branch and regulatory policies have hurt American small businesses and manufacturers. 55 percent say they would not start a business today given what they know now and in the current environment. 54 percent say other countries like China and India are more supportive of their small businesses and manufacturers than the United States. “Instead of smoothing the way, our government continues to erect more barriers to growth through burdensome regulations that increase costs for small businesses and all Americans,” NFIB president Dan Danner said. Those statistics suggest that even Democratic and independent small business owners criticized Obama, because only 46 percent of poll participants identified as Republicans, per Roll Call. “It’s clear that small business owners and manufacturers are becoming increasingly more frustrated by the federal government’s inability to solve America’s economic problems,” Bill McInturff, whose Public Opinion Strategies conducted the poll. “Manufacturers place most of the blame squarely on policies coming out of Washington.”</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1348676346582</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 12:19:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348676458259-34</Id><Title>Obama fascists</Title><Msg>The standard lib response to reason is: S*T*F*U.

Likely voters by a 49 percent to 25 percent margin, or two-to-one, say they are less likely to vote for Obama because he included taxpayer funding of abortion in Obamacare. A whopping 54 percent are less likely to back him due to his vote against a law to give equal treatment to babies born alive after a failed abortion. And 69 percent reject the administration's mandate that forces faith-based institutions to provide insurance that covers birth control. "This survey shows that a few straightforward, specific facts about President Obama and abortion shock the collective conscience of swing voters in battleground states," said pollster Kellyanne Conway. "His support for taxpayer-funded abortion, opposition to Born-Alive Infant protections and 'intimidation through regulation' foisted upon religious organizations draws the ire of between one-half and two-thirds of the voters surveyed," she said. The poll was conducted by Conway's firm, the polling company, for the Susan B. Anthony List, a group opposed to abortion. The group's president Marjorie Dannenfelser said, "pro-life voters make up a sizable voting bloc capable of achieving victory in close elections. President Obama's record of supporting abortion for any reason and at any time is so extreme that even supporters are turning away."</Msg><Username>liberalsarecancer</Username><Timestamp>1348687093442</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 15:18:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348689492947-50</Id><Topic><Title>Obama sticking to silly movie excuse</Title><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1348676874158</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 12:27:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Citing uncertainty over the impending “fiscal cliff” and lower demand overseas, an association of CEOs from top companies on Wednesday dropped its growth expectations for the third quarter to the lowest level since the middle of the Great Recession. The Business Roundtable lowered projections for sales, capital spending and hiring in its latest CEO Economic Outlook Survey to the lowest level since 2009. The fiscal cliff — an end-of-the-year deadline for a long-term budget deal between Republican and Democratic lawmakers — has businesses putting off hiring and spending decisions, because they don’t know what to expect in the coming months and years, said Jim McNerney, the CEO of Boeing who also heads the Business Roundtable. “This complete Mexican standoff that we have now is not getting us anywhere,” he told reporters. Business Roundtable President John Engler called it a “fiscal Everest.” “This is something that urgently needs to be addressed,” Mr. Engler said. “This is the same problem the NFL is having. The players aren’t quite clear how to play the game, because the refereeing is so bad.” Mr. Engler urged lawmakers to take action now to avoid the automatic spending cuts and tax increases set to kick if if no deal is made. “We can lead, but you can’t lead by not making decisions,” he said. Only 58 percent of the CEOs who responded expect sales to increase, down from 75 percent last quarter, while the number of CEOs who expect a decline in sales nearly tripled to 15 percent, due in large part to weaker demand in Europe and China. Companies are also slowing capital spending and hiring because of uncertainties in the U.S. tax and regulatory environments. Only 30 percent expect to increase spending, down from 43 percent last quarter, while 19 percent plan to cut back on spending, up from 12 percent. Meanwhile, only 29 percent expect to boost hiring, down from 36 percent, while 34 percent expect to make layoffs or other declines in employment, up from 20 percent.

What did the gop tantrum on debt ceiling accomplish? just ONE thing.....sabotage of the USA economic recovery: "In 2011, congressional Republicans came closer than ever before to breaching the debt ceiling and setting off a global financial crisis. In the end, they pulled back moments before we toppled into the abyss. But by then, they had already done serious damage to the recovery. Early in the year, the economy seemed to be gathering momentum. In February, it added 220,000 jobs. In March, it added 246,000 jobs. In April, 251,000 jobs. But as markets began to take the Republican threats on the debt ceiling more seriously, the economy sputtered. Between May and August, the nation never added more than 100,000 jobs a month. And then, in September, the month after the debt ceiling was resolved, the economy sped back up and added more than 200,000 jobs."

That affects EVERYBODY *** Dropkick and the people Howard Stern talked to on the streets of Harlem comprise the idiot majority manipulated by lib media. Austerity protests are coming to America. Obama has put USA into a Greek Hole in 4 short years. He should be tarred and feathered not re-elected. Obama is the biggest fraud ever. We are repeating 1937. Obama will blame the Republicans. He takes responsibility for nothing therefore he should not be in office. Now he says he accepts responsibility (for a sound bite on TV commercials), so he should resign before the world goes into a Global Depression caused by Obama. IMPEACH OBAMA NOW. IMPEACH PELOSI NOW.

Subway System By Tim Graham | September 26, 2012 | 17:00 757 549 Reddit69 62 A A Tim Graham's picture The New York Post reported Egyptian-American columnist Mona Eltahawy has been arrested for defacing an anti-Muslim ad in the New York subway system. The video shows her spraying pink paint on the ad while a supporter of the ad tries to block her. She's a journalist for censorship. Eltahawy, a former Reuters correspondent, has been a recent favorite of CNN and MSNBC’s weekend morning shows to discuss Egypt, and she often smears together the Islamist “right wing” and the American right wing, as she did on Melissa Harris-Perry just 11 days ago [video and transcript below]: Story Continues Below Ad ↓ ELTAHAWY: We [Egyptians] have a president who is trying to establish his position somewhere in the middle and we have a group that is trying to establish themselves on the right wing. And you`re having a similar situation in the U.S. We are coming up to elections now in less than two months. There is a right wing fringe there as well. So, you`ve got a right wing and a right wing. Both minorities, both trying to provoke people and a whole lot of people with very, very, sometimes legitimate grievances, but sometimes utterly senseless grievances, being caught in the middle. Eltahawy was even featured on the September 15 NBC Nightly News decrying America’s long-term support for Egyptian dictators.
