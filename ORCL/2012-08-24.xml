Eventually, he will be censured. At the Democrat Convention he will announce that he is stepping down as VP "for the good of the Party." There will be a DRAFT HILLARY FOR VP movement: How could she decline? This fits right in with Obama’s pandering to women and complaints that Republicans have a “War on Women.” Obama will claim that his ticket has “Diversity” which young people have been taught to value. The Democrat base will be energized to vote for Obama-Clinton! *** Great idea. I've been suggesting this for years. Obama should have picked Hillary as VP.

Rep. Lamar Smith, the Texan who runs the committee, said the Obama administration has for the past several years been mixing some Border Patrol apprehensions with the deportation statistics from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency chiefly responsible for interior enforcement and for deporting aliens. His investigation found that when the Border Patrol numbers are subtracted, deportations actually have gone down every year since Mr. Obama first took office in 2009, dropping from about 395,000 that year to about 330,000 in 2011. And 2012 is shaping up to have even fewer deportations once the Border Patrol figures are subtracted, the committee said. “It is dishonest to count illegal immigrants apprehended by the Border Patrol along the border as ICE removals,” Mr. Smith said. “These ‘removals’ from the Border Patrol program do not subject the illegal immigrant to any penalties or bars for returning to the U.S. This means a single illegal immigrant can show up at the border and be removed numerous times in a single year — and counted each time as a removal.” ICE did not directly dispute Mr. Smith’s claim.

"Chicago is an example of what makes this country great," Obama said. His audience applauded. Barack Obama meets with, from left, James Jones, Rahm Emanuel, and Tom Donilon. Barack Obama meets with, from left, James Jones, Rahm Emanuel, and Tom Donilon. President Obama's proof for his assertion? The donors in the room, who had given to his reelection campaign. "Witness this room," Obama said. And he elaborated: "[W]e've got everything we need to make things work here in America. We still have the best workers in the world. (Applause.) We've still got the best entrepreneurs in the world. We've got the best colleges, the best universities, the best scientists, the best researchers. We're a young nation, and we've got the greatest diversity of talent and ingenuity from every corner of the globe." But what President Obama did not address is Chicago's homicide rate, one of the highest in the nation. "[M]ore Chicago residents -- 228 -- have been killed so far this year in the city than the number of U.S. troops killed in Afghanistan - 144 -- over the same period," the Huffington Post noted in June. "The war zone-like statistics are not new. As WBEZ reports, while some 2,000 U.S. troops have been killed in Afghanistan since 2001, more than 5,000 people have been killed by gun fire in Chicago during that time, based on Department of Defense and FBI data. Chicago's murder rate is also currently quadruple that of New York and double Los Angeles' rate."

There are 228 dead: That's the number of murders this year in Chicago. It's nearly twice as many as the number of Americans lost on the battlefields of Afghanistan over these last six months. And the number of deaths is up 35 percent over the same period last year. There was a time it was called "gangland" Chicago and maybe that time has returned. Chicago's mayor, Rahm Emanuel, was formerly President Obama's chief of staff.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1345857076000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 21:11:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345857331000-137</Id><Topic><Title>The Tough Question for Democrats</Title><Username>wearelegion100000</Username><Timestamp>1345848211000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 18:43:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>http://www.breitbart.com/Breitbart-TV/2012/08/24/Cooper-To-DWS-Why-Are-You-Lying</Msg><Username>liberals_plague_humanity</Username><Timestamp>1345857331000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 21:15:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345861381000-138</Id><Title>Does anyone discuss Oracle on this board?</Title><Msg>Big fan of the stock.
