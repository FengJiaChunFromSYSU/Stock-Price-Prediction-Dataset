Buy low, sell high. That simple investment strategy works well over and over again. An investment opportunity presents itself when a great company is beaten down in the stock market. Recently, Oracle (NASDAQ: ORCL) dropped significantly, from around $36.30 per share to nearly $32 per share, losing more than 11.8% of its total market value. The huge decrease in its stock price was caused by its recent, weaker-than-expected earnings results. Should investors consider this drop an investment opportunity? Let’s find out. A small earnings glitch Oracle generated nearly $8.96 billion in revenue and non-GAAP earnings of $0.65 per share, lower than analysts’ estimates of $9.38 billion revenue and $0.66 EPS, respectively. While revenue from software license updates and product support experienced a year-over-year growth of 7% to $4.34 billion, revenue from new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions declined nearly 2% to $2.3 billion. GAAP net income experienced a small decline of 1% to $3.1 billion. GAAP EPS came in at $0.52, a 6% growth compared to the EPS last year. The increase in GAAP EPS was partly due to the share buybacks in the past twelve months. Oracle’s shares outstanding have been reduced from more than 5 billion to around 4.81 billion. A cash cow with a strong balance sheet What makes me interested is Oracle’s strong balance sheet. As of February 2013, it had nearly $43.8 billion in total stockholders’ equity, $16.1 billion in cash, $17.3 billion in marketable securities, and nearly $20 billion in both long and short-term notes payable and borrowings. As Oracle has made a lot of acquisitions to grow its business over the years, it had a high goodwill amount of more than $26.1 billion. Moreover, the business is really a cash cow. In the past ten years, while its operating cash flow increased from $3 billion in 2003 to $13.7 billion in 2012, its free cash flow rose from $2.7 billion to more than $13 billion in the same period. Interestingly, Oracle is one of favorites stocks of Lou Simpson, a successful investment manager that Warren Buffett admires. Lou Simpson increased his holdings in Oracle nearly 45% in the fourth quarter of 2012. As of December 2012, with 3 million shares, Oracle became Lou Simpson's third biggest position, accounting for 8.5% of his total portfolio. The highest operating margin business with the lowest valuation At around $31 per share, Oracle is worth around $148 billion on the market. The market values Oracle at only 7.78 times EV/EBITDA. Compared to its other tech peers, including International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM) and SAP AG (NYSE: SAP), Oracle is valued the cheapest. SAP, at around $80 per share, has a total market capitalization of $95 billion. It has the most expensive valuation among the three, at nearly 15.6 times EV/EBITDA. IBM is the biggest company, with more than $235 billion in total market cap. At around $211 per share, IBM is valued reasonably at 9.7 times EV/EBITDA. Among the three, Oracle has the highest operating margin. Its operating margin, at around 40%, is nearly two times higher than that of IBM, while IBM generates more than 21% operating margin. The operating margin of SAP is a bit higher at 25.1%. However, in terms of return on invested capital, IBM is a top-notch with nearly 31.4% ROIC, while the ROIC of Oracle and SAP are 16.7% and 19.3%. My Foolish take Oracle, after a significant drop, represents a good investment opportunity for investors due to its strong balance sheet, superb cash flow growth, and low valuation. Investors might feel more confident as Oracle is one of the top positions in Lou Simpson’s portfolio.</Msg><Username>sportycarman</Username><Timestamp>1364298090962</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 07:41:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364301859994-4</Id><Topic><Title>Interesting article on ORCL</Title><Username>sportycarman</Username><Timestamp>1364298090962</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 07:41:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I would like to add that I am neither bullish nor bearish on this stock - just thought it looked like it belonged on this borad</Msg><Username>sportycarman</Username><Timestamp>1364301859994</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 08:44:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364302319760-5</Id><Title>.Search resultsAlameda County rewards boss: $400k…for life | Matier And ...</Title><Msg>Disgusting nd it's all over at all govt levals and it'snot as though these people are helping us ether.

Over time the majority of guns will be possessed by criminals The best law they can pass is one that seriously fines a legal gun owner if their gun is stolen and they can't prove it was secured properly... This is easy because all they have to do is require hand guns to be stored in a gun safe.... IF you report your gun stolen and there is no evidence of your safe being broken open... you pay the fine... You fail to report your gun stolen and its used in a crime and the fine should be 10xs what it would have been if it was stolen from your nightstand not properly secured Remember IF you're home and your gun is in a drawer... it is highly unlikely that your gun would be stolen as you would get to it first and you would put a bullet between the eyes of the perp like that black kid did to that white baby... But on the chance your gun was stolen while you were present... either you would know the perp or you could give a damn good description It would be a common sense law but it is way beyond the imagination of dems to think of it</Msg><Username>central_scrutinizer_fz</Username><Timestamp>1364306163779</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 09:56:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364306642545-13</Id><Title>So Mark Kelly made fradulent statements on the application to buy the AR-15 in AZ</Title><Msg>Gee wiz... that's a felony... exactly the type of felony he is trying to prevent with his lobbying I think he should step up to the plate and go directly to jail and do his 7 years... you know.. to set a good example</Msg><Username>central_scrutinizer_fz</Username><Timestamp>1364306642545</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 10:04:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364306655817-14</Id><Topic><Title>Now was that 17 yr old black thug using his own legally registered gun?

Wolf Blitzer's show The Situation Room on CNN uncovered a contract apparently also related to the same visit to Paris: Also on the receipt was $321,665 for a limousine company. Although CNN did not link to the document, the notice of the contract award for the limousine service was posted on the same government website as the hotel contracts.

Last week, the IRS apologized for spending $60,000 on the parody, which was intended to be used as a training video. Lawmakers — and now the show’s star actor — have blasted it as a senseless use of taxpayer money. “So I watched that IRS video. I am appalled at the utter waste of U.S. tax dollars,” Shatner tweeted Tuesday Morning. The six-minute “Star Trek” video made in Maryland was shown to agency employees at a conference in 2010. In the video, IRS workers are meticulously dressed as characters from the popular TV show and are flying a staged space craft towards the planet “Notax.” Shatner, who is known for his distinct style of overacting, didn’t weigh in on the performance seen in the video. The IRS has called the video a “mistake” and promised to clamp down on similar productions in the future. "The IRS recognizes and takes seriously our obligation to be good stewards of government resources and taxpayer dollars," the agency said. "There is no mistaking that this video did not reflect the best stewardship of resources."</Msg><Username>liberals_plague_humanity</Username><Timestamp>1364312281571</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 11:38:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364313267794-18</Id><Topic><Title>ORCL Report and Stock Poll</Title><Username>moyasefangelina</Username><Timestamp>1361889545234</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 09:39:05 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This is what I am looking for.</Msg><Username>resbaladizocaroline</Username><Timestamp>1364313267794</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 11:54:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364313645791-19</Id><Title>Orale</Title><Msg>pray for $50</Msg><Username>alfredo2030</Username><Timestamp>1364313645791</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 12:00:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364313969994-20</Id><Topic><Title>Great stuff from today, look at this!</Title><Username>rayrogers37</Username><Timestamp>1364307979713</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 10:26:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>interesting predictions!</Msg><Username>steve.henderson71</Username><Timestamp>1364313969994</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 12:06:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364314504412-21</Id><Topic><Title>ORCL Report and Stock Poll</Title><Username>moyasefangelina</Username><Timestamp>1361889545234</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 09:39:05 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nice one.
