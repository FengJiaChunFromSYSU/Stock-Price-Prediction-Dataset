It is a gigantic Ponzi swindle where monetized debt is created but the money to pay the interest on that debt is not. This is why we have an ever progressing deficit and inflation. If yo REALLY care write your Congress Person and ask for a copy of the original "Fed" act and subsequent revisions by the Government Printing Office. I have one I got in the early 60's that was printed in 1958. I also got a booklet on gold and silver regs.

The Michigan Republican Party is alleging that a poll watcher in Detroit on Tuesday morning was threatened with a gun. According to the Michigan GOP the poll watcher's 911 call was rejected. Below is a press release from Michigan Republican Party spokesman Matt Frendeway: This morning, a legally credentialed poll watcher was threatened and intimidated while attempting to perform his legally allowed duties of observing the election process at precinct polling location 289 in Detroit. The poll watcher, a lawyer, was confronted by a voter in line, who demanded the poll watcher produce his credentials, which he did. However, the voter said that wasn’t good enough and that he had “a badge and a gun” and told the poll watcher get out of the precinct. Rather than allow the situation to escalate, the poll watcher left before the voter produced a badge or brandished a gun. Fearing for his safety, the poll watcher exited and called 911, however the Detroit Police refused to respond to the call – neglecting the fact that a voter alleged to have a ‘badge’ and a ‘gun’ in a precinct, putting other voters at risk. Michigan Republican Party Chairman Bobby Schostak issued a statement concerning the issue the following statement:“Poll watchers, precinct workers and voters should not be put in danger when performing their duties, our Republic requires free and fair elections. “I can only hope that this morning’s outlandish, reckless and dangerous behavior, was not part of a coordinated effort by the Democratic Party and therefore, I am calling on Mark Brewer, Democratic Party Chairman, to condemn these threats of violence and pledge to ensuring all election workers, volunteers and citizens remain safe.”</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1352225917244</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-06 13:18:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352226225448-24</Id><Title>As Yogi Berra Said</Title><Msg>It's deja vu all over again.

Keep calm? Calm as opposed to what? In a conference call this afternoon, President Barack Obama’s re-election campaign had one central message for their supporters when Election Day arrives tomorrow: They should “keep calm,” even if they hear snippets of information favoring Republican Mitt Romney. “My warning, we need to stay calm for much of the day,” Stephanie Cutter, Mr. Obama’s deputy campaign manager, said, touting thousands of early ballots already submitted by voters. “We’ve already banked a pretty big portion of our vote.” The fear, she explained, was early numbers leaking before voters have finished going to the polls, creating unnecessary panic and pessimism among Democrats. “Keep calm and tweet on,” Ms. Cutter said. “So, no matter what you hear tomorrow about turnout in Republican counties or exit polls, particularly early in the day, please remember and remind your readers that, because of early votes, we’re where we need to be to win….I don’t think there’s going to be official exits until the end of the day, but if things leak out that aren’t validated or weighted, please stay calm.”</Msg><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1352230043622</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-06 14:27:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352230091362-35</Id><Title>Romney cares so little about you he won't even take questions from the press</Title><Msg>yep, not only does Romney not care for most Americans, he won't even take any questions from the press, so all you get from him is the horse manure from him or his rearend lickers: "Romney hasn't taken a question from his traveling press pool since late September and unless you count his sit-down with Chris Berman on Monday Night Football as an interview, he hasn't done an interview with any independent media outlet since Oct. 12.

By the looks of it Romney will have none.........even if he is elected..... Romney is afraid to talk to people on live tv for one thing, obama was on the O'reilly show once..... has Romney done ANYTHING like THAT? Mitt Romney refused to participate in a Nickelodeon special and answer questions from kids.....like obama did. Romney has refused to be interviewed and take the questions of young voters on MTV. Obama did that ditto for Letterman.... and Romney threw a tanrum at unavision and refuse to go by the rules, unlike Obama: "President Obama and his campaign team simply accepted the terms of the event, and agreed to follow Univision's rules, including prioritizing the role of students at the University of Miami event, without incident. Romney and his team had a different idea -- when they couldn't find enough University of Miami students who liked Romney, the campaign demanded that Univision drop its "students-only" rule and allow Team Romney to bus in hand-picked supporters to fill the seats. The campaign threatened to cancel the televised event unless Univision and organizers met Romney's demands. Organizers backed down (the University of Miami forum was coordinated by a local Romney campaign official). The bused-in Republican activists proceeded to ignore Univision requests to hold their applause, turning the forum into more of a pro-Romney rally. Wait, it gets worse. Univision's Jorge Ramos, welcoming the audience to the forum, noted that Romney had agreed to a 35-minute event, while Obama would be on set the next night for a full hour. Ramos then invited the audience to welcome Romney to the stage, but the Republican didn't show. Romney was sulking and had more demands. Apparently, Romney took issue with the anchors beginning the broadcast that way, said Salinas, and he refused to go on stage until they re-taped the introduction. (One Republican present at the taping said Romney "threw a tantrum.") "Our president of news was talking to the Romney campaign and negotiating it," Salinas said. "But at that point, you can't really argue with that. The candidate is there, everyone is in their seats, the show must go on. There's a limit to how much we can object to it."</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1352232322679</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-06 15:05:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352232890780-41</Id><Topic><Title>Romney cares so little about you he won't even take questions from the press</Title><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1352230091362</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-06 14:28:11 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>hardly Mesa.

(Felicia Sonmez/Washington Post via Instagram) MOON TOWNSHIP, Pa. — Mitt Romney walked out of his campaign jet at Pittsburgh International Airport here Tuesday afternoon and was met by an unexpected sight: hundreds upon hundreds of supporters packed into the top and middle levels of a nearby parking garage, cheering the candidate’s arrival. A visibly moved Romney, clad in a white shirt and slacks, stepped into the late afternoon sun and walked across the tarmac to a spot near a metal fence separating him from the supporters in the garage. Press entourage in tow, he waved to the crowd for several moments, saying nothing. Afterward, a reporter asked Romney how the moment made him feel. “That’s when you know you’re gonna win,” he said as he walked back across the tarmac and into an SUV that carried him off to his second stop of the day. The moment came two days after he held a rally across the state, near Philadelphia, that drew tens of thousands of supporters who braved freezing temperatures to see the Republican candidate. Both events were a reminder of the gamble that Romney has made in Pennsylvania, a state that has eluded GOP presidential candidates for decades where Romney, like Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) before him, has launched an 11th-hour effort.</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1352237905984</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-06 16:38:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352238424521-47</Id><Title>omg, if romney wins</Title><Msg>the gop will have to finally shut up about the "entitlements" of medicare and social security, Romney has promised they will be unchanged for all on them and all near being on them, meaning most of the boomers.................nice!........... and plus the full entitlements, MORE tax cuts!!
