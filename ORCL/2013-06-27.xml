If there’s something that Paula Deen loves more than butter, it’s black waiters serving wedding guests “Southern plantation style.” At least that’s the takeaway from the unedited transcript of her deposition in the $1.2 million discrimination lawsuit filed against the First Lady of Finger Lickin’ Food and her brother, Earl “Bubba” Hiers. In her testimony, Deen admits to using the N-word, reveals her ambivalence towards people watching pornography at a place of work, and—the arguably racist, definitely bizarre bit that’s made headlines Wednesday—details the Southern plantation wedding of her dreams, in which black waiters serve guests slave-style.</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1372337931315</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-27 08:58:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372341135654-3</Id><Title>Any PC Trash Media Celeb Who Has Spewed Racist Epithets Like #$%$" &amp; "Cracker"...</Title><Msg>or "Spic", #$%$", "Nip", "Honky", "Gringo", "Hymie", "Paddy", #$%$" or Peckerhead at any time over the last 30 years needs to be fired immediately!!

The sanitizing of Rachel Jeantel’s Twitter account came as the 19-year-old Miami resident prepared to take the stand and testify about a phone call she had with Trayvon Martin immediately before the unarmed 17-year-old was shot to death by Zimmerman in February 2012. In relating that conversation, Jeantel has told investigators that a “scared” Martin said he was being followed by an unknown white man who demanded to know what the teen was doing inside the Retreat at Twin Lakes, a gated community in Sanford, Florida. Jeantel contends that she heard Martin ask the man, “Why you following me for?” before she heard someone “bump” the teenager. “Next thing I hear…the phone is shut off,” Jeantel told investigators in an April 2012 interview. Jeantel’s testimony may allow prosecutors to further portray Zimmerman, a 29-year-old neighborhood watch commander, as Martin’s pursuer, an armed aggressor who profiled the black teen before murdering him with a single gunshot to the chest. As TSG reported yesterday, Jeantel, pictured above, maintains a Twitter account (@MsRachel_94) to which she has made more than 200 posts over the past five months. Many of the teenager’s tweets referred to drinking, smoking, and getting high. She also made references to Martin’s death, referred to acquaintances as #$%$” and #$%$,” and wrote about having “jack#$%$ lawyers on my #$%$.” Yesterday afternoon, after TSG sought to c</Msg><Username>liberals_plague_humanity</Username><Timestamp>1372349926120</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-27 12:18:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372350502463-19</Id><Topic><Title>You don’t want to miss out on DOMK</Title><Username>hstrickland595</Username><Timestamp>1372345768732</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-27 11:09:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I am buying this now</Msg><Username>isaiahhunter918</Username><Timestamp>1372350502463</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-27 12:28:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372351377151-20</Id><Topic><Title>for Mesa: IRS targeting conservative groups confirmed</Title><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1372342533642</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-27 10:15:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>well you had no problem with the former IRS Commissioner who was appointed by Bush</Msg><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1372351377151</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-27 12:42:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372351524703-21</Id><Title>Testimony shows the dead guy uttered racist epitaphs, yet Zimmerman is being painted as the racist</Title><Msg>....by the media.

Nokia also has a contract with Oracle for their outstanding HERE maps that are integrated into Oracles clients. Everyone knows about the Microsoft partnership. This means Microsoft can go to the Dept. of Defense and US Gov. and say we have the first real end to end solution that is secure from top to bottom and your employees only have to learn 1 operating system for all devices. Windows 8.1 will run on all devices including XBOX ONE which offers Skype HD video conference calling on any big screen tv. As easy to set up as plugging in a few cables. Everything including the phone automatically sync files to the Oracle Cloud. The maps are so accurate you. can track a vehicle in real time on every phone, you can wipe the phone remotely and the phones and laptops use the same OS. It is a winner combination and will boost this stock, Microsoft &amp; Nokia. Nokia stock price is under $4.00. I swear this little company is putting out some killer technology.

Among the differences cited by West: - In some accounts, she said race was an issue but not in others. - Jeantel testified Wednesday that her friend's last words were "Get off! Get off!" before Martin's phone went silent. But on Thursday, under cross-examination, she conceded that she hadn't mentioned that in her account of what happened to Martin's mother, Sybrina Fulton. She had left out some details to spare Fulton's feelings, and also because neither Fulton nor the Martin family attorney asked her directly about them, Jeantel said. - After Martin asks why he is being followed, Zimmerman responds, "What are you doing around here?" in one account by Jeantel. In another account, according to West, she says Zimmerman said, "What are you talking about?" Zimmerman, 29, could get life in prison if convicted of second-degree murder. Zimmerman followed Martin in his truck and called a police dispatch number before he and the teen got into a fight. Zimmerman has said he opened fire only after the teenager jumped him and began slamming his head against the concrete sidewalk. Zimmerman identifies himself as Hispanic and has denied the confrontation had anything to do with race, as Martin's family and their supporters have claimed. Jeantel testified Thursday that she thought race was an issue because Martin told her he was being followed by a white man. She told jurors on Wednesday that Martin had described being followed by a "creepy#$%$ cracker." "He was being followed," Jeantel said. But West responded, "It was racial because Trayvon put race in this?" The exchanges got testier as the day progressed. When asked by West if she had previously told investigators that she heard what sounded like somebody being hit at the end of her call with Martin, Jeantel said, "Trayvon got hit." "You don't know that? Do you? You don't know that Trayvon got hit," West answered angrily. "You don't know that Trayvon didn't at that moment take his fists and drive them into George Zimmerman's face." Later in the morning, West accused Jeantel of not calling police after Martin's phone went dead because she thought it was a fight he had provoked. "That's why you weren't worried. That's why you didn't do anything because Trayvon Martin started the fight and you knew that," West said.</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1372359976682</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-27 15:06:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372364851619-30</Id><Topic><Title>Testimony shows the dead guy uttered racist epitaphs, yet Zimmerman is being painted as the racist</Title><Username>coughingredink</Username><Timestamp>1372351524703</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-27 12:45:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Trayvon was a punk, no less, no more.

I've heard Blacks down through the years use that title referring to themselves and others oif their kind. But, if a white uses it it's "racist".
