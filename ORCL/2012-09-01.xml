I'm don't understand how putting your post at the top of the board list keeps you from having to bounce down to the one that is being replied to. Perhaps if the posts and replies had were numbered that might help some. We all know there are some frequent posters on both sides who only occasionally add something relevant, but 9 out of 10 times just disagree and/or badmouth. If Yahoo would give us a way to complain about them or limit people to say 10 posts a day or 50 a week that might lead to improvement in the amount of crap without content.</Msg><Username>economist_too</Username><Timestamp>1346479014440</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-01 01:56:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346480078653-2</Id><Topic><Title>Ryan the weasel liar</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1346439717692</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 15:01:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Both Ryan and Obama use the same savings from doing away with the costly "Medicare Advantage Plans", which only advantage the health insurance business.

Please cite a qualified economist who thinks otherwise. Bubble up (help the 99% and the 1% will benefit too) USED to work. Now the problem though is while giving the 99% more, some is spent on food, education and medical care, especially by those nearer the bottom. Some of them though and many of the rest spend the money on trinkets like fancy smart phones, fancy computers and giant TVs. That helps the poor in Asia but doesn't improve things here much.</Msg><Username>economist_too</Username><Timestamp>1346481311147</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-01 02:35:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346507075000-4</Id><Title>New Analysis onOracle CorporationSuggests Drop</Title><Msg>Wow!

Workers were trying Saturday afternoon to reform the base of the sculpture, built from sand brought in from Myrtle Beach, S.C., pounding and smoothing out the sand that had washed off the facade of the waist-up rendering of the chief executive. The sand sculpture was protected from above, and Mr. Obama's face didn't see too much damage. But the storm was so strong that its heavy winds blew the rain sideways, pelting the president's right side and leaving the sand pockmarked and completely erasing his right elbow. Democrats' choice of Charlotte has drawn criticism from unions who don't like North Carolina's labor laws, and the state seems to be tilting away from Democrats politically. The large Rushmore-style sculpture drew comparisons to Mr. Obama's 2008 convention in Denver, when he accepted his party's nomination on a stage that looked like a Greek temple.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1346553724237</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-01 22:42:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346553809624-14</Id><Topic><Title>GOP = trillions in tax cuts to rich, and trillions in tax hikes to the middle class</Title><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1346344200978</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 12:30:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Exclusive: U.S. Scales-Back Military Exercise with Israel, Affecting Potential Iran Strike A smaller U.S. contingent may make it more difficult for the Israeli government to launch a pre-emptive strike on Tehran's nuclear program. By Karl Vick and Aaron J. Klein | August 31, 2012 | 1657 inShare11 Seven months ago, Israel and the United States postponed a massive joint military exercise that was originally set to go forward just as concerns were brimming that Israel would launch a strike on Iran’s nuclear facilities. The exercise was rescheduled for late October, and appears likely to go forward on the cusp of the U.S. presidential election. But it won’t be nearly the same exercise. Well-placed sources in both countries have told TIME that Washington has greatly reduced the scale of U.S. participation, slashing by more than two-thirds the number of American troops going to Israel and reducing both the number and potency of missile interception systems at the core of the joint exercise. (PHOTOS: The Ultra-Holy City of Jerusalem) “Basically what the Americans are saying is, ‘We don’t trust you,’” a senior Israeli military official tells TIME. The reductions are striking. Instead of the approximately 5,000 U.S. troops originally trumpeted for Austere Challenge 12, as the annual exercise is called, the Pentagon will send only 1,500 service members, and perhaps as few as 1,200. Patriot anti-missile systems will arrive in Israel as planned, but the crews to operate them will not. Instead of two Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense warships being dispatched to Israeli waters, the new plan is to send one, though even the remaining vessel is listed as a “maybe,” according to officials in both militaries. (MORE: Will Iran’s Third-World Jamboree Hasten an Israeli Attack? Probably Not) A Pentagon spokesperson declined to discuss specifics of the reduced deployment, noting that planning for the exercise was classified. But in an e-mailed statement, Commander Wendy L. Snyder emphasized that the Israeli military has been kept informed of the changes. “Throughout all the planning and coordination, we’ve been lock-step with the Israel Defense Force (IDF) and will continue to do so,” Snyder said.</Msg><Username>liberals_plague_humanity</Username><Timestamp>1346553809624</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-01 22:43:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346554189261-15</Id><Topic><Title>GOP = trillions in tax cuts to rich, and trillions in tax hikes to the middle class</Title><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1346344200978</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 12:30:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Feds end probe of 'America's toughest sheriff' Joe Arpaio; no charges Federal attorneys announce that they will be shutting down their probe into whether Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio abused the power of his office. KPNX's Kevin Kennedy reports. By NBC News staff and wire services The federal government has closed a criminal probe of alleged financial misconduct by Arizona lawman Joe Arpaio, who styles himself as "America's toughest sheriff," and no charges will be filed, the U.S. Attorney's Office said on Friday. A separate federal investigation relating to allegations of civil rights abuses by Arpaio's office is continuing. The announcement on Friday marked the end of an investigation that began in November 2010 at the behest of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors to examine alleged financial improprieties by the county sheriff and his deputies. A federal criminal inquiry into several of those matters was concluded last summer with the U.S. Attorney's Office in Arizona declining to initiate criminal charges. Follow @NBCNewsUS Advertise | AdChoices Maricopa County authorities were informed on Friday that federal prosecutors had likewise declined to bring charges in connection with allegations that the sheriff's office had misused county credit cards or misspent money from jail facilities excise taxes.</Msg><Username>liberals_plague_humanity</Username><Timestamp>1346554189261</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-01 22:49:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
