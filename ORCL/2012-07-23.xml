He inherited a federal budget surplus of $236 billion, an unemployment rate of 4 percent and an average GDP growth rate for the previous four years of 4.4 percent. And the Dow was at 11,250. The economy was as good as it gets. Bush should have dampened the economy with increased taxes. Instead, like most Republicans, he ignored the Keynesian lessons of the Great Depression. He stimulated a bubble economy by cutting taxes and giving away the surplus. Romney's proposals to balance the budget in the midst of a weak economy reflect the same kind of perversity and refusal to learn from history. The Keynesianism that the Republicans reject is straightforward logic. A recession is by definition the existence of idle resources. So you put those resources to work by cutting taxes and increasing spending. Is that so hard to understand? " above from: Romney using Bush's failed playbook By PAUL HEISE Mitt Romney has clinched the Republican nomination, so it's time to ask what a Romney administration would be like. Since everyone agrees that the election will be about the economy, it makes sense to start the campaign off with that. Well, we have a model for what Republican economic policy is like: It is the George W. Bush administration. Bush was elected on the same platform Romney advocates: globalization, deregulation, privatization, and cuts in taxes and government spending."</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1343052115000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 10:01:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343052916000-19</Id><Topic><Title>gop will sacrifice the USA for tax cuts to the rich</Title><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1343050932000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 09:42:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Not only is it FAIR, but it will help the economy as the middleclass need to SPEND and WILL spend their tax cut and that will create jobs. ********** Obama's taxing the rich has a lot more to do with communism than fairness. The "middleclass" is a communist concept per se. The "middleclass" are not spending now, and the "tax cuts" have been in place for ten years. Leaving them in place will have no effect, except to provide stability. What would be most fair would be to entirely scrap the commie-progressive tax system and do a flat tax. Everybody pays 15% without deductions.</Msg><Username>balongnieponey</Username><Timestamp>1343052916000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 10:15:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343053553000-20</Id><Topic><Title>gop will sacrifice the USA for tax cuts to the rich</Title><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1343050932000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 09:42:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you must think the rich paying LESS a % than the middleclass in fair.

The growth rate of national health expenditures has been declining for a decade, driven by better medical care and consumer choice. New data show that health spending over the past several years has been normalizing toward the rate of general inflation, rather than growing higher and higher, as had been the case almost continuously since the 1970s. This moderation in the growth rate of spending predates the national recession. And it puts the lie to the claim that we need government to put the brakes on an "out-of-control" health-care system. As the graph nearby shows, the growth rate of national health expenditures, according to data compiled by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, has been moderating since 2002. http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204792404577227050656680024.html</Msg><Username>balongnieponey</Username><Timestamp>1343054749000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 10:45:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343054751000-26</Id><Topic><Title>Penn State lucky they aren't getting the death penalty</Title><Username>kollesteral</Username><Timestamp>1343013260000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-22 23:14:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>do you think Penn State would of imposed those sanctions and fines upon itself had not the NCAA done so? forfieting all games won for the past 14 years seems rather strange.</Msg><Username>kollesteral</Username><Timestamp>1343054751000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 10:45:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343054878000-27</Id><Topic><Title>Penn State lucky they aren't getting the death penalty</Title><Username>kollesteral</Username><Timestamp>1343013260000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-22 23:14:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Maybe would have been more appropriate to vacate Joe Paterno's record, not the whole schools.

This statistic flips on its head the often-repeated Republican charge that America has the second highest corporate tax rate in the world (which is only true on paper). In 2009, U.S. corporate taxes had fallen to only 1.3 percent of GDP, from 4 percent in 1965. "Recently, conservative commentator Bill Kristol chastised his own party for pretending that lowering the corporate tax rate is a cure-all for America’s economic woes.

Most economists agree with that and also add that it is essential for democracy as well. Thomas jefferson said the same: Another means of silently lessening the inequality of property is to exempt all from taxation below a certain point, and to tax the higher portions of property in geometrical progression as they rise. Whenever there is in any country, uncultivated lands and unemployed poor, it is clear that the laws of property have been so far extended as to violate natural right. The earth is given as a common stock for man to labor and live on." --Thomas Jefferson to James Madison, October 28,1785.

It found that 66 percent believe paltry job growth and slow economic recovery is the result of bad policy. Thirty-four percent say Obama is the most to blame, followed by 23 percent who say Congress is the culprit. Twenty percent point the finger at Wall Street, and 18 percent cite former President George W. Bush. The results highlight the reelection challenge Obama faces amid dissatisfaction with his first-term performance on the economy. The poll, conducted for The Hill by Pulse Opinion Research, found 53 percent of voters say Obama has taken the wrong actions and has slowed the economy down. Forty-two percent said he has taken the right actions to revive the economy, while six percent said they were not sure. Obama has argued throughout the presidential campaign that his policies have made the economy better. He says recovery is taking a long time because he inherited such deep economic trouble upon taking office in 2009. “The problems we’re facing right now have been more than a decade in the making,” he told an audience last month in Cleveland.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1343064475000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 13:27:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343064871000-54</Id><Topic><Title>The NCAA is Predictably Embarrassed</Title><Username>dropkickuuuuuu</Username><Timestamp>1343057260000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 11:27:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>oh is that how you see it?

Per your report: 6.

USA debt back on a sustainable path. *** I proved 2.3% growth is not "happy" economic times. Somewhere around 2.3% growth is where economy makes just enough jobs to keep pace with growth in population. *** 2. fiscal cliff is avoided and then gdp growth of 4.4% is achieved which, of course, means LESS debt compared to gdp. more people are working, more tax revenue and less spending on UE and so forth.... so AGAIN the debt situation is improved. *** I proved 4.4% growth is not likely anytime soon.

What magic is going to happen to increase growth to 4.4%? Not likely, even if we elect Romney. One of your former quotes included CBO saying deficit would be reduced by eliminating Bush Tax Cuts. This will increase taxes for all, during a recession, suppressing the economy. (e.g. Basic Keynesian theory here. Higher taxes pull money out of the economy leading to a slowdown!) Decrease in economy will result in lower tax revenue collected, even at higher rates. (This has already happened in several states, Maryland, for example. Maryland wanted a special new tax on the rich, if I recall.) If SPENDING remains the same dollar values while economy and tax revenue decreases, we will have a higher deficit, especially higher as a percent of GDP. So much for your professional experts at CBO.

Under that approach, which is the assumption about future policy that underlies CBO’s baseline projections, federal revenues would increase sharply, I realize that this is a DIFFICULT concept for you but eliminating the "Bush Tax Cuts" and reverting to the Clinton Tax Levels" would suppress the economy and decrease total tax revenue. So this first assumption is FALSE! (We are already in a recession, how much more of a recession do you want before we call it a DEPRESSION? 41 months of unemployment over 8% is coming pretty close!) *** &gt;&gt;&gt; and federal spending would be restrained somewhat relative to what would occur under current policies; By what magic will federal spending be "restrained"? If economy goes down and revenue goes down and spending dollars remain the same then spending as a percent of GDP will INCREASE! And NOTHING has "restrained" the Democrats from spending wildly for the last seven years, what magic good fairy is going to come by and convince them to be responsible now? Barack Obama? Harry Reid &amp; Nancy Pelosi? OR Mitt Romney? A Republican House? A Republican Senate by over 60 votes?</Msg><Username>orsa_novus</Username><Timestamp>1343097226000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 22:33:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343097536000-121</Id><Title>James Holmes looks like OWS Protester!</Title><Msg>Anybody else notice that?</Msg><Username>hollymackrelamos</Username><Timestamp>1343097536000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 22:38:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>11</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343099913000-122</Id><Title>Regarding freely available guns in the U.S.</Title><Msg>regarding the widespread availability of guns in the U.S., which the NRA and most right-wingers fervently support, because they fear govt over-reach: This may come back to bite them in the rear-end, as unemployed and hungry people toting weapons end up scaling the walls of gated communities in search of food. Food becoming very expensive (scarce?) due to climate change devastation/desertification of the nations breadbasket. All of a sudden the widespread guns become a cause for concern, and the same people crowing for them now will change their tune and start demanding police protection and suppression of the unruly masses. Funny how things go.</Msg><Username>egik_egak_egoogimak</Username><Timestamp>1343099913000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 23:18:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343100087000-123</Id><Topic><Title>James Holmes looks like OWS Protester!</Title><Username>hollymackrelamos</Username><Timestamp>1343097536000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 22:38:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And Mitt Romney looks like a poofta who models jackets and jeans for Land's End or L.L.Bean like who cares</Msg><Username>egik_egak_egoogimak</Username><Timestamp>1343100087000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 23:21:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
