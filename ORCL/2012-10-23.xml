The Navy said they needed 313 ships to carry out their mission. We’re now at under 285. We’re headed down to the low 200s if we go through a sequestration. That’s unacceptable to me.” Romney’s “1917” attack line comes from the Navy itself, which coined it under the leadership of onetime Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Gary Roughead in order to drum up support in Congress for its shipbuilding program.</Msg><Username>hikemanymiles</Username><Timestamp>1350993950184</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 08:05:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350995194099-3</Id><Topic><Title>Obama "Growled &amp; Snarled" His Way To A Pyrrhic Victory!!</Title><Username>moveon_moveoutnow</Username><Timestamp>1350960110326</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 22:41:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And Obama says he will "stand by" Israel if it is attacked.

The congresswoman said in an exclusive interview with Newsmax TV that Obama has yet to put into effect the strong sanctions he appeared to champion during the debate, after doing everything he could to fight their passage in Congress. “It galls me to see President Obama time and time again take credit for the bill that we passed while he did everything possible to stop the bill from becoming law,” she said. “[He] did everything possible to try to water down the tough sanctions. And yet, there he is taking credit for the Iran sanctions law, and he says it has had an effect and he wishes it would have more of an effect. Yeah, me too — if he would implement the sanctions. So not only did he drag his feet, not only did he not want to pass those, not only did he want to weaken them, but now that it's a law he doesn't want to enforce it.” Story continues below the video. Ros-Lehtinen said that “reasonable” voters will recognize Obama spent the debate pandering to the Jews, Israel, and the nation-state’s supporters. The president is aware that he is slipping badly with Jewish voters, who he needs to win Florida. With polls as they are, she said voters can count on the kind words about Israel and Benjamin Netanyahu to last through the election, but not much after that. “We have never heard President Obama give such loving words of tribute to Jewish people [and] to the Israeli people as we have tonight,” Ros-Lehtinen said. “And he kept saying it over and over again. . . . After election day, you can count on President Obama reverting back to giving the cold shoulder to Netanyahu, to telling Israel to stop their settlements and force them to make peace with Palestinians, even though the Palestinians do not want to make peace with the Israelis. So, don’t buy that kettle of fish. It stinks to high heaven.” She added that Obama did not help himself with women either, because when Romney tied foreign policy to the economy, he reminded women that they’ve been hurt by the prolonged recession. The realities of what has happened during his being in office didn’t “seal the deal” with them, she said, adding that “Obamanomics” have brought down women’s purchasing power, in addition to not helping them with jobs. “Mitt Romney was able to tell the American public one more time that the Barack Obama presidency has been a financial disaster,” Ros-Lehtinen said. “I know the theme for tonight was international relations but every candidate brought it home to what really matters most to the American public — which is pocketbook issues.”</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1351012462621</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 13:14:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351012512770-42</Id><Title>Obama's Apology Tour Was No "Whopper"!</Title><Msg>Nor is his Apology Presidency!

And the Reagan administration demonized opponents of apartheid, most notably the African National Congress, as dangerous and pro-communist.

Adam was placed here six thousand years ago. The earth is much older and so are many of the peoples of this earth. No Christian believes Noah put dinosaurs on the ark. Another misinterpretation of original scripture is the "World wide Flood". Scripture simply states the flood covered "a land or country". The word is "erets" for land or country. The phony religionists have twisted it into Ararat and even changed the name of Mt. Masiv a hundred years ago to Ararat. I think much of this has been done to obscure biblical truths. Most likely flood location is the Tarim Basin. There is evidence of sudden and massive flooding in many places. Mediterranean Basin, Black Sea Basin. etc. There are cities under water in central Asian lakes and off the coast of India and at Lands End, England.</Msg><Username>lewcor</Username><Timestamp>1351014134848</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 13:42:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351015679390-51</Id><Topic><Title>What's going on?</Title><Username>lewcor</Username><Timestamp>1351013421696</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 13:30:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Usually when Yahoo sends notices it's because you've been reported by someone who didn't like your opinion.

The photos, taken at Frank Marshall Davis' house in Honolulu, appeared in Bizarre Life, Exotique, Secret Pleasures, and Battling Babes. They help illustrate the intimate relationship between Dunham and Davis. "My father was from Kenya, he grew up herding goats," Barack Obama told the cheering crowds. Did Obama build his political career upon a fairy tale? Was Obama misdirecting Americans away from a deeply disturbing family background and a Marxist political foundation? Obama's version of his early childhood is false - the family did not split up when the Kenyan Obama went to Harvard as he claimed. In fact, Ann Dunham took "Barry" to Seattle a few weeks after his birth (late August 1961), and began studies at the University of Washington, while the Kenyan remained in Hawaii. All evidence points to a "sham" marriage to cover up an illicit affair. Barack Obama began regular visits to Frank Marshall Davis' house at the age of 10, and Obama refers to Frank Marshall Davis throughout his autobiography as his childhood "mentor." Dreams from My Real Father makes the case that the Communist Party USA propagandist was both Obama's biological and ideological father, and likely indoctrinated Obama in Marxism during his formative years.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1351030585139</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 18:16:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351031413846-75</Id><Topic><Title>Obama: Companies &amp; Wealthy Investors Sitting on Tons of Cash</Title><Username>bjspokanimal</Username><Timestamp>1351017853410</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 14:44:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama has worked very hard to make voters under 25 his "core constituency".

The Republican presidential nominee has clearly benefited from the debates. He had a 44.5 percent favorability rating at the end of September, before the debates. But by Monday, when he and Mr. Obama faced off for the final debate of the campaign, Mr. Romney’s favorability average was up to 50.5 percent. Tom Jensen, director of Public Policy Polling, a Democratic firm, said Mr. Romney’s favorability surge “really has been remarkable.” “It was inevitable that Republicans were going to warm up to him once he became their nominee, but ever since his big victory in the first debate, his numbers with independents have improved a good deal as well,” he said. “We’re actually finding in our national tracking now that Romney’s favorability numbers are better than Obama‘s, which no one could have imagined six months ago.” Mike McKenna, a Republican pollster, said Mr. Romney used the three 90-minute debates this month, with the largest national audiences he’s ever had, to humanize himself for voters who’d only seen snapshots in campaign commercials. news accounts and negative ads from the Obama campaign. Mr. McKenna said the Republican candidate’s performances punctured the Obama campaign’s effort to disqualify Mr. Romney in voters’ minds, through a bruising barrage of attack ads aimed at Hispanics, young adults and, chiefly, women voters. “Six months of work and $400 million of ad buys went up in smoke in about 10 days,” Mr. McKenna said. “With less than 340 hours to go, they are having real trouble with their footing.” With the presidential debates now behind him, Mr. Romney enters the final two-week stretch of the campaign having turned the election once again into a referendum on President Obama. His measured performance in Monday’s debate capped that off. While pundits complained that he didn’t leave much daylight between himself and Mr. Obama on many issues, depriving them of the chance to compare and contrast policies, Republicans said Mr. Romney accomplished something deeper — he made himself a palatable alternative to Mr. Obama. At one point he even swatted away an Obama attack by accusing the president of offering little else. “Attacking me is not an agenda,” the Republican said.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1351033061201</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 18:57:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351035661381-79</Id><Title>the trend is your friend</Title><Msg>unless you are an Obama supporter.

Well, Governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of our military's changed." According to the official U.S. Marine Corps website, every Marine is STILL required to complete a bayonet training program ... because "the weapon becomes just as effective [as a rifle] in close combat situations." We spoke with Dan Riker from Bayonet Inc. -- a leading military surplus outlet that specializes in bayonets -- who tells us he believes Obama's comment was "ignorant ... because our soldiers still use bayonets."

Yes. All Marines learn to use bayonets during their basic martial arts training. Some of this training takes place on the Bayonet Assault Course, upon which Marines are unleashed to bayonet everything in sight. Learning proficiency in basic bayoneting techniques is part of qualifying for a tan belt, which is required of every recruit. Marines are expected to learn to attach and remove the bayonets from their rifles quickly, so that they might swiftly initiate a charge. While the bayonet dates to the 17th century, it has evolved through technological innovations over the years. In 2003, the Marine Corps replaced its standard-issue bayonet with a longer, sharper model, the OKC-3S. The new model, designed by New York's Ontario Knife Co., was also more effective when brandished as a hand knife - not to mention more ergonomically correct. Perhaps more vitally, the blades were also better able to pierce body armor, a concern particular to modern warriors. More than 120,000 bayonets were commissioned to supply one to each Marine, at an estimated price of $36.35 each, or $4,362,000 total. In addition to potential use in hand-to-hand combat, bayonets are said to be useful for keeping prisoners under control and for "poking an enemy to see whether he is dead." The Marines aren't the only branch of the military to equip its soldiers with bayonets. The Army issues the M9 bayonet knife, which has been in use since the 1980s, but troops have moved away from the detachable knives in recent years. In 2010, the Army began to scale back on bayonet drills in favor of calisthenics, perhaps a wise move given that the soldiers rarely carry bayonets on their rifles, and since the last U.S. bayonet charge was in 1951. Others, however, have still found use for the bayonet charge in recent years. Just last month a British soldier was honored for a bayonet charge on the Taliban that he led in 2011. This charge was reminiscent of another British bayonet charge in Basra, Iraq, in 2004. In 2011, Col. Moammar Gadhafi was also reportedly killed by a bayonet stab to the rear. The Commander in Chief don't know jack about the military.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1351046154744</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 22:35:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351046636732-90</Id><Topic><Title>Obama: Companies &amp; Wealthy Investors Sitting on Tons of Cash</Title><Username>bjspokanimal</Username><Timestamp>1351017853410</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 14:44:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Capitalism has SEIZED UP in America, thanks to the daily rants of hatred by Barack Obama against ANYBODY who has a significant amount of wealth.
