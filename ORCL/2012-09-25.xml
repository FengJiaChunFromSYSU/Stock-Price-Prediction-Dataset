That's not the question... ... the #1 question is... will they STAY HERE IN PRODUCTIVE, JOBS-PRODUCING VENTURES AND PAY IT?

Few American's understand how investment risk capital works as the fuel behind a vibrant, capitalist system... they just want to keep the government checks coming to their mailbox and they're willing to give an anti-business, anti-capitalist president like Obama 4 more years to keep 'em coming. On the current trajectory, the U.S. will hit a debt-to-GDP ratio that's equal to present-day Greece in 3 years... ...

Here's footage of Madonna's "endorsement" (her Obama comments come around the 1:50 mark) So yeah. That's odd, right? Thanks to her terrible delivery, it's hard to tell whether Madonna is being sarcastic and mocking people who think Obama is a Muslim (yes people still do) or if Madonna actually believes President Obama is a Muslim (he isn't). Hey, she even confused Politico. "That means there is hope in this country," she said. Add in the mega church-like cheering, and her other reasons to vote for Obama (that Obama is fighting for gay rights)—and three things become apparent in this video: (1) Madonna is endorsing Obama. (2) If Madonna is wrong, no one is going to tell Madonna she's wrong. (3) History class with Madonna would probably be really great.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1348612088059</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-25 18:28:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348613163186-36</Id><Topic><Title>..Anti-union Gov.

The claim, though, is open to debate. It only holds up in a particular scenario in which both income and all payroll taxes are counted. The president's campaign presumably is referring to Romney's release last week of his 2011 tax returns, which showed he paid an effective tax rate of 14.1 percent. This revelation, as might be expected, fueled a wave of campaign stump speeches and videos. The latest was an Obama Web video blasting Romney's "strange take on tax fairness." It included clips of people accusing Romney of paying a lower rate than "average" Americans. An accompanying campaign email said: "Mitt Romney admitted he thinks it's fair that his $20 million income was taxed at a lower rate than someone making $50,000." IRS data, though, shows that Romney's effective income tax rate -- that's what he pays as a percentage of his income once deductions and other benefits are factored in -- is actually far higher than what most Americans pay. And it's certainly higher than what someone making $50,000 pays. IRS data from 2010 shows someone making between $50,000 and $75,000 on average pays an effective rate of 7.8 percent. Even someone making between $100,000 and $200,000 pays a 12.1 percent rate -- also lower than Romney's. So what is the Obama campaign referring to? There are a couple possibilities. The campaign likely is trying to make the point that Romney's income -- at least the huge chunk of it that is derived from investments -- is taxed at a 15 percent rate, while others who earn their money from a paycheck are taxed at marginal income rates going all the way up to 35 percent. The latter percentage, though, comes down once deductions and exemptions are included. The Tax Foundation estimated in a report in January that Romney's rate in 2010 -- which was also about 14 percent -- was higher than what 97 percent of Americans pay. The math works out better for the Obama campaign's claims if all payroll taxes are included in the formula. Since Romney earns most his income from investments and not from a paycheck, he doesn't have to pay much toward Social Security and Medicare taxes. But if both the employee and employer share of those taxes are included, according to a Tax Policy Center chart, the middle tier of earners would be paying a 15.5 percent effective rate. (As pointed out in an earlier report by FactCheck.org.) That would be slightly higher than Romney's rate.</Msg><Username>hikemanymiles</Username><Timestamp>1348618768016</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-25 20:19:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348620988280-41</Id><Topic><Title>gop nonsense of "broadening the base"...Romney camp says Romney will "give on his tax cuts"</Title><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1348603051452</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-25 15:57:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>As usual, everything Obama and his team say are LIES! Also ignores that Romney pays around 16% of his income in charitable contributions. And in total dollars Romney pays more in charitable contributions than than Obama &amp; Biden combined for a decade. Moreover, since the charitable contributions are deductible they reduce Romney's total tax and tax rate. All total, Romney pays about 1/3rd of his income in federal taxes and charitable contributions.</Msg><Username>ourfirstpantroglodytepresident</Username><Timestamp>1348620988280</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-25 20:56:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348621196838-42</Id><Title>Looks like Yahoo new format is working!</Title><Msg>Reducing number of political posts but allowing all those important schlock stock spams.</Msg><Username>ourfirstpantroglodytepresident</Username><Timestamp>1348621196838</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-25 20:59:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348625678833-43</Id><Title>AP IMPACT: Party seems over for Somali pirates</Title><Msg>Hey carl db.........here's yet another example of your #$%$.
