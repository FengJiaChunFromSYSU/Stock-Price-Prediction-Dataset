Edward Pinto, a former top executive at Fannie Mae, now with the American Enterprise Institute, confirmed the government’s adoption of a strategy that requires banks to lend to less qualified borrowers or face discrimination complaints. He is outraged, as are other housing industry experts and economists. “This push by FHA will continue to set up for failure the very families and neighborhoods its mission is to help,” Obama doesn't care.

"For example, lenders remain concerned about the risk that they will be required to repurchase defaulted loans from the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs)--the so-called putback risk. The ability to hold lenders accountable for poorly underwritten loans is a significant protection for taxpayers. However, if lenders are unsure about the conditions under which they will be required to repurchase loans sold to the GSEs, they may shy away from originating loans to borrowers whose risk profiles indicate a higher likelihood of default. The Federal Housing Finance Agency launched an important initiative last year to clarify the liabilities associated with representations and warranties, but so far, those efforts do not appear to have been sufficient to keep putback risk from weighing on the mortgage market. .

"Hadiya Pendleton was me, and I was her," said the first lady. "Thousands of children in this city live in neighborhoods where a funeral for a teenager is considered unfortunate, but not unusual; where wandering onto the wrong block or even just standing on your own front porch can mean putting yourself at risk," Michelle Obama told the Chicago crowd, according to a transcript provided by the White House. "Those are the odds that so many young people are facing in this city –- young people like Hadiya Pendleton, whose funeral I attended back in February. And we all know Hadiya’s story. She was 15 years old, an honor student at King College Prep. And she came from a good family -– two devoted parents, plenty of cousins, solid godparents and grandparents, an adoring little brother. The Pendletons are hardworking people. They’re churchgoing folks. And Hadiya’s mother did everything she could for her daughter. She enrolled her in every activity you could imagine -– cheerleading, majorettes, the praise dance ministry -– anything to keep her off the streets and keep her busy. "And as I visited with the Pendleton family at Hadiya’s funeral, I couldn’t get over how familiar they felt to me. Because what I realized was Hadiya’s family was just like my family. Hadiya Pendleton was me, and I was her. But I got to grow up, and go to Princeton and Harvard Law School, and have a career and a family and the most blessed life I could ever imagine.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1365688551813</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 09:55:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365689071857-16</Id><Topic><Title>=(BREAKING NEWS) Analyst Downgrades ORCL =(MUST READ)</Title><Username>johnnyford834</Username><Timestamp>1363881147525</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-21 11:52:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>strong report.</Msg><Username>jackreed288</Username><Timestamp>1365689071857</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 10:04:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365689454469-17</Id><Topic><Title>Oracle Upgraded to STRONG BUY?</Title><Username>phyllis.pfaff</Username><Timestamp>1365686689337</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 09:24:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nice one!</Msg><Username>garner_nicole</Username><Timestamp>1365689454469</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 10:10:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365689556645-18</Id><Title>Pubs whine about jobs while demanding sequester and throwing debt ceiling tantrums that cost jobs</Title><Msg>the demand for spending cuts and the sequester will cut gdp growth this year by a few % and of course that costs jobs....................kinda like how they support less than a livable wage for retail and food service and other areas........ yet they whine about these people having to use food stamps and Medicaid to support their families</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1365689556645</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 10:12:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365690376285-19</Id><Title>-- "All the incentives are toward less medical care, because—the less care they give them, the more money they make."</Title><Msg>(Nixon cackling over how for profit healthcare means less care for patients more money for the operators) Ehrlichman: —private enterprise one.

Hova just released a new rap, in which he addresses all of the drama surrounding his trip to Cuba last week with his wife Beyonce. In the song, titled "Open Letter," Jay says ..."Politicians never did s**t for me ... except lie to me, distort history.” He continues, "Obama said chill ‘You gonna get me impeached' ... We don’t need this s**t anyway chill with me on the beach.'" The implication based on the lyric -- that Obama did something shady in helping Jay-Z and Beyonce get into Cuba and he could be in political hot water as a result. It's a pretty believable lyric, considering how close Jay is with B.O. There's more -- "I can turn Havana to Atlanta ... ballin’ too much they try to jam you." “I’m in Cuba, I love Cubans.This Communist talk is so confusing.”</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1365701119344</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 13:25:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365701553614-30</Id><Title>Tiger Woods 2 under after 9</Title><Msg>As long as Tiger is in it I'll be watching with keen interest..

You see this for car loans, which are even more subprime (see Reuters: "Special Report: How the Fed fueled an explosion in subprime auto loans"), or student loans which are made regardless of field studied, of student grades, or even regardless of whether the money is used to actually study. The same in housing (see Washington post: "Obama administration pushes banks to make home loans to people with weaker credit"). Because to a keynesian politician, people must "buy now, pay later". Better private people doing it than them politicians having to do it through government. But it all ends up on taxpayers balance sheet anyway. And if a profit is made, it's for Wall Street. If the loans go bad, taxpayers will pay. Democrats will call it "access" for the poor, but all it does is push prices higher.
