While doing that the poor are helped I know, it's much too complicated for your narrow mind to comprehend.</Msg><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1372696195443</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-01 12:29:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372697198331-37</Id><Title>unintended consequences: This one cracked me up</Title><Msg>Hundreds of twitchers travelled the length of the country to see the “bird of the century” – only for it to fly into a wind turbine and die. Bird-spotters were ecstatic about the first UK sighting of the rare white-throated needletail since 1991. But their excitement soon turned to horror when it hit the 120ft structure’s rotating blades. James Hanlon and three pals drove 17 hours through the night to see the black and white swift on the Isle of Harris, one of Scotland’s Western Isles. He said: “I was watching it through my binoculars from about 200 metres away. “One minute it was flying in spectacular fashion. I followed it and then watched as it flew into one of the blades of the wind turbine and vanished. “My heart jumped into my mouth. We dashed over to see if it had been killed and sadly found its body on the ground. It was heartbreaking.” .............................................................................................................. reminds me of a story that happened some years ago. In ALaska there was an oil covered sea otter that townspeople rescued and cleaned up. Once ready to rejoin the wild the town held a huge celebration for the otter. School bands playing etc. When the otter was released everyone watched with great excitement. Suddenly a whale emerged from the depths and swalled the otter whole. Everyone groaned.

A deal reached in federal bankruptcy court between the archdiocese and victims suing it for fraud called for the documents to be made public by July 1. Victims say the archdiocese transferred problem priests to new churches without warning parishioners and covered up priests' crimes for decades. Many pushed for the documents' release in the belief that it would be an important part of their healing. Similar files made public by other Roman Catholic dioceses and religious orders have detailed how leaders tried to protect the church by shielding priests and not reporting child sex abuse to authorities. The cover-up extended to the top of the Catholic hierarchy. Correspondence obtained by The Associated Press in 2010 showed the future Pope Benedict XVI had resisted pleas in the 1980s to defrock a California priest with a record of molesting children. Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger led the Vatican office responsible for disciplining abusive priests before his election as pope. The Milwaukee collection has drawn interest because of the involvement of Dolan, the president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and the nation's most prominent Roman Catholic official. Dolan has not been accused of transferring problem priests. He took over as archbishop in mid-2002, after many victims had already come forward. But there have been questions about his response to the crisis, including payments made to abusive priests when they left the church. The archdiocese has characterized the money, as much as $20,000 in some cases, as a kind of severance pay meant</Msg><Username>hydroponicoctopus</Username><Timestamp>1372698542940</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-01 13:09:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372698696212-43</Id><Title>Child abuse scandal cost US Catholic church $3 billion</Title><Msg>Child abuse scandal cost US Catholic church $3 bln (AFP) – Apr 5, 2010 CHICAGO — The pedophile priest crisis has cost the Roman Catholic church nearly $3 billion in the United States, but only a fraction of the perpetrators have been jailed and little been done to punish those who covered up the crimes.

Researchers from the Center for the Study of Global Christianity estimate that Christian religious leaders will commit $90 million in financial crimes daily and the fraud is growing at a rate of 5.97% each year. If the researchers are correct, religious financial fraud among Christians will almost double in 14 years to $60 billion annually by 2025. 1 Dr. David Barrett, the first editor of the World Christian Encyclopedia and a researcher for the Center, has been studying religious financial fraud for more than 20 years. According to Dr. Todd Johnson, the Center’s director, these statistics were the result of Barrett “developing a balance sheet for global Christianity.” Barrett was “trying to understand the totality of Christian finance.” 2 A Global Problem Barrett and Johnson in the reference book “World Christian Trends” reported, “Probably 80% of all cases are kept private or swept under the carpet, but each year a rash of megathefts (over $1 million each) is uncovered and publicized in the secular media.” 3 Here is a small sample of religious financial scandals from around the world: Common Funding Sources of Religious Thieves 1.The Offering Plate — In 2002 NBC Dateline aired an exposé on Benny Hinn. Mike Estrella, a former Benny Hinn Ministries employee responsible for counting the money given at Hinn’s crusades, said that he observed Gene Polino, Hinn’s CEO, embezzle thousands of dollars from the crusade collection buckets.11Wikipedia describes this practice as “skimming” which “refers to taking cash ‘off the top’ of the daily receipts of a business …” 12 This form of fraud is hard to detect but occassionally the skimmers are caught.

We think 57% of this goes on health-care networks, followed by 28% on colleges, with parish and diocesan day-to-day operations accounting for just 6% and national charitable activities just 2.7% (see chart). In total, Catholic institutions employ over 1m people, reckons Fred Gluck, a former McKinsey managing partner and co-founder of the National Leadership Roundtable on Church Management, a lay organisation seeking to improve the way the church is run. For purposes of secular comparison, in 2010 General Electric’s revenue was $150 billion and Walmart employed roughly 2m people. Wow. You knew the Church had money… but that much?! Where does it all come from? Offering plates, donations, tuition money, Medicare/Medicaid payments, and other investments. I thought that the sexual abuse scandal payouts would at least put a dent in their budget. Turns out it’s only a small fraction of it and most of the payments are made by local dioceses and not the Vatican: The molestation and rape of children by priests in America has resulted in more than $3.3 billion of settlements over the past 15 years, ...... For an organisation with revenues of $170 billion that might seem manageable.

In the Chatholic church there are lots of ways to give directly to a cause including the annual Cardinal's appeal. All the money collected for that (and it's substantial) goes to intended recipients.

There are other sources that contradict you. So it is you who is the liar. The following is just part of it. There is more. If many conservatives are liberals who have been mugged by reality, Brooks, a registered independent, is, as a reviewer of his book said, a social scientist who has been mugged by data. They include these findings: -- Although liberal families' incomes average 6 percent higher than those of conservative families, conservative-headed households give, on average, 30 percent more to charity than the average liberal-headed household ($1,600 per year vs. $1,227). -- Conservatives also donate more time and give more blood. -- Residents of the states that voted for John Kerry in 2004 gave smaller percentages of their incomes to charity than did residents of states that voted for George Bush. -- Bush carried 24 of the 25 states where charitable giving was above average. -- In the 10 reddest states, in which Bush got more than 60 percent majorities, the average percentage of personal income donated to charity was 3.5. Residents of the bluest states, which gave Bush less than 40 percent, donated just 1.9 percent.</Msg><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1372714360542</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-01 17:32:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372715549568-70</Id><Topic><Title>Study: Conservatives and liberals are equally charitable, but they give to different charities</Title><Username>hydroponicoctopus</Username><Timestamp>1372622830078</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-30 16:07:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>jeez, you are dense. FYI the latest study, as REPORTED by the Washington Post and elsewhere, refutes the methodology uses by Brooks, you who quote...... get it?.... Brooks is wrong..... and it should be OBVIOUS from the quote YOU use ...................... he says conservatives give 30% more to charity.......... well.... did you miss it that MOST of that "charity" is given to their own congregation and most of that is not spent on the needy at all..............the Economist showed that the American catholic church gives 2.7% of the money they spend to charity........... they pay out more than twice that to themselves in salary and benefits : "The Economist estimates that annual spending by the church and entities owned by the church was around $170 billion in 2010 (the church does not release such figures). We think 57% of this goes on health-care networks, followed by 28% on colleges, with parish and diocesan day-to-day operations accounting for just 6% and national charitable activities just 2.7% (see chart). In total, Catholic institutions employ over 1m people, reckons Fred Gluck, a former McKinsey managing partner and co-founder of the National Leadership Roundtable on Church Management, a lay organisation seeking to improve the way the church is run. For purposes of secular comparison, in 2010 General Electric’s revenue was $150 billion and Walmart employed roughly 2m people." so you see that is like me counting the money I spend on movies as "charity"...... sinceit mostly goes for salaries and benefits for those who make that kind of entertainment and sure even they, like the avg American or the Catholic church likely donate a couple % to the needy.... and lets not forget the BILLIONs of Fraud that you people also count as part of your "charity" you really should stop trying to make out like you and your church lady type are better than everyone else, you are not, and any one can see that......... \</Msg><Username>hydroponicoctopus</Username><Timestamp>1372715549568</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-01 17:52:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372715814803-71</Id><Title>15 July</Title><Msg>the party starts for ORCL target 40.00</Msg><Username>spanishbee</Username><Timestamp>1372715814803</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-01 17:56:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372716432464-72</Id><Topic><Title>Why the drop today?</Title><Username>liputin</Username><Timestamp>1372713819985</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-01 17:23:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>because I wanted to buy at lower price.

You begrudge people whose donations go for salaries and operations. Those people who receive a salary etc also do good work. They aren't in the business for money. The priests at our parish get something like 20K per year. I think you'd favor getting rid of tax write offs for church donations. Am I right? Of course. Shall I again cite Algore's and Biden's charitable giving? Hundreds of $ out of all the dough they make. They are typical.
