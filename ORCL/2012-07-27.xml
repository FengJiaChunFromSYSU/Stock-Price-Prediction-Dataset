LONDON—On day three of his overseas tour, Mitt Romney woke up to unfriendly headlines from the British media, which continue to trash him for telling NBC News that he found preparations for the Olympics here "disconcerting." "Mitt the Twit," declared The Sun tabloid, condemning Romney as a "wannabe president." The Independent headlined its take on Romney's trip "Romneyshambles"—accusing him of not only committing a diplomatic gaffe but later "the cardinal sin of U.S. politics, flip-flopping" on his criticism. The Daily Telegraph suggested Romney's "Olympic gaffe" had overshadowed his trip to London. Meanwhile, the conservative Daily Mail slammed Romney as "devoid of charm, offensive and a wazzock."</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1343403204000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 11:33:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343403579000-12</Id><Title>nice going Romney</Title><Msg>size 12 wing tip in mouth to launch his world wide, "I'm Presidential" tour. better stick to the teleprompter</Msg><Username>kollesteral</Username><Timestamp>1343403579000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 11:39:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343403929000-13</Id><Topic><Title>tough times for the young?</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1343392575000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 08:36:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"college education but a shortage of welders and machinists.

How long does it take to train a welder? 2 weeks? 3 months? I can guaranty after a 3 months unpaid internship a lot of people would be able to do useful work welding. And there are millions of unemployed people desperate to do any job. All they need is a chance. It's like wedding photographers. I have a friend who was asked $3000 for 4 hours taking pictures. I'm willing to believe taking pictures involve some technique and some experience, but I can't believe it's so hard to learn that it is worth $750/ hours. Then you can look at how much a nanny costs. i.e. very expensive. Why? Is there a shortage of women who can look after a baby? How long do you need to train them? And don't even start me on realtards who earn 3% of a huge transaction, often with very little work. This 3% would be competed away if not protected by the NAR cartel. This whole economy is made of pockets of people who make way too much money. It will fix itself provided the Feds don't flood the world with such easy money that no one really tries.</Msg><Username>nazyoyo</Username><Timestamp>1343405193000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 12:06:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343405652000-16</Id><Topic><Title>tough times for the young?</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1343392575000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 08:36:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If your are talking about low end welding.

Amazing you have a degree in everything. It's one stop shopping. May I ask how many shingles you have hanging outside your laboratory? Do you have a degree in psychiatry? You can't legally analyse dropkick without the proper training tho I know it's hard to resist by a man of your vast expertise. Were that the case, we can't tell which one of you is the Dr and which is the nutjob.</Msg><Username>passthebuckaroo</Username><Timestamp>1343438423000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 21:20:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343440000000-66</Id><Topic><Title>I own this Board.
