Sullivan questioned why Snowden did not take advantage of federal whistler-blower laws or take his concerns to Congress before going to the media.[90] This criticism was echoed by Jeffrey Toobin of the New Yorker. While conceding that whistle-blowers are indispensable to a society with a free press, Toobin characterizes Snowden's approach as "reckless." Furthermore, by putting himself at the mercy of Beijing-backed Hong Kong leaders, Toobin wrote that "all of Snowden's secrets may wind up in the hands of the Chinese government—which has no commitment at all to free speech or the right to political dissent."[95] James Fallows wrote that "if Snowden thinks, as some of his comments seem to suggest, that he has found a bastion of freer speech [in Hong Kong], then he is ill-informed; and if he knowingly chose to make his case from China he is playing a more complicated game."[91] Matt Schiavenza called Snowden's decision to go to Hong Kong a "serious miscalculation," particularly if the Beijing government decided to try to use him as an intelligence asset.[96]</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1371127845444</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 08:50:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371129588661-6</Id><Topic><Title>Perry is "disappointed" Texas not getting Fed money he asked for</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1371070723003</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-12 16:58:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama ‘Strongly Objects’ to Religious Liberty Amendment Obama ‘Strongly Objects’ to Religious Liberty Amendment Jun 12, 2013 By Todd Starnes The Obama Administration “strongly objects” to a proposed amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act on Wednesday that would have protected the religious rights of soldiers – including evangelical Christian service members who are facing growing hostility towards their religion.

MILLER and GEOFF EARLE Last Updated: 8:47 AM, June 13, 2013 Posted: 1:39 AM, June 13, 2013 WASHINGTON — The State Department has hired an alarming number of law-enforcement agents with criminal or checkered backgrounds because of a flawed hiring process, a stunning memo obtained by The Post reveals. The background problems are severe enough that many of the roughly 2,000 agents in State’s Bureau of Diplomatic Security can play only limited roles in agency efforts to police bad conduct and prosecute wrongdoers. The problems in the bureau are the latest revelation in an exploding scandal that also involves accusations that members of former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton’s security detail and those of the US ambassador to Belgium solicited prostitutes overseas.</Msg><Username>onedinosaur</Username><Timestamp>1371129699052</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 09:21:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371129904850-8</Id><Topic><Title>Perry is "disappointed" Texas not getting Fed money he asked for</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1371070723003</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-12 16:58:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you no doubt have never been in the military.

That's right, the government's sweeping surveillance of our most private communications excludes the jihad factories where homegrown terrorists are radicalized. Since October 2011, mosques have been off-limits to FBI agents. No more surveillance or undercover string operations without high-level approval from a special oversight body at the Justice Department dubbed the Sensitive Operations Review Committee. Who makes up this body, and how do they decide requests? Nobody knows; the names of the chairman, members and staff are kept secret. We do know the panel was set up under pressure from Islamist groups who complained about FBI stings at mosques. Just months before the panel's formation, the Council on American-Islamic Relations teamed up with the ACLU to sue the FBI for allegedly violating the civil rights of Muslims in Los Angeles by hiring an undercover agent to infiltrate and monitor mosques there. .investors InvestorsBusinessDaily on Facebook</Msg><Username>hikemanymiles</Username><Timestamp>1371137427698</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 11:30:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371138574113-23</Id><Topic><Title>Until you all defend a women's right to medical privacy, you can't be taken seriously on privacy</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1371041789098</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-12 08:56:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>White Share of U.S. Population Drops to Historic Low By Frank Bass - Jun 13, 2013 12:01 AM ET The U.S. continued its transformation into a majority-minority nation last year, with Census Bureau data showing non-Hispanic whites making up the lowest percentage of the population in American history. The estimates released today capture several milestones in the country’s demographic makeup. For the first time in more than a century, deaths outpaced births among white Americans. Almost half, 49.9 percent, of the nation’s children younger than 5 were minorities as of July 1. And the nation’s total minority population grew 21 times faster than whites. Non-Hispanic whites, the nation’s predominant racial group, added 0.09 percent last year to increase their total to 197.7 million, about 63 percent of the total population. Even with the increase, the largest since 2008, the total number of white deaths exceeded white births by 12,419. In 2000, whites were 69 percent of the population, and 80 percent in 1980. “A natural decrease and eventual loss in the white population is baked into the cake of our older white population,” William H. Frey, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a Washington-based policy research group, said in an e-mail. “It’s the younger, rapidly growing minority population that will be driving economic and demographic growth this century.” Minorities younger than 18 are expected to overtake the number of white children by 2019, the Census Bureau said last year. The U.S. is projected to become a majority-minority nation by 2043.</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1371138574113</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 11:49:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371138963377-24</Id><Topic><Title>Snowden gave up the job he held for 3 months to save our privacy</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1371071455384</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-12 17:10:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"I" want us in endless illegal undeclared wars?

The Obama Family Trip to Africa to Cost $60 to $100 Million 2:12 PM, Jun 13, 2013 • By DANIEL HALPER President Obama and his family will be going to Africa later this month. But the trip won't be cheap; it's expected to cost American taxpayers $60 to $100 million, according to the Washington Post. "When President Obama makes his first extended trip to sub-Saharan Africa later this month, the federal agencies charged with keeping him safe won’t be taking any chances. Hundreds of U.S. Secret Service agents will be dispatched to secure facilities in Senegal, South Africa and Tanzania. A Navy aircraft carrier or amphibious ship, with a fully staffed medical trauma center, will be stationed offshore in case of emergency," reports the Post. "Military cargo planes will airlift in 56 support vehicles, including 14 limousines and three trucks loaded with sheets of bullet-proof glass to cover the windows of the hotels where the first family will stay. Fighter jets will fly in shifts giving 24-hour coverage over the president’s airspace so they can intervene quickly if an errant plane gets too close. "The extraordinary security provisions — which will cost the government tens of millions of dollars — are outlined in a confidential internal planning document obtained by The Washington Post. While the preparations appear to be in line with similar travels in the past, the document offers an unusual glimpse into the colossal efforts to protect the U.S. commander-in-chief on trips abroad."

But now that gays are accepted in the Boy Scouts, liberals would not have a problem with some lecher taking advantage of those entrusted to their care. Families will be pulling their kids out of the org by the thousands to reject the decision. So, if the scouts are gay and the leaders are gay, it would be easy pickins. And you wanna bet liberal goons would condone it in the name of personal freedom.</Msg><Username>passthebuckaroo</Username><Timestamp>1371173456443</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 21:30:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371178297623-73</Id><Title>Ain't wonderful!</Title><Msg>Just got mail today from my primary health insurer.
