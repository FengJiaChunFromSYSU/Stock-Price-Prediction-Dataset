Mittens might end up paying close to ZERO % income tax. Someone has to make up the difference and it will be YOU. You will also get to pay MORE for your elderly healthcare , and again good for you.... your Ryan voucher will cover 30% of YOUR costs.... and YOU will pay for the boomers to continue with medicare AS iS , which covers 80% of their costs. and ditto for social security. No changes for the boomers, the changes will be in the FUTURE and paid for by YOU. you know , to help make up the difference for Mittens and those types paying close to ZERO income taxes, while demanding INCREASES in military spending.</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1344788314000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 12:18:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344788383000-36</Id><Topic><Title>Ryan benefitted from SS.</Title><Username>dr_gloom_and_doom</Username><Timestamp>1344787286000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 12:01:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>dishonest moron. fyi, the hypocrites are the Ryan , ayn rand, koch and other rightwinger types who publically denounce social security, yet privately use it and even privately PROMOTE it as did the kochs.</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1344788383000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 12:19:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344788603000-37</Id><Title>Mitt can't even meet his own standard for tax records</Title><Msg>Mitt has to hide HIS tax records. but he asked his VP contenders not to CHARLOTTE - Mitt Romney requested "several" years of tax returns from his potential running mates, a senior adviser to the candidate said Saturday, suggesting that those considered for the ticket may have been required to reveal more financial documents that the candidate himself.</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1344788603000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 12:23:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344788782000-38</Id><Title>hardwarestupidperson says stupid stuff</Title><Msg>Then repeats it.</Msg><Username>dr_gloom_and_doom</Username><Timestamp>1344788782000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 12:26:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344788810000-39</Id><Title>hardwarestupidperson says stupid stuff</Title><Msg>Then repeats it.</Msg><Username>dr_gloom_and_doom</Username><Timestamp>1344788810000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 12:26:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344788848000-40</Id><Title>hardwarestupidperson says stupid stuff</Title><Msg>Then repeats it some more.</Msg><Username>dr_gloom_and_doom</Username><Timestamp>1344788848000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 12:27:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344788901000-41</Id><Title>hardwarestupidperson says stupid stuff</Title><Msg>Then repeats it yet again.</Msg><Username>dr_gloom_and_doom</Username><Timestamp>1344788901000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 12:28:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344788975000-42</Id><Title>hardwarestupidperson says stupid stuff</Title><Msg>Then repeats it still yet again.

In the long run, space exploration is more important than solar panels. Some day we will need to have humans OFF this gravity well! (e.g. Earth for the ignorant.) However, there is no logical reason why we can't invest in both. The difference is that NASA has been accomplishing things for about 49 years. Solar panels and "alternative energy" have been a liberal pipe dream for at least as long.</Msg><Username>dr_gloom_and_doom</Username><Timestamp>1344800370000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 15:39:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344800679000-73</Id><Topic><Title>typical pub, dr_gloom_and_doom</Title><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1344789186000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 12:33:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Your posts are a waste of electrons!
