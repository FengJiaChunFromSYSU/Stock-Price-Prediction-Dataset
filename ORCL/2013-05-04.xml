HAYES Send to Kindle Audio version Single Page Print Larger Text Smaller Text Alerts Even as the White House strove last week to move beyond questions about the Benghazi attacks of Tuesday, September 11, 2012, fresh evidence emerged that senior Obama administration officials knowingly misled the country about what had happened in the days following the assaults. The Weekly Standard has obtained a timeline briefed by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence detailing the heavy substantive revisions made to the CIA’s talking points, just six weeks before the 2012 presidential election, and additional information about why the changes were made and by whom. The Embassy in Benghazi burns Reuters As intelligence officials pieced together the puzzle of events unfolding in Libya, they concluded even before the assaults had ended that al Qaeda-linked terrorists were involved. Senior administration officials, however, sought to obscure the emerging picture and downplay the significance of attacks that killed a U.S. ambassador and three other Americans. The frantic process that produced the changes to the talking points took place over a 24-hour period just one day before Susan Rice, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, made her now-famous appearances on the Sunday television talk shows. The discussions involved senior officials from the State Department, the National Security Council, the CIA, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and the White House.</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1367714817566</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 20:46:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367715569488-14</Id><Topic><Title>Gee, how about this "Global Warming".</Title><Username>lewcor</Username><Timestamp>1367684168359</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 12:16:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>looky here jr. the bus left you at the station long ago on global warming you're now waiting for the little yellow school bus because you're special</Msg><Username>kollesteral</Username><Timestamp>1367715569488</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 20:59:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367716846145-15</Id><Topic><Title>Obama is preparing a stern, stern speech on Benghazi</Title><Username>gr8mkt</Username><Timestamp>1367587415406</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 09:23:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Radical Islamic files found on Boston bomber's wife's computer: report By M.L. NESTEL and DAN MacLEOD Last Updated: 10:27 AM, May 4, 2013 Posted: 1:58 AM, May 4, 2013 Radical Islamic materials and an al Qaeda magazine were found on the computer of Boston Marathon bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev’s widow — and there was explosive residue throughout their house, it was revealed yesterday. The files found on Katherine Russell’s hard drive are part of an investigation into whether the woman — who claimed to be in the dark on her husband’s terrorist activities — was aware of his plan to set off the two bombs, The Washington Post reported. It wasn’t clear whether the files belonged to Russell, 24, or her husband, 26. The explosive residue was found on the kitchen sink and table and in the bathtub at their home in Cambridge, Mass., a source told CNN.</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1367716846145</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 21:20:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367721691970-16</Id><Topic><Title>Some real employment (or "unemployment") data on Obama's lousy economy</Title><Username>say92liberals</Username><Timestamp>1367622729945</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 19:12:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>UR demented, Bro!
