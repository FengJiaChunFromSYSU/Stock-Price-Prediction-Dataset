Just as George Bush the elder lied when he said; "Read my lips, no new taxes" so now all the rest of these lying #$%$ are betraying those that voted for them. Cut the budget? Totally alien to these thieves as they need to pay off those that support them. A pox on all of them.</Msg><Username>lewcor</Username><Timestamp>1353941023351</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-26 09:43:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353948899003-2</Id><Title>Pravda calls Obama an old style communist whose economic plans will not work!</Title><Msg>While Putin is a conservative who is lowering taxes and reducing government spending.

Interestingly, Obama’s 50.8 percent represents a higher percentage of the vote than Ronald ReaganRonald Reagan received against Jimmy CarterJimmy Carter in 1980 or George W. BushGeorge W. Bush received in his 2004 re-election victory over John Kerry. Both Reagan in ’80 and Bush in ’04 received 50.7 percent of the popular vote.</Msg><Username>dropkickpubs4321</Username><Timestamp>1353958163874</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-26 14:29:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353973821635-6</Id><Title>a republican contacted YHOO to COMPLAIN about me.the other day</Title><Msg>That surely shows republicans are bankrupt..in all ways.</Msg><Username>dropkickpubs4321</Username><Timestamp>1353973821635</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-26 18:50:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353974099378-7</Id><Title>repubs........WHY should SS/Medicare/ Medicaid be part of negotiations at this point?</Title><Msg>They had NOTHING to do with the massive debt.

It wasn't me as I've never been a fink and don't intend to ever be. I've been "reported" too on another board. Pretty stupid if you ask me as these boards are to ahare opinions. If you don't have the guts to read something disagreeable to you then DON'T READ it.

I'm finding more truth there now than in "our?" "Ministry Of Truth". What we are getting is straight out of Orwell's "1984".
