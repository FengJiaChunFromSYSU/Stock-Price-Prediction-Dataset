This year, there have already been 191 emergency room visits in upstate New York as a result of using bath salts. These visits show a drastic increase from the 39 reported visits in 2011. *** Naturally, Governor Andrew Cuomo thinks we need new regulations to "combat" this. How about this: Allow the idiots to die and send their families a posthumous Darwin Award.</Msg><Username>waddaboutboosch43.duck</Username><Timestamp>1344486837000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-09 00:33:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344501545000-2</Id><Topic><Title>The BIGGEST Difference between Romney &amp; Obama!</Title><Username>caliente.zorra</Username><Timestamp>1344482503000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 23:21:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Way to go, you Hot little Fox!</Msg><Username>ourfirstpantroglodytepresident</Username><Timestamp>1344501545000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-09 04:39:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344511716000-3</Id><Topic><Title>The BIGGEST Difference between Romney &amp; Obama!</Title><Username>caliente.zorra</Username><Timestamp>1344482503000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 23:21:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nice one, Caliente... but Obama is still getting massive support from women!

I know what poverty is and I never met anyone that would not work because they were lazy! Some people won’t work for "GARBAGE WAGES!" Do you think God was LAZY, he didn’t work? You see, comrade, I am Mighty, and I cannot be fooled by Satan. He is just a little girl to me! However, I know, as a medical professional, the situation is very complicated and goes over most peoples heads, because they are not properly educated. People in poverty suffer: abuse, isolation, PTSD, depression, personality disorders, Alcoholism, drug addiction … Incompetence … THERE ARE MANY, MANY REASONS WHY PEOPLE CANT WORK! OH and I must remind you, most Americans are being medicated for "one or more" of the above! YOU CHEAT SOME … THEY MAY WANT TO KILL YOU, THEREFORE, THEY CANT WORK BECAUSE THEY HAVE AN AXE TO GRIND. THE MAIN REASON WHY EVERYONE (100-MILLION AMERICANS) ARE ON WELFARE!! Bankers have (GREEDILY) exported everything, they have reduced life to ZERO, and therefore, people have nothing! Some know this and are wise enough to say: “F THEM TOO!” THE ECONOMY WOULD DIE IF MORE PEOPLE WENT ON STRIKE, COMRADE! YOU DON’T CAST PEARLS TO SWINE! IF SOMEONE WON’T PAY YOU A FAIR WAGE, THAT’S TANTAMOUNT TO MURDER, AS DO YOU THINK POVERTY AFFORDS PROPER FOOD! NO! Republican monkeys are mindless drones of Satan; SATAN is making man disgusting to GOD, that’s his plan. If you don’t treat people the way you want to be treated, YOU DON’T GO TO HEAVEN, COMRADE! Now, can you understand the situation better? I can elaborate further -and in great detail- that would tire the hand of even a heavenly scribe if you need more? I had over 20 jobs in my life and they all STUNK! I have two degrees. I don’t take lightly to liars and cowards who try to steal from other people. I could be angry, because I never took a dime from welfare or unemployment! I paid into the system and got nothing in return! I don’t support TERRORIZING THE WORLD, MURDER AND SODOMY, COMRADE!
