Now that a recent report by the State Law Enforcement Division has blown up those claims, unable to find a single example of a "zombie voter" committing fraud, one Democrat is demanding that Gov. Nikki Haley (R) apologize for her party's "bogus" crusade. In a statement released Monday, House Democratic Leader Todd Rutherford accused Haley and other Republicans of deliberately and deceptively pushing false claims for political gain. "Now we have the proof that shows that the accusations of voter fraud were completely without merit," said Rutherford. "And once again, South Carolina's taxpayers have to foot the bill for the millions of dollars unnecessarily spent as a result of Governor Haley and her colleagues' incompetence and blind-ideology." Rutherford went on to call for Haley and Republicans to "acknowledge that they were being dishonest about voter fraud" and to "apologize to the public."</Msg><Username>hydroponicoctopus</Username><Timestamp>1373394074893</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 14:21:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373394257163-28</Id><Topic><Title>contrary to the liars here there are NOT more people on food stamps than workers</Title><Username>hydroponicoctopus</Username><Timestamp>1373376235676</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 09:23:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>the board liar and ajole wearsreligion said earlier that more people are on food stamps than are working...... that is a huge lie...... one has to wonder why people make such stupid lies?.... just the way they are, I guess, pathological liars.</Msg><Username>hydroponicoctopus</Username><Timestamp>1373394257163</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 14:24:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373394967464-29</Id><Title>wearelegion100000. is a liar., here is a quote from her that proves it</Title><Msg>"More Americans on federal food assistance than work in the private sector" so says the liar wearelegion100000..... the bls says there are 143 million people working in the civilian labor force. there are about 47 million people on food stamps...and the avg month benefit is $4.50 a day....... wearelegion100000. is a liar. lol</Msg><Username>hydroponicoctopus</Username><Timestamp>1373394967464</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 14:36:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373398043283-30</Id><Title>Expert States</Title><Msg>Trayvon was in a position on top of Zimmerman when shot was fired.
