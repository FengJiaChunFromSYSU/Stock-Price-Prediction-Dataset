When people see the tax as a line item on a restaurant tab as opposed to the cost being buried in menu items it get's their attention. Similarly, if the population had to pay quarterly taxes as opposed to paying taxes via payroll deductions, you'd see a wholesale tax revolt. That is why the IRS hates 1099 employees.</Msg><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1353070572604</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-16 07:56:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353073007331-2</Id><Topic><Title>whiny owner of 40 dennys takes back his kneejerk 'idea' to add a 5% obamacare charge</Title><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1353014457743</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 16:20:57 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>funny how the 60 denny's in canada can manage, what with all the socialism and universal healthcare, and weird Canadian idea that even waitressess and cooks should have health insurance. and come to think of it, arent' there restaurants in Europe, and Japan and australia and israel and well, you get it......every country in the world with universal healthcare.... which is all the modern nations,</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1353073007331</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-16 08:36:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353073528264-3</Id><Title>losers in the gop think the little people should not even get paid a livable wage</Title><Msg>#$%$ like seaburgc think that the waitress or the cook and so forth should not get a livable wage and health insurance........their work isn't worth it according to this ilk....... only in the USA though...... the cooks and waitresses in Canada and Europe and everywhere have health insurance..... the 60 Dennys in Canada aren't whining about a pancake tax paying for their healthcare.</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1353073528264</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-16 08:45:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353075008920-4</Id><Topic><Title>Could someone please splain to me why those</Title><Username>whycantphiligetawoman</Username><Timestamp>1353065145026</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-16 06:25:45 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama's financial repression policies are progressively destroying the economy.

Simpson, the former Wyoming senator, said of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, aka "Obamacare." "We haven't found any constituency yet who wants to cut anything back anywhere." A persistent lack of support from Washington to get a handle on the debt and deficit problem took focus of much of the pair's remarks. For Simpson, the problem is especially apparent in health care, which they identified as one of five key areas where debt-reduction has to focus. Congress in 2010 passed President Barack Obama's national health care plan that will go into effect fully in 2014. "This baby is on automatic pilot," he said. "It can't possibly succeed. There is no cost containment in this baby until down the road, and we know what will happen down the road - nothing." http://finance.yahoo.com/news/obamacare-others-slashing-simpson-bowles-145835342.html</Msg><Username>howie_is_long</Username><Timestamp>1353080069388</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-16 10:34:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353080171855-17</Id><Title>this Petreaus scandle just won't quite</Title><Msg>the love triangle, unclassified material at the biographer's house, the Jill Kelly who wanted $80 million to broker a deal with Korea and now the FBI agent who blew the cover off it all decided he'd just send Kelly a photo of him shirtless to see if he could get in on the action?? what a bunch of testosterone fueled idiots.</Msg><Username>kollesteral</Username><Timestamp>1353080171855</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-16 10:36:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353081682289-18</Id><Topic><Title>losers in the gop think the little people should not even get paid a livable wage</Title><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1353073528264</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-16 08:45:28 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>SPIT IN THIER FOOD and REMEMBER, HEP 1, 2, and 3; Aids ...

Hostess brands will be no more. Who will be next? There may be a silver lining in this. Eliminating the high cost of union labor will correct wage discrepency and benefits. I know guys who work on the Golden Gate Bridge. Unions there include painters, ironworkers, electricians, mechanics, bus drivers. The painters broke with their union a year or so ago. They realized they weren't being represented in their interests and had better results with GGB management. Who will be next? Much of the outsourcing jobs are due to greedy unions. The leftwing ding dongs will deny it but the wage scale bartered by union contracts sent many companies overseas. Ask Diane Feinstein. She and her husband were some of the first to jump when NAFTA was signed. Did you know Procter &amp; Gamble are headquartered in Canada?

I'm sure the founder was a Republican and probably most of the management. To show idiots that these people cared for their employees I'll cite a couple of facts about the company. These occurred before there was a union. During the depression they worked men on a shortened week rather than lay anyone off. The founder had also set up a fund for people with medical expenses they couldn't handle. The company would pay for sots to "take the cure" rather than fire them. You won't find billionaire "liberals" doing such things,ever.</Msg><Username>lewcor</Username><Timestamp>1353116528280</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-16 20:42:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353121760538-36</Id><Title>Barbara Bush says grow up, you lost get over it, stop your whining &amp; panty wadding</Title><Msg>Former First Lady Barbara Bush Says All The Mitt Romney Lovin’ Sore Losers Need To Get Over It! “I’m tired now of the elections,” Bush, who had endorsed Republican Mitt Romney, said at a forum on America’s first ladies. “People spoke.
