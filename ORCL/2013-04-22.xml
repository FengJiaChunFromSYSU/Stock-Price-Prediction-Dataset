What was it? 5) And most important of all: The FBI interview him in 2011. That means they met with him, looked him in the eye. Why is it that no one at the FBI said "I know that guy?"

Same sex marriage and immigration didn't get the support from the GOP until they realized that's what the voters wanted - they're making a big mistake over back ground checks. Telling people it's a "slippery slope" by requiring background checks is completely irresponsible.

(Photograph: Matt Rourke/AP) Over the last two years, the US has witnessed at least three other episodes of mass, indiscriminate violence that killed more people than the Boston bombings did: the Tucson shooting by Jared Loughner in which 19 people (including Rep. Gabrielle Giffords) were shot, six of whom died; the Aurora movie theater shooting by James Holmes in which 70 people were shot, 12 of whom died; and the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting by Adam Lanza in which 26 people (20 of whom were children) were shot and killed. The word "terrorism" was almost never used to describe that indiscriminate slaughter of innocent people, and none of the perpetrators of those attacks was charged with terrorism-related crimes. A decade earlier, two high school seniors in Colorado, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, used guns and bombs to murder 12 students and a teacher, and almost nobody called that "terrorism" either.</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1366658259513</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-22 15:17:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366658821247-42</Id><Topic><Title>40% of gun sales done with no background check</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1366638302685</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-22 09:45:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>it is true republican pollster Frank Lutz documents it and the fact that idiots like you are ignorant of the facts: "Gun owners have misperceptions of current gun laws, with over half (53%) of non-NRA members and 57% of NRA members believing that the statement, “Everyone who wants to buy a gun has to pass a background check to complete the purchase” is true.
