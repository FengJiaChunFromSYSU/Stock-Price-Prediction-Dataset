I say, pretty good idea. I'm all for profiling. Effective. CNN's Don Lemon discusses the possibility of profiling white men in an attempt to prevent gun violence and decrease the amount of mass shootings. Lemon argues that white males between the ages of 18 and 25 were behind nearly all recent mass killings.</Msg><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1356363028539</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-24 10:30:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356363293705-2</Id><Topic><Title>Urgent: ORCL Traders - Dont drop the soap..

Right now I've got the nastiest cold in memory. Got pink eye as a result and went to a walk-in clinic Saturday evening for treatment. Couldn't afford to wait to see regular doc so I put my trust in some 3rd world MD at the clinic. I think he got it right though. Hasn't stopped me from cooking. Last evening we steamed 1.5 lb. lobsters. Tomorrow bacon wrapped shrimp for my appetizer.</Msg><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1356365697123</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-24 11:14:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356366372172-7</Id><Topic><Title>profile white guys...</Title><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1356363028539</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-24 10:30:28 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>peter, the not so great, it's more than school shootings.

It is made using a proprietary, water-based manufacturing process that results in a pH neutral product containing naturally occurring vitamin C metabolites. These metabolites activate the vitamin C molecules, making it easier for the body to transport them from cell to cell for numerous health benefits.* One clinical study showed that Ester-C® increased vitamin C levels in the body.¹ White blood cell levels of Vitamin C were elevated in subjects receiving Ester-C® when measured after initial dose. The presence of key metabolites such as threonate may contribute to this increased level and retention of vitamin C by the cells.</Msg><Username>ivleeg_garbage</Username><Timestamp>1356372974980</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-24 13:16:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
