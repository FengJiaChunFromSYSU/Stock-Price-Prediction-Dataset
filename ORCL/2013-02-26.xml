The issue is that the people on the bottom quintile pay NEGATIVE taxes, and the bottom 49% pay nothing or get a credit. Thus, it all falls on the top. Further, when the marginal rates were 70%, the effective rate for the top 1% was 21.8%, but now with the top marginal rate at only 35% theeffective tax rate for that same group is 19.4.

Ask yourself, why does a Pres need a task force whose primary purpose is to sprinkle sugar on scht and keep the low info, low IQ liberals in step? And the media perpetuates it. Liberals gave him the latitude to screw them and they cheer for more. They wholeheartedly deserve it. To say that Bush was to blame for what is happening now is denial and a sugar fest.</Msg><Username>passthebuckaroo</Username><Timestamp>1361927100234</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 20:05:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361933409359-38</Id><Topic><Title>taxes killed the USA in the 1950s, killed the jobs, and all the "job creators" left whine about high taxes</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1361887517880</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 09:05:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>UR simply wrong --- the top 1% are paying more than ever, both in terms of total dollars and the share of all taxes they are unfairly covering.</Msg><Username>indahouzza</Username><Timestamp>1361933409359</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 21:50:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361939687023-39</Id><Title>what bush and repubs did in 2001 and 2002 is the most fiscally irresponsible thing</Title><Msg>to have ever happened and it was done with 99.9% supoort from repubs.
