This thread shows 5 replies but they aren't showing up. Yahoo must have really been offended by buckwheat. They're zapping everyone? I'm ditching Yahoo and staying over at Raging Bull. I think the guys who came up with this convoluted format are the same ones who wrote the 2600 page healthcare reform. What a logistical mess.</Msg><Username>passthebuckaroo</Username><Timestamp>1356538104801</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-26 11:08:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356544622264-4</Id><Title>fathers disappearing?</Title><Msg>yahoo won't let me post link, but there's a newspaer piece out there about disappearing fathers..and how that contributes to poverty especially among blacks. Interesting how the paper paints this as news. It's been that way for 40 years. It's old news.

If one expects nothing, guess what...one gets nothing. The word "expect" is one of the most powerful words in the English lexicon. That word was very effective for me when raising our kids. Too bad it isn't used more.</Msg><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1356568273093</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-26 19:31:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
