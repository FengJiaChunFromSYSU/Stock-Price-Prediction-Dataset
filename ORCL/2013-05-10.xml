The Internal Revenue Service inappropriately flagged conservative political groups for additional reviews during the 2012 election to see if they were violating their tax-exempt status, a top IRS official said Friday. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite) WASHINGTON (AP) — The Internal Revenue Service inappropriately flagged conservative political groups for additional reviews during the 2012 election to see if they were violating their tax-exempt status, a top IRS official said Friday. Organizations were singled out because they included the words "tea party" or "patriot" in their applications for tax-exempt status, said Lois Lerner, who heads the IRS division that oversees tax-exempt groups. In some cases, groups were asked for their list of donors, which violates IRS policy in most cases, she said. "That was wrong. That was absolutely incorrect, it was insensitive and it was inappropriate. That's not how we go about selecting cases for further review," Lerner said at a conference sponsored by the American Bar Association. "The IRS would like to apologize for that," she added.</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1368214531233</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 15:35:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368215118234-40</Id><Title>knock knock on 34's door! gonna bust that door open and go 44</Title><Msg>oh yeah!</Msg><Username>crazy_iranian456</Username><Timestamp>1368215118234</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 15:45:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368216429344-41</Id><Title>But I do note that the Head-Kicked Pig who used to post American Death Tolls every #$%$ day has not done so since Jan 2009!</Title><Msg>There hasn't been that many.
