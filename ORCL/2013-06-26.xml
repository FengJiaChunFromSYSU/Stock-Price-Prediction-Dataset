In a massive restructuring, Army leaders said Tuesday that they will slash the number of active duty combat brigades from 45 to 33, as the service moves forward with a longtime plan to cut the size of the service by 80,000. And they warned that more cuts — of as many as 100,000 more active duty, National Guard and Reserve soldiers — could be coming if Congress allows billions of dollars in automatic budget cuts to continue next year. The sweeping changes would eliminate brigades — which number from 3,500 to 5,000 troops — at 10 Army bases in the U.S. by 2017, including those in Texas, Kentucky, Georgia, Colorado, North Carolina, New York, Kansas and Washington. The Army will also cut thousands of other jobs across the service, including soldiers in units that support the brigades, and two brigades in Germany have already been scheduled for elimination.</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1372249176350</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 08:19:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372249723090-11</Id><Topic><Title>is god a man?

These alliances with Salesforce and Microsoft are small and I'm cutting my losses. Some analysts report that they may not make earnings estimates in September 2013. That could drop the stock by 20-30%. I thought about going long but I think Google is going to wipe the floor with AAPL and it makes no sense to stay with ORCL who are making slow moves without a good dividend. Cut your losses, the lack of "startling announcements" was the final straw in the hat for me. I took a 3k loss on this stock in the last week.

It had a PE of 18, high for a utility. And with interest rates rising, I figure utilities will be less attractive for their yield. So now I have $12k to play with. I see positive secular economic improvement, especially in technology. Oracle has caught my eye, given its PE=13, cash flow, balance sheets, and technology that underpins enterprise computing, both on site &amp; in the cloud. Oracle provides infrastructure &amp; applications for the entire cloud stack: IAAS, PAAS, &amp; SAAS. I'm deciding between ORCL, IBM, &amp; INTC. I actually believe INTC is best of 3 solid, fairly valued companies here. But it's a matter of degree of course. Note also that I am a value investor, prepared to hold from 5 - 20 years, reinvesting dividends along the way. Any thoughts, advice, or opinions on ORCL &amp; the future? Especially in the context of the cloud? Can Oracle sustain growth? My guts says yes. A history of great financials &amp; adaptation speaks volumes. Larry is still vigorous. Also, as somebody whom has frequently competed against Oracle, I can attest to the excellence of their core database &amp; some apps.

ALSO most Fund Managers by now have done their rebalancing for the month/quarter end and ORCL has had some good press, the market is coming back after the GDP discredited the Bond vigilantes that drove the 10-year US bond yields by over 25% in a week.... THE shorts now are fighting the House with 500 million share buyback program and the Fed that has no intention of slowing down the Bond purchases as the economy slowly but surely is ticking up.... THE earnings season will prove the shorts wrong as the large caps will beat and outperform the expectations. WE will have choppy trading on Oracle till mid-July till it officially trades at NYSE, So buy on all the Dips.
