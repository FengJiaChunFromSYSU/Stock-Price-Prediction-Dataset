The scope of using the secret accounts across government remains a mystery: Most U.S. agencies have failed to turn over lists of political appointees' email addresses, which the AP sought under the Freedom of Information Act more than three months ago. The Labor Department initially asked the AP to pay more than $1 million for its email addresses. The AP asked for the addresses following last year's disclosures that the former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency had used separate email accounts at work. The practice is separate from officials who use personal, non-government email accounts for work, which generally is discouraged - but often happens anyway - due to laws requiring that most federal records be preserved. The secret email accounts complicate an agency's legal responsibilities to find and turn over emails in response to congressional or internal investigations, civil lawsuits or public records requests because employees assigned to compile such responses would necessarily need to know about the accounts to search them. Secret accounts also drive perceptions that government officials are trying to hide actions or decisions.</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1370346497505</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 07:48:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370346548980-3</Id><Topic><Title>200 bush WH visits by male prostitute..... ha ha ha ha SCANDALOUS!!!!!</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1370289691500</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-03 16:01:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Posted on Monday, June 3, 2013 Obama Administration publishes details of missile base Israel wanted kept secret TEL AVIV, Israel — Israel’s military fumed Monday over the discovery that the U.S. government had revealed details of a top-secret Israeli military installation in published bid requests. The Obama administration had promised to build Israel a state-of-the-art facility to house a new ballistic-missile defense system, the Arrow 3. As with all Defense Department projects, detailed specifications were made public so that contractors could bid on the $25 million project. The specifications included more than 1,000 pages of details on the facility, ranging from the heating and cooling systems to the thickness of the walls. "If an enemy of Israel wanted to launch an attack against a facility, this would give him an easy how-to guide. This type of information is closely guarded and its release can jeopardize the entire facility," said an Israeli military official who commented on the publication of the proposal but declined to be named because he wasn’t authorized to discuss the facility. He declined to say whether plans for the facility have been altered as a result of the disclosure. "This is more than worrying, it is shocking," he said.</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1370346548980</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 07:49:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370349710121-4</Id><Title>Issa proves he is a big joke and a creep that few take seriously</Title><Msg>Raw Story “Darrell Issa should call Jay Carney and apologize this morning,” Gibbs told MSNBC host Joe Scarborough on Monday. “He’s laying out the charge and then saying it might be true.

It’s why five people in this town take Darrell Issa seriously. And it’s the surest bet that the Republicans are very much on the verge of overplaying their hand publicly and that the American people will lose interest in their side of this,” he added. “To throw around the words liar and perjury as easily as he did is shameful. And if he’s got information that these people lied, he should put it out there today.” Co-host Mika Brzezinski pointed out that “Darrell Issa just kind of took it down to a level that makes us all just want to walk away and ignore it.” “It shows how unserious he is about investigating anything,” Gibbs agreed. “The notion that he’s in charge of — quote — Government Oversight might now be the biggest joke in all of Washington.”</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1370349710121</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 08:41:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370349847131-5</Id><Title>even Rebublicans are calling Issa a liar</Title><Msg>RePubs Call Issa a Liar ! .
