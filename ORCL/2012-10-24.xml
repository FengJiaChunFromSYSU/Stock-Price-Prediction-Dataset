Particularly revenue from per unit licensees continued to erode because handset vendors in Japan, along with RIM, and HTC continued to lose market share to Samsung and Apple. Samsung and Apple are both fixed-term licensees where revenue streams are unaffected by volumes. OUTLOOK SHOULD BE SOLID We believe that due to the timing of asset sales, as well as license renewals and outcomes of litigation, that quarterly results are difficult to forecast. However, we should continue to see an annualized trend towards growth through licensing, partnerships, and asset sales. This is reflected in our sum-of-the-parts analysis below. Our estimate of cash includes our estimate incremental cash that resulted from the sale of the patents to Intel. We reiterate our BUY recommendation and our 12-month share price target of $45.00. Our estimate excludes licensing revenue from Nokia, Huawei, ZTE, and LG, which are all involved in litigation with Interdigital currently. Yesterday's the stock closed with a gain of 5% in the after hours trading.

On Monday, several voters complained that their electronic ballot machine cast the wrong vote. All the complaints were made by people who voted at the Bur-Mil Park polling location. One of the voters, Sher Coromalis, says she cast her ballot for Governor Mitt Romney, but every time she entered her vote it defaulted to President Obama. “I was so upset that this could happen,” said Coromalis. Guilford County Board of Elections Director George Gilbert says the problem arises every election. It can be resolved after the machine is re-calibrated by poll workers. “It’s not a conspiracy it’s just a machine that needs to be corrected,” Gilbert said. After the third try, Coromalis says she was able to get her vote counted for Gov. Romney but was still annoyed. “I should have just mailed it in,” Coromalis said. Elections officials say the machines have been fixed as of Tuesday, and no problems have been reported since. Early Voting ends November 3.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1351076434245</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 07:00:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351081120469-4</Id><Title>2 Black boys who could pass as 'sons of Obama'.....</Title><Msg>Travon Martin look alikes..... ages 15 &amp; 17... brothers... bashed a 12 yr old white girls skull in yesterday in NJ.... small... beautiful little girl by anyones discription They left her body in a trash recycling bin...

Reagan raised the debt limit every five months, Bush every 13 months, and Obama every 15 months. (Clinton was every 24 months.) So, without the possibility of contradiction, the presidents who needed the debt ceiling raised the most often were Reagan and Bush, and the Republicans burbled happily as they did it. Suddenly though, in the middle of a global financial trauma, those same GOPers decided that now raising the debt ceiling mattered. And, somehow, they portrayed this as being representative of out-of-control spending by the Democrats. (I showed why that was bogus up above.) There were a few other things that the Republican talking points hid from America – raising the debt ceiling wasn’t about allowing future spending, it was about paying past bills. In other words, the money had already been spent – demanding cuts in future budgets did nothing to affect the structural debt.."</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1351082391649</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 08:39:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351082909998-10</Id><Topic><Title>republican senate candidate says rape is God's work</Title><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1351044696389</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 22:11:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>the gop senator explained that not only is rape god's work, but god blessed him personally with an erection the other day and that viagra was the work of god too. and ditto for west nile disease and the mosquito, one of god's favorite works.</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1351082909998</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 08:48:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351084167181-11</Id><Topic><Title>Chief Clown Obama does not know ALL US Marines are issued bayonets</Title><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1351046154744</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 22:35:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Neither one of those idiots knows anything..

Pollak 23 Oct 2012 106 post a comment The New York Times reveals today--in a classic buried lede--that Harvey Weinstein's film about the killing of Osama bin Laden, set to air on the National Geographic Channel two days before the election, originally included a scene showing Gov. Mitt Romney "appearing to oppose the raid," a complete fabrication of history. The film, SEAL Team Six: The Raid on Osama bin Laden, grants President Barack Obama a "starring role," and was edited--apparently at Weinstein's suggestion--to embellish Obama's involvement: "the film has been recut, using news and documentary footage to strengthen Mr. Obama’s role and provide a window into decision-making in the White House." The director claims, in his defense, that the edits reduce Obama's on-screen time. The Romney scene was cut at the insistence of National Geographic Channel CEO Howard T. Owens, who told the Times: "We wouldn’t air this if it were propaganda." He explains the choice of the film's release date as merely the best chance to exploit its commercial potential. Another controversial film about the bin Laden raid, Kathryn Bigelow's Zero Dark Thirty, which was produced in coordination with the Obama administration and using classified information from intelligence agencies, had its release date postponed until after the election. Romney has pushed back throughout the presidential campaign against made-up charges by the Obama campaign that he would not have ordered the raid--a claim that has been debunked and widely criticized, not only for the substance of the charge, but for the political foolishness of the Obama campaign in making it. Now that task has been outsourced to Weinstein, a devoted donor to Obama and other Democrats, who spent $2.5 million to acquire the rights to the film and shaped it to suit his political purposes and preferences.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1351089459790</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 10:37:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351090212947-40</Id><Title>TADF BIG OCTOBER NEWS.TADF 2000% GAINS POSSIBLE ON ACQUISITIONS ANNOUNCED.

The emails, reportedly put out by the State Department, specifically mention that the Libyan militant group Ansar al-Sharia had taken credit for the attack almost immediately and called for additional terrorist acts. The correspondence provides a glimpse into how U.S. diplomats described the fiery assault, as it was happening, to officials in Washington, D.C. The terrorist attack claimed the lives of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans, including two former Navy SEALs and a State Department official. It took the Obama administration nearly two weeks to completely rule out an anti-Muslim video as the cause of the attack. Numerous Obama administration officials, including White House Press Secretary Jay Carney, U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Susan Rice, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and even Obama himself, went on TV at different times and told millions of American citizens that the attacks were due to a spontaneous protest sparked by the video. Now it has been uncovered that the administration knew within hours that a terrorist group had proudly admitted they attacked the U.S. compound. Reuters has the details on the emails sent to the various Obama administration officials: The first email, timed at 4:05 p.m. Washington time – or 10:05 p.m. Benghazi time, 20-30 minutes after the attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission allegedly began – carried the subject line “U.S. Diplomatic Mission in Benghazi Under Attack” and the notation “SBU”, meaning “Sensitive But Unclassified.” The text said the State Department’s regional security office had reported that the diplomatic mission in Benghazi was “under attack. Embassy in Tripoli reports approximately 20 armed people fired shots; explosions have been heard as well.” A second email, headed “Update 1: U.S. Diplomatic Mission in Benghazi” and timed 4:54 p.m. Washington time, said that the Embassy in Tripoli had reported that “the firing at the U.S. Diplomatic Mission in Benghazi had stopped and the compound had been cleared.” It said a “response team” was at the site attempting to locate missing personnel. A third email, also marked SBU and sent at 6:07 p.m. Washington time, carried the subject line: “Update 2: Ansar al-Sharia Claims Responsibility for Benghazi Attack.” The message reported: “Embassy Tripoli reports the group claimed responsibility on Facebook and Twitter and has called for an attack on Embassy Tripoli.” Here are images of the emails courtesy of CBS News: Emails Show Ansar al Sharia Claimed Responsibilty for Benghazi Attack Within Two Hours Emails Show Ansar al Sharia Claimed Responsibilty for Benghazi Attack Within Two Hours Emails Show Ansar al Sharia Claimed Responsibilty for Benghazi Attack Within Two Hours Watch CBS News’ report: Fox News reports that the emails were sent to a “variety of national security platforms, whose addresses have been redacted, including the White House Situation Room, the Pentagon, the FBI and the Director of National Intelligence.” Additionally, sources told Fox News that around 300 to 400 national security officials received the emails “in real time.” The officials on the email recipient list work under the nation’s top national security, military and diplomatic officials, according to sources. The revelation, if confirmed to be legitimate, also calls into question why President Obama decided to take off on campaign trip to Las Vegas if his State Department the day before informed his national security team that a group of radical Islamic terrorists was claiming responsibility for killing four Americans. The other question that demands answering is whether the U.S. military could have intervened if the White House knew two hours after the seven hour attack began that a terrorist group was overwhelming the U.S. Consulate, putting the lives of Americans in danger. CBS News’ Sharyl Attkisson reports: CBS News has been told that, hours after the attack began, an unmanned Predator drone was sent over the U.S. mission in Benghazi, and that the drone and other reconnaissance aircraft apparently observed the final hours of the protracted battle. The State Department, White House and Pentagon declined to say what military options were available. A White House official told CBS News that, at the start of the attack, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Martin Dempsey and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta “looked at available options, and the ones we exercised had our military forces arrive in less than 24 hours, well ahead of timelines laid out in established policies.” But it was too late to help the Americans in Benghazi. The ambassador and three others were dead. No word from the Obama administration on the emails.

The latest figures are from the 3,903 people who received letters from Gessler's office questioning their citizenship in August. During a first round of checks, Gessler said 141 others were found to be possible noncitizens based on a federal immigration database. Critics of Gessler, who is a Republican, have questioned his political motives and argue the checks have the potential to disenfranchise eligible voters. Some of the people who have received letters questioning their citizenship have turned out to be U.S. citizens, and a few of the original 141 have maintained they are citizens. The majority of the people who are suspected to be noncitizens and on the rolls are unaffiliated voters, which make up more than half, and Democrats, according to data provided by Gessler's office. The proportion in party registration breakdown is similar to the overall number of people who received letters in August. State election officials did additional checks this month after obtaining immigration identification numbers from the state division of motor vehicles for all of people who received letters. They received letters because at one point they showed proof they weren't U.S. citizens, such as a green card, when obtaining a driver's license. The latest figures mean that out of the 3,903 who received letters, 441 are believed to be non-citizens, according to the federal database, which has normally been used to check the status of legal immigrants who receive government benefits. "It's unacceptable to have ineligible voters casting ballots in our elections," Gessler said. "We want to ensure the most accurate reliable elections possible."</Msg><Username>liberals_plague_humanity</Username><Timestamp>1351097548743</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 12:52:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351097897498-54</Id><Topic><Title>Mullah gop preachs that rape is god's work and 9000 yr old earth and that tax cuts and money grow on trees</Title><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1351085088788</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 09:24:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yep, they must have a direct line to god . thus they know and talk about god's view of rape and the blessing it really is.</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1351097897498</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 12:58:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351098004714-55</Id><Topic><Title>how long until the Mittens austerity and spending cuts....if he wins?</Title><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1351096158197</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 12:29:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>is mitt going to start his austerity on day one? is that the same time he will start more of his cherished nation building in the mideast by sending them money?</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1351098004714</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 13:00:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351098094203-56</Id><Topic><Title>Game changing report</Title><Username>elisaverf80108</Username><Timestamp>1351002651356</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 10:30:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Very informative.

All five of the Midianite kings – Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba – died in the battle. They also killed Balaam son of Beor with the sword. Then the Israelite army captured the Midianite women and children and seized their cattle and flocks and all their wealth as plunder. They burned all the towns and villages where the Midianites had lived. After they had gathered the plunder and captives, both people and animals, they brought them all to Moses and Eleazar the priest, and to the whole community of Israel, which was camped on the plains of Moab beside the Jordan River, across from Jericho. Moses, Eleazar the priest, and all the leaders of the people went to meet them outside the camp. But Moses was furious with all the military commanders who had returned from the battle. "Why have you let all the women live?" he demanded. "These are the very ones who followed Balaam's advice and caused the people of Israel to rebel against the LORD at Mount Peor. They are the ones who caused the plague to strike the LORD's people. Now kill all the boys and all the women who have slept with a man. Only the young girls who are virgins may live; you may keep them for yourselves. Clearly Moses and God approves of rape of virgins.</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1351101544807</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 13:59:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351101615943-64</Id><Topic><Title>If a Mitt win, how long till the austerity and spending cuts</Title><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1351098855646</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 13:14:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>if mitt is elected will the spending cuts come BEFORE the tax cuts this time?</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1351101615943</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 14:00:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351103589151-65</Id><Topic><Title>If a Mitt win, how long till the austerity and spending cuts</Title><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1351098855646</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 13:14:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Libiots never think of growing an economy instead of govt ruining it.

The predominant philosophy among this group is that a dollar in a workers' pocket is a dollar that could be in a rich person's pocket – and these people see social security putting lots of dollars in the pockets of people who are not rich. Cutting back benefits could mean delays in repaying the government bonds held by the Trust Fund. The money to repay these bonds would come primarily from a relatively progressive income tax revenue. The wealthy certainly don't want to see changes like raising the cap on wages that are subject to the social security tax, which is currently just over $110,000. For this reason, a candidate who comes out for protecting social security can expect to see a hit to their campaign contributions. They also can anticipate being beaten up in both the opinion and news sections of major media outlets. While, in principle, these are supposed to be kept strictly separate, the owners and/or top management of most news outlets feel no qualms about removing this separation when it comes to social security – and using news space to attack those who defend social security. There is also the flip side to this story. Politicians, especially Democrats, who speak up for cuts to social security can count on lavish praise from the media. Political figures of no obvious stature, like former Louisiana Senator John Breaux or former Indiana Senator Evan Bayh, were lionized in the media for their willingness to cut social security benefits. After leaving the Senate, both took lobbying positions where they were almost certainly earning well over $1m a year."

After the fundraiser, Allred admitted to O’Reilly Factor correspondent Jesse Watters that she “just had a few words with the President” backstage, “he had some very kind words for me,” and “knows of my work…” but would not elaborate more on the details of her conversation. Now, two weeks later Allred is spearheading an “October surprise” targeting Mitt Romney just days before the election. Allred is looking to unseal testimony that the GOP presidential candidate gave in the divorce case of Staples founder Tom Stemberg. Staples was founded with seed money from Romney's firm, Bain Capital and Stemberg is a Romney surrogate. Allred appeared in court today with ex-wife Maureen Stemberg.
