Now we have the tax hikes and STILL he won't agree to spending cuts as part of the debt ceiling negotiations. He threw away the recommendations of HIS OWN deficit commission, Simpson-Bowles. It's like he doesn't even CARE about these huge deficits and this massive money-printing by the federal reserve. We have to fight this man, people. Obama has no concern that he is bankrupting America. We have to assume, given what is happening, that he is the enemy of our future in America.

The nice shysters at the "Fed" create it from thin air and charge usury on it. However, they DO NOT create the money to pay that usury. This leads to an ever increasing debt load. Few will speak out against this racket which is as old as ancient Babylon where it originated. The only other source of money at this time is coinage. The government pays this directly into circulation with no usury and makes a small profit called seignorage. If they can create coins they can print paper too as Lincoln did during the Civil War. They were called "U, S, Notes" and 4.5 billion dollars was created at NO interest. They are supposed to circulate by law but the banksters took them from open circulation and put them in their vaults as "reserves". Do some reading on the subject and see how you are being had.</Msg><Username>lewcor</Username><Timestamp>1358210856093</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-14 19:47:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358213870421-22</Id><Title>Bloomberg starts: Mayors Against Illegal Guns</Title><Msg>DUH?
