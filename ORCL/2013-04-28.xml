Media falsely claim Obama and staff are "exempt" from health care reform Media have falsely claimed President Obama, members of his administration, and certain congressional staff are "exempt" from the recently enacted health care bill. In fact, the bill subjects the White House, members of Congress, and their staffs to the same reforms and requirements as the rest of the American people. White House, Congress, and federal employees are subject to same health care reforms applied to American people White House, Congress required to carry health insurance like everyone else. Starting in 2014, Americans will be required to have minimum health insurance coverage, with exemptions for certain people with religious objections or the inability to afford coverage. The bill does not exempt government employees such as leaders and staffers at the White House and Congress. Insurers covering government workers will be subject to insurance regulations. The insurers participating in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, through which federal workers obtain health coverage, are not exempt from the regulations imposed by the bill on insurers. These regulations include prohibitions on lifetime limits on coverage and denial of coverage to those with pre-existing conditions, and the requirement to spend 80-85 percent of premiums on medical claims, among others. Bill does not require Americans to enroll in health care exchange plans. Contrary to the suggestion that participating in the exchange plans is mandatory, there is no such requirement</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1367158717435</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-28 10:18:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367159221905-15</Id><Topic><Title>seaburgc repeats the old lie that "congress staffers ""could be"" exempt from Obamacare</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1367158717435</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-28 10:18:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Mesa, it is you who lie.

In another conversation, the mother of now-dead bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev was recorded talking to someone in southern Russia who is under FBI investigation in an unrelated case, officials said. The conversations are significant because, had they been revealed earlier, they might have been enough evidence for the FBI to initiate a more thorough investigation of the Tsarnaev family.</Msg><Username>liberals_plague_humanity</Username><Timestamp>1367160922734</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-28 10:55:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367160949228-21</Id><Topic><Title>more pain to come</Title><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1367152814647</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-28 08:40:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In his weekly address, Pres.

That explains the new affection for Bush. By PEGGY NOONAN Like this columnist Barack Obama was elected president in 2008 because he was not George W. Bush. In fact, he was elected because he was the farthest thing possible from Mr. Bush. On some level he knew this, which is why every time he got in trouble he'd say Bush's name. It's all his fault, you have no idea the mess I inherited. As long as Mr. Bush's memory was hovering like Boo Radley in the shadows, Mr. Obama would be OK. This week something changed. George W. Bush is back, for the unveiling of his presidential library. His numbers are dramatically up. You know why? Because he's the farthest thing from Barack Obama. Obama fatigue has opened the way to Bush affection. *** In all his recent interviews Mr. Bush has been modest, humorous, proud but unassuming, and essentially philosophical: History will decide. No finger-pointing or scoring points. If he feels rancor or resentment he didn't show it. He didn't attempt to manipulate. His sheer normality seemed like a relief, an echo of an older age. And all this felt like an antidote to Obama—to the imperious I, to the inability to execute, to the endless interviews and the imperturbable drone, to the sense that he is trying to teach us, like an Ivy League instructor taken aback by the backwardness of his students. *** This is EXACTLY spot on. Let Biden take over. U.S. can't take 3 more years of this clown.

Hey, what's new about this government financing terrorists? "Al Queda" means "The List" in Arabic. It refers to the CIA's list of members in this group. George Bush was in business in Texas with one of Osama's half brother. He was killed in an ultra-light airplane accident 2-3 years before 9/11. When 9/11 happened there were about 35 Bin Laden relatives in Texas. They were all flown back to Saudi Arabia with no questions asked while no one else could fly.</Msg><Username>lewcor</Username><Timestamp>1367191228867</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-28 19:20:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367191854834-40</Id><Title>is the worm turning?</Title><Msg>I dunno, but this is interesting. Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook fame touting virtues of big oil and dangers of Obamacare. Hmmm. FWD.us, the political action group founded by Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg and other Silicon Valley big shots, says its purpose is to promote comprehensive immigration reform. But some of their recent ads talk more about the dangers of Obamacare and the virtues of Big Oil. That doesn’t sound very much like the Zuckerberg of old, ThinkProgress says. In fact, Zuckerberg wrote in an op-ed in The Washington Post, that “The economy of the last century was primarily based on natural resources … Today’s economy is very different. It is based primarily on knowledge and ideas.”</Msg><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1367191854834</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-28 19:30:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367192141179-41</Id><Title>Sen.

Even in the wake of the April 15 Boston Marathon bombing – in which a pair of Islamic radicals are accused of planting explosives that took the lives of 3 and wounded over 280 – the polls suggest Americans are hesitant to give up any further freedoms in exchange for increased “security.” One poll is Fox news. The other is the Washington POst. Is the worm turning? Hmmm.</Msg><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1367192459672</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-28 19:40:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
