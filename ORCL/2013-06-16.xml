As our James Hamblin notes, white deaths haven’t exceeded white births in at least a century. The Caucasian population only expanded thanks to 188,384 immigrants. So there’s still no net decline in white population. But now we gotta bring in ringers.

As a result, many of the roughly 2,000 agents in the agency’s Bureau of Diplomatic Security are permitted to play only limited roles in agency efforts to police bad conduct and prosecute wrongdoers. * US Ambassador to Belgium Howard Gutman, a big Democratic donor, was accused of soliciting prostitutes, including minors, but the State Department agent examining the claims was called off the investigation even after determining Gutman routinely ditched his security detail. * Security officer Chuck Lisenbee, stationed in Beirut, Lebanon, allegedly sexually assaulted local guards. The internal probe into the charges lasted three days. * Huma Abedin, wife of mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner and one of Clinton’s closest aides, is being investigated for how she got a six-figure deal to work as a private consultant while still employed by the State Department. * After terrorists killed four Americans, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens, at the US Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, on Sept. 11, 2012, then-US Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice described the assault as stemming from a “spontaneous protest” rather than calling what it was — a planned terrorist attack. The assault came after repeated indications that compound security needed to be increased.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1371432593595</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-16 21:29:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371438906266-52</Id><Topic><Title>It makes no difference to me anyway as Iran IS NOT a threat to anyone.says runner</Title><Username>dropkickpubs4321</Username><Timestamp>1371420901080</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-16 18:15:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama thinks they're a threat. They have nuclear capabilities now and Russia will at some point join the Axis. If Obama is preparing to deal with Assad and Iran is sending troops, where do you think this will lead and are you going to squeal like you did with Bush or do you think Obama should let Syria exterminate their people by use of chemical weapons?
