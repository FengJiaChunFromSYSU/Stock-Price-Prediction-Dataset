"The fact is the United States is on an unsustainable course," Perot says in an op-ed for our sister Gannett paper, the Des Moines Register. "At stake is nothing less than our position in the world, our standard of living at home and our constitutional freedoms." Perot, who sought the presidency as an independent candidate in 1992 and 1996, writes that "we can't afford four more years in which debt mushrooms out of control, our government grows and our military is weakened." Decrying a "stagnant" economy, Perot writes: "Economic growth is insufficient to create enough jobs for a country whose population is growing. The result is unemployment stuck over 8 percent for every single month of Barack Obama's presidency. (Oval note: the jobless rate dipped to 7.8% last month.) We have 23 million Americans who are looking for work and either can't find a full-time job, can't find a job at all, or who have given up looking. That is wrong. It's not the way America ought to be. Obama should follow Pandit's lead and just resign.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1350393893045</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 09:24:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350394462903-13</Id><Title>Regean a gop hero who signed the free bushcare for illegals bill passed by a gop senate</Title><Msg>Ronnie Raygun and a gop senate passed and signed a bill requiring free bushcare, even for illegals and the POOR !!!!

King: Al Qaeda a greater threat now than before 9/11 U.S. Rep. Peter T. King, New York Republican and Chairman of the House's Homeland Security Committee, said Tuesday that al Qaeda is a greater threat now than it was before the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. "That is the consensus of most intelligence experts," he said on CNN's "Starting Point." "What they've done is they are now more under the radar screen, they're more spread out, and they're harder to define. It was great killing … [Osama] bin Laden, I give President Obama credit for that, for bin Laden being killed, but having said that, he was one element, because al Qaeda [had] shifted. And it [had] shifted its emphasis from being a centralized force to being a diversified, diverse force, which is harder to track down. They're under the radar screen in many cases. "They're a greater threat than they were back on September 11, because of the fact that they are much more spread out, the fact that there is active recruiting going on, people under the radar screen, and if you talk to intelligence experts, most will agree with that," Mr. King continued. "That on September 11 and the immediate years afterwards we knew who they were, we know we had a generalized idea of how to get them, and we were getting them one by one. And the culmination was when President Obama got bin Laden in May of 2011 … but the fact is, it has now spread out into many different groups, and that is why it is considered by most intelligence experts to be more dangerous now than it was then, and that's the story the president is not telling." Mr. King said that the Obama administration's evolving story over the recent events in Libya has unfolded because immediately labeling the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi an act of terrorism would undercut the administration's message that al Qaeda, a terrorist group, has been decimated. While traveling in Peru, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said she is taking "full responsibility" for the lack of security at the consulate before the attack on the anniversary of 9/11 that led to the death of four Americans, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1350395740280</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 09:55:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350395819963-18</Id><Topic><Title>Hillary!!

(AONE), a maker of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries for electric cars, filed for bankruptcy after failing to make a debt payment that was due yesterday. The company listed assets of $459.8 million and debt of $376 million as of Aug. 31 in Chapter 11 documents filed today in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Delaware. Chapter 11 is the section of the Bankruptcy Code used by companies to reorganize. A123 didn’t expect to be on time with an interest payment due yesterday on $143.8 million of notes expiring in 2016, or to make a payment due yesterday on $2.76 million in outstanding 6 percent notes, the Waltham, Massachusetts-based company said yesterday in a regulatory filing. “The company may not have sufficient cash to fund operations and may need to seek the protections provided under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code,” A123 said. A123, which received a $249.1 million federal grant in 2009 to build a U.S. factory, needed a financial lifeline after struggling with costs from a recall of batteries supplied to Fisker Automotive Inc., the plug-in hybrid luxury carmaker. A123 announced in August that it was working on a deal with Wanxiang Group Corp., China’s largest auto-parts maker, for financing in exchange for a majority ownership stake. Chinese Investment Wanxiang plans to invest as much as $465 million in A123, giving the Hangzhou, China-based company a stake of as much as 80 percent, A123 said in an Aug. 16 statement. In yesterday’s filing, A123 said it was considering strategic alternatives including “one or more potential transactions” to address its liquidity problems. There is “no assurance” that A123 will be able to find a way to continue to operate its business as a going concern, the company said. The bankruptcy filing may fuel further political debate over government financing of alternative-energy and transportation businesses. Federal grants and loans to companies including A123, Fisker and Tesla Motors Inc. have drawn scrutiny from congressional Republicans following the September 2011 bankruptcy filing of solar-panel maker Solyndra LLC two years after it received a $535 million loan guarantee from the U.S. Energy Department. Obama's Call President Barack Obama called A123 Chief Executive Officer David Vieau and then-Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm during a September 2010 event celebrating the opening of the plant in Livonia, Michigan, that the company received the U.S. grant to help build. “This is about the birth of an entire new industry in America -- an industry that’s going to be central to the next generation of cars,” Obama said in the phone call, according to a transcript provided by the White House. “When folks lift up their hoods on the cars of the future, I want them to see engines and batteries that are stamped: Made in America.”</Msg><Username>liberals_plague_humanity</Username><Timestamp>1350395819963</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 09:56:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350395820275-19</Id><Topic><Title>Hillary!!

You could only VOTE in America if you CONTRIBUTED to America. Just like you can only vote on Oracle issues if you own Oracle stock. The left argues that many of the 47% that don't pay income taxes also pay "payroll" (FICA) taxes. We have to remember that FICA is an "insurance" premium, not a tax... and that the social security system that it pays for has not only been made progressive over the years... but that 60% of the FICA taxes that support it are paid by EMPLOYERS, NOT EMPLOYEES (it was 50% before the recent stimulus that reduced FICA taxes for employees, but, of course, NOT employers). Maybe we should let all of America's "illegal" immigrants vote too... maybe THAT will result in reigning in these massive deficits and endless growth of entitlements.</Msg><Username>bjspokanimal</Username><Timestamp>1350404263939</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 12:17:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350404979566-30</Id><Topic><Title>CNN Got SMACKed Down</Title><Username>passthebuckaroo</Username><Timestamp>1350404030129</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 12:13:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There are no better Bubblehead Bimbos pumping Obama than on MSNBC and CNN... and she's right near the top!</Msg><Username>ivleeg_garbage</Username><Timestamp>1350404979566</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 12:29:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350406199060-31</Id><Title>VALE 2nd largest Mining Company in the world is FLYING!!!!! $18.92 +0.55 (+2.99%)</Title><Msg>VALE 2nd largest Mining Company in the world is FLYING!!!!! $18.92 +0.55 (+2.99%)</Msg><Username>fishstar749</Username><Timestamp>1350406199060</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 12:49:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350406446449-32</Id><Topic><Title>CNN Got SMACKed Down</Title><Username>passthebuckaroo</Username><Timestamp>1350404030129</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 12:13:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Rice Pins Faulty Libya Story on Intel Reuters/AP US Ambassador to the UN Susan Rice blames talking points from intelligence community as source of controversial account of Libya attacks, as lawmakers continue to press White House for a clearer explanation.</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1350406446449</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 12:54:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350407174928-33</Id><Title>The election is all about women... and Obama makes Hillary the fall woman!</Title><Msg>No wonder Obama has lost a double digit lead among women</Msg><Username>central_scrutinizer_fz</Username><Timestamp>1350407174928</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 13:06:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350407688436-34</Id><Topic><Title>Romney &amp; RyaN: volunteer YOU for Bushghanistan forever</Title><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1350393185638</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 09:13:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>KISS bassist Gene Simmons sounds pretty fed up with President Barack Obama. “The country is so divided.

They’re the ones who weigh all of the threats and the risks and the needs and make a considered decision.” The attacks on the Benghazi mission, and the Obama administration’s response, have become a contentious election issue. Clinton’s comments came a day before the second debate between President Obama and Mitt Romney.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1350413339536</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 14:48:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350417037938-70</Id><Topic><Title>Who was responsible for W's $3.1 trillion budget request for fy 2009?</Title><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1350409221269</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 13:40:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>W did a whopping $3.1 trillion budget request for fy 2009..... holy cow.... his tax cuts sure got rid of the surplus!</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1350417037938</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 15:50:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350417209932-71</Id><Topic><Title>ORCL, is Today the Day?</Title><Username>estrada_sandoval</Username><Timestamp>1350412894915</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 14:41:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I just read the info on the site.

October 16, 2012 | 3:56 pm 3Comments Paul Bedard Washington Secrets The Washington Examiner A second Democratic campaign has been caught mistaking a foreign ship for a U.S. Navy vessel in images meant to brag on the candidate's devotion to the military. A month after the Democratic National Convention featured Cold War-era Soviet ships on a giant screen as a former Navy admiral representing the Obama campaign praised American veterans, the Democrat running for Senate in Connecticut featured a foreign sub in a television ad promoting his efforts to create jobs at the state's sub-maker, General Dynamics' Electric Boat of Groton. Instead of Groton-made subs, the ad for Rep. Chris Murphy featured a Norwegian submarine. The ad maker apparently took the picture off an image website without checking what the featured sub was. The pictures were shown as the ad announcer said, "Chris Murphy has a jobs plan, but he also has a jobs record. The Connecticut jobs Chris Murphy's helped create are building a new industrial park in Waterbury, launch new subs in Groton." Republican challenger Linda McMahon was quick to jump on the mistake, putting up their own ad that calls Murphy a jokester. "Murphy brags about helping Electric Boat in Groton. Uhhhhhhhh, Chris, that submarine in your commercial, it's from Norway, not Groton. Chris Murphy is a funny guy." Republican campaign officials said that the race has tightened since Mitt Romney's winning performance in his first debate with President Obama.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1350419826142</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 16:37:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350419871351-87</Id><Title>gop to form an all male panel to decide how women should dress</Title><Msg>this comes from god who apparently demands that women cover their heads and always obey the man and also the earth is 9,000 years old and btw Noah easily put the dinosaurs on the ark.</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1350419871351</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 16:37:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350420011914-88</Id><Topic><Title>Who was responsible for W's $3.1 trillion budget request for fy 2009?</Title><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1350409221269</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 13:40:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>W requested $3.1 trillion!!!!! and he turned a projected $6 trillion surplus into a $5trillion deficit, and Mitt is just a big lying rerun of bush complete with a tax plan based on lies.</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1350420011914</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 16:40:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350420114752-89</Id><Topic><Title>W &amp; gop sent troops to Iraq ill equipped and it cost them where was the ISSA investigation?</Title><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1350410336064</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 13:58:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>who was responsible? where was the ISSAass investigation?</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1350420114752</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 16:41:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350420379087-90</Id><Title>9000 yr earth is a fact says gop science committee</Title><Msg>Earth is 9,000 years old, says Rep.

Here's a chart from the minority side of the Senate Budget Committee, outlining the program's enormous growth: As the chart shows, when President Obama took office, enrollment in the food stamps program was 31.98 million. Now, not even four years later, it's a whopping 46.48 million. (In 2002, as the chart states, "19.1 million Americans received food stamps.") In fact, the newly released data represents enrollment in July (the last month for which data is available). Assuming the program remained on its projected path, the number of those enrolled in food stamps is likely now larger by several hundreds of thousands. "USDA has engaged in an aggressive outreach and promotional campaign to boost food stamp enrollment. Among these efforts are an ongoing partnership with the Mexican government to advertise food stamps to Mexican nationals, migrant workers, and non-citizen immigrants. Partly as a result of these efforts, the number of non-citizens on food stamps has quadrupled since 2001," explains the Republican side of the Senate Budget Committee. And the cost, the committee explains, is astronomical. "Total spending on food stamps is projected to reach nearly $800 billion over the next 10 years, with no fewer than 1 in 9 people on the program at any given time. Neither food stamp participation nor spending on the program are ever projected to return to pre-recession levels at any point in the next 10 years."</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1350429200450</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 19:13:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350429758107-106</Id><Title>Romney Gets All The Gotcha Questions, Obama The Softballs!</Title><Msg>Bet on it!

A study made of isotopes gathered in the growth layer of 4,500 year old Bristle Cone Pines in California's White Mountains. The study proves that the sun is directly responsible for hot and cold and wet and dry spells. All out of proportion to anything experienced recently.
