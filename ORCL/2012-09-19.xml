During the much-anticipated interview, Barack Obama responded, "We're gonna keep it that way" (video follows with transcript and commentary). After telling the President he looked great, Letterman began his interview with the most powerful man on the planet with a real hardball question: “How much do you weigh?” Obama responded, “About 180.” “180 looks good on you,” replied Letterman. “That’s just about where I am, and I don’t look so good at 180.” “You know, you look sharp,” objected the President. “You haven’t seen me naked,” disagreed Letterman. “We’re gonna keep it that way,” replied the President. After some laughter, the pair fist-bumped with Letterman saying, “That’s fair enough. Alright, I like that. We'll keep it that way.” And that’s how Letterman’s interview with the President began.

"We have provided information about what we believe was the precipitating cause of the protest and violence based on the information that we have had available," White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Tuesday. "The FBI is investigating, and that investigation will follow the facts wherever they lead." Carney continued to claim that "we do not have any indication at this point of premeditation or pre-planned attacks," but went on to say: "we're not making declarations ahead of the facts here." Perhaps significantly, Carney did not go so far as U.S. Ambassador Susan Rice in detailing what the administration thinks happened. In doing so, Carney appeared to acknowledge that the investigation could offer a different version of events. Rice said on "Fox News Sunday" -- one of several Sunday show interviews she granted -- that the administration believes the attack was not "preplanned" or "premeditated." Instead, Rice said, it was a "spontaneous" reaction to protests in Egypt over an anti-Islam film, and extremist elements "joined the fray" before it "spun out of control." However, that account clashed with claims by the Libyan president that the attack was in fact premeditated. Other sources, including an intelligence source in Libya who spoke to Fox News, have echoed those claims. The intelligence source even said that, contrary to the suggestion by the Obama administration, there was no major protest in Benghazi before the deadly attack which killed four Americans. A U.S. official did not dispute the claim. In the face of these conflicting accounts, Carney on Tuesday deferred to the ongoing investigation. "It is an absolute tragedy that we lost four Americans in Benghazi," he said. "There is an active investigation under way about what happened and why and what the motivations were." Some have questioned how an attack that involved RPG's and mortar fire could have possibly been spontaneous. Carney, though, suggested those weapons are readily available in post-revolution Libya. "There are vast numbers of weapons and certainly a number of violent groups in the country," Carney said. "It is still a very volatile place, there's no question about it." He said the ongoing investigation will examine "what role the video played" in the attack, among other things.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1348054963795</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 07:42:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348055023308-5</Id><Topic><Title>gop hates minimum wages but whine that those living on them pay no income tax</Title><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1347993076127</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 14:31:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Selective Edit? Mother Jones Admits Romney Tape Missing 'One to Two Minutes' 395 5 283 Email Article Print Article Send a Tip by Joel B. Pollak 19 Sep 2012, 12:04 AM PDT 53 post a comment Mother Jones, the left-wing magazine that released a controversial video of Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney's remarks to a fundraiser in May, now admits that it has no full tape of what Romney said, and that its video is missing "one to two minutes" at the most important moment. The Legal Insurrection blog's William Jacobson and The Blaze both raised questions on Tuesday about whether Mother Jones had, as promised, revealed the full video, given an apparent jump cut in the critical section of Romney's remarks. "Something is missing. Romney’s 47% answer was cut off before completed, and is not picked up on the Part 2 audio video," Jacobson noted. Late Tuesday evening, Jacobson obtained the following comment from David Corn of Mother Jones: According to the source, the recording device inadvertently turned off. The source noticed this quickly and turned it back one [sic]. The source estimates that one to two minutes, maybe less, of recording was missed. Corn was forced to update his original post, which promised the "full" video, to reflect the fact that a key portion of the video is, in fact, missing. There is no way to know, without the missing footage, exactly what Romney said. On Monday evening, Romney called for a complete video of his remarks to be released. That now turns out to be impossible, either because Romney's remarks were never recorded in full (as Mother Jones now claims), or because some of his remarks--perhaps mitigating some of the controversial effect of his statements--were selectively edited out of the tape by Mother Jones or its chain of sources (including former President Jimmy Carter's grandson). Earlier on Tuesday, new media pioneer James O'Keefe pointed out the hypocrisy of the mainstream media in accepting, without question, a snippet of a video recording that aimed to portray a Republican in a bad light, while conservatives are still doubted even after providing full video or audio, as O'Keefe did with his famous ACORN tapes. Whether Romney is right or wrong about the "47 percent" of Americans he says have become dependent on government--he stood by his May remarks on Monday evening--he may have been taken out of context. Mother Jones has failed a basic test and broken its promise to its readers and the public. There is now reason to doubt that it provided Romney's full remarks--not just the context, but the remarks themselves. And there is new reason to suspect manipulation. Corn promised the complete version of Romney's remarks. Instead, he provided a version that is missing a large portion of video at the critical moment. Mother Jones's entire story now deserves to be treated with suspicion, if not contempt.</Msg><Username>onedinosaur</Username><Timestamp>1348055023308</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 07:43:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348055659554-6</Id><Topic><Title>60-billion per yr = the entire food stamp program; 40-billion per month to welfare banks and speculators with Q=3 unlimited!</Title><Username>peterthegreat533</Username><Timestamp>1347991781463</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 14:09:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Asked if he was referring to the 47 percent of Americans who don’t pay income tax — including many retirees and veterans — as moochers, Romney responded: “No, I’m talking about a perspective of individuals who I’m not likely to get to support me. Those that are dependent upon government and those who think the government’s job is to redistribute — I’m not going to get them.” Romney’s TV appearance had a more focused pushback at President Obama than did his hastily called news conference Monday night, where he granted that his own comments in the video from a May fund-raiser were “not elegantly stated,” but also didn’t back down. Romney’s reference to “redistribution” of wealth came after a 1998 audio tape of Obama speaking at a college conference surfaced on YouTube yesterday, in which he said, “I actually believe in redistribution.” The video of Romney was surreptitiously taken at a $50,000-a- plate fund-raiser hosted by private equity honcho Marc Leder at his home in Boca Raton, Fla.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1348055659554</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 07:54:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348056113634-7</Id><Topic><Title>60-billion per yr = the entire food stamp program; 40-billion per month to welfare banks and speculators with Q=3 unlimited!</Title><Username>peterthegreat533</Username><Timestamp>1347991781463</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 14:09:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Romney only said what Obama always says: That Democrats are victims Why are people pillorying the Republican nominee for characterizing the President's voters as the President himself does? Comments (15) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Wednesday, September 19, 2012, 5:00 AM It makes perfect sense, really. I get why President Obama’s campaign spokespeople say they are “shocked” by Mitt Romney’s assertion that 47% of the electorate see themselves as victims, want handouts and think they are entitled to government money. I understand why liberals find the comments, made at a secretly filmed, closed-door meeting with big-money donors, offensive. And it’s very clear why the media is seizing on Romney’s words as . . . cue scary music. . . the “end of his campaign.” But the truth is, Romney stole an Obama tactic — labeling Democratic voters victims — right out from under him. But the substance of what he was trying to get across — which has his detractors more offended than his math or his “inelegance” — is, in my mind, the least controversial aspect of this brouhaha. Look a little deeper and you’ll discover that Romney has ripped a page right out of Obama’s playbook. At a million-dollar fund-raiser in San Francisco Obama held in 2011, he told donors what he’s told voters in some way or another on the stump for a year: that unless he is reelected, “we’re going to have a government that tells the American people, ‘you are on your own.’ If you get sick, you’re on your own. If you can’t afford college, you’re on your own. If you don’t like that some corporation is polluting your air or the air that your child breathes, then you’re on your own.” If Obama’s not calling his voters victims, I think the word needs a new definition. In fact, in the name of supporting Obama, Democrats and liberals haven’t just admitted, but have insisted that their voter base — minorities, illegal immigrants, gays, the elderly, women — are victims of the Republican Party. From Sandra Fluke to Barney Frank to David Axelrod, the modus operandi of the left this election year has been to scream at the top of their lungs that these various special interest groups need Democrats and the government to take care of them. Suddenly Romney accepts Obama’s characterization of his own base and he is the indelicate one? Obama’s message for a year has been one of two Americas — one where he and the government will take care of you, and one where Republicans and Mitt Romney will leave you to die, or at least suffer in squalor. It’s us vs. them, dependency vs. self-reliance. And frankly, the feigned outrage over Romney’s closed-door remarks seems a little disingenuous considering Obama’s own brush with off-the-cuff comments. Whether it was inadvertently admitting his entire economic philosophy in one soundbite — “I do think at a certain point you’ve made enough money” — or throwing Cambridge police under the bus for “acting stupidly,” Obama’s not always been an artful orator. And, of course, we all remember the flap heard ’round the world. In 2008, then-Sen. Obama made devastating comments about folks in Pennsylvania, also at a closed-door fund-raiser for wealthy donors, maligning “bitter” small-town voters for clinging to “guns or religion” and fostering “antipathy toward people who aren’t like them or anti-immigrant sentiment.” In basically calling white working class Americans racist, xenophobic, fanatical hicks, he drew on the worst and laziest stereotypes about middle America. But, of course, Romney won’t have eight months to atone for his sins like Obama did. He will have to get out on the stump and defend his statements for acknowledging the very sales pitch Democrats have been delivering for four years — that under Obama you’ll be taken care of and under Romney you’ll be on your own. Just imagine if a Republican had said that.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1348056113634</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 08:01:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348056748877-8</Id><Title>Barack Obama...

I do not believe any of this is new information. Suddenly, however, the press is very interested in my theories as to the inherent laziness of the poor.

Alpha Natural Resources announced Tuesday its plan to cut the positions and scale back coal production by 16 million tons annually -- which would result in eight mine closings in Virginia, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Four-hundred workers will be laid off immediately, though the company reportedly may try to re-hire some of the 1,200. Kevin Crutchfield, the company’s chief executive officer, said the lay-offs and the closings of the non-union mines are the result a difficult market in which power plants are switching to abundant, less-expensive natural gas and "a regulatory environment that's aggressively aimed at constraining the use of coal." However, elected officials and business groups have been less oblique in their analysis, saying Alpha employees are victims of President Obama’s so-called "War on Coal." The Mitt Romney campaign is among the most recent to put the blame squarely on the president, releasing a TV ad Wednesday that reminds voters about what Obama said in 2008. “If somebody wants to build a coal-powered plant, they can, it's just that it will bankrupt them,” the president said, in a quote interpreted by critics as a campaign promise that coal would have no future in an Obama White House. West Virginia Republican Rep. Shelley Moore Capito acknowledged this week that several factors, including the declining price of natural gas, have led to recent mine closures. But she said the Environmental Protection Agency’s “extreme rules and regulations played a major role.” “The president’s extreme policies are crippling entire towns and making it harder for workers to find jobs,” Capito, co-founder of the Congressional Coal Caucus, said in a written statement. "Because of the president's War on Coal, thousands of West Virginia families have to worry about where their next paycheck is going to come from." She has added language to a bill which the Republican-controlled House is expected to vote on this week that would force the EPA to consider the impact on jobs and the economy when issuing new rules and regulations</Msg><Username>liberals_plague_humanity</Username><Timestamp>1348083541564</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 15:39:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348083582887-45</Id><Topic><Title>Barack Obama...

The notices went out to mechanics and ground workers whose jobs will be affected as American goes through a bankruptcy restructuring. American Airlines spokesman Bruce Hicks said Tuesday that fewer than 40 percent of those getting notices will lose their jobs. Hicks said federal law requires the company to notify anyone whose position could change, including those who could get "bumped" by more-senior employees whose jobs are eliminated or outsourced. American said in February that it planned to cut 14,000 jobs, including 13,000 held by union workers. But if Hicks is right, the final job losses will be about a third of that. Over the summer American accepted slightly smaller cost-cutting measures as it negotiated new labor contracts, and it agreed to give bonuses to flight attendants and ground workers who quit. So far 1,800 flight attendants and 800 ground workers have applied to take the money and leave. Layoff notices went to nearly 3,000 workers in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, where a maintenance facility will close, and nearly 3,000 more at a base in Tulsa, Okla. Also receiving notices were about 1,200 workers in Miami, 1,100 in New York and Newark, N.J., 900 in Chicago, and smaller numbers elsewhere.</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1348083582887</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 15:39:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348086701771-46</Id><Topic><Title>Barack Obama...

Most would be in the middle class. The new estimate amounts to an inconvenient fact for the administration, a reminder of what critics see as broken promises. The numbers from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office are 50 percent higher than a previous projection by the same office in 2010, shortly after the law passed. The earlier estimate found 4 million people would be affected in 2016, when the penalty is fully in effect. That's still only a sliver of the population, given that more than 150 million people currently are covered by employer plans. Nonetheless, in his first campaign for the White House, Obama pledged not to raise taxes on individuals making less than $200,000 a year and couples making less than $250,000. And the budget office analysis found that nearly 80 percent of those who'll face the penalty would be making up to or less than five times the federal poverty level. Currently that would work out to $55,850 or less for an individual and $115,250 or less for a family of four. Average penalty: about $1,200 in 2016. "The bad news and broken promises from Obamacare just keep piling up," said Rep. Dave Camp, R-Mich., chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, who wants to repeal the law. Starting in 2014, virtually every legal resident of the U.S. will be required to carry health insurance or face a tax penalty, with exemptions for financial hardship, religious objections and certain other circumstances. Most people will not have to worry about the requirement since they already have coverage through employers, government programs like Medicare or by buying their own policies. A spokeswoman for the Obama administration said 98 percent of Americans will not be affected by the tax penalty — and suggested that those who will be should face up to their civic responsibilities. "This (analysis) doesn't change the basic fact that the individual responsibility policy will only affect people who can afford health care but choose not to buy it," said Erin Shields Britt of the Health and Human Services Department. "We're no longer going to subsidize the care of those who can afford to buy insurance but make a choice not to buy it." The budget office said most of the increase in its estimate is due to changes in underlying projections about the economy, incorporating the effects of new federal legislation, as well as higher unemployment and lower wages. The Supreme Court upheld Obama's law as constitutional in a 5-4 decision this summer, finding that the insurance mandate and the tax penalty enforcing it fall within the power of Congress to impose taxes. The penalty will be collected by the IRS, just like taxes. The budget office said the penalty will raise $6.9 billion in 2016. The new law will also provide government aid to help middle-class and low-income households afford coverage, the financial carrot that balances out the penalty. Nonetheless, some people might still decide to remain uninsured because they object to government mandates or because they feel they would come out ahead financially even if they have to pay the penalty. Health insurance is expensive, with employer-provided family coverage averaging nearly $15,800 a year for a family and $4,300 for a single plan. Indeed, insurance industry experts say the federal penalty may be too low. The Supreme Court also allowed individual states to opt out of a major Medicaid expansion under the law. The Obama administration says it will exempt low-income people in states that opt out from having to comply with the insurance requirement. Many Republicans still regard the insurance mandate as unconstitutional and rue the day the Supreme Court upheld it. However, the idea for an individual insurance requirement comes from Republican health care plans in the 1990s. It's also a central element of the 2006 Massachusetts health care law signed by then-GOP Gov. Mitt Romney, now running against Obama and promising to repeal the federal law. Romney spokeswoman Andrea Saul said Wednesday the new report is more evidence that Obama's law is a "costly disaster." "Even more of the middle-class families who President Obama promised would see no tax increase will in fact see a massive tax increase thanks to Obamacare," she said. Romney says insurance mandates should be up to each state. The approach seems to have worked well in Massachusetts, with virtually all residents covered and dwindling numbers opting to pay the penalty instead.</Msg><Username>onedinosaur</Username><Timestamp>1348100735366</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 20:25:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348100781389-64</Id><Topic><Title>Barack Obama...

The bill, labeled the Buffett Rule Act, passed by voice vote, meaning Democrats and Republicans agreed with it. Under the legislation, which would still need Senate approval, taxpayers could check a box on their taxes and send in a check for more than they owe to the IRS. "If Warren Buffett and others like him truly feel they're not paying enough in taxes, they can use the Buffett Rule Act to put their money where their mouth is and voluntarily send in more to pay down the national debt, rather than changing the entire tax code to inflict more job-killing tax hikes on hard-working Americans," said Rep. Steve Scalise, the Louisiana Republican who wrote the bill. President Obama and Democrats had proposed a Buffett Rule tax, based on billionaire investor Warren Buffett's statement that he shouldn't pay a lower rate on his income than his secretary. Investments are taxed at a lower rate than salary or wage income under the theory that they are spurring economic growth, so wealthy investors usually pay less as a percentage, though they end up paying far more in real dollar terms. Democrats said there should be a minimum tax for the wealthy, which would mean investors would pay more. They proposed a 30 percent tax on those with incomes higher than $1 million a year. Republicans, though, objected to rewriting the tax code on Mr. Buffett's say-so, and said he is free to pay more if he wants. Current law already allows taxpayers to send money to pay down the debt, but Republicans said that process is onerous. Under their new plan, taxpayers would have an easy option on their tax returns allowing them to pay more. Under Republicans' legislation, the money would go directly toward reducing the debt. Democrats didn't object to the bill, but said it did a disservice to the real Buffett Rule tax. "There's nothing wrong with this bill except the label," said Rep. Sander Levin, Michigan Democrat.</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1348100781389</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 20:26:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348101463903-65</Id><Topic><Title>dropkick ... where are you?
