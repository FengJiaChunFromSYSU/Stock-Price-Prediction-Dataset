"Observations show increases in globally averaged air and ocean temperatures, as well as widespread melting of snow and ice and rising globally averaged sea level." The dominant cause of the warming since the 1950s is human activities, they said, adding that their scientific finding is based on "a large and persuasive body of research." "Due to natural variability," the statement noted, "not every year is warmer than the preceding year globally. Nevertheless, all of the 10 warmest years in the global temperature records up to 2011 have occurred since 1997, with 2005 and 2010 being the warmest two years in more than a century of global records."</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1346244460841</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 08:47:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346248015264-7</Id><Topic><Title>Obama: High Un-employment, No Growth, Massive Deficits</Title><Username>bjspokanimal</Username><Timestamp>1346176571243</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 13:56:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>MSNBC abandons GOP convention during every speech by a minority Published: 11:18 PM 08/28/2012 By Jeff Poor BEVERLY HILLS, CA - AUGUST 02: (L-R) President of MSNBC Phil Griffin, host of 'The Rachel Maddow Show' Rachel Maddow, host of 'The Last Word' Lawrence O' Donnell and host of 'Hardball' Chris Matthews speak during the 'MSNBC' panel during the NBC Universal portion of the 2011 Summer TCA Tour held at the Beverly Hilton Hotel on August 2, 2011 in Beverly Hills, California. (Photo by Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images) One of the left’s favorite attacks on the Republican Party is that it is the party of old white people, devoid of diversity and probably racist. If you were watching MSNBC’s coverage of the Republican National Convention in Tampa on Tuesday night, you might believe those assertions, since missing from the coverage was nearly every ethnic minority that spoke during Tuesday’s festivities. In lieu of airing speeches from former Democratic Rep. Artur Davis, a black American; Mia Love, a black candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives from Utah; and Texas senatorial hopeful Ted Cruz, a Latino American, MSNBC opted to show commentary anchored by Rachel Maddow from Rev. Al Sharpton, Ed Schultz, Chris Matthews, Chris Hayes and Steve Schmidt. Throughout this convention, Matthews has accused the Republicans of playing dog-whistle racist politics while on scene in Tampa. It isn’t clear, however, if Matthews will hurl accusations of racism at Davis, Love or Cruz for speeches his network failed to broadcast.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1346248015264</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 09:46:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346250098521-8</Id><Topic><Title>Obama: High Un-employment, No Growth, Massive Deficits</Title><Username>bjspokanimal</Username><Timestamp>1346176571243</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 13:56:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's what 's called window-dressing</Msg><Username>egik_egak_egoogimak</Username><Timestamp>1346250098521</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 10:21:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346251406000-9</Id><Topic><Title>Buy Buy Buy</Title><Username>latonia_nadine23</Username><Timestamp>1346245521000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 09:05:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Cool picks.</Msg><Username>mark_janelle22</Username><Timestamp>1346251406000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 10:43:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346253647000-10</Id><Topic><Title>The GM Volt!

Most shockingly, Yahoo! Washington Bureau Chief David Chalian got caught on an ABC webcast saying that Mitt Romney would be “happy to have a party when black people drown.” ***UPDATE: ABC News reached out to Breitbart News to name the man heard mocking the Romneys during this ABC News livecast: David Chalian (pictured) of Yahoo! News. Chalian is a former political director with ABC News, but according to ABC News has no association with the network now. The headline has been changed to reflect this update, as has the story itself. Here's a look at the black, bitter, bitter, ugly and biased souls of our corrupt media during ABC News' live-feed coverage yesterday. The moment in question occurs in the first ten seconds. Listen closely to the video embedded below this post. This is who the media is. This is what Romney and all Republicans are up against. In what atmosphere does a so-called reporter feel comfortable firing off this kind of vicious joke? Well, the answer is easy: In an atmosphere where you're surrounded in a bubble by elite, ignorant, hate-mongering, ideologically-bigoted leftists just like yourself. The media cannot be reasoned with nor can a peace be brokered. We must defeat these people because that's what they intend to do to us. When you believe our nominee is happy to party while black people drown, you can only believe that we possess no humanity. You can't reason with people who hate you. You just can't. ADDED: This is a sample of the media's awful, racialist behavior towards Mitt Romney. Believe me, there's plenty more. Here's our rundown of yesterday's media coverage of the convention; it's a tale of bias and race-baiting. Here's the story of how NBC News's Chief White House Correspondent, Chuck Todd, race-baited while live on the air yesterday. Incredible stuff.

If a person making the median wage saved an amount equal to his total yearly Social Security payments, $3,380, after 40 years at 3% interest he would have $260,000 at retirement age. If he then started withdrawing money in equal payments spread over his remaining lifetime, say 30 years, he could withdraw about $1,000 a month the same as his Social Security benefit would be if started at 62. But at the end of that 30 years his savings would reach zero, as annuities do. Say that you can make more that 3% interest? In terms of historic performance of the DJIA, that's possible. But you have to consider this, stocks advance unevenly. From 1930 to 2010, all the advance in the DJIA happened in two bull markets which together spanned thirty years. For the other fifty years, the DJIA didn't move much or retraced. If history is predictive, you can expect to make nothing for twenty to thirty years, get discouraged and quit contributing and miss the next bull market. That is the nature of private investments. The DJIA hasn't netted a gain for the last ten years in what is arguably been the best financial environment possible for it to do so. Ryan attempts to assure voters by promising that their privatized contributions will be guaranteed against loss by the government. This from a member of a party that promises never to raise the income taxes that would cover that guarantee. It' an empty promise bordering on fraud."</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1346274101617</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 17:01:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346274979551-49</Id><Topic><Title>Ryan math and Ryan lies</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1346274101617</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 17:01:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Fraud is a ponzi scheme foisted on the American people when it was started.
