I believe it is Americans literally reaching for the stars. Reaching for the highest aspirations of the human race. I also believe that one way we can keep our planet cleaner and "a garden" is get all the heavy industry off it. We can find lots of ores, metals and minerals in the asteroid belt. We can maybe find hydrocarbons (oil?) in the gaseous planets if we can find a way to draw on them. We will have lots of room to expand if we get to space. Also: Our planet has been prone to GREAT catastrophes in the past (that comet killing off the dinosaurs was just ONE of seven or nine!) One way to protect our species from extinction is to get our species off this planet and into space. Lots of growth for our species right here in our solar system, Oort cloud and Kuiper belt. And yes, Sally Ride WAS a great hero. Anybody daring enough to ride in a space craft is a hero! Do you remember John Glen's comment on that? He was asked if he was ever afraid while riding the Mercury ship to be first American into space. He replied; "Of course I was terrified! I was riding on top of a giant roman candle build by the cheapest bidder on a government project!" If I recall, Sally Ride actually rode on the Challenger shuttle a few times before it exploded, killing the crew.</Msg><Username>balongnieponey</Username><Timestamp>1343192838000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 01:07:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343192994000-7</Id><Topic><Title>I didn't know Sally Ride supported Obama</Title><Username>dropkickuuuuuuu</Username><Timestamp>1343191578000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 00:46:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Goodbye, Sally Ride!

In 2007 they were saying he bush tax cuts had put us on an unsustainable path, and getting rid of them would fix that. The recession beginning 2007 only shifted their time table forward a number of years. sure, you are smarter than everyone, but it's funny you whine so much. Unlike you I bought and own a house (at a good price), so when your end of civilization occurs you will have to spend your gold coins on rent and i won't have to pay a thing. and do keep on crying about the problems that have existed for ages, maybe that will help with inflation, recession,depression,panic and bubbles and wars and taxes. in fact, why work at all, after all, the money you earn today might not be worth the same tomorrow, so maybe you should just stay in bed? no doubt you would have told George Washington the situation at valley forge was hopeless, no way to win, costs to much and way too cold and best to go home.

All told, these Republican tax increases would hit more than 25 million poor, working, and middle class families. "Republicans Will Raise Taxes — Just Not on the Wealthy Republicans are holding middle class tax cuts hostage in order to give the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans yet another extra tax cut. If that wasn’t bad enough, the Republicans are now affirmatively proposing to raise taxes on tens of millions of poor and middle class Americans — even as they slash them on the wealthy. Here’s the rundown. If you want to know how Republicans really feel about the middle class, you need look no further than a doozy of a floor speech that Sen. Jon Kyl (AZ) — a member of the Senate Republican leadership — gave yesterday. Kyl attacked President Obama for “incessantly” talking about the middle class. And it’s not just their rhetoric that shows disdain for the middle class, it’s their actual proposals. TAX CUTS REPUBLICANS ARE HOLDING HOSTAGE: Tax cuts for 98 percent of Americans. (The wealthiest two percent would also still get a tax cut on their first $250,000 of income.) TAX CUTS REPUBLICANS ARE INSISTING ON: An extra tax cut for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans, including millionaires and billionaires. TAX INCREASES REPUBLICANS WANT: Limiting eligibility for the child tax credit, which constitutes a tax increase on 12 MILLION families. This works out to an average tax increase of $800 per family. In the case of a family made up of one person earning minimum wage and two children, the tax increase would be much larger according to one estimate: $1545. Curtailing tax credits for higher education expenses from $2500 a year to $1800 and reducing the years of eligibility from four years to two. This translates into an average tax increase of $1100 for 11 MILLION families. Cutting back on the earned income tax credit for families with three or more children and worsening the so-called “marriage penalty” on working poor couples, which translates into an average tax increase of $500 for 6 MILLION families. All told, these Republican tax increases would hit more than 25 million poor, working, and middle class families. Worse yet, Republicans aren’t even being honest about their plans to raise taxes on millions of Americans. Here’s what Sen. Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) claimed earlier today: “Republicans will head into tomorrow’s vote guided by a simple principle: do no harm. In our view, the best approach to taxes right now is to let every American and every American business know they won’t have a higher income tax bill at the end of the year. We think everybody in America should have that certainty.” Unfortunately, the only people Republicans are really interested in letting know that they won’t see a tax increase are the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans. Republicans claim to care about the middle class, but they are holding middle class tax cuts hostage. And even as they promise more tax giveaways to the wealthy, Republicans want to raise taxes on 25 MILLION families — including some of the poorest Americans. Tomorrow, Senate Democrats will try and move forward with their plan to preserve middle class tax cuts while asking the wealthiest Americans to give up the extra tax cuts that they simply do not need and that we cannot afford.</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1343221219000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 09:00:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343223026000-23</Id><Topic><Title>Mitzi LIED!!!!!!</Title><Username>whycantphiligetawoman</Username><Timestamp>1343221636000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 09:07:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So, you still don't know anything.</Msg><Username>rojolacr</Username><Timestamp>1343223026000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 09:30:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343223183000-24</Id><Topic><Title>Mitzi LIED!!!!!!</Title><Username>whycantphiligetawoman</Username><Timestamp>1343221636000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 09:07:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>By the way did you do all this research when Obama ran for President, or maybe you could not see his records because he them sealed.

For him, getting to the moon was a publicity stunt to upstage the Russians. He never had a plan for what to do after the publicity stunt was over. Another problem was the space shuttle, which was a limited purpose vehicle from the beginning. And no one ever agreed on a plan for what space vehicle should follow. In part because there was never a vision of what program should follow. We should be planning to get off earth. Get a permanent, large, space station. Get to the moon. Get to Mars. Get to the asteroid belt. Start industry and colonization of space. Are you aware that all the little computerized gadgets you like to play with are in one way or another spin offs from the space program? It involved real, genuine research that sped up a number of industries and made American science &amp; technology dominant in the world. Thus it spun off lots of entrepreneurs, businesses and jobs that no one could have conceived of in the beginning.</Msg><Username>orsa_novus</Username><Timestamp>1343228581000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 11:03:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343228744000-66</Id><Topic><Title>yaaaaaaaa Sally Ride US HERO LESBIAN!</Title><Username>dropkickuuuuuuu</Username><Timestamp>1343167379000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 18:02:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I heard Sally Ride had nightmares over the long shaft of the space shuttle docking with the round orbit of the space station.</Msg><Username>staythirsty_myfriend</Username><Timestamp>1343228744000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 11:05:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343228905000-67</Id><Topic><Title>The importance of Social Security</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1343179062000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 21:17:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You are wrong.

By that measure, the debt is roughly a third less: $10.5 trillion, or nearly 70% the size of the economy. That is still high by historic standards.

That is where in some cases, major cocaine and marijuana dealers admitted to buying votes to steal elections, and the result is the corruption of American democracy. The government continues to mete out justice in the scandal, as two people convicted in April in a vote-buying case face sentencing this week, and another public official pleaded guilty Tuesday to conspiracy. "We believe that drug money did buy votes," Kerry B. Harvey, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Kentucky, said of a separate vote-buying case. He described a stunning vote-buying scheme that includes "very extensive, organized criminal activity, involving hundreds of thousands of dollars, and in many cases that involves drug money." Harvey has led a recent string of federal prosecutions exposing the widespread and accepted practice of vote buying in eastern Kentucky. The soft-spoken federal prosecutor, along with his team and state authorities, are waging a battle against what he characterizes as a vote-buying culture embedded in many of the communities for generations. He says the problem is rooted in economic woes, which is why votes are routinely for sale. In that part of the state, jobs are scarce and poverty is high. Controlling local government means controlling jobs. “These folks go out and hijack the local elections for their own purposes and then they use those jobs to enrich themselves and their confederates. It really is a terrible problem and it has to be stopped,” Harvey explains. In Clay County, according to court testimony, some of the funds to purchase votes came from massive cocaine and marijuana drug trafficking operations. "They did use drug money to buy votes, and drug dealers felt they would be protected," Harvey said. Prosecutors say more than $400,000, part of it drug proceeds, was pooled by Democratic politicians over several elections, and spent to buy the votes of more than 8,000 voters, usually at $50 apiece.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1343269731000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 22:28:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343269793000-119</Id><Topic><Title>I believe it is Americans literally reaching for the stars.</Title><Username>dropkickuuuuuuu</Username><Timestamp>1343194257000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 01:30:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Once again, dropkick proves what an ignorant dumbbutt he is.</Msg><Username>bullwinkle.themoose</Username><Timestamp>1343269793000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 22:29:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343272366000-120</Id><Topic><Title>USA debt is 70% of gdp</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1343265303000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 21:15:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Maybe 3 trillion or so is "owed" to SS , but is it due tommorrow or next year or the next or the next.... NO , it is not..... all total of debt the government owes it self is 30% of the total..... --------------------- Is all the debt due tomorrow or next year? No it is not. What's the difference? It is due at some date in the future like any other debt.</Msg><Username>nazyoyo</Username><Timestamp>1343272366000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 23:12:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343272778000-121</Id><Topic><Title>USA debt is 70% of gdp</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1343265303000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 21:15:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>as i said, 10% of the national debt is just accounting for the federal reserve, if it gets paid back it goes straight to the treasury, so scrach that off. and there are other items like that. ------------------------------------------------- No only interests would be returned to the treasury. The principal would go back to the fiery printer from whence it came. And the Fed may or may not decide to roll it over depending on inflationary conditions. Your assumption that the Feds can forever provide the gov will near zero interests by printing money is inconsistent with the Federal reserve mandate on inflation. If inflation started going up, and rates with it, the government would immediately be in serious trouble on their current debt. See Spain: they are not in trouble because they pay 7% for 10 yrs. rates have been at 7% before, and there was no problem. But they have enough debt and deficit that they can't finance 7%. i.e. They are insolvent for all practical purpose.</Msg><Username>nazyoyo</Username><Timestamp>1343272778000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 23:19:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343273705000-122</Id><Topic><Title>USA debt is 70% of gdp</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1343265303000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 21:15:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Naz, you are wasting your time debating with someone who is relying on a CBO report from July 2010. Back then we had a Democrat dominated Congress and President. Who failed to take any sensible action on this. The first Debt Limit crisis was not until 18 months later in Dec-2011. And the report is fully 24 months out of date now. Yet messybrians argues from it as though it were current.</Msg><Username>bullwinkle.themoose</Username><Timestamp>1343273705000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 23:35:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
