Scroll to the bottom and you can read that the dispatcher said "we don't need you to do that." I haven't followed every word of this trial but I bet Zimmerman did not testify that the dispatcher told him not to follow. Your sources are tainted. 911 dispatcher: Let me know if he does anything, OK? Zimmerman: OK. 911 dispatcher: We’ve got him on the wire. Just let me know if this guy does anything else. Zimmerman: OK. These #$%$. They always get away. When you come to the clubhouse, you come straight in and you go left. Actually, you would go past the clubhouse. [1:39] 911 dispatcher: OK, so it’s on the left hand side of the clubhouse? Zimmerman: Yeah. You go in straight through the entrance and then you would go left. You go straight in, don’t turn and make a left. He’s running. [2:08] 911 dispatcher: He’s running? Which way is he running? Zimmerman: Down toward the other entrance of the neighborhood. [2:14] 911 dispatcher: OK, which entrance is that he’s headed towards? Zimmerman: The back entrance. 911 dispatcher: Are you following him? [2:24] Zimmerman: Yeah. [2:25] 911 dispatcher: OK. We don’t need you to do that</Msg><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1373108115416</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-06 06:55:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373110244554-2</Id><Title>I'm not happy with the odds Zim will be convicted</Title><Msg>I could have prosicuted him better.

She said that Martin was scared because he was being followed by an unknown male and didn't know why.[9][215] Investigators said that Martin attempted to run home, but Zimmerman followed him, because he didn't want Martin whom he falsely assumed was going to commit a crime, to get away before the police arrived.[9][214] When the police dispatcher realized Zimmerman was pursuing Martin, he instructed Zimmerman not to do that and told him an officer would meet him.[30] Prosecutors stated that Zimmerman ignored the dispatcher's instruction and continued pursuing Martin on foot.[213] Investigators said Zimmerman then confronted Martin and a struggle ensued.[9][30]</Msg><Username>hydroponicoctopus</Username><Timestamp>1373116949162</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-06 09:22:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373117207575-19</Id><Topic><Title>there are no libertarian firefighters</Title><Username>hydroponicoctopus</Username><Timestamp>1373044784103</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-05 13:19:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Ayn Rand, the philosophical guru of the modern Republican Party, popularized this view of human nature.

"The company suing over the law is a chain of craft stores called the Hobby Lobby, owned by conservative Christians who oppose hormonal contraception. This is a for-profit business just like millions of others in America. Its owners aren't demanding their own rights to religious freedom; they're demanding the right to determine the healthcare their employees receive. Taking the Hobby Lobby's argument to its logical conclusion, what if you're a plumber whose company happens to be owned by Jehovah's Witnesses: should your boss have the right to determine that your health insurance won't cover any surgeries or procedures that involve blood transfusions? What if you're a lawyer and the head of your firm is a Scientologist: should he be able to exclude coverage of psychiatric medication and treatment? What if you're a restaurant employee and the owner is a Muslim fundamentalist who opposes polio vaccines: should he have the right to refuse vaccination coverage? What if you're an administrator for a company owned by Christian Scientists: should they have the right to entirely refuse to cover their employees' healthcare?......"
