I have a broker at Raymond James I went to college with, he says something is up with RENN because much of the trading is being hidden, they appear to be either making it look like it is coming from many different places or the buys really are. load and load again</Msg><Username>namfong43</Username><Timestamp>1349460145468</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 14:02:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349460501050-65</Id><Topic><Title>Did you see the write up on this (ORCL)</Title><Username>avisgef7901</Username><Timestamp>1349443720687</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 09:28:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Fantastic.

Two wars against al Queda stimulated the economy. Then, to burst the real estate bubble, Uncle Ben kept raising rates until he killed it. He burst the economy. (Oops!) Uncle Ben triggered a wave of defaults. He cleaned the frauds out of the system. Unfortunately, Obama spent 4 times as much as Bush in 1/2 the time, over-reached and over-regulated business and the bashed business so the recovery has been so anemic it's rolling over and causing a global recession. High taxes on the rich, big government, central planning -- it's the European Socialist model. By removing the profit motive, socialism works creates an environment of laziness and misery. Since the late 18th century, the bourgeoisie describes a social class "characterized by their ownership of capital, and their related culture"; hence, the personal terms bourgeois (masculine) and bourgeoise (feminine) culturally identify the man or woman who is a member of the wealthiest social class in capitalist societies. The bourgeois is the enemy of Marxists. Prolong the misery. 4 more years.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1349466038024</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 15:40:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349466217917-80</Id><Topic><Title>Did you see the write up on this (ORCL)</Title><Username>avisgef7901</Username><Timestamp>1349443720687</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 09:28:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks for sharing this article.</Msg><Username>tyesharefq24653</Username><Timestamp>1349466217917</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 15:43:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349466582804-81</Id><Topic><Title>W &amp; gop took a projected $6 trillion surplus and turned it into a $5 trillion deficit</Title><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1349283793263</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 13:03:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A day after the Obama campaign countered Mitt Romney's strong debate performance by accusing him of playing fast and loose with the facts, President Obama threw out a doozy of his own. At a rally Friday in Fairfax, Va., Obama claimed Romney had outright rejected his proposal to end tax breaks for oil and gas companies. "He said there's no way that he'd close the loophole that gives big oil companies billions each year in corporate warfare," Obama said, in the middle of a litany of complaints on Romney's tax positions from Wednesday's debate. Just one problem. Romney didn't say that. Rather, the Republican nominee said that if tax rates are lowered as his plan calls for, the $2.8 billion in breaks for oil companies should be on the table. Here's what Romney said: "But, you know, if we get that tax rate from 35 percent down to 25 percent, why that $2.8 billion is on the table. Of course it's on the table. That's probably not going to survive (if) you get that rate down to 25 percent." The president, though, has been trying to recover from Wednesday's debate by casting the Republican nominee as an ideological shape-shifter. He claimed Thursday that the Romney who showed up to debate him is not the same Romney who's been showing up on the campaign trail. Campaign adviser David Axelrod called Romney a "serial evader" and an "artful dodger" in a conference call Thursday. "What we learned is that he'll say anything that makes him effective in the short term but vulnerable in the long term," Axelrod said. However, Romney told Fox News in an interview Thursday that the president just "wasn't happy with the response to our debate." He reiterated he wants to bring tax rates down while reducing deductions. "What the president's been saying and the reality are pretty far apart," Romney said.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1349466582804</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 15:49:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349468927276-82</Id><Topic><Title>W &amp; gop took a projected $6 trillion surplus and turned it into a $5 trillion deficit</Title><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1349283793263</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 13:03:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>sure the flim flam man is going to lower taxes for all..... except the rich..... .. and of course the middledclass is overburdened... so they will pay less..... i guess...... so.....oh, i get it, the 47%, the poor will pay more and Romney will get rid of W's double of the child tax credit and then the poor can pay for , keeping taxes low for the rich, and increased military spending, and medicare as is for all 55 and above and even all younger if the "choose" it... and of course deficit reduction...... wow...... i know, you have to trust mitt and his enron future value accounting..... in the future there will be more jobs with higher pay..... how again?</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1349468927276</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 16:28:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349469602859-83</Id><Topic><Title>Did you see the write up on this (ORCL)</Title><Username>avisgef7901</Username><Timestamp>1349443720687</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 09:28:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nice one.

If 600 moms out of 60,000 non-random households across the country took a part-time job out of desperation at their kids school or by working the election, then that would explain the number. It's a statistical anomaly not supported by the actual payroll count or the progressively slowing GDP numbers. Obama taking a victory lap on an increase in part time jobs shows just how desperate the Obama campaign is for ANY halfway decent news on the economy. In fact, the financial repression policies of this administration have not ignited growth in the economy. The economy has been slowing down each year since the bounce back in 2009. The poor ignorant masses of America are being told by their gubment and the North Korean media that all is well, be happy, spend all your money. They are holding back all the bad news until after the election. Obama's socialist friends in Europe are doing the same. Spain's finance minister said last night they don't need a bailout and everybody laughed. Spain is 6 times worse off than Greece because they have covered up their bank losses. They have not marked their assets to market like the rest of the world. Greece runs out of money in November. Merkel is just stringing it out to prevent a blowup before the election (at Obama's request) so her socialist buddy can get re-elected. Obama must have made a deal with Merkel that he'll bail out Germany when the Euro collapses. Obama can ram anything through Congress during a crisis with Nancy and Harry twisting arms.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1349480769630</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 19:46:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349481465161-92</Id><Topic><Title>No Way In Hell! 1.3% GDP Growth - A New QE3 - and A Magical Drop to 7.8% UE!</Title><Username>moveon_moveoutnow</Username><Timestamp>1349478997059</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 19:16:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hey, "Big Brother" and his "Ministry Of Truth" never tell lies.

The reason to lie is that the government workers including the BLS tend to support Democrats. Unemployment rate has been over 8 percent for 43 months, the longest since the Great Depression. Now we need to have an investigation in how they did this survey. Then the report should be corrected as soon as possible.</Msg><Username>nutritionsolution</Username><Timestamp>1349488533100</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 21:55:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349489012764-95</Id><Topic><Title>No Way In Hell! 1.3% GDP Growth - A New QE3 - and A Magical Drop to 7.8% UE!</Title><Username>moveon_moveoutnow</Username><Timestamp>1349478997059</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 19:16:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Total #$%$ and its obvious!</Msg><Username>peterthegreat533</Username><Timestamp>1349489012764</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 22:03:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349489170377-96</Id><Title>zero hedge/ small surge in PT employment to blame for #$%$ drop.</Title><Msg>these people shoudl be ashamed.
