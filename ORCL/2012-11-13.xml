They are more deadly than the outright lies the Dems. use. I could give you a long list of who really runs this country. You would notice a certain similarity between most of them. Problem? It would be deleted. Just a hint. You can start with all the ex officers of Goldman-Sachs now in government employ and others from years past. Then do some study on who controls Goldman-Sachs.</Msg><Username>lewcor</Username><Timestamp>1352852359936</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-13 19:19:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352856809055-37</Id><Title>What's this?</Title><Msg>buckwheat telling people to grow up? The twit that fomented for 8 years about Bush. Now saying we should all get along. In other words, we should let Dems do whatever they want. Republicans aren't going to sit back and let the Dems get away with their reckless, screwball ideas. The healthcare situation is not what it's glorified to be. Many doctors are not taking medicare patients. Why is that? No sir, Republicans are going to fight every step of the way. You can call it obstruction if you want, it's really the preservation of the ideals that made this country great. Dems are gradually implanting their feel good philosophy to the detriment of the people who are expected to support it.</Msg><Username>passthebuckaroo</Username><Timestamp>1352856809055</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-13 20:33:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352858531640-38</Id><Topic><Title>repubs, you CAN'T be proud of yourselves.
