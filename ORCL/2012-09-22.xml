Democratic leader Harry Reid follow in the footsteps of GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney by releasing his 2011 tax return? Dave Buell, chairman of the Washoe Country Republican party in Mr. Reid's political backyard of Nevada, certainly thinks so. "Senator, make our day and release your 2011 tax return," he said in an email blast Friday evening. Citing an anonymous source, Mr. Reid has repeatedly claimed in recent weeks that Mr. Romney "didn't pay taxes for 10 years." Mr. Romney countered that over the past ten years he never paid less than 13 percent of his taxable income and that "Harry Reid's charge is totally false." Shortly after Mr. Romney released the additional tax information, Mr. Buell blasted out the email calling for Mr. Reid to come clean and release hits tax records "so that all Nevadans can see that he is paying his fair share." He added, "In addition, Mr. Reid should explain to all of us how he became a millionaire on a bureaucrat's salary. Mitt Romney earned his money by investing in companies, people and creating jobs in the private sector while Harry Reid made his money by taking money from the private sector and redistributing it through government." Mr. Buell also pointed out that Nevada has had the highest unemployment rate in the country.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1348317238281</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 08:33:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348320842511-3</Id><Title>Ryan requested Obamacare money</Title><Msg>.

(AP Photo/MTI, Lajos Soos) Democratic heavyweight George Soros keeps inching his way back into partisan politics. The latest evidence: Mr. Soros donated $100,000 in August to a super PAC created to help Democrats win control of the House in the November election. The contribution, tucked into a fundraising report released late Thursday night, is the latest evidence that Mr. Soros’s self-imposed hiatus from election politics may be coming to an end after nearly a decade. What Mr. Soros does with his money could be important because the billionaire investor was once the No. 1 source of money to Democratic candidates and causes. In the 2004 presidential election, Mr. Soros contributed $23.7 million – a record amount at the time. (Mr. Soros record was finally surpassed this year by Republican casino magnate Sheldon Adelson and his wife, who together donated $36 million to Republican candidates and super PACs.) But after Democrats and Mr. Kerry lost the 2004 election, Mr. Soros decided that he no longer wanted to be a major funder of the Democrats’ election campaigns. Instead, he moved his money to progressive causes and issues rather than electoral politics. That began to change earlier in this election cycle when he donated $175,000 to a pair of super PACs created to help Democrats keep control of the Senate and win a majority in the House. Since then, he has slowly ramped up his spending. In June he contributed $1 million to a super PAC set up to help Democratic candidates across the country. The latest $100,000 donation, which came on Aug. 31, brings his total election donations to about $1.3 million for the 2012 campaign. That’s still just a fraction of what Mr. Soros used to give. But it put Mr. Soros is in the ranks of the Top 20 donors to Democratic causes thus far in the election.</Msg><Username>liberals_plague_humanity</Username><Timestamp>1348322380123</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 09:59:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348322439326-6</Id><Topic><Title>Democrats Actually Dumber Than We Thought!</Title><Username>pt_bama_nation</Username><Timestamp>1348259898791</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 16:38:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Most members of Congress keep their tax returns secret | McClatchy/ ALL running for president do NOT, until Romknee.

The year before, he made $21.6 million, paid $3 million in taxes and gave $3 million to charity. So, to recap: Mitt Romney has, in the past two years, paid almost $5 million in taxes while giving away $7 million. And, as he said, he has paid the taxes he was supposed to pay according to the laws of the United States, which is all that is required — legally, morally and practically — of anyone. If you’ve been reading my columns for the past couple of years, you know I’m perfectly capable of being critical of Romney. I did so the other day, and radio host Mark Levin called me a “trash-mouther” who was “giving aid and comfort to Obama.” With open arms: Mitt Romney has given $7 million to charity the last two years, while paying $5 million in taxes. AP With open arms: Mitt Romney has given $7 million to charity the last two years, while paying $5 million in taxes. But the release of these tax records leaves no doubt about one thing: Mitt Romney is an extraordinarily, remarkably, astonishingly generous man. A good man. Maybe even a great man. That is all. There is no “but.” Anyone who says otherwise is ignorant, stupid or a liar.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1348323005643</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 10:10:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348323381757-9</Id><Topic><Title>Democrats Actually Dumber Than We Thought!</Title><Username>pt_bama_nation</Username><Timestamp>1348259898791</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 16:38:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>McCain fires back at Obama on immigration 13 Comments (78) By KATE NOCERA | 9/21/12 2:51 PM EDT Sen. John McCain went after President Barack Obama on the Senate floor, after Obama singled out the Arizona Senator as a Republican who blocked his immigration efforts. Obama said McCain was one of the Republicans who had worked on comprehensive immigration reform in 2007, and yet voted against the DREAM Act in 2008. Obama said he was surprised the Senator would "suddenly walk away.” “I’m not often in the business of accusing presidents of the United States of not telling the truth, but facts are stubborn things,” McCain said in a firey floor speech on Friday. “First of all it was then-Sen. Obama who joined with Sen. Kennedy and me when we were doing comprehensive immigration reform and we pledged we would take tough votes so that the whole fragile coalition would not fall apart.” Instead, McCain charged, it was Obama who introduced an amendment that would have “destroyed the entire coalition” without telling anyone. “More importantly, in 2009 I was invited over to the White House,” McCain continued. “I came over there, there was a conversation with others about comprehensive immigration reform and the president at that time stated they would be proposing legislation…Nothing came from the White House. Zero. Not one word.” Obama made his remarks about McCain on Thursday during a Univision News Forum at which he was pressed on why comprehensive immigration reform hadn’t happened during his first term. “Again, we find a president who wants to blame everybody else, no matter what it is,” McCain said.</Msg><Username>liberals_plague_humanity</Username><Timestamp>1348323381757</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 10:16:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348323579018-10</Id><Title>Libyan Islamist militia swept out of Benghazi bases</Title><Msg>Good to see</Msg><Username>dropkicksomemore7</Username><Timestamp>1348323579018</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 10:19:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348324318602-11</Id><Topic><Title>Romney campaign trails in crucial ground game</Title><Username>whycantphiligetawoman</Username><Timestamp>1348323804035</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 10:23:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>.....and yet another reason Romknee barely has a chance.</Msg><Username>dropkicksomemore7</Username><Timestamp>1348324318602</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 10:31:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348324447415-12</Id><Topic><Title>Democrats Actually Dumber Than We Thought!</Title><Username>pt_bama_nation</Username><Timestamp>1348259898791</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 16:38:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Big deal.

No one can accuse him of being a flip-flopper like his ally and admirer, Mitt Romney. Twenty years ago, in 1992, Netanyahu declared Iran would deploy nuclear weapons in 3-5 years. In 1995, Israeli officials warned Iran would have nuclear arms by 2000. In 1998, US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld warned that Iran would have intercontinental ballistic missiles with nuclear warheads by 2003 that could strike the United States. Netanyahu now insists Iran will have nukes within a year. US intelligence denies this claim. Even biased UN nuclear inspectors say Iran has no nukes. Even so, hysteria and disinformation about Iran’s nuclear program continues without relent, intensifying war fever in America which is in the midst of election fever. Last week, a secretly taped video emerged of candidate Romney talking to a $50,000 a plate lunch for pro-Israel supporters in Boca Raton, Florida.

So why did he deliberately avoid deducting charitable contributions in his 2011 tax return in order to pay a higher effective tax rate? The Romney campaign released a letter about the Romneys' 2011 return on Friday, and says it plans to release the full return and a summary of previous years' returns late Friday. The Romneys, who are most likely worth more than $200 million, paid a 14.1 percent effective tax rate in 2011, less than many Americans who aren't nearly that wealthy. But they did so deliberately: The Romneys gave $4.1 million to charity, but only took a deduction of 2.5 million of that in order to make sure their tax rate stayed above 14 percent. Forget for a second that Romney once said that paying more in taxes than owed would disqualify someone from running for president. The cynical answer here is that Romney deliberately paid more in taxes because he's "running for office for pete's sake." But his doing so undercuts one of his core policy arguments: That tax rates on the wealthy are too high. Not only that, but as revealed in the recording of a private fundraiser published by Mother Jones, Romney believes that those who pay income taxes are financing the laziness of those who don't, even though that's not a realistic description of Americans don't pay income taxes. Yet Romney just opted to shovel more cash to those he sees as irresponsible moochers, because paying an even lower tax rate might harm his chances of getting elected. The best part? If he loses, he might be able to file an amended return and claim those deductions anyway.</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1348331296392</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 12:28:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348336613868-17</Id><Title>Quote of The Week</Title><Msg>by Ben Stein Fathom the hypocrisy of a government that requires every citizen to prove they have insurance but not everyone has to prove they are a citizen.

Senators say they were rebuffed by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton when they pressed for more information about the attack that killed U.S. envoy Christopher Stephens in Libya. “That is the most useless, worthless briefing I have attended in a long time,” Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) told reporters after the closed-door session. GOP lawmakers were incensed to find many of the details they tried to learn Thursday were in a front-page article in The Times the following morning. “I was very disappointed in the briefing yesterday, too. The bottom line is, we asked questions like, ‘How many people were at the Benghazi consulate?’ You pick up The New York Times and you get a blow-by-blow description of what supposedly went on,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. The Times published a timeline of the attacks chronicling militants gaining access to the U.S. compound after 9:35 pm on Sept. 11, American security forces attempting to retake it at 10:45 pm and American and Libyan forces regaining control of the main compound around 11:20 pm, before evacuating. According to the timeline, Libyans found Stevens in the compound after midnight and took him to a hospital, and 20 embassy staff members were hit by mortar rounds around 2 am, an attack that killed two former Navy SEALs. The official Senate briefing was less informative. “It was like pulling teeth to get information yesterday,” Graham said of the meeting with Clinton and other administration officials. “A lot of senators were frustrated. And you pick up major newspapers in the country and you find details not shared with you.” The Wall Street Journal published a similarly detailed account of the attack. “We were told nothing. We were told absolutely nothing,” said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), ranking Republican on the Armed Services Panel. McCain said the details lawmakers sought were in The Times and The Journal. “If that isn’t an incredible disrespect to the members of the United States Senate, I don’t know what is,” he said. “It’s an example of the disdain with which this body is held by the administration, including, I’m sorry to say, the secretary of state.” “She didn’t talk about anything,” McCain said of Clinton in a subsequent interview. Senators asked Clinton about the sequence of events during the Benghazi attack. She and other officials declined to provide any specifics, citing an ongoing investigation. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and Deputy Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter also attended the briefing. Republicans have grown increasingly frustrated with the Obama administration’s cozy relationship with the press. Some think the media has given Obama favorable coverage. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) said the media’s intense coverage of Mitt Romney’s controversial remarks about 47 percent of the nation depending on government handouts had distracted from the central issue of the election: the economy. “The problem is the media coverage of it. Obviously the campaign wants to talk about the real issues,” he said of the comment, which has dominated press coverage this week. “It will be an issue as long as the media makes it one. “I’m starting to think that there might be a little bit of a media bias,” he quipped. Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) said the media has helped Obama by not focusing enough on the nation’s sluggish economy and $16 trillion debt. “The president of the United States is doing everything he can to change the subject from that real central issue of our faltering economy and yes, the mainstream media is out there playing trivial pursuit and talking about everything that is not important and that is a distraction,” Wicker said on the Senate floor Friday. Republicans led by McCain have complained loudly this year that Obama’s senior advisors have tried to generate favorable stories by leaking classified information to reporters. In June, McCain called for a special counsel to investigate national security leaks to The New York Times and The Washington Post. McCain has voiced concern over stories detailing President Obama’s approval of a kill list of suspected terrorists and the role of U.S. and Israeli intelligence agencies in a cyber attack against Iran.</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1348338396972</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 14:26:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348338509191-19</Id><Title>Did You Ever Wonder</Title><Msg>why conservative are called the right and liberals the left?

I'm an independent... I'd LOVE to balance out spending cuts with higher taxes on the wealthy. The problem is, the top 1% are already providing 39% of individual income tax receipts and they are running offshore like the brazillian facebook founder did or diving into tax shelters and THAT isn't going to lead to any private sector investment and/or hiring.
