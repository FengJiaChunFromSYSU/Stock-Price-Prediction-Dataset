As a consequence, the empire ultimately unravels and descends into chaos. Today, governments that have relied upon quantitative easing (QE) instead of undertaking necessary structural reforms have arguably entered into the grandest Faustian bargain in financial history. As a result of multi-trillion dollar quantitative easing programs, central banks around the world have compromised their ability to control the money supply, making them vulnerable to runaway inflation. When interest rates rise, the market value of central bank assets could fall below the face value of their liabilities, potentially rendering the banks incapable of protecting the stability and purchasing power of their currencies. Today, the gold standard no longer exists and, for the first time, the entire global monetary system is built on a foundation of fiat currencies. This monetary paradigm works because of an abiding faith that paper money will be accepted as a medium of exchange and remain a store of value. At the core of this system is the presumption that central banks, as the issuers of paper money, have enough assets that can be readily sold in the event that their currencies' value begins to fall and the money supply needs to be reduced. When confidence in a central bank's ability to reduce its money supply in a sufficient amount to maintain its currency's purchasing power is drawn into question, there is a risk of a currency crisis or even hyperinflation. Beginning in 2008, the monetary orthodoxy of the previous 95 years quickly disappeared. By 2011, the Federal Reserve's portfolio consisted of more than $2.6 trillion in Treasury and agency securities, mortgage bonds, and other obligations. This resulted in an increase in the central bank's debt-to-equity ratio to roughly 51-to-1. Under Operation Twist, the Federal Reserve swapped its short-term Treasury securities holdings for longer-term ones in an attempt to induce borrowing and growth in the economy. This caused an extension of the duration of the Federal Reserve's portfolio to more than eight years. Now, a 100 basis-point increase in interest rates would cause the market value of the Federal Reserve's assets to fall by about 8%, or approximately $200 billion, which would leave the Federal Reserve with a capital deficit of $150 billion, rendering it insolvent under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Although this may not happen in the immediate future, if interest rates rose five percentage points, the Federal Reserve could lose more than a trillion dollars from its fixed income portfolio.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1345725861000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 08:44:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345726160000-19</Id><Title>Put your trading of Oracle Corporation on hold before you regret it</Title><Msg>If you want to become a professional investor, you need to use this awesome system HTTP://WWW.BESTTRADINGONLINEPENNYSTOCKS.INFO</Msg><Username>coombszrmny9296</Username><Timestamp>1345726160000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 08:49:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345726562000-20</Id><Topic><Title>corpiss is such a scum, whenever anyone acts SMART, corpiss flips out</Title><Username>dropkickuuuuuuu</Username><Timestamp>1345664093000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 15:34:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Oh forgot... and annie!

This rule was an expansive reading by the George W. Bush administration of legal provisions that only enabled health care workers and entities such as hospitals and health maintenance organizations to object to performing, counseling, referring for, or covering abortion. But President Bush broadly interpreted the law to apply to any health care service, including contraception, end-of-life care, HIV treatments, and many others, and extended it beyond doctors, nurses, and pharmacists to candy stripers, janitors, ambulance drivers, and health insurance claims officers, to name just a few examples. If elected, Gov. Romney would reinstate this overreaching regulation. Gov. Romney also supported the failed Blunt Amendment, which would have undermined an Obama administration regulation that requires health insurance plans to cover contraception with no cost-sharing, such as co-pays or deductibles. The amendment, named after Sen. Roy Blunt (R-MO), would allow employers and insurers to refuse to cover any health care service, including but not limited to contraception, that they find objectionable for moral or religious reasons. Romney would support efforts to outlaw abortion Gov. Romney has called Roe v. Wade, the case that established a constitutional right to abortion, “one of the darkest moments in Supreme Court history.” As with contraception, he supports letting the states decide whether abortion should be legal. He also has said he “absolutely” would support a state constitutional amendment to define life as beginning at conception. And vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan has sponsored a similar federal measure in Congress. These would outlaw abortion under all circumstances with no exceptions. Such a law might also interfere with the treatment of ectopic pregnancies, with some fertility treatments, and with some methods of contraception, as described above.</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1345728418000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 09:26:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345728890000-25</Id><Title>Baron Koch builds his own private fiefdom</Title><Msg>Billionaire Koch Builds Frontier Town All His Own Near Aspen Energy billionaire William Koch is developing a private 19th-century Western village, with a saloon, a jail and a train station, high in the Rocky Mountains in a region pockmarked with historic ghost towns that died when the mines that supported them played out. Koch, 72, who made his fortune partly by developing underground coal deposits in Somerset, Colorado, is building the out-of-the-way oasis at his nearby Bear Ranch, a working cattle operation southwest of Aspen. The compound will also include a 21,762-square-foot mansion with an elevator, a wine room and his-and-hers mud rooms overlooking the 50-building frontier town. A third of the house will be underground. Koch is a collector of Old West memorabilia, including the only known photograph of Billy the Kid, which he bought for $2.3 million at a Denver auction last year. He plans to open the make-believe town solely to his family and friends, not the public, said Brad Goldstein, a spokesman for the company Koch founded, West Palm Beach, Florida-based Oxbow Carbon LLC.</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1345728890000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 09:34:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345732672000-26</Id><Topic><Title>Baron Koch builds his own private fiefdom</Title><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1345728890000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 09:34:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Jobs being created by private money.

Posted: 08/23/2012 08:44:28 AM PDT Updated: 08/23/2012 08:46:19 AM PDT An analysis from the University of Colorado that has correctly predicted the outcome of presidential elections since 1980 is forecasting Mitt Romney as the winner this year. Political science professors Kenneth Bickers and Michael Berry found that the ailing economy spells trouble for the president's re-election bid. The professors conduct a state-by-state analysis, incorporating economic data such as unemployment figures. The results of their analysis show that Obama will win 218 votes in the electoral college, short of the 270 that he would need to be re-elected. While their study focuses on the electoral college, the political scientists predict Romney, the presumptive Republican candidate, will win 52.9 percent of the popular vote compared with 47.1 for Obama when considering only the two major political parties. The economy is a main driver in elections, said Bickers. "If the economy were just average, we would be forecasting Obama to win," Bickers said. "But the economy is below average, and he is struggling." Bickers said this election cycle has some parallels with 1980 -- a period when the economy was slumping and inflation was skyrocketing -- and voters chose Republican Ronald Reagan over Democratic incumbent President Jimmy Carter. Bickers said Obama risks losing almost all of the states now considered swing states, including Colorado, North Carolina, Virginia, New Hampshire, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Florida. Advertisement The CU model has accurately predicted the winner for the last eight presidential elections. The study will be published this month in "PS: Political Science &amp; Politics," a peer-reviewed journal of the American Political Science Association. The CU study will be among about a dozen election prediction models. The professors provide some caveats that could affect their forecast, including the time frame the economic data used in the study was collected and close tallies in some states. The data was taken five months in advance of the Nov. 6 election, and the professors plan to update it with more current economic data next month. "As scholars and pundits well know, each election has unique elements that could lead one or more states to behave in ways in a particular election that the model is unable to correctly predict," Berry said in a news release.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1345741063000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 12:57:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345741529000-51</Id><Topic><Title>will Ted Nugent be at the gop convention?</Title><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1345726629000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 08:57:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>doofus, Nugent is a loud mouth hawk just like Tush, they are all for the wars.... as long as others go.... ditto for Romney. and fyi neo nazi Ron Paul would have left hilter and Tojo alone too.....we would be speaking german now had ron paul been prez instead of fdr........ paul and hilter have the same ideas on race and a lot of things which is why paul hangs out with stromfront people and is the rep from the kkk stronghold in Texas.</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1345741529000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 13:05:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345741631000-52</Id><Topic><Title>Puts?</Title><Username>tarrahimo848</Username><Timestamp>1345736676000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 11:44:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This is what I am looking for.</Msg><Username>reaglerrz8170</Username><Timestamp>1345741631000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 13:07:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345741645000-53</Id><Topic><Title>9% Unemployment, Negative GDP, Recession, Economy Tanking...

"Biden got plenty of support from Minnesota Democrats," PostBulletin.com reports. "Sen. Al Franken praised Obama for pushing the health care law, saying it will help more seniors get help paying for prescriptions and will ensure Medicare's solvency for an additional eight years." But before Franken was a senator he was a writer on the TV show Saturday Night Live. Then, he famously joked about raping CBS reporter Lesley Stahl. As New York magazine reported in 1995, from a writing session that the reporter sat in on: Franken: “And, ‘I give the pills to Lesley Stahl. Then, when Lesley’s passed out, I take her to the closet and rape her.’ Or, ‘That’s why you never see Lesley until February.’ Or, ‘When she passes out, I put her in various positions and take pictures of her.’” With the national conversation now turning to women's issues as a result of the bizarre and offensive comments by Missouri Senate candidate Todd Akin over the weekend, it seems a bit odd that Vice President Biden would take the stage with Franken, considering his own lack of sensitivity to the horrors of rape.

Nor will anyone born before 1957 or so........ but that is BS for sure as explained here: "The scheme to radically degrade Medicare benefits for those born after 1957 would blow up well before the year of change, 2023, arrives. The Ryan plan has gotten as far as it has because younger Americans have not been focusing on their retirements. Republicans think they can drop this voucher system on them unawares. But the likelihood that Americans born in 1957 or after are going to accept a two-class deal in which they have to pay for older peoples' generous benefits while expecting far less for themselves is about zero. As time goes on, there will be progressively more voters born after 1957 and fewer born before. Thus, the politically numerous would either demand that older Americans' Medicare benefits be dragged down to their promised levels or that the whole voucher business be dropped. And who could blame them?"

The fine for hospitals is there to punish those hospital who send people home when they are still sick. As a result they need to be readmitted, often on emergency basis. The hospitals get "punished" for not caring for the sick while they are there but instead just push them out. Note. The hospitals are only fined when people are readmitted for the same reason they had just been hospitalized.

Logically, this means someone earning $20 million a year should pay a much larger proportion of his income in taxes than someone earning $200,000, who in turn should pay a larger proportion than someone earning $50,000. But Romney’s alleged 13 percent tax rate is lower than that of most middle class Americans who earn a tiny fraction of what he earns. At a time when poverty is increasing, when public parks and public libraries are being closed and when public schools are shrinking their offerings and their hours, when the nation’s debt is immense, and when the 400 richest Americans have more wealth than the bottom 150 million of us put together — Romney’s 13 percent is shameful.

"Hospitals are punished for not caring for the sick while they are there." Are you on some kind of mind altering cookies or is that what the penalty czar told you. It's not the hospitals, it's the limited coverage insurance companies will allow for certain treatment. If hospitals are forced to release a patient early, why are they the ones punished? I could give you a dozen or more cases of people I know that were sent home 2 days after an operation. You think it would be any different with Obamacare? I have a real Rolex for $20 if you're interested.</Msg><Username>annieshenanigan</Username><Timestamp>1345766647000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 20:04:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345768564000-135</Id><Topic><Title>Romney's 13% is a disgrace</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1345761043000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 18:30:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>well Mesa, I was just playing off the quote you provided, which said: &lt;Equal sacrifice means that in paying taxes people ought to feel about the same degree of pain regardless of whether they’re wealthy or poor.&gt; ..................................................................

Median household income fell 4.8 percent on an inflation- adjusted basis since the recession ended in June 2009, more than the 2.6 percent drop during the 18-month contraction, the research firm’s Gordon Green and John Coder wrote in a report today. Household income is 7.2 percent below the December 2007 level, the former Census Bureau economic statisticians wrote. “Almost every group is worse off than it was three years ago, and some groups had very large declines in income,” Green, who previously directed work on the Census Bureau’s income and poverty statistics program, said in a phone interview today. “We’re in an unprecedented period of economic stagnation.”</Msg><Username>onedinosaur</Username><Timestamp>1345771696000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 21:28:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345774917000-144</Id><Topic><Title>the rich benefited most from the Bush tax cuts</Title><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1345765787000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 19:49:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No, he was a murderer, thief, and blasphemer!
