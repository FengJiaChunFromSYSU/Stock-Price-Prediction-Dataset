It's not a case that the people who receive all the government benefits pay more taxes, it's a case that they pay NO taxes. We working wage earners pay the taxes, the government gives our tax money and benefits to the ERR Poor? Many of these Poor?, receive more in cash payments and benifits than many low income working tax payers earn. Where's the fairness in that situation?

At 17 Izzy immigrated to the USA from England after his family escaped from Poland when he was 12. A more proud American can not be imagined. He often said, "I am overwhelmed by the opportunities my county offers me!" All five of his children graduated from college. One got an MS, another got a JD, and the third an MD degree. It took Izzy 13 years of night school to get a college degree. When a young Black kid was being laid off at the end of his 90 day evaluation period he confronted Izzy in the huge Republic Steel Plant break room at lunch and tried to intimidate him with all sorts of NAACP / ACLU / Etc threats. "I want this on-the-record in front of everybody." the young man said. "You' firin' me 'cause I'm Black!" Without even looking up from his sandwich the foreman said, "No. We hired you because you're Black. We're firing you because you're useless."

I had to pay close to 100k in educational expenses, and I never qualified for any grants or welfare! I could be bitter like You, but I am educated, that’s the only difference! If you idiots allowed your "corporate Gods" to export all the Industry (and those JOBS paid very well) then it is solely your fault, because your government was not protecting its people. Government failed to do its JOB! Your economy is failing due to this reality! Everyone pays Tax, and the rates are all unfair; however, because everyone is now either unemployed or working at Wal-Mart (due to your worship of corporate greed) the tax base gets short revenue. The benefits are still being paid “only to secure against civil war,” and you better be sure that’s why, because the government is not stupid enough to cut all social programs (though I wish they were) because they would be DEAD MEN WALKING!

And even that is a small problem compared to what's going on in the credit world. Taxpayer guaranties have massively distorted credit allocation, made sure money flows to dead beats homeowners, bad students, to banks irrespective of their balance sheets. This affects literally $trillions of dollars. All this have created an economy based on over consumption and under production. Production is being replaced by debt growth. And the distortions of credit are necessary to get further debt growth. This, and not welfare, is the overwhelming problem.

While filling in for Anderson Cooper, O'Brien was actually caught on screen looking at an article from the left-wing website Talking Points Memo to assist her in a heated debate with Romney campaign senior adviser Barbara Comstock (video follows with commentary): Ali Akbar at Viral Read reported Monday: During her interview with Virginia House of Delegates Republican member Barbara Comstock, O’Brien became visibly flustered and was actually caught doing finger stress exercises as she attempt [sic] to insert editorial commentary while her guest, a former skilled Republican operative, defended the House GOP budget, designed by Budget Chairman Paul Ryan. Accidentally, a cameraman captured O’Brien furiously flipping through notes, only to cut out seconds later. Indeed: Once blown up, the picture told quite a story: What she's reading from is a TPM article titled "The Myth Of Paul Ryan The Bipartisan Leader" published Monday at 6:08 PM only a few hours before this program started.

Reagan signed into law a bill that made any immigrant who had entered the country before 1982 eligible for amnesty. The bill was sold as a crackdown, but its tough sanctions on employers who hired undocumented immigrants were removed before final passage. The bill helped 3 million people and millions more family members gain American residency. It has since become a source of major embarrassment for conservatives. 8. Reagan illegally funneled weapons to Iran. Reagan and other senior U.S. officials secretly sold arms to officials in Iran, which was subject to a an arms embargo at the time, in exchange for American hostages. Some funds from the illegal arms sales also went to fund anti-Communist rebels in Nicaragua — something Congress had already prohibited the administration from doing. When the deals went public, the Iran-Contra Affair, as it came to be know, was an enormous political scandal that forced several senior administration officials to resign. 9. Reagan vetoed a comprehensive anti-Apartheid act. which placed sanctions on South Africa and cut off all American trade with the country. Reagan's veto was overridden by the Republican-controlled Senate. Reagan responded by saying "I deeply regret that Congress has seen fit to override my veto," saying that the law "will not solve the serious problems that plague that country." 10. Reagan helped create the Taliban and Osama Bin Laden. Reagan fought a proxy war with the Soviet Union by training, arming, equipping, and funding Islamist mujahidin fighters in Afghanistan. Reagan funneled billions of dollars, along with top-secret intelligence and sophisticated weaponry to these fighters through the Pakistani intelligence service. The Talbian and Osama Bin Laden — a prominent mujahidin commander — emerged from these mujahidin groups Reagan helped create, and U.S. policy towards Pakistan remains strained because of the intelligence services' close relations to these fighters. In fact, Reagan's decision to continue the proxy war after the Soviets were willing to retreat played a direct role in Bin Laden's ascendancy.</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1344973186000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 15:39:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344973240000-70</Id><Topic><Title>Obama Will Only Lose $25 Billion On GM!!

Comments 124 Former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani told CNBC’s Larry Kudlow tonight that Vice President Biden may be unfit for office. Here’s the transcript: KUDLOW: You know, what did he say? ‘Y’all going to be put back in chains’? That almost has racial overtones, Rudy Giuliani. What’s your take on that? GIULIANI: Well, I think if it came from somebody serious maybe we’d get all excited about it. But the — I think the vice president of the United States has become a laugh line on late night television. I mean, he — I’ve never seen a vice president that has made as many mistakes, said as many stupid things. I mean, there’s a real fear if, God forbid, he ever had to be entrusted with the presidency, whether he really has the mental capacity to handle it. I mean, this guy just isn’t bright. He’s never been bright. He isn’t bright. And people think, ‘Well, he just talks a little too much.’ Actually he’s not very smart.</Msg><Username>hikemanymiles</Username><Timestamp>1344992112000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 20:55:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344992233000-113</Id><Topic><Title>Why dont the poor pay tax on</Title><Username>central_scrutinizer_fz</Username><Timestamp>1344892272000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 17:11:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>WOW!
