The story was first reported by Politico and has been confirmed by ABC News. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor was on the trip but was not present for the late night antics. When Cantor was told about what happened, according to Republican sources, he was "livid" and called members of the delegation to say the behavior was unacceptable and must never be repeated. The skinny dipper, according to the sources, was Rep. Kevin Yoder, R-Kansas.</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1345466572000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-20 08:42:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345470522000-7</Id><Topic><Title>Did you see this report yet?

Greenspan lowered interest rates and Bill lowered taxes, pushed de-regulation (real estate loans and repeal of Glass Stegall) and globalization. Then, when the economy was firing on all cylinders he raised taxes to pay off the national debt after being lambasted by Ross Perot to do so. Times were great until the dot com disaster in Clinton's last year ended 20 years of prosperity. And then 9/11 happened in retaliation for Clinton's drone bombing of bin Laden's compound.

Does Pus_sy Ri_ot deserve to be in jail? There is no recovery until real estate recovers. Obama is not the road to prosperity. He blew it and he knows it. Keynesian policies extended the Great Depression. Obama has repeated the mistakes of the past. Now, we all have to pay.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1345494589000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-20 16:29:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345495114000-35</Id><Topic><Title>Real estate whores on NYT</Title><Username>nazyoyo</Username><Timestamp>1345477622000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-20 11:47:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes, all women are sluts.

We are reaching the crunch phase of the exponential. It will continue until the government is bankrupt or inflation destroys the dollar, or both. *** That's the whole point. Bernanke has been inflating the economy. He has slayed the monster of deflation. The genie is out of the bottle. Inflation will solve all the problems. The price of everything is going to go sky high. Everyone's going to be a millionaire and will be taxed like a millionaire. That's Obama's little secret. You are all going to pay more taxes. There's no way around it. He's robbed you by devaluing the dollar. The clown is gonna come and take the last dollar out of your wallet. He's going to the the Bush tax cuts expire and blame the Republicans. What a joker. What a leader.
