Tsarnaev, now dead, is suspected of bombing the Boston Marathon last week. "Marathon bombings mastermind Tamerlan Tsarnaev was living on taxpayer-funded state welfare benefits even as he was delving deep into the world of radical anti-American Islamism, the Herald has learned," reports the Boston Herald. "State officials confirmed last night that Tsarnaev, slain in a raging gun battle with police last Friday, was receiving benefits along with his wife, Katherine Russell Tsarnaev, and their 3-year-old daughter. The state’s Executive Office of Health and Human Services said those benefits ended in 2012 when the couple stopped meeting income eligibility limits. Russell Tsarnaev’s attorney has claimed Katherine — who had converted to Islam — was working up to 80 hours a week as a home health aide while Tsarnaev stayed at home. "In addition, both of Tsarnaev’s parents received benefits, and accused brother bombers Dzhokhar and Tamerlan were recipients through their parents when they were younger, according to the state."</Msg><Username>liberals_plague_humanity</Username><Timestamp>1366809602811</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 09:20:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366810143882-12</Id><Topic><Title>Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah........</Title><Username>coughingredink</Username><Timestamp>1366761563046</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-23 19:59:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No wonder he hates the GOP!

Now to further that crackhead position, the trial of the man who killed an abortion doctor was covered in mass by the liberal press but not the same for the abortion doctor who murdered hundreds of live babies. Shameful to us is justifiable to them in the name of choice. The true ugly Americans, nothing else comes close..</Msg><Username>passthebuckaroo</Username><Timestamp>1366846641820</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 19:37:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366846986615-34</Id><Topic><Title>HaHa Governent Workers Ticked</Title><Username>passthebuckaroo</Username><Timestamp>1366831406937</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 15:23:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I love when I get a thumbs down from one of the useful idiots, it means I hit the nail.

"Counterterrorism is often shrouded in secrecy, as it should be, so let us judge by the results.

In the over seven years after 9/11 under George W. Bush, how many terrorists reached their target in the United States? Zero! We need to ask, ‘Why is the Obama Administration failing in its mission to stop terrorism before it reaches its targets in the United States?’”</Msg><Username>hikemanymiles</Username><Timestamp>1366854751908</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 21:52:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366854819632-38</Id><Topic><Title>oddly enough terrorism against France ended when they left Nam and Algeria</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1366822480803</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 12:54:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Williams-Sonoma Pulls Pressure Cookers Off Shelves 'Out of Respect' April 24, 2013 A local news outlet is reporting that the home-goods retailer, Williams-Sonoma has pulled pressure cookers from their shelves in the aftermath of the Boston attack at the request of the Obama Administration.
