"If even one child can be saved we should take those steps." What a dishonest argument. If saving children's lives is his goal let's start with abortion. Oo let's take another approach. On average 26 school kids are killed each year by getting stuck in a closing bus door unknown to the driver, then the driver takes off dragging a child. If saving children's lives is his goal let's begin with school buses. there is no constitutional issue on tht.</Msg><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1358342048871</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 08:14:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358349314451-2</Id><Title>new anti-gun policies due out today</Title><Msg>Will gun owners simply comply with new policies?

Just owning a clip that holds more than 7 rounds at time of the signing makes you a criminal... even though it was legal seconds before maybe that was their point However.... it certainly violates the ex post facto clause of the US Constitution It will be a mere matter of months before NY'S new law is declared unConstitutional... at least in part and its gonna be impossible to pass further new laws on the magazines after the first try is un-Constitutional furthermore the only 7 round magazines available are for smaller easy to conceal pistols which also makes all full sized semi-autos obsolete in NYS NO manufacturer makes a seven or less round clip for their guns which probably violates the Supreme Courts recent ruling that states may only place reasonable restrictions on gun ownership... Its hard to imagine that the court would agree that making all current pistols obsolete by the stroke of a pen is reasonable</Msg><Username>howie_is_long</Username><Timestamp>1358355085290</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 11:51:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358355172065-8</Id><Title>Cuomo destroyed any possibility he had of becoming President</Title><Msg>at least some good came out of this law</Msg><Username>howie_is_long</Username><Timestamp>1358355172065</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 11:52:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358357440325-9</Id><Topic><Title>Cuomo made every NY semi owner a criminal</Title><Username>howie_is_long</Username><Timestamp>1358355085290</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 11:51:25 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I have a cousin that was married to a very well known celebrity that lives in New York.
