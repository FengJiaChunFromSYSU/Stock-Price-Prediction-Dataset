It might be a white American who has joined forces with terrorist factions in this country. Remember Adam Gadhan who fought along side Al Queda in Afghanistan. The truth is there will be more of these ambushes and mostly at events where they can cause the most casualties. It's a terrible reality that innocent people are the targets. . I hope the surveillance cameras picked up some hint of the perps.</Msg><Username>annieshenanigan</Username><Timestamp>1366218224264</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-17 13:03:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366218954126-41</Id><Title>Let’s hope the Boston Marathon bomber is a white American” What's wrong with that You all want it to be a person of color</Title><Msg>Surely don't pretend you have any high road.</Msg><Username>dropkickpubs4321</Username><Timestamp>1366218954126</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-17 13:15:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366219873091-42</Id><Title>again seeb,,, interesting point you have BUT,,.STOP pretending what you want the killer terrorist to be is the right thing</Title><Msg>and what I want is the wrong thing, Both are the same........in terms of right and wrong good and bad.</Msg><Username>dropkickpubs4321</Username><Timestamp>1366219873091</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-17 13:31:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366219932578-43</Id><Title>if there's a terror attack in a foriegn country I'd prefer the terrorist would be someone from that country too.</Title><Msg>I'd say I'm consistant.</Msg><Username>dropkickpubs4321</Username><Timestamp>1366219932578</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-17 13:32:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366220425697-44</Id><Title>It looks like they're about to arest someone,..for the record,,if he's caught today I'll be pleased and I don't care who he is,,just caught</Title><Msg>If its corpiss that WOULD be a plus but if hes a seebe preferred terrorist,,,fine with me,,just get him and see if he was involved with others.</Msg><Username>dropkickpubs4321</Username><Timestamp>1366220425697</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-17 13:40:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366221168377-45</Id><Title>arrest has been made seebe hope the guy is ...................................</Title><Msg>the person responsible...</Msg><Username>dropkickpubs4321</Username><Timestamp>1366221168377</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-17 13:52:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366223271402-46</Id><Title>they shouldn't even be saying they've video of the guy until they arrest him</Title><Msg>amatures</Msg><Username>dropkickpubs4321</Username><Timestamp>1366223271402</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-17 14:27:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366225624644-47</Id><Topic><Title>they shouldn't even be saying they've video of the guy until they arrest him</Title><Username>dropkickpubs4321</Username><Timestamp>1366223271402</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-17 14:27:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>They want him to panic and run... hopefully not killing more people in the process!</Msg><Username>ivleeg_garbage</Username><Timestamp>1366225624644</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-17 15:07:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366228551214-48</Id><Topic><Title>Carter's moronic plan, Several repub admins prior to Carter's are to blame for the military's situation</Title><Username>dropkickpubs4321</Username><Timestamp>1366211464745</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-17 11:11:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Baucus warns of 'huge train wreck' enacting ObamaCare provisions By Sam Baker - 04/17/13 12:33 PM ET Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.) said Wednesday he fears a "train wreck" as the Obama administration implements its signature healthcare law. Baucus, the chairman of the chamber's powerful Finance Committee and a key architect of the healthcare reform law, said he fears people do not understand how the law will work. "I just see a huge train wreck coming down," he told Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius at a Wednesday hearing. "You and I have discussed this many times, and I don't see any results yet." Baucus pressed Sebelius for details about how the Health Department will explain the law and raise awareness of its provisions, which are supposed to take effect in just a matter of months. "I'm very concerned that not enough is being done so far — very concerned," Baucus said.</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1366228551214</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-17 15:55:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366229744794-49</Id><Title>They want him to panic and run...
