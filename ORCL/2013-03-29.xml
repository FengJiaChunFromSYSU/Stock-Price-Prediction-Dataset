Oracle and IBM are busy publicly fighting over whose servers are faster. Brawler Oracle has thrown down more barbs against rival IBM. Oracle earlier this week said its new servers are faster/better/stronger than IBM’s. IBM fired back that Oracle was comparing its new servers to IBM’s older servers, not a fair comparison. Now Oracle is adding fuel to the fire. Oracle EVP John Fowler told Business Insider, “IBM customers are being wildly over-charged for the performance their getting.” Oracle’s not afraid of kicking some dirt, but it has had to back down in the past. Last year it pulled advertising saying certain systems were faster than IBM’s after IBM complained to the Better Business Bureau. It looks like the same will happen again. Do the recent results reflect Oracle's loss of integrity with it's customers?</Msg><Username>hikemanymiles</Username><Timestamp>1364563051094</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-29 09:17:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364563364601-13</Id><Topic><Title>Current economic failures belong to Obama and his dismal policies.</Title><Username>cykdelic</Username><Timestamp>1364337106709</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 18:31:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>When bgroup doubled the debt, doubled the jobless, lost double digits in stock markets NEVER BEFORE happened,,, surely THAT was bgroups fault?

Cemetaries have always been considered sacred ground. There are thousands of men buried in Arlington and around the countlry in vet cemetaries, each one has a cross as a marker. Are they going to demand those be removed too? This amounts to hate and disrespect for those who died in service of their country for which it stands, under GOD. They better not preach to me about the separation of church and state. Many people believe in GOD but don't necessarily belong to any religion. If a burial cross is a statement of that, so be it. Who the hell do these people think they are to impose their heathenistic objections on the rest of us?
