Today NTWK is a much stronger company with far more revenue sources including new Cloud Divisions. Unlike 2010, NTWK today has the flexibility to deliver reliable software products and services not only from Pakistan but also from excellence centers located in Bangkok, Beijing, the US, and the UK. The float today is 1/10 of what it was then and 2013 revenues are expected to breakaway into the mid $40 million for the first time in company history. During 2010 (and 2007) NTWK's market cap reached over $100 million on 50% lower revenues of what is projected for 2013. During the September 4Q CC NTWK officials stated that revenues are expected to reach $100 Million in 2015 up significantly from the $38 Million reported in 2012. They also expect margins to continue to go up as the high-margin Cloud divisions keep continuing exponentially to revenues. MUST READ ……This Week’s Analysts Comments on Upgrade: We project 13% annual growth to FY14 from FY10 reflecting 80 significant NFS legacy customers in FY14, up from 52, 37, and 28 in FY12, FY11, and FY10, respectively. The new Vroozi Cloud Division contributed $1.3 million in FY12. We expect at least $4 million in FY13 and $6 million to FY14 Our price target is based on the average forward 2013 P/E multiple of 13.2X (up from 12.8X in August 2012). NTWK is trading at 6.4X our FY13 projections. We are forecasting EPS of $0.85 per share. We applied an 11X multiple to our FY13 EPS forecast. We anticipate a richer multiple as earnings momentum builds in FY13. The company guidance calls for $1/share net income in 2013. NTWK is entering FY13 with a $25 million backlog and approximately $100 million in qualified leads. One quarter of the backlog is from four new NFS platform customer implementations that began in 4Q12. In August 2011, NetSol launched its Cloud Vroozi Division, an e-procurement search tool for SAP supplier relationship management (SRM) users. SAP AG is a global vendor of enterprise management systems that has the largest market share (24%) based on a worldwide Gartner survey. Vroozi should provide sales diversification and a higher margin recurring revenue stream. The Vroozi division contributed $1.3 million in FY12 sales and is expected to grow to $4 million in revenues in 2013 NTWK announced its 2nd Cloud Division last week offering an array of products and services to capture a greater % of the cloud applications in North America.

Egan Jones already downgraded this foolishness. A few more and the US will be Bankrupt because they cannot pay interest on that DEBt … #$%$ Obama just wants to be president he is a small child.

It is a Long Term Care home that provides assisted living for the elderly. Last year, she brought in $220,000 in revenues and incurred expenses of about $145,000 so her "net income" was about $75,000. She is single so her tax bracket is high, right?... ... wrong. Her taxes were zero. The reason is because the source of about $77,000 of her revenue was medicaid that was paid to her by the state to care for 3 of her residents who qualifiy for medicaid. Medicaid revenues are considered NON-TAXABLE, so her 1040 schedule C showed $143,000 in revenues and $145,000 of expenses. She drives a lexus. Now, lets look at Mitt Romney. Of his millions in income, he paid about 14% of it in taxes. Obama seized on that, stated that Warren Buffett's secretary pays closer to 20% on far less income, and seated Warren Buffett's secretary in the FRONT ROW of the state of the union address to make his point. Obama was banking on the fact that 90% of Americans don't know that Mitt Romney's income was from dividends, which are taxed at a lower rate because they are "double taxed". The companies that pay Romney those dividends can't deduct them and, since the U.S. corporate tax rate is the highest in the world topping out at 35%, the "total take" on his dividends from both him and the corp. that paid them was close to 50%. Buffett's secretary was an "employee", so Warren Buffett could "deduct" her salary. Thus, the total tax take on her earnings was just the 20% she paid... and Warren, unlike Romney's payors, paid NOTHING. Obama wants to tax dividends like "ordinary income" and he wants to raise the top rate on ordinary income to 39.6% (Romney's bracket). If he does, the total take on Romney's dividends from both sources would be 74.6%. So, can you answer these 2 questions for me: 1. What is the true cost of medicaid to our country's $1.2 trillion deficit? Answer... much higher than they say it is because care providers don't pay taxes on medicaid payments... even if they make a lot of money and drive a lexus. 2. What will happen if Obama leaves the AFH owner comfortably in her lexus and raises the total tax on dividend income to a max of 74.6%? Answer: Multinational corporations who prefer to pay dividends will compare the U.S. tax treatment of dividends with how they are treated in other countries and decide where to do business and where to employ labor based on those comparisons... thus perpetuating the high unemployment that currently plagues the U.S. Congratulations! If you read and understand this, you are more knowledgeable on these subjects than 98% of all the Americans that will vote for president this coming November.

Sponsored Links Unemployment rates in August rose in 26 states from July, but most states showed lower rates than a year ago, the federal government reported Friday. Nevada continued to lead the country with the highest unemployment rate, 12.1% in August. Rhode Island had the second-highest rate, 10.7%, and California was next at 10.6%. Oil-rich North Dakota had the lowest at 3%. Twelve states and the District of Columbia posted declines in their unemployment rates last month vs. July. Rates were unchanged in 12 states. Forty-two states and the District of Columbia had lower unemployment rates in August than in August 2011, seven had higher rates and one had no change. Regionally, unemployment was highest in the West and lowest in the Midwest. Friday's report will be closely analyzed for its potential impact on the presidential campaign, especially in 12 swing states that are expected to be key battlegrounds. Those 12 are Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Michigan, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin. Colorado, Florida, Michigan, Nevada, and North Carolina have jobless rates above the national average, which was 8.1% in August. Among the 12, Michigan's rate rose the most last month, 0.4 percentage point from July, to 9.4%. Rates rose in seven of the 12 compared with July.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1348247694920</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 13:14:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348251697265-26</Id><Topic><Title>Obama has more campaign money to spend than Romney</Title><Username>whycantphiligetawoman</Username><Timestamp>1348225500632</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 07:05:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That doesn't even include all the money Obama is spending on the public dime to campaign.

The campaign previews a few of the highlights here: In 2011, the Romneys paid $1,935,708 in taxes on $13,696,951 in mostly investment income. The Romneys’ effective tax rate for 2011 was 14.1%. The Romneys donated $4,020,772 to charity in 2011, amounting to nearly 30% of their income. The Romneys claimed a deduction for $2.25 million of those charitable contributions. The Romneys’ generous charitable donations in 2011 would have significantly reduced their tax obligation for the year. The Romneys thus limited their deduction of charitable contributions to conform to the Governor's statement in August, based upon the January estimate of income, that he paid at least 13% in income taxes in each of the last 10 years. Additionally, the Romney campaign is releasing a summary of 20 years of taxes, between 1990-2009, detailing their tax expenditures during those years: In each year during the entire 20-year period, the Romneys owed both state and federal income taxes. Over the entire 20-year period, the average annual effective federal tax rate was 20.20%. Over the entire 20-year period, the lowest annual effective federal personal tax rate was 13.66%. Over the entire 20-year period, the Romneys gave to charity an average of 13.45% of their adjusted gross income. Over the entire 20-year period, the total federal and state taxes owed plus the total charitable donations deducted represented 38.49% of total AGI.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1348252951022</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 14:42:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348252990537-29</Id><Topic><Title>Obama has more campaign money to spend than Romney</Title><Username>whycantphiligetawoman</Username><Timestamp>1348225500632</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 07:05:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>DNC Literally in Hock to SEIU DNC owes millions to union-owned bank, records show Debbie Wasserman Schultz / AP Debbie Wasserman Schultz / AP BY: Andrew Stiles September 21, 2012 2:10 pm The Democratic National Committee (DNC) owes at least $8 million to a bank owned by one of the largest unions in the country, according to the committee’s most recent financial report. The DNC initiated an $8 million loan with the Amalgamated Bank of New York on Aug. 10, the report shows, accounting for the majority of the committee’s overall debt of $11 million. Amalgamated Bank, often described as “America’s Labor Bank,” is a national entity, the majority of which is owned by the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), a politically active union with deep ties to the Democratic Party. The SEIU is also involved with the Democracy Alliance, a shadowy group of wealthy left-wing donors founded by billionaire investor George Soros. The bank announced in an August press release that the DNC had “moved its primary banking relationship” to Amalgamated Bank, which would handle the committee’s “day-to-day banking needs.” The DNC had previously done most of its banking with Bank of America, which helped finance the Democratic convention in Charlotte. DNC chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz hailed the transition to Amalgamated Bank, and noted the longstanding political and financial ties between the two organizations. The committee, she said, had a “fiduciary responsibility to those who invest in our party.” “It is critical that we honor their efforts to strengthen our infrastructure and build our organization by partnering with an institution that shares our commitment to standing with America’s working families and small businesses,” she said in a press release. The SEIU is one of the most active political interest groups in the country, and a top financial backer of the Democratic Party. The union has given at least $200 million in direct contributions to candidates and committees since 1990 and has spent at least $14 million on lobbying since 1998, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. The SEIU spent more than $80 million in 2008 in support of Obama and other Democratic candidates, an investment that has reaped numerous political dividends. Former SEIU president Andy Stern was the most frequent visitor to the White House in the first year of Obama’s presidency and was later nominated to serve on the Bowles-Simpson deficit commission. Stern was spotted poolside at a lavish Democracy Alliance summit in May held at the historic Biltmore Hotel near Miami. The group’s international president, Mary Kay Henry, sits on the Democracy Alliance (DA) board of directors. The DA funnels millions of dollars in secret donations to Democratic candidates and causes.

New York Times columnist David Brooks penned a devastating column entitled “Thurston Howell Romney,” in which he argued the GOP presidential nominee doesn’t understand America: “[Romney's] comment suggests a few things. First, it suggests that he really doesn’t know much about the country he inhabits. Who are these freeloaders? Is it the Iraq war veteran who goes to the V.A.? Is it the student getting a loan to go to college? Is it the retiree on Social Security or Medicare? “It suggests that Romney doesn’t know much about the culture of America.” Even archconservative Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol called Romney’s comments “arrogant and stupid”: “It’s worth recalling that a good chunk of the 47 percent who don’t pay income taxes are Romney supporters—especially of course seniors (who might well “believe they are entitled to heath care,” a position Romney agrees with), as well as many lower-income Americans (including men and women serving in the military) who think conservative policies are better for the country even if they’re not getting a tax cut under the Romney plan. So Romney seems to have contempt not just for the Democrats who oppose him, but for tens of millions who intend to vote for him.“ Republican candidates in competitive senate races also began to distance themselves from Romney. Even the ultrawealthy private equity CEO who hosted the fundraiser, who like Romney has shifted pension obligations onto the government and bankrupted companies while walking away with billions in profits, declined to rise to Romney’s defense. Who are the 47% of Americans Romney Attacked? They are probably not the moocher class that Romney envisioned when he made the comments. They are a diverse group and don’t pay federal income tax for a diverse set of reasons: Mostly, they are either too poor to qualify for even the lowest tax bracket (but still pay federal payroll tax, and state or local sales taxes, gas taxes, and excise taxes), or they benefit from tax credits for the working poor, the elderly, or students. Active duty military in combat zones Students Seniors – one in five of those that pay no federal income taxes are elderly. Working Americans – 61 percent have jobs and pay 15.3 percent of their income in payroll taxes Fully 83 percent of those paying no federal income taxes are either working or are elderly. As Ezra Klein noted, a good many of them appear to pay a higher share of their income in taxes than Mitt Romney himself: “Among the Americans who paid no federal income taxes in 2011, 61 percent paid payroll taxes — which means they have jobs and, when you account for both sides of the payroll tax, they paid 15.3 percent of their income in taxes, which is higher than the 13.9 percent that Romney paid.” The Atlantic points out that the 47% are more heavily concentrated in red states than blue ones: nonpayers.banner.taxfound.jpg BOTTOM LINE: We need a president of all Americans, not one who writes off nearly half of Americans – seniors, veterans,students, and working people – simply because he believes they are “entitled” “victims” who will “never” “take personal responsibility and care for their lives.”</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1348253468217</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 14:51:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348253721578-32</Id><Topic><Title>Increase your portfolio by checking out these guys right now.</Title><Username>danielshropshire975</Username><Timestamp>1348151260038</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 10:27:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Awesome site...</Msg><Username>nelsoneugene277</Username><Timestamp>1348253721578</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 14:55:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348254511040-33</Id><Topic><Title>“Thurston Howell Romney,”</Title><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1348253468217</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 14:51:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>David Brooks... just more Pigshyt from NY Times trash!

I know of AFH operators who operate 2 or 3 of them instead of running facilities under the "boarding home" law, where excemption of medicaid revenues isn't possible... just to exploit the loophole and maximize the associated tax-free income. Every AFH owner I know sympathizes with Romney's support of small businesses because they are heavily regulated and government hurts them in ways that go beyond what's necessary... ... but most of them support Obama for purely selfish reasons because they know that Romney/Ryan want to "broaden" the tax base by treating AFH owners as taxable entities just like everybody else who makes the money they do... and Obama only wants to tax the rich. I should also mention that Obama's tax-the-rich proposal would raise only $78 billion annually... or only about 1/17 of what is necessary to balance the budget. He has no proposals to balance the other 16/17 of the annual deficits. If it isn't factual, I won't say that it is... no matter what I'm discussing. Just like when I say that on our current trajectory, the U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio will pass that of Greece in 3 years... one year before the end of a 2nd, Obama term in office. Obama has almost no plans to change the current trajectory of our deficits except to tax the rich and re-distribute wealth.

Bush, Cheney, Rove and Rice if they were running a private company they would have bankrupted it and been marched away in cuffs. But then again bush did Bankrupt a firm here and there. There was a reason our economy is coming out of the worst recession in our lifetimes. "The Decider" had a significant hand in it. Let me ask you if a category 4 hurricane hit a major city in Texas especially the suburbs do you think there would be floating bodies in the streets and people trapped in and around a convention center for 3 to 7 days?
