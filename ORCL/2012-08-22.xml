The Democratic National Committee has informed a Connecticut town it will not be reimbursed for the thousands of dollars the city spent on costs for President Obama's fundraising visit earlier this month. Gordon Joseloff, the first selectman of Westport, says he was informed this week the town's request to have the DNC and Obama for America cover the $14,812 the city paid in police and fire overtime was denied. The president traveled to the area on Aug. 6 to attend a fundraiser in Stamford and a $35,800 per person dinner at the Westport home of movie producer Harvey Weinstein. Local officials even shut down two popular public beaches to accommodate the president. They closed the 238-acre Sherwood Island State Park so the president's helicopter could land, and also closed the roughly two-acre Burying Hill Beach -- adjacent to Weinstein's mansion.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1345646754000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 10:45:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345646758000-16</Id><Topic><Title>How is it that the Pukes can remember</Title><Username>whycantphiligetawoman</Username><Timestamp>1345646216000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 10:36:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"all the way back to Jimmy Carter when talking about hard times in America,but they can't seem to remember that George W Bush,lied to everyone in America about Iraq,spent taxpayer money like a drunken soldier on leave,left the country economically bankrupt,created 3000 jobs in 8 years,and blame Obama for every problem facing America today?What's up with that?Are ALL Pukes just retarded like seebug,dumbassbuck,et al?

(NOT Bain Capital!)</Title><Msg>Team Obama makes more dubvious investments in our name! Obama Administration Averts Layoffs and $5+/Gallon Gas for Entire Northeast U.S. Before Election The latest in hypocrisy of the unprincipled leftwing kookery. The Obama administration has brokered a deal for private equity firm, the Carlyle Group, to buy a failing Philadelphia oil refinery, whose imminent closure by owner Sunoco Inc. threatened union layoffs and a spike in gasoline prices for the northeast U.S. just before the election. Carlyle will pay nothing for a majority stake but will contribute cash for an upgrade. To help seal the deal, the Obama administration has instructed the EPA to loosen compliance standards for environmental regulations on the refinery. The president of the United Steelworkers union said the union wouldn't have agreed to the deal if it had been Bain Capital across the table, though Bain boasts an 80% success rate of bringing failing companies back from the brink of closure. The White House (Gene Sperling, director of Mr. Obama's National Economic Council) hosted a call with the Sunoco CEO and Deputy Energy Secretary Dan Poneman. The White House confirmed the call. The group discussed the possibility of $5 gasoline prices for the summer. When the officials pressed him for a solution, the Sunoco CEO suggested that a joint venture with a partner that could contribute expertise and cash was the only option. Soon after, the White House (Sperling) called Carlyle co-CEO David M. Rubenstein (who worked in the Carter administration) and told him the White House was willing to help move the deal along. Of course, this is a good thing. Jobs will be saved and production of American energy will continue. But I am sure that the leftkook American media will villify Obama for his "Bain" connection. Not.

That’s because the starting point for the second dip would be our current weak economy, and this time, policymakers have little room to fix things. Consumers don’t have much fat to cut, either—they did that already—meaning families would have to “cut from the bone.” Other signs round two would be a doozy: Consumer spending hasn’t grown; industrial production is down 8% compared to December 2007; and while the civilian working-age population has grown about 3% since 2007, there are 5% fewer jobs for it. Interest rates can’t go lower than their current zero, and Washington lacks the financial and political means for another stimulus. Finally, “and perhaps most worrisome,” is the fact that the economy is smaller now than it was at the beginning of the recession. The only good news: Corporate profits have hit record highs, and the cash in corporations’ coffers could “act as a buffer to layoffs if demand drops.”</Msg><Username>g00dguyoooooooo1</Username><Timestamp>1345651096000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 11:58:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345651437000-34</Id><Title>Occupy Wall Street had RAPE TENTS!</Title><Msg>But only for "legitimate rapes".
