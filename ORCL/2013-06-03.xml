So what are we looking at here? The latest projections show the combined cost of Social Security and Medicare rising by a bit more than 3 percent of G.D.P. between now and 2035, and that number could easily come down with more effort on the health care front. Now, 3 percent of G.D.P. is a big number, but it’s not an economy-crushing number. The United States could, for example, close that gap entirely through tax increases, with no reduction in benefits at all, and still have one of the lowest overall tax rates in the advanced world. But haven’t all the great and the good been telling us that Social Security and Medicare as we know them are unsustainable, that they must be totally revamped — and made much less generous? Why yes, they have; they’ve also been telling us that we must slash spending right away or we’ll face a Greek-style fiscal crisis. They were wrong about that, and they’re wrong about the longer run, too. The truth is that the long-term outlook for Social Security and Medicare, while not great, actually isn’t all that bad. It’s time to stop obsessing about how we’ll pay benefits to retirees in 2035 and focus instead on how we’re going to provide jobs to unemployed Americans in the here and now</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1370267546874</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-03 09:52:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370268519411-11</Id><Topic><Title>GGCO looks prime for a breakout</Title><Username>cdylan968</Username><Timestamp>1370266954859</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-03 09:42:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I will take a look at this.</Msg><Username>mcdonaldxavier549</Username><Timestamp>1370268519411</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-03 10:08:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370268544379-12</Id><Topic><Title>why the IRS was reduced to using inappropriate shortcuts</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1370183916064</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-02 10:38:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Incredibly stupid Dem logic (he got you, too, Seeburg!).

They get one in a position of authority and then start hiring their buddies. I worked at a large public inst. that was full of them. Many were incompetant. As soon as I had enough time to get a small pension I got out. I knew of several fake marriages betyween men and women to try and hide the fact of what they were.
