I want you to locate using Interpol a VK Janaky and her son who has a property in the neighbourhood and for want of not giving it to their adopted daughter Sindhu, these criminals\ created a situation in a haphazard manner to trape me in a relation in 1991. This is the crime and they are dragging it for two decades. These criminals would want to portray me as a shcizophrenic or disabled. I dont want anything to do with anyone in akathethara or palakkad. Its shameless that the tech community is not giving me my money. I worked as an individual and was only disturbed by my mother and this sick cousin who had to depend on me. She and her frends and other criminals in the yoga hindu temple industry want to exploit the value of my labour and steal and eat theit food and feed their kids..the criminals bharat created a gate to gayathri where i visited in 2000 when i was working in bangalore. These criminals should have persuaded visalakshy to break up with me in 2000 itself, i would have never resigned from my position and settled in US. These criminals intention is to steal and eat and feed their progeny my multimillion dollar personal options. I hodl all the managers in SUN behind this crime. I am the first person to start aggressively start browsing and information retrieving in 1992 and this evolved into the WWW/tools and Information retrieval companies..I porposed a Single SignON project which can save millions of dollars in internet time and make it more efficient. The w3.org has not replied. Again these criminals want the hindutva to use and hurt me. I have nothing to do with any political parties..i am an individual who succeeded in tech book and want to enjoy a retired life. This crime cannot continue even for a second.. they cannot use people who line in valley of palakkad western ghtas to control the wealth created in a place like California ..My whole body is in pain because of lack of bodily comforts and these criminals want me to hear some drumming in temple..

Mitt Romney's lying on Medicare is beginning to make him sound, dare I say, pathologically unhinged. Never mind the fact checks and the other fact checks. Romney's got his fiction and is sticking to it: "Obama has cut $716 billion from Medicare. Why? To pay for Obamacare." We all know that Paul Ryan, in the budget Romney endorsed (last time I checked, anyway), included those exact same cuts to Medicare. And none of those cuts actually hit beneficiaries. They rein in the huge amount of taxpayer money going to overpayments in the Republican-created (and not paid for) Medicare Advantage program. So, you could almost commend Ryan for seeing where it makes sense to cut Medicare. Almost. But of course, Ryan just couldn't leave it at that, because that isn't going to destroy Medicare, the GOP's ultimate aim. What's going to destroy Medicare is his voucher plan. That would hurt seniors, forcing them to pay more and more out of pocket as the value of the vouchers decreases. That's what would happen in the future with Ryan's and Romney's Medicare plan. But what they really don't want to talk about is the cuts to seniors right now Ryan proposes by slashing Medicaid, which would happen immediately. The $800 billion in cuts over the next decade that Ryan proposes would have to end up hurting the six million seniors who rely on the program for nursing home and long-term care—two-thirds of all nursing home patients in the U.S. are covered by Medicaid. Cynically, Ryan made these dramatic cuts to Medicaid so that he could spare current Medicare retirees from seeing cuts, and could put off their pain—and their opposition—for at least a while. Rep. Henry Waxman (D-CA) nailed Ryan on this ploy: "They care about the votes of seniors who are not poor and they don’t care about the votes and the consequences to seniors who are poor." Expect this to be one of those things that's off-limits to talk about. Mitt's running for president, for Pete's sake. That means you can't talk about what he stands for or what he'd do as president. You can't talk about him, or Ryan, at all</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1345123822000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 09:30:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345124174000-16</Id><Topic><Title>Obama cut $716 Billion from Medicare....</Title><Username>central_scrutinizer_fz</Username><Timestamp>1345045560000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 11:46:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>We all know that Paul Ryan, in the budget Romney endorsed (last time I checked, anyway), included those exact same cuts to Medicare.

A business owner is showing his disapproval of the President. The sign is hanging next to Additive Systems, Inc. on Main Street in B.A. It says "'We' built this business without gov't. help. Obama can kiss our a**." It goes on to say, "I'm Bob Roggendorff and I approve this message." While our crew was on scene, a man pulled over just to get a picture of it. "I was just driving by, saw it, kind of stuck out, figured I might as well take a picture for myself," says John. "It's pro-American, anti-Obama." We tried contacting Roggendorff in person and via phone, but have not heard back from him.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1345126219000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 10:10:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345126291000-21</Id><Topic><Title>Win For The Left Is Crucial and Obama Can't Do It</Title><Username>dropkickuuuuuu</Username><Timestamp>1345125547000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 09:59:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/today-day_650058.html</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1345126291000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 10:11:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345126515000-22</Id><Topic><Title>Win For The Left Is Crucial and Obama Can't Do It</Title><Username>dropkickuuuuuu</Username><Timestamp>1345125547000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 09:59:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I agree most of America has had enough.

The company is once again losing market share, and it seems unable to develop products that are truly competitive in the U.S. market. Right now, the federal government owns 500,000,000 shares of GM, or about 26% of the company. It would need to get about $53.00/share for these to break even on the bailout, but the stock closed at only $20.21/share on Tuesday. This left the government holding $10.1 billion worth of stock, and sitting on an unrealized loss of $16.4 billion!"</Msg><Username>econ_meister</Username><Timestamp>1345132308000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 11:51:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345132481000-31</Id><Topic><Title>Am I dreaming?</Title><Username>beryldbi991</Username><Timestamp>1345127990000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 10:39:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>We are the makers of music and the dreamers of dreams.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1345132481000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 11:54:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345132568000-32</Id><Topic><Title>Obama Can Not Cut It</Title><Username>whycantphilgetawoman</Username><Timestamp>1345126041000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 10:07:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>When a guy has an ERA of 12, bats .140 and has 100 errors, you send him to the minors. *** When a team is losing, they fire the manager.

Paul Ryan (R-WI) has taken to the campaign trail and begun viciously attacking the record of running mate and former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney. Within hours of joining the GOP ticket Saturday, Ryan went on the offensive against the GOP candidate, and he has continued to cast him as a “pro-abortion crusader” and “shameless political chameleon” in stump speeches throughout Wisconsin, Iowa, and Colorado. At town hall meetings and fundraising events, Ryan has repeatedly referred to Romney’s governorship as “disastrous,” even going so far as to warn voters that the Republican candidate was an unreliable and dangerous choice for president.&gt;&gt; http://www.theonion.com/articles/ryan-begins-attacking-romneys-record-as-massachuse,29179/</Msg><Username>nazyoyo</Username><Timestamp>1345133322000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 12:08:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345133603000-34</Id><Topic><Title>DC shooter is a rightwing NRA and</Title><Username>whycantphiligetawoman</Username><Timestamp>1345129748000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 11:09:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>wrong as usual phil. http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/Security-Guard-Shooting-chickfila/2012/08/16/id/448772</Msg><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1345133603000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 12:13:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345133902000-35</Id><Topic><Title>Obama's GM Back On The Cliff!!

They just want to examine his returns so that they find something they think is questionable and hammer him with it.</Msg><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1345142893000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 14:48:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345142946000-67</Id><Topic><Title>Unabashedly shameless, Obama is</Title><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1345140862000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 14:14:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>that's kind of how the other half of the nation felt when Bush said "Mission Accomplished" "Bring it on" "The economy is fundamentally sound" "I'm the decider"............. and who can forget 5ick Cheney "Deficits don't matter"</Msg><Username>kollesteral</Username><Timestamp>1345142946000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 14:49:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345143144000-68</Id><Topic><Title>Romney talks about his taxes</Title><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1345142893000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 14:48:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>right wingers ought to pay for the wars they feel we all need to "protect our freedom" 13% tax for a guy making millions and advocaing for more spending in the military? no wonder we have such a deficit.</Msg><Username>kollesteral</Username><Timestamp>1345143144000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 14:52:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345143268000-69</Id><Topic><Title>Unabashedly shameless, Obama is</Title><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1345140862000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 14:14:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Gee...
