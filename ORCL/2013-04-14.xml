If you substitute the chained CPI for the current formula, as the President has proposed, people will be kicked into higher tax brackets earlier. Then they’ll pay more in taxes, even if they’re not making any more “real” money. That’s a tax hike. And it’s a tax hike for everybody but the wealthy. The richest earnings won’t be affected because they’re already in the highest tax bracket. You could save much more money in other, better ways. The White House has said the chained CPI will save $122 billion in benefits over ten years. Leaving aside the fact that Social Security doesn’t affect the deficit .. here’s what isn’t being done: Close capital gains loopholes: $174 billion. End the Bush tax cuts at Obama’s original $250,000 level, rather than the compromise $400,000 number: $183 billion. Cut overseas military bases by 20 percent: $200 billion. Negotiate with drug companies: $220 billion. Enact “Defense-friendly” Pentagon cuts: $519 billion. End corporate tax loopholes (without being “revenue neutral,” as the President’s proposing): $1.24 trillion. Enact a financial transaction tax on the folks who ruined our economy: $1.8 trillion. from 10 “Chained CPI” Facts The White House Doesn’t Want You to Know By Richard Eskow |</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1365947132762</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 09:45:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365947322155-9</Id><Topic><Title>You love abortion which has destroyed more lives than all wars//TYPICAL REPUB!

The opportunity costs of this Pentagon . . . (1) improved education - Testing scores have decreased every year since we got teachers unions and a Federal Department of Education. Spending more federal $$$ will make things worse. (2) healthcare - You already complain that the USA spends TOO MUCH on health care! (In total &amp; per capita!) How much more do you want to spend? (3) jobs - Obama would rather play golf, go on vacation and have aristocratic live music nights at tax payers expense. We've had the longest period of high unemployment, ever, in the BLS data set, since 1948 all because of Obama's &amp; the Democrat's bad policies. If American's wanted jobs they should have voted for Romney! When Obama DOES anything for jobs it focuses on UNION jobs, a small portion of the employment market. Which is why the problem persists! (4) rebuilding our infrastructure - I thought we did that with our First &amp; Second "Stimulus Plans" Over One trillion $ together. So why do we still need to "rebuild infrastructure"? It is obviously a ruse to get more money for temporary UNION jobs! (5) addressing climate change - Surely you jest! WE (the USA) are not the biggest problem in "climate change" anymore! The biggest problems are India &amp; China! Let the biggest polluters "address climate change"! (Assuming we even agree that there is "climate change.")</Msg><Username>bullwinkle.themoose</Username><Timestamp>1365974138879</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 17:15:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365975290261-42</Id><Topic><Title>Alaskans twice as likely to get killed with a gun as New Yorkers</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1365948398542</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 10:06:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Lets see... Alaska has a population of about 731,000 people, so 7.31 X 20.3 =~ 148 gun deaths. Clearly a more "wild west" &amp; "pioneer" state than the rest of America. They have about 1.2 persons per square mile of Alaska, which I am sure is the lowest pop per sq mile in USA. I guess they don't see 148 gun deaths per year as a big problem. Alaska ALSO has highest rate per 100,000 of dogs killing humans than the rest of the USA. The problem is they allow their sled dogs to run free in the woods all summer because they don't want to bother feeding them. Sometimes the humans get killed &amp; eaten when they try to collect the dogs again in the fall! LOL! If New York was so low in gun related deaths why does Mayor Bloomberg have such a bee in his bonnet about guns? And why did Gov Coumo need to rush to be first to pass an ill conceived gun control law? This just highlights that liberals are full of #$%$. Both are trying to solve a non-problem for NY State &amp; City!</Msg><Username>bullwinkle.themoose</Username><Timestamp>1365975290261</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 17:34:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365976156931-43</Id><Title>bullwinkle.themoose signed IDIOT Can ya UNDERSTAND what PER CAPITA means?</Title><Msg>I don't think ya can</Msg><Username>dropkickpubs4321</Username><Timestamp>1365976156931</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 17:49:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365976300257-44</Id><Topic><Title>The total “national security budget,” costs $1 trillion per year</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1365967878548</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 15:31:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>All started this badly with bgroup and nearly as badly with idiot reagun</Msg><Username>dropkickpubs4321</Username><Timestamp>1365976300257</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 17:51:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365976956428-45</Id><Topic><Title>Alaskans twice as likely to get killed with a gun as New Yorkers</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1365948398542</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 10:06:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>this is just a fact , all your stupid blather and ignorance does not change it: "As of 2010, Alaska had the worst gun death rate in the nation—20.3 deaths per 100,000 people, almost twice the national norm of 10.3 deaths per 100,000 people."</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1365976956428</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 18:02:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365977502282-46</Id><Topic><Title>bullwinkle.themoose signed IDIOT Can ya UNDERSTAND what PER CAPITA means?</Title><Username>dropkickpubs4321</Username><Timestamp>1365976156931</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 17:49:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>dupes like him buy the nra lie that more guns = less gun violence. it is kinda funny that the rednecks gun nuts kill themselves at the highest per capita rates in lilly white #$%$ states like Alaska, Wyoming , Montana, Arizona, Alabama and so forth...........those are the states with the most guns per capita and the weakest gun laws.... and yep.... the most gun killings per capita...........at the opposite end are states with tough gun laws and fewer guns and states like new York, new jersey and Massachusetts have less than HALF the percapita gun killing rate as the states like Alaska.</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1365977502282</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 18:11:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365982611989-47</Id><Title>it is kinda funny that the rednecks gun nuts kill themselves at the highest per capita rates in lilly white #$%$ states like Alaska,</Title><Msg>It's proof positive that in actuality gun DON'T make things safer as a rule</Msg><Username>dropkickpubs4321</Username><Timestamp>1365982611989</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 19:36:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365987565506-48</Id><Topic><Title>Alaskans twice as likely to get killed with a gun as New Yorkers</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1365948398542</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 10:06:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>More Pigshyt mesa! I know, you love it! This is from the Alaska Dispatch... and BTW, the higher homicide and suicide rates are driven by the Intuits, not Rednecks... you stupid Putz! Alaska homicide rate dropping!! And yet, the Alaska homicide rate for 2011, the latest year for which figures are available, was 4 per 100,000 people. That's significantly lower than the 6.4 per 100,000 people for New York City, where Mayor Michael Bloomberg likes to brag about how many guns the New York Police Department has taken away from the citizenry, and about a fifth of the homicide rate for Chicago (19.4 per 100,000), a city with stringent gun control that has been labeled the world's "Deadliest Global City." But none of that really concerns the question that begs an answer. If guns in and of themselves are evil, if more guns means people are more likely to kill other people, why does the death toll for Alaska "firearms homicides" stand at 2.6 per 100,000? Actually, the number is probably lower than that now. The data on specifically how people kill each other -- with guns, knifes, beatings -- dates to 2004, and the Alaska homicide rate has fallen about 25 percent since then. But suffice to say, fewer than half the people killed in homicides in Alaska are killed with a gun. The state's gun-homicide rate is a low number. At 2.6, your odds of being shot and killed in Alaska are lower than your odds of being murdered in the European principality of Liechtenstein (2.8 per 100,000) and about the same as your odds for being murdered in Luxembourg (2.5 per 100,000). Neither country is known as a hotbed of violent crime. The real question is why is death by firearm so much more prevalent in major U.S. cities, most of which have made it harder for people to legally obtain guns than in the Wild West of Alaska? Wouldn't you think that given gun control in those places, the ratio of knife, beating and other deaths would increase in proportion to gun deaths?</Msg><Username>moveon_moveoutnow</Username><Timestamp>1365987565506</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 20:59:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365987833714-49</Id><Topic><Title>it is kinda funny that the rednecks gun nuts kill themselves at the highest per capita rates in lilly white #$%$ states like Alaska,</Title><Username>dropkickpubs4321</Username><Timestamp>1365982611989</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 19:36:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What's funny is your endless posting of PC Pigshyt!
