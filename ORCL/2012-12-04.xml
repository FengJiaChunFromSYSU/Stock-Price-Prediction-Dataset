Simply put, President Obama has been threatening for years to punish capitalism with high taxes on those who provide and deploy investment capital into the U.S. The special dividends are simply a final, low-tax distribution to shareholders before the dark ages of U.S. investment sets in... ... probably accompanied by low growth, high un-employment, and minimal capital investment that is so characteristic of the countries that have followed the path of socialism and wealth re-distribution before us. We saw just the opposite in 1997, as Bill Clinton worked with the new, GOP dominated congress to lower capital gains taxes and unleash a torrent of tax revenues that grew the economy, minimized unemployment and balanced the budget. Obama's anti-capitalism crusade of punishing the sources of those same revenue streams should be expected to produce the exact opposite result. As for the special dividends themselves, under better presidential leadership, the companies paying these dividends might be expected to RETAIN those earnings and invest them into new american industry and more american jobs. I would contend that it isn't just getting under the wire on the 15% dividend tax that's driving the torrent of special dividends... but also the fact that many american companies simply don't see growth opportunities in the U.S. over the next 4 years, so they may as well return the money to shareholders to ship offshore or dive into bonds and gold. Socialism is a harsh lesson for countries to learn about in this way... but few american citizens truly understand what they're doing when a 20-something votes for Obama because he saw him on TV with Justin Bieber... ... Mr. Obama was highly reliant on such voters to NOT have an understanding of what his main supporters... Hugo Chavez and Raul Castro... had done to their countries before Mr. Obama set his sites on doing likewise to ours.

Mr. Obama thinks that isn't fair. His proposals would jack them up well over 40% of total revenues. Currently, the bottom 47% pay no federal income taxes. Mr. Obama thinks that's fair but has said that he would like to exempt half of all americans from contributing anything... presumably the half that votes him into office. When the 47% were highlighted, the left screamed that they pay FICA (social security insurance)... so the "employee's" portion of FICA was reduced from 6.2% to 4.2%... while the EMPLOYER'S half of FICA was left at 6.2%. Mr. Obama think's it's fair that the employer pay for 60% of their employee's social security (yes, Virginia, they built that TOO). Currently, dividends are taxed at a max of 15% after the corporate earnings they are attributed to are taxed at a max of 35%... for a total of 50% tax on those earnings. Mr. Obama thinks that's unfair and want's the dividends taxed at 39.6% plus the obamacare tax of 3.8%... ... that would make the total tax paid on corporate earnings distributed as dividends taxed at a rate of 78.4%... Incredibly, Mr. Obama think's that is "fair". Mr. Obama says daily that the wealthy should pay "just a LITTLE bit more"... ... I guess TRIPPLING the dividend tax is "just a little bit"... and, in Mr. Obama's eye's, it's "fair".
