Exports are not benefitting from a weak dollar -- trade is slowing because the rest of the world is broke and in recession. Equity markets have been inflated on helium for the last 3 years. The Chinese stock market, where economic growth is supposedly the fastest in the world, has been dropping for 3 years. Does this make any sense? The Fed has entered a global arms race aimed at devaluing currency under the auspices of monetary stimulus. Since these currencies are measured against one another and global growth continues to be weak, the relative value of the dollar is unlikely to drop much through this whole process. In essence, by acting in concert, central banks around the world are providing stimulus and attempting to weaken their currencies to strengthen equity and manufacturing export markets, but since everyone is doing the same thing, we are basically treading water. The ultimate outcome to this coordinated global stimulus is that markets are more dependent than ever on central bank action. Same as 1952. A Romney win will stop QE and will end the recession which started this summer in the USA by next Spring. The velocity of money is at its lowest point since records have been kept and the Fed's own data demonstrates that credit markets are only operating at a quarter the volume they were at in 2007. So the next big moves will have to be an effort to get money moving around the system faster. Investors should look for opportunities to buy in industries and emerging businesses where freer capital and access to cheap credit will increase profit margins dramatically. Obama has stagnated the economy. America has become a nation of lazy people whining for more handouts.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1349011750361</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-30 09:29:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349012147929-5</Id><Topic><Title>why wouldn't they hate USA “imperialism,” as it used to be called?</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1348932118550</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 11:21:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No, we just murder the democratically elected, as we did in Iran (and elsewhere) and install a dictatator like the shaw.... and we supported other dictators like like Saddam or monacrhs, and so forth, murdering and meddling. and sure, according to you, we do this for the good of the people you hate ,the 100s of millions of muslims in the region..... just like we saved Nepal from the communist chinese......right? why, we only murdered 100's of thousands of innocent men, women and children in the mid east to make their lives better, and the $ trillions we have paid and the thousands of our own troops sacrificed had nothing to do with oil, it all about giving the locals good government., right?

Only in Venezuela could violent street gangs and a former U.S. president be on the same team. According to sources in Miraflores palace, about two months ago, Chávez began refusing cancer treatment and check-ups, insisting that returning to the campaign trail would invigorate him. In recent weeks, as doctors warned, this dangerous decision has taken a terrible toll. Watch Hugo's behavior for clues of what Obama might do if he feels desperate. They're cut from the same cloth. Jimmy Carter is campaigning for Chavez. Chávez is taking steps to ensure that the international community accepts his victory, no matter what the outcome. In this, he is counting on former President Jimmy Carter and retired governor and Clinton Cabinet member Bill Richardson. On Sept.11, Carter described Venezuela’s electoral system “as the best in the world." Better than the corrupt US system Jimmy?</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1349012599475</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-30 09:43:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349012711021-8</Id><Topic><Title>Obama weak dollar policies rob Americans</Title><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1349011750361</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-30 09:29:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>They don’t care, they all want obama bucks!

The program is called Lifeline, established in 1984, originally created to subsidize landline phone service for low income Americans, funded by government-collected telecommunication fees, paid by consumers. In 2008, the program was expanded to support cell phones which quickly escalated the cost of the program. In 2008 the program cost $772 million, but by 2011 it cost $1.6 billion. A 2011 audit found that 269,000 wireless Lifeline subscribers were receiving free phones and monthly service from two or more carriers. Several websites have been created to promote “free” government cell phones, including the”The Obama Cell Phone” website at Obamaphone.net. Rep. Tim Griffin R-Ark. has proposed a bill to eliminate federal subsidies for free cell phones and has produced a great YouTube video highlighting the runaway cost of the program. The program has also been highlighted for reform by Senator Claire McCaskill D-Mo.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1349015430592</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-30 10:30:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349015465100-17</Id><Title>Mitt's jobs plan.........for china</Title><Msg>WASHINGTON -- Sensata Technologies is a healthy manufacturing company that employs nearly 200 workers at a factory in northern Illinois.
