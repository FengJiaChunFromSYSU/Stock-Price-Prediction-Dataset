Not only is Obama leading Romney, but the George Washington University poll also found that small business owners thought President Obama was more supportive of them than Mitt Romney by 39%-31% margin, with 28% undecided. 6,415 small business owners were asked what their single most important issue was in their choice for president. Forty percent of them responded the economy and jobs. Fourteen percent listed corruption/honesty/ethics in government, six percent responded social/moral issues, and five percent said it was beating Romney/supporting Obama/electing Democrats. Obamacare, beating Obama/electing Romney/supporting Republicans, and the budget deficit all tied at 5%. Two staples of the Romney campaign, taxes was mentioned by 3%, and government regulation was not mentioned at all. The three most important issues to small business owners were unemployment and the job market (26%), the federal budget deficit (16%), and healthcare costs (10%). Small business owners listed self-employment taxes, the cost of gas, healthcare costs, and personal income taxes to be the biggest burdens. President Obama has cut taxes for small businesses anywhere from 16 to 18 times depending on how a small business tax cut is defined. In contrast Mitt Romney came up with a slogan, but the benefits of his tax plan are designed for corporations and people at the top. Romney’s plan would give the biggest corporations a $1 trillion tax cut. . 0users liked this posts0users disliked this posts Reply</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1348148872787</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 09:47:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348149757238-10</Id><Title>speaking of mooches and shirkers</Title><Msg>Bushcare at the ER was done by Reagan and the gop senate, btw: Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA)[1] is a U.S. Act of Congress passed in 1986 It requires hospitals to provide care to anyone needing emergency healthcare treatment regardless of citizenship, legal status or ability to pay.

Obama is heard speaking at a university conference in October 1998, appearing to endorse "redistribution" of wealth. "I actually believe in redistribution, at least at a certain level, to make sure that everybody's got a shot," Obama is heard saying on the clip, which then abruptly ends. In the full recording, obtained by NBC News, Obama continues to explain in the next sentence that he is speaking broadly about making city and state government more efficient in their use of resources - and endorses "competition" in the "marketplace." "How do we pool resources at the same time as we decentralize delivery systems in ways that both foster competition, can work in the marketplace, and can foster innovation at the local level and can be tailored to particular communities," he says. The edit of the last line out of the clip earned Romney and the Republican National Committee a "four pinocchios" rating by fact checkers at the Washington Post.</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1348163460972</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 13:51:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348163518017-32</Id><Topic><Title>Increase your portfolio by checking out these guys right now.</Title><Username>danielshropshire975</Username><Timestamp>1348151260038</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 10:27:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>lol.

Interestingly, as the Washington Free Beacon notes, just yesterday Kaine released an ad that suggested he's to the right of President Obama on the issue of taxes. Kaine says in ad, “President Obama wants the Bush tax cuts to expire for people earning over $250,000; George Allen wants to make all the tax cuts permanent. There’s a middle ground. Let the tax cuts expire for those earning over $500,000.” But the position articulated by Kaine in today's debate is new. Currently, Kaine has a slight leader over Allen in the race. According to the RealClearPolitics average of polls, Kaine has 48.6 percent of the vote to Allen's 44.2 percent.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1348166798703</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 14:46:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348167264241-41</Id><Title>Re: Clueless Or Plain Lying</Title><Msg>Why have these attacks on embassies started now.

GAAP new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions revenues were up 5% to $1.6 billion, while non-GAAP new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions revenues were up 6% to $1.6 billion. Both GAAP and non-GAAP software license updates and product support revenues were up 3% to $4.1 billion. Both GAAP and non-GAAP hardware systems products revenues were down 24% to $779 million. GAAP operating income was up 7% to $2.9 billion, and GAAP operating margin was 35%. Non-GAAP operating income was up 1% to $3.6 billion, and non-GAAP operating margin was 44%. GAAP net income was up 11% to $2.0 billion, while non-GAAP net income was up 6% to $2.6 billion. GAAP earnings per share were $0.41, up 15% compared to last year while non-GAAP earnings per share were up 11% to $0.53. GAAP operating cash flow on a trailing twelve-month basis was $14.0 billion, up 9% compared to last year. Without the impact of the US dollar strengthening compared to foreign currencies, Oracle’s reported Q1 GAAP earnings per share would have been $0.03 higher at $0.44, up 24%, and Q1 non-GAAP earnings per share would have been $0.03 higher at $0.56, up 17%. Both GAAP and non-GAAP total revenues also would have been up 3%, GAAP new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions revenues would have been up 10%, non-GAAP new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions revenues would have been up 11% and both GAAP and non-GAAP hardware systems products revenues would have been down 21%. “On a non-GAAP basis, new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions sales grew 11% in constant currency and operating margin increased to 44% in Q1,” said Oracle President and CFO, Safra Catz. “Q1 operating cash flow increased to a record high of $5.7 billion. We’re off to a good start in the new year.” “Exadata, Exalogic, Exalytics and our other engineered systems grew more than 100% in the quarter,” said Oracle President, Mark Hurd. “For the full year, we expect to double engineered systems sales to well over $1 billion. Oracle’s new cloud business is also approaching a $1 billion annual run rate. These two businesses will drive Oracle’s growth for years to come.” “A little more than a week from now we will announce lots of enhancements to the Oracle Cloud,” said Oracle CEO, Larry Ellison. “There are more CRM, ERP and HCM applications as a service, and more Oracle database, Java and social network platform services. Our new infrastructure as a service is available in the Oracle Cloud and as a private cloud in our customers’ data center, with the unique ability to move applications and services back and forth between the two. Join us at Oracle OpenWorld for all the details.” The Board of Directors also declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.06 per share of outstanding common stock. This dividend will be paid to stockholders of record as of the close of business on October 12, 2012, with a payment date of November 2, 2012.

If the report were great, it would have bumped at close instead of falling. A miss is a miss on sales, its pps should reflect growth that isn't happening and the chart is inflated. Ambiguous, i think it needed a real beat to hold this pps. So, yes, short, it needed a more clear signal to hold up after its run, too little too late. Mcd had profit beats but questions about growth which sent it down 10%. We are likely to see something like this here. depends on how the media sees this. It is a miss, not a beat, but they are becoming more profitable with less revenue. Scary long, how much can a company tighten its belt after it just figured out how to squeeze an extra 11% out of a turnip. I say short, but don't bet the farm, wait to go hard short until it is clear the market is reaching a frothy top, which may be forming here soon.</Msg><Username>shakagenghis</Username><Timestamp>1348178482922</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 18:01:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348178798354-84</Id><Title>Longs are stuck with ORCL</Title><Msg>manipulation</Msg><Username>drhollars</Username><Timestamp>1348178798354</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 18:06:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348178948299-85</Id><Topic><Title>TIME to SHORT this CRAP</Title><Username>drhollars</Username><Timestamp>1348177358865</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 17:42:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Market goes up on bad news.

Replacing the 50 stars with his mug. Taking a page from Mao and Saddam? It won't be long til we see bigger than life size murals across building and bridges. His Mission Accomplished. Americans have to stop being complacent. Many Germans in WWII lost their homes, businesses and sent to concentration camps when they realized what was happening and spoke out but it was too late. History does not emphasize the millions of Germans who were against Hitler and lost everything. People are losing everything here, now. Not due to the same reasons in Germany but of being unaware of the damage being inflicted and the suffering we're headed for because of this Pres's agenda. He is weakening America, he is inviting more unrest and terror, even within our own country.</Msg><Username>passthebuckaroo</Username><Timestamp>1348199234754</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 23:47:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348199314101-112</Id><Topic><Title>What The?</Title><Username>passthebuckaroo</Username><Timestamp>1348199234754</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 23:47:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Repubs are so full of s.
