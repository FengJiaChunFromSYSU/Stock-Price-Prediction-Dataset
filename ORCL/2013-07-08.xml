Doctors have warned that continuing the pregnancy will be dangerous for the 11-year-old’s health, as well as for the health of her fetus. But, under Chile’s total abortion ban, she is forced to continue it anyway. The young girl is now 14 weeks pregnant. Her mother’s boyfriend has confessed to sexually abusing the child over the past two years, and is now in custody.</Msg><Username>hydroponicoctopus</Username><Timestamp>1373293357890</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-08 10:22:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373294335614-12</Id><Title>Fun Obama Facts: For every 1 Job created....</Title><Msg>75 people ended up on Food Stamps!

It's likely to show more consumers have taken out loans for autos and other major purchases. Friday's jobs report was better than expected. U.S. employers have added an average 202,000 jobs for the past six months, up from 180,000 in the previous six. June's jobs gain was fueled by consumer spending and the housing recovery. The consumer economy is showing more signs of flashing green. Consumer confidence has reached a five-year high.

A Joint Statement by Episcopal, Lutheran, Presbyterian, Roman Catholic and United Methodist Leaders As you did it to one of the least of these who are members of my family, you did it to me. Matthew 25:4 We speak as bishops and Christian leaders in North Carolina about the moral issues highlighted by the Moral Monday events. Our call to speak grows out of these words that we prayed together at our meeting on June 6: “May we be a more vivid symbol of unity to all the faithful. May the witness of our lives proclaim the Kingdom of God.” As you may know, people have been gathering on Monday evenings to offer vigilant witness on moral issues being considered by our elected state officials. We share their concern for many of the issues they are bringing forth. The Rev. Dr. Rodney Sadler of Union Seminary (Charlotte) recently summarized the effect of pending and enacted legislation especially on the poor, the aging and children. "As you read this letter, the North Carolina General Assembly is passing bills that will remove 500,000 people from the Medicaid roles leaving them without health insurance; that will remove 170,000 people from unemployment when unemployment rates remain at historically high levels; that threaten to replace the graduated state income tax with a consumption tax that will adversely impact the poorest North Carolinians who will face increased prices on basic goods; that will force college students to return to their often distant homes to vote or cost their parents their $2,500 dependency deduction…. These and many other bills will adversely impact those who can least afford it and therefore demand a fervent response from people of faith!

How Republicans Quietly Mandate Transvaginal Probes When They Think No One’s Paying Attention By Tara Culp-Ressler on Feb 7, 2013 at 1:50 pm Example of a transvaginal ultrasound procedure During the height of last year’s outcry over the GOP’s “War on Women,” transvaginal probes became one of the most recognizable symbols of the Republican Party’s overreaching anti-abortion policies. Particularly when Virginia pushed forward with a controversial measure to require all women seeking abortions to undergo a transvaginal ultrasound, women’s health advocates decried the practice as “state-sponsored rape.” Virginia legislators ultimately changed the language of their ultrasound bill to remove the mention of transvaginal probes. But stringent abortion restrictions don’t necessarily need specific “transvaginal” language to force women to undergo invasive, unnecessary medical procedures against their will. These are just a few examples of carefully-worded abortion bills that would ultimately require transvaginal probes — even though it’s not explicitly stated in the leg</Msg><Username>hydroponicoctopus</Username><Timestamp>1373301646589</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-08 12:40:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373302402259-39</Id><Title>anti abortionists wanted to force 11 yr old to birth a rapists fetus, a fetus is so deformed it had no brain</Title><Msg>pregnant with a foetus having nearly no brain and no skull, and scalp; blind, deaf, unconscious . the government of Ireland attempted prevent her getting abortion of a fetus that would die anyway........

Do you realize that here in North America there are about 2600 sects of Christianity, with the Roman Catholic sect being by far the largest. There are some sects that are as small as one or a few families. If they post opinions on the internet it does not mean all of Christendom endorses it. And here in North America they are free to publish thier opinion on the internet if they wish to.</Msg><Username>wearelegion100000</Username><Timestamp>1373336523931</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-08 22:22:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373336645887-67</Id><Topic><Title>It is silly to argue that it is OK to kill it because it is not human.

It is well known that Democrats and their "progressive" global allies (most of which are enemies to America) sabotaged the economy in 2008 to get Barack Obama elected. They have since discovered that it is lots easier to sabotage an economy than it is to heal it again. Especially when your "progressive" policies are clueless and inept. Barack Obama STILL has the worst employment record in the history of the BLS data going back to 1948. It's been so long that most people in America no longer remember what a good economy was!</Msg><Username>wearelegion100000</Username><Timestamp>1373337806422</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-08 22:43:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373338437384-74</Id><Topic><Title>Hydroponicsenema says we need 53 million murdered in genocide</Title><Username>wearelegion100000</Username><Timestamp>1373297753712</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-08 11:35:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Commies are good at mass murder.

PRESIDENT, BARACK OBAMA, SIR! For the your failed economic policies and the failed economics policies of the Democrats who totally controlled Congress from Jan-2007 to Jan-2011, and continue to control the Senate &amp; Presidency since. Do you realize that the last national budget that was passed, was passed by the Republican controlled Congress and expired in Oct-2011. Now follow this.... The Democrats take over all of Congress in Jan-2011. The national budget expires and they refuse to pass a new one. All they are into is tax &amp; spend, and spend, and spend. And a Great Recession supposedly foloows in Dec-2011... But it is all Bush's fault? All the Democrats have done since is spend &amp; spend &amp; spend while the Federal Reserve prints cash &amp; cash and cash and cash. And the economy stays a mess, people have run out 99 weeks of unemployment (the longest benefit period ever offered) and that's Bush's fault too! More people, and a higher percent of people, are in poverty than since the start of Lyndon Johnson's "Great Society" and "War on Poverty." More people than ever on Food Stamps (SNAPS.) Which PROVES that Liberal-Democrat policies for the last 45 years are TOTAL FAILURES! Then the UN does a study and finds that many American children are in poverty! We've had 46 years of failed, Liberal policies: WHAT DO YOU EXPECT? POOOLEASE!</Msg><Username>wearelegion100000</Username><Timestamp>1373338758609</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-08 22:59:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
