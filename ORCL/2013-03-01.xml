As CEPR’s Dean Baker and Will Kimball noted in a blog post yesterday, “The purchasing power of the minimum wage peaked in the late 1960s at $9.22 an hour in 2012 dollars. That is almost two dollars above the current level of $7.25 an hour.” They also noted that the minimum wage has not kept pace with productivity increases over the past 44 years, as it had from 1947-1969 – a period when economic “[g]rowth averaged 4.0 percent annually” and “the unemployment rate for the year 1969 averaged less than 4.0 percent.” But the link between productivity growth and minimum wage ended in the 1970s. Baker and Kimball note that “If the minimum wage had kept pace with productivity growth it would be $16.54 in 2012 dollars.”</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1362145473530</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 08:44:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362146043752-10</Id><Title>the avg min wage worker is 35yrs old. 43% have some college,10% are college grads,80% are HS grads or above</Title><Msg>Between 1979 and 2011, the average age of low-wage workers increased 2.6 years, from 32.3 to 34.9. The rise in the average age reflects a big drop in the share of low-wage workers who are teenagers – from over one-in-four (26.0 percent) in 1979 to less than one-in-eight (12.0 percent) in 2011. Over the same period, the representation of workers in the 25-to-34 and 35-to-64 age ranges both increased sharply. In 1979, workers 25-to-64 made up almost half (about 48 percent) of low-wage workers; by 2011, they were just over 60 percent. Meanwhile, the educational attainment of low-wage workers has also soared. The share of low-wage workers with less than a high schooldegree fell by half, from roughly 40 percent in 1979 to roughly 20 percent in 2011. At the same time, the share of low-wage workers with a high school degree increased, from 35.4 to 37.0 percent, and the share with some college education (but not a four-year degree) rose dramatically, from about one-in-five (19.5 percent) in 1979 to one-in-three (33.3 percent) in 2011. By 2011, almost one-tenth (9.9 percent) of low-wage workers had a four-year college degree or more, up from 5.7 percent in 1979 The Center for Economic and Policy Research ........</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1362146043752</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 08:54:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362146142271-11</Id><Topic><Title>say goodbye to flyovers</Title><Username>dropkickpubs4321</Username><Timestamp>1362144660905</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 08:31:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>how come the spending cut gop arent demanding cuts to congress's salary and benefits?</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1362146142271</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 08:55:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362146312985-12</Id><Topic><Title>Is ORCL too good to be true?</Title><Username>evanswilliams63</Username><Timestamp>1362143271880</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 08:07:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>keep me informed</Msg><Username>wolfordwilkins</Username><Timestamp>1362146312985</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 08:58:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362146542432-13</Id><Topic><Title>Oracle Corporation CEO &amp; CFO Selling Shares?!</Title><Username>paulcampbell630</Username><Timestamp>1361977982420</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 10:13:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>good report</Msg><Username>todd.meyn</Username><Timestamp>1362146542432</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 09:02:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362146607158-14</Id><Title>Henry Ford DOUBLED the pay of workers</Title><Msg>pubs must think henry ford was an idiot.... why double the standard wage of the time.....

Malik Obama — a half-brother of Barack Obama — is running for a governor's position in the country's nationwide elections on Monday, though he said he's not sure what impact his relationship to the American president has on his campaign. "I'm going into it as Malik Obama," he said in a phone interview with The Associated Press from western Kenya. "I can't run away from my name and association with my brother, but I have the feeling that people somewhat want to see who the brother of Obama is."Malik Obama says this is the first step to be president of the Untied States.</Msg><Username>onedinosaur</Username><Timestamp>1362150267464</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 10:04:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362150329339-24</Id><Topic><Title>Is ORCL too good to be true?</Title><Username>evanswilliams63</Username><Timestamp>1362143271880</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 08:07:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>cold cold cold</Msg><Username>ninorichard776</Username><Timestamp>1362150329339</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 10:05:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362150441839-25</Id><Topic><Title>the avg min wage worker is 35yrs old. 43% have some college,10% are college grads,80% are HS grads or above</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1362146043752</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 08:54:03 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>the avg min wage worker is 35yrs old, just a fact.</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1362150441839</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 10:07:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362150582963-26</Id><Topic><Title>pubs will whine about the "47%"</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1362148574521</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 09:36:14 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>pubs whine about food stamps and they whine if workers want the min wage raised so they can feed their family without foodstamps</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1362150582963</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 10:09:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362150817370-27</Id><Topic><Title>according to some silly pubs here, raising the min wage will raise airline pilots salaries.</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1362082554704</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 15:15:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>pubs think an airline pilot union goes to management and says "hey, raise of my captain pay of $150K to $152K because the dishwasher at Denny's got a raise to $9 an hour."</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1362150817370</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 10:13:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362150925024-28</Id><Topic><Title>Larry Ellison -- GALE @ 1.88 ★★★ ANX @ .73 ★★★ APPY @ 2.26 ★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★</Title><Username>wcase70</Username><Timestamp>1362084421835</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 15:47:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Q - How would you purchase 50,000 - 100,000 shares of each?

I'm surprised that you don't already know that the reason we tip well for good service is precisely because waitstaff makes less than minimum wage. So we tip. Most often I tip better than 20%. Some waitresses I know do quite well financially. One in particular is the main breadwinner for her family. While I will continue to tip well for good service, if wiatstaff makes minimumwage I am concerned that others will not.

Woodward spoke to his own newspaper, the Washington Post, and appeared on Sean Hannity's Fox News show to discuss the now infamous emails between himself and Sperling. On Wednesday, Woodward set the media world chattering when he told Wolf Blitzer that Sperling's email —which said, in part, that, "as a friend," he thought Woodward would "regret" a hotly contested claim he was making about the Obama administration's handling of the budget sequester — had made him "very uncomfortable." He did not dispute Blitzer's comment that he had been "threatened" by Sperling. Nor did he quarrel with the Politico editors who interviewed him and wrote, "Woodward clear he saw it as a veiled threat." When the emails were released in full by Politico on Thursday, though, their cordial tone angered many journalists, who thought Woodward had mischaracterized the nature of the exchange.</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1362178605898</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 17:56:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362181239275-70</Id><Topic><Title>My Taxes Raised for This?</Title><Username>annieshenanigan</Username><Timestamp>1362081425367</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 14:57:05 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You forgot Michele's vacations.

Well if the Feds were sending $84 billions worth of fresh money to taxpayers ($600 by person) every month, there would be inflation all right. Instead they give $84 billions to rich people who keep it into their bank accounts and don't spend it, and push more debts on taxpayers and poor people who struggle to pay it back. No wonder there's no inflation. That's a feature not a bug. Doing more of this wouldn't change a thing.</Msg><Username>nazyoyo</Username><Timestamp>1362187505432</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 20:25:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362195093725-74</Id><Topic><Title>Bob Woodward Tells Hannity: I Never Called WH Email A 'Threat,'</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1362178605898</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 17:56:45 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>panywad pubs!!! way to show your stuff!</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1362195093725</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 22:31:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362195160867-75</Id><Topic><Title>teaparty takes credit &amp; brags about forcing the sequestration on the USA</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1362174614517</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 16:50:14 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>nice work teaparty! you sure hate the USA, don't you</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1362195160867</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 22:32:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
