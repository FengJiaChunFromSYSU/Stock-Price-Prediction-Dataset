The deal was sealed 24 hours before Hillary arrived. They had to wait to announce it until she got there. That way she can say what you just said. I think you're ticked that Israel has a great defensive dome that protects them. Unfair in your mind, right Phil?</Msg><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1353592953001</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-22 09:02:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353594582657-2</Id><Title>obama is a murderer and a liar and so is everyone who supports him.</Title><Msg>FOOLS!</Msg><Username>peterthegreat533</Username><Timestamp>1353594582657</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-22 09:29:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353599214021-3</Id><Title>voter fraud accusations by repu#$%$ is 100% #$%$</Title><Msg>GROW UP DB'S.</Msg><Username>dropkickpubs4321</Username><Timestamp>1353599214021</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-22 10:46:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353599232246-4</Id><Title>Facts about election 2012</Title><Msg>Total Vote, 122000000, 100.0% Obama, 61732000, 50.6% Romney, 58316000, 47.8% Other, 1952000, 1.6% Obama won the majority (over 50.0%) by 0.6% or 732000 votes. Romney + Other = 49.4% or 60268000 votes. So 49.4% of voters voted for somebody other than Obama. However, it is also true: Obama + Other = 63684000 or 52.2% voted for Other Than Romney. Obama got 3416000 more votes than Romney or 2.8&amp; more of total. Meanwhile some 3 million registered Republicans and 7 million registered Democrats did not show up to vote. **** In my opinion, America lost the opportunity to be lead, out of this economic quagmire, by a successful, decent, honorable and competent man. Instead, they voted for the charismatic socialist because he was black and Democrat.</Msg><Username>googleguy000000001</Username><Timestamp>1353599232246</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-22 10:47:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353599536447-5</Id><Topic><Title>Facts about election 2012</Title><Username>googleguy000000001</Username><Timestamp>1353599232246</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-22 10:47:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>YOU fk on idiot IDIOT!

No, I've not voted for any mainstream party candidate in many elections. I've even voted "Peace and Freedom" a few times, not because I believe their line but as a protest against those swine that run both major parties. Amazing how "brave" people like you are when anonymous. If you were worth it I would locate you and have a talk. It can be done you know.
