Dumbkick Dropkick is a typical anti-white racist just like the entire Nobama Adm. You must know this fact. *** And he and Obama call everyone else "Racist!" I have been busy working (I've got my own service business) and moostly didn't get to pay attention. Black Gymnast, Gabby Douglas did well. Got a gold or so. Nice butt! Nice thighs! Cute face. Got bumped out of tippy-top of gymnast games. I think she got a gold or two at other levels. Also got to watch some of the runners and hurdlers. Seems to me one (black) hurdler woman got a Silver, not quite the gold. And a cute young black female runner finally got her gold after prior games attempts getting silvers. It is sad when one can only see it as racist crap. Obama &amp; Dropkick may as well be modern Adolph Hitlers at the 1936 games! CHEER FOR OUR WHOLE TEAM!

We had a goal to get to the moon. With that goal, the gov fostered an environment to accomplish that goal. You could argue it promoted it. Fine. It's still a cherry pick. And BTW, whatever the space program produced was not sold commercially to the public. With Solyndra and indeed to whole green tech movement, the gov is attempting to force a commercial market.

He joined the company’s board in 1993, and has served on it for 11 of the past 19 years, including six as chairman of the audit committee. During Romney’s tenure as a Marriott director, the company repeatedly utilized complex tax-avoidance maneuvers, prompting at least two tangles with the Internal Revenue Service, records show. In 1994, while he headed the audit committee, Marriott used a tax shelter known to attorneys by its nickname: “Son of BOSS.” http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-02-22/romney-as-auditing-chairman-saw-marriott-son-of-boss-tax-shelter-defy-irs.html</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1344634513000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-10 17:35:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344634865000-49</Id><Topic><Title>sorry repubs, US ahead by 13 medals</Title><Username>dropkickuuuuuuu</Username><Timestamp>1344634439000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-10 17:33:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Right... another Great Obama victory... on the heals of killing Bin Laden (in between golf rounds) and claiming Romney of being a wife murderer!!

Reid's aide retracting heresay info. Hahaha, there goes their last bogus attempt to smear Romney. It was reported that Romney released his tax returns when he ran for Governor, he released them when he ran for Senator. These goons are grasping at dead end, crash and burn political smear tactics. I love when Dems get hosed for their desperate antics.
