Nonetheless, this is why doctors have malpractice insurance. The Gov can't regulate medical advice. A person in constant pain from back or neck injuries gets addicted, so what. However, It's not always that a doctor knows the risks of long term use of prescription drugs. I learned that with a doc who kept prescribing statins to my father and they made him act like he was drunk all the time, babbling, couldn't gather his thoughts. The attitude was that's all there is.
