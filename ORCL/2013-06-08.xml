FOLLOW TODD ON FACEBOOK FOR CULTURE WAR NEWS. CLICK HERE TO JOIN! Master Sgt. Nathan Sommers, a 25-year Army veteran and conservative Christian based at Fort Myer in Washington, believes his outspoken opposition to gay marriage prompted higher-ups to take a closer look at his beliefs. The recipient of an Army Commendation Medal and a soloist at the funeral of former First Lady Betty Ford, Sommers said his core beliefs are enough to mark a soldier for persecution in today’s military. “It seems like with the repeal of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell – that the Christians have been the ones who’ve had to go underground and in the closet – for fear of retaliation and reprisals,” Sommers told Fox News. “Christians feel like they can’t be forthright with their faith. They have to hide.”</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1370690023468</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-08 07:13:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370691405903-4</Id><Title>reagan is to blame for all the bad govt today,, flippen the dial last night I come upon Bill Mahr,, watched for few</Title><Msg>mins.

Her office cited domestic responsibilities for not attending - it is the last week of the school year for the Obamas' daughters Malia, 14, and Sasha, 11 - but the move leaves China's first lady, Peng Liyuan, to attend the summit without her American counterpart. China experts warned that Mrs Obama's decision to stay in Washington could have an unwelcome chilling effect on a summit that White House officials have billed as an "unprecedented" opportunity to heal divisions between the world's two biggest economies.</Msg><Username>captain_cazo_schettino.the_brave</Username><Timestamp>1370698193385</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-08 09:29:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370698308902-12</Id><Topic><Title>These "non" scandals aren't going away</Title><Username>passthebuckaroo</Username><Timestamp>1370653644887</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 21:07:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>EXECUTE!

The news is contrary to what these liberal goons have convinced themselves of. When the squealing gets this bad you know the hammer is about to drop, BAM! No other straw to grasp, so using Reagan to wag the donkey, priceless. The country was in far better shape under Reagan, and Repubs and Dems were getting along. Our political landscape now is one of division, unrest, uncertainty for the future. We owe it to Obama and his socialist mentality. Do we go the way of Rome or do we save what the founders fought for? Before the smoke clears, there will be another chapter in the fight for freedom.</Msg><Username>passthebuckaroo</Username><Timestamp>1370736947826</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-08 20:15:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
