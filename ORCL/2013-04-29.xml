Their conclusion: about three-quarters is due to the lackluster economy. The rest stems from efforts to keep spending down, including measures introduced in the 2010 "Obamacare" law. America's national health care spending grew by 3.9% each year from 2009 to 2011, the lowest rate since the federal government began keeping these records in 1960. That slow growth appears to have continued into 2012, when expenditures totaled an estimated $2.8 trillion. the biggest driver of the slowdown is that people spend less on health care in weak economic times, said Larry Levitt, senior vice president at Kaiser. Those who lose their jobs often lose coverage and hold off on seeing the doctor, and even workers with company-sponsored plans may still face large out-of-pocket costs that they'd rather avoid unless absolutely necessary. "When people feel less secure, they are more hesitant to use the health care system," Levitt said. Companies have tried to curb their spending, too, by raising deductibles and co-pays, as well moving toward high-deductible plans, through which enrollees must typically spend a few thousand dollars before coverage kicks in. A growing number of companies have also instituted disease management or wellness efforts that aim to cut costs by keeping workers healthier. Most of Obamacare's provisions have yet to be implemented, but some of the early ones are already having an effect, Levitt said. Insurance companies, hospitals and other providers are seeing smaller payment increases, while insurers are limited in what they can spend on administrative costs and must submit any premium increases of more than 10% for review by state or federal experts...................................</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1367241480264</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 09:18:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367242303527-6</Id><Title>Denmark, universal healthcare, less debt, more jobs (6% of Danish children in poverty, 23% are here)</Title><Msg>another example. its the same for many nations: Australia, Canada, Germany,Sweden, Israel.. and many more , Japan's UE rate is 4% or so and they have universal healthcare but more debt.....

The World Bank estimates that gross domestic product per capita in Denmark for the 2008-12 period at $59,889, compared with $48,112 for the United States. The Danes spend far less on health care per capita than we do in the United States, yet achieve better health outcomes in many areas, including life expectancy. Their child poverty rates are far lower: About 6.5 percent of Danish children live in families with disposable incomes under 50 percent of the median, compared with 23.1 percent in the United States. The Danish banking system, like most, took a hit in the financial crisis. But its banking regulations prevented major losses in mortgage lending. Overall levels of public debt as a percentage of G.D.P. are far lower than ours, and remain well below the European Union average.</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1367242303527</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 09:31:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367242976956-7</Id><Topic><Title>Denmark, universal healthcare, less debt, more jobs (6% of Danish children in poverty, 23% are here)</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1367242303527</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 09:31:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'll but the plane ticket if you promise to move there.</Msg><Username>vanzinf</Username><Timestamp>1367242976956</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 09:42:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367243401382-8</Id><Topic><Title>seaburcc lie claiming "Americans fear government more than terror"</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1367240391052</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 08:59:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What's the difference.

MSNBC host Chris Hayes explained on his program Thursday how the Bush administration—and specifically former Vice President #$%$ Cheney’s son-in-law—played a critical role in defeating regulations that would have strengthened federal oversight of chemical plants like the one that exploded and killed 15 people in West, Texas, last week. During the time his father-in-law was vice president, Philip Perry worked in various governmental entities such as the White House Office of Management and Budget and the Department of Homeland Security. While at these jobs, he was able to successfully block the Environmental Protection Agency from regulating the chemical industry. As general counsel at the DHS in 2007, Perry played a key role in moving the task of regulating chemical plants from the EPA to his own department—a move that favored the chemical industry. “Basically, in a backroom maneuver, Perry does the chemical industry’s bidding by moving the oversight of this from the EPA, which the chemical industry hates, to DHS, which the chemical industry thinks they can more easily manipulate,” Hayes explained. As Hayes goes on to point out, the West Fertilizer Plant had been storing more than 1,300 times the amount of potentially explosive ammonium nitrate that would normally trigger oversight by the DHS. Incredibly, however, the DHS wasn’t even aware that the plant existed..............</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1367267799380</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 16:36:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367271501131-34</Id><Topic><Title>#$%$ Cheney’s Son-in-Law Helped Deregulate Chemical Plants (like the one that blew up last week in tx)</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1367267799380</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 16:36:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>President of the country let it happen, that$&amp;@);??&amp;@)!

According to the Associated Press, European mayors are now attempting to limit the travel of their citizens to Syria to fight “holy war” against the Assad regime in Syria. The AP reports: “Through much of western Europe, scores of Islamic youths have heeded the call to take up arms for a cause that is only a few hours away by plane. The phenomenon has alarmed authorities amid signs that the insurgency is becoming increasingly radicalized, with strong infiltration by al-Qaida.”</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1367273750014</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 18:15:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367275122805-37</Id><Topic><Title>#$%$ Cheney’s Son-in-Law Helped Deregulate Chemical Plants (like the one that blew up last week in tx)</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1367267799380</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 16:36:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>gee, so Obama runs Texas and also was responsible for bush era deregulation pushed by the gop and their industry cronies...? wow, you are the king of lollypopbubblegumbimbodom as your thinking proves.</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1367275122805</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 18:38:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367283098478-38</Id><Topic><Title>#$%$ Cheney’s Son-in-Law Helped Deregulate Chemical Plants (like the one that blew up last week in tx)</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1367267799380</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 16:36:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama Administration Accused of Threats to Benghazi Whistle-Blowers Reuters Lawyer says at least four officials at the State Department and the CIA are preparing to give sensitive details on the Benghazi attacks to Congress, and several have received threats from unnamed administration officials.</Msg><Username>liberals_plague_humanity</Username><Timestamp>1367283098478</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 20:51:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367283527722-39</Id><Title>This is Incredible.</Title><Msg>The motherly attributes of a female jihadi. The bombers mother wails that America took her sons from her. WHAT? The uncle said she had a big time influence on them in connection with their extremist views. She claims they were innocent but asks why they were not sent to Gitmo. She's a liar and a thief as are most radical muslims. The poor woman didn't think her sons would get caught and the deed would make them heros. She sent them to their fate. Now she blames America for getting rid of her vermin offspring. She can't grasp that she was responsible.</Msg><Username>annieshenanigan</Username><Timestamp>1367283527722</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 20:58:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367287749076-40</Id><Topic><Title>This is Incredible.</Title><Username>annieshenanigan</Username><Timestamp>1367283527722</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 20:58:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hard to believe about a mother. My mom worried about me all the time I was in the Army. I worried about my daughter during Gulf War I. She was in a Field Evac. Hosp. unit on the Gulf. My oldest son is active Army Reserve He was called up for both Bosnia and Iraq. I spent many hours praying for him. He's on active duty again for a year but not over seas, thank God. If something happened to him I would have to go hunting. I had my turn in the barrel as did my dad and several uncles.

My daughter-in-law's brother did 3 tours in Iraq and he made it home. It's one thing to fight for your country and possibly give your life for that, it's another thing to take the lives of innocent people for religion and consider it heroic. Our heros are the men and women who stand up for the rest of us.
