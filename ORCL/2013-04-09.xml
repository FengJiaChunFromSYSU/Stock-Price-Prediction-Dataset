Shockingly, its video business is currently receiving absolutely no value at all - and it's extremely profitable with no debt! CCUR is currently $7 with 9.2mm o/s, a market cap of $64.4mm, huge cash position of $24.6mm, and an enterprise value of $39.8mm. CCUR paid $15mm in cash to acquire their media data intelligence business, which tracks the viewing behavior of 35mm cable TV subscribers. This leaves only $24.8mm of remaining value for CCUR's two main businesses! CCUR's real-time business has been in business for 47 years. Its clients include Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Northdrop Grumman, Boeing, General Electric, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ferrari, Rolls-Royce, Saab, Daimler, Porsche, Fiat, and Thales.It powers time critical simulator applications in the defense and automotive industries and has $27.6 million in annualized revenue. CCUR's real-time business is worth at least $25mm, which leaves no value left for CCUR's video business! NCAA March Madness online streams were up 158% so far this year with 60% of them to tablets/smartphones! CCUR holds a 30% market share of the video on demand (VOD) tech space and is bridging the gap between VOD and streaming video to IP-connected mobile devices! CCUR just signed a huge multi-screen deal with Virgin Media (VMED) the #1 cable TV operator in the UK! CCUR earned calendar year 2012 non-GAAP EPS of $0.35 and now has annualized non-GAAP EPS of $0.50 and this isn't including any revenue/profits from VMED! CCUR's #1 competitor SEAC is expected to report 2012 non-GAAP EPS of $0.40 this evening and it's trading for $11.24.

The group planned to protest in front of the White House and issued a scathing statement Tuesday calling on Congress to reject changes to Social Security in the president's budget. "Do not follow President Obama in cheating the women of this country. After facing years of wage discrimination, women cannot afford to be swindled yet again when it comes to their Social Security," the group said. Obama plans to include a change to the way benefits are calculated with so-called chained CPI, a move NOW calls "eitehr a highly cynical move to bargain with right-wing legislators or a willfully misguided move to undermine our Social Security system." "The president and the Democratic leadership in Congress may think most voters aren't bright enough to figure out what's going on, but they're flat-out wrong. Voters who helped elect these leaders are now feeling betrayed, as they see supposedly progressive politicians turn their backs on the most vulnerable among us," the group says. NOW says the change would disproportionately affect women, who already are struggling to earn as much as men for the same jobs. On average they earn 77 cents to the dollar men earn with African American women earning 70 cents and Latinos 60 cents. "Let's face it: Instituting the chained CPI is like tripping someone at the end of a race after forcing them to run on the outside lane the whole way. Can this be the same president who proudly signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act back in January of 2009?"</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1365528676712</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-09 13:31:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365530767060-26</Id><Topic><Title>Thatcher told Palin to screw off,,how can repubs love Palin and love Thatch?</Title><Username>dropkickpubs4321</Username><Timestamp>1365512880489</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-09 09:08:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>that was funny.

"I was a scientist before I was a politician, Peter," she told him carefully. "And as a scientist I know you need facts, evidence and proof -- and then you check, recheck and check again. The fact was that there were no facts, there was no evidence, and there was no proof. As a politician the most serious decision you can take is to commit your armed services to war from which they may not return." (of course, this is her rewriting history to claim she never supported the Iraq war which she did......by making false claims about wmd.......but at least she has sense enough to want to write herself out of supporting that illegal and immoral war based on lies........unlike many on this board who claim the invasion was not a "brainfart".....invading a country that was not a threat to the USA, had no wmd , no connection to 911, and doing so in violation of the UN charter.......and ntm mention the loss of life and staggering cost.....</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1365544389980</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-09 17:53:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365545552706-42</Id><Topic><Title>Kansas: A Bill to Outlaw Sustainability</Title><Username>nazyoyo</Username><Timestamp>1365537336896</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-09 15:55:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Private companies are there to translate any resources available into profits as fast as possible.
