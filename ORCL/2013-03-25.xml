However, I've always respected and admired Oracle for its business success. No matter what one might say, Oracle is an enterprise ecosystem, powering many companies. Core to this ecosystem is its database. Sorry, I don't but that it's just a commodity. PL-SQL on Oracle databases underpins lots of cloud computing applications, never mind in house systems. Oracle applications and other applications optimally work with Oracle databases. I know for a fact that some prominent cloud companies build their core technology stacks on mostly Oracle systems. Finally, if I learned anything the hard way, it's that Oracle tends to adjust &amp; adapt to change at the right time. I remember working for a database vendor in the mid 90s when the internet boom started. We touted our ability to handle more connections simultaneously than Oracle. However, Oracle partnered with middleware companies to pool connections for internet apps...something we didn't do initially. Hence, Oracle got the early jump and branded itself as "powering the internet". Likewise, I think it is only a matter of time before Oracle starts to take market share in cloud computing apps. Again, they have nearly all the components to build out SaaS stacks cheaply. Moreover, as to financials, look at their valuation, cash flow, and balance sheets...as compared to, for example, SalesForce. My bet is that Oracle will prove to be a winner over the long haul. This looks to be a decent entry point. Larry Ellison is still vigorous and should continue to guide the company for a long time to come. I'm definitely looking to start a long position.</Msg><Username>banmate7</Username><Timestamp>1364226138826</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 11:42:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364226161587-39</Id><Title>I will take this stock up to 34.00 sometime this year but not now.</Title><Msg>So if you want to buy now and wait .

May fall a bit more though. Depends a lot what the market does to. Market seems to be ignoring bad news. Thats a concern. But ORCL at $31 looks good. I see a gap up in NOV to be filled at 30.90.

Moreover, the market seems to be favoring potential growth like CRM, AMZN, and LNKD, whilst quick to punish companies like Apple and Oracle that actually make decent profits. At a current PE of 14, Oracle seems a fair value right now, although like you inferred, it could be gotten for cheaper. But in my book, I'd rather take Oracle now and bet on good odds of decent returns...as opposed to being a bag holder in the aforementioned companies when the market inevitably corrects. My philosophy is that it is more important to avoid a serious loss than to win a big one. I don't chase growth, other than with play money. My serious money goes into companies like Oracle, Apple, IBM, MSFT, and so.</Msg><Username>banmate7</Username><Timestamp>1364227671764</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 12:07:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364228868939-45</Id><Topic><Title>Oracle Should Stand the Test of Time...and Is A Good Long Term Bet</Title><Username>banmate7</Username><Timestamp>1364226138826</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 11:42:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yep will look great at $23.</Msg><Username>rmanage_this_36</Username><Timestamp>1364228868939</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 12:27:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364230076491-46</Id><Topic><Title>I see where Iraq is continuing to allow Iran access to its airspace in order to provide weapons to Assad.

Assemblyman Joe Cryan, of Union, graphically spelled out his kinky proclivities in more than 150 e-mails that he sent to a lobbyist — and then fought to keep them hidden after he stunned the state political world by having her busted for stalking in 2006. Cryan urged prosecutors for years to keep the courts from releasing the e-mails’ sexually charged content, while Golding pushed to get them out, first referring to them in court papers in 2009. With the case still playing out in court, the secret correspondence — racy enough to make any “Fifty Shades of Grey’’ fan blush — landed on the driveway of a Post reporter. “What do you want to be spanked with?” the lascivious lawmaker asked Golding in an inappropriate workday exchange that spanned 14 hours on June 28, 2004. “What will you wear to beg for it?” “Available for a bj this morning?” Cryan lustfully queried. “I’m really hard and #$%$.” The e-mails were written when the pol presumably would have been at one of his government jobs — either his $49,000-a-year Assembly gig or his $111,000-a-year post as Union County undersheriff.

In other words, Raystock claims to be the market maker but can't explain why the stock went down after telling you that he was buying and that you should buy cheap last Friday at $31.73 so he wants you to know that he doesn't have to explain!!! hah hah hah, we love to ridicule that clueless dimwit lying attention seeking child that is Raystock. Funny how the market maker was nowhere to be found when the share price was much higher prior to the earnings release. He would have looked very sharp had he told you to sell then but of course he is a know nothing fraud so what do you expect????

Know this, he bought aapl at $661.31, qid at $55, watg at $13.80, caas at $15, and rimm at $48.50 All of these stocks went on to plummet in value after he bought them. All of them he claimed to be taking down or keeping down the price even while still long the shares. There are no stocks that he made money on. Now you know why he is the winner of the Laughing Stock of Yahoo Message Boards title for three years in a row.</Msg><Username>psychiatrist_of_rayst0ck</Username><Timestamp>1364269718195</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 23:48:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
