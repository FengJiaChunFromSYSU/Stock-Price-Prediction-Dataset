That means Romney has been "underwater" in 10 consecutive polls this year. What's more, while the the presumptive Republican nominee's favorables have ticked up by 7 percentage points this year, his unfavorable score is up more than double that - 18 points.

But in doing so, the veracity of the claims is being called into question. The Romney campaign has pushed back hard on the ads, one of which labels Romney as "extreme" on the issue of women's health and another of which ties him to a woman's death. The latter ad was released by pro-Obama super PAC Priorities USA. The ad focuses on the story of Joe Soptic, a former GST Steel worker among those affected when the firm declared bankruptcy in 2001, following the takeover by Romney's Bain Capital and other companies. The ad, though, condensed a series of events that took place over several years, and Romney's ties to the situation are not clear. Further, Soptic's wife reportedly had health insurance for a while through her own employer, meaning Soptic's layoff did not strip the family of coverage. But in the ad, Soptic recalled how when "Mitt Romney and Bain" closed the plant, his family lost their health care. "A short time after that, my wife became ill," he said. Soptic said that one day he took her to the hospital, where doctors found she had Stage 4 cancer. "There was nothing they could do for her. And she passed away in 22 days," he said. "I do not think Mitt Romney realizes what he's done to anyone." Romney spokesman Ryan Williams rejected the premise of the ad in a written statement Tuesday. "President Obama's allies continue to use discredited and dishonest attacks in a contemptible effort to conceal the administration's deplorable economic record. After 42 months of unemployment above 8 percent, it is clear that the president and his campaign do not have a rationale for reelection," he said.</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1344436691000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 10:38:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344437233000-21</Id><Topic><Title>Bill Clinton calls Romney’s welfare claims 'not true'</Title><Username>dropkickuuuuuuu</Username><Timestamp>1344417731000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 05:22:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Right.... the guy who lies like a rug 24/7/366 (Bill Clinton) is now pointing fingers!!

"They just send you your welfare check, and 'welfare to work' goes back to being plain old welfare." PolitiFact gave this attack a "pants on fire" rating on Wednesday, saying it ignores the fact that the waiver will only be extended to states that seek to increase the percentage of welfare recipients engaging in work. But the Obama campaign has trotted out another defense: Republican governors, including Romney, have sought this sort of flexibility in the past. On a conference call with reporters Tuesday, Obama staffers said that Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval and Utah Gov. Gary Herbert—both Romney supporters—had asked them about these waivers. The state of Utah called for waivers that let states tinker with work requirements in 2011. "It is the narrow definitions of what counts and the burdensome documentation and verification processes that are not helpful," the Utah letter said.</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1344458376000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 16:39:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344459382000-75</Id><Topic><Title>THE TOP 20 percent get 80 percent of all Money!</Title><Username>ivanthedestroyer111</Username><Timestamp>1344457841000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 16:30:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Right...

And a bunch of Democrat BOOBS out of the Senate &amp; the House and maybe we can save our republic! [Unless we vote in morons like Chief Justice John Roberts, Olympia Snow, Lindsay Grahm, John McCain &amp; the like who think we need to leap across the aisle to compromise our values with the big government statists!]</Msg><Username>goodgal000000001</Username><Timestamp>1344477726000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 22:02:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344477788000-97</Id><Topic><Title>Lets identify the noisiest 0.5%</Title><Username>goodgal000000001</Username><Timestamp>1344477726000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 22:02:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>TEA PARTY FOREVER!</Msg><Username>goodgal000000001</Username><Timestamp>1344477788000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 22:03:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344481760000-98</Id><Topic><Title>Oracle Corporatio (ORCL ) you will get rectified</Title><Username>gutierrezerin153</Username><Timestamp>1344424910000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 07:21:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Been customer I am So lucky.U guys just buy it and become a Lucky...........</Msg><Username>karaburks504</Username><Timestamp>1344481760000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 23:09:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344482291000-99</Id><Title>Obama and the Olympics!</Title><Msg>Quote of the Month!!
