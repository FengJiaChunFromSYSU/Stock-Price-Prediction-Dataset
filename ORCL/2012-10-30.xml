Obviously the Republicans have been pushing the voter ID restrictions, as they largely effect the poorer parts of society (those without driver's licenses), those who tend to vote Democratic. Republicans were even fighting a recent ruling in Ohio that allowed library cards as legitimate photo IDs. Why's that?

Federal officials said last week that it’s state officials’ call whether to push back the election, Politico reports. Federal law mandates that presidential elections be held on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. But if a state “has failed to make a choice on the day prescribed by law, the electors may be appointed on a subsequent day in such a manner as the legislature of such state may direct.” When emergencies threaten to disrupt voting, the federal Election Assistance Commission advises state election officials to “review existing state law to determine if the governor has the power to cancel an election or designate alternative methods for distribution of ballots.” The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) already is dealing with the possibilities. “We are anticipating that, based on the storm, there could be impacts that would linger into next week and have impacts on the federal election,” FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate told reporters in a conference call Monday afternoon. “Our chief counsel’s been working on making sure that we have the proper guidance. We’re going through the regulatory policy and making sure all that’s in place and we can support it.” The New York City mayoral primary was delayed in September 2001 after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. But there is little, if any history, concerning delays for natural disasters. Whether the election can be postponed or not is a legal black hole,” Adam Winkler, a law professor at the University of California at Los Angeles, told Politico. “There’s very little precedent for such an act.” ............................................................................................................................................................. FEMA is in the act. What's FEMA got to do with elections? At any rate, in what states might the election be rescheduled? NY Conn. and NJ. NY would go to Obama even with the disaster.</Msg><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1351616670748</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 13:04:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351616760082-39</Id><Topic><Title>Bill Gates endorses Obama for prez 2012</Title><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1351616646263</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 13:04:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yeah Mesa.

It is a FACT that 38% of government revenues that come from the federal, personal, income tax comes from the top 1%. Obama's proposals would push that well over 40% to almost 45% when you count dividends, cap gains and the top earned income rate. I is a FACT that the bottom 47% of Americans pay no federal, personal, income tax... and as you pointed out, their FICA tax got reduced from 6.2% to 4.2% while the "employers" portion of the FICA tax was left at 6.2%. It is a FACT that the corporate tax rate in the U.S. is the highest in the world... it was the 2nd highest until last April, when japan lowered theirs and made OURS the highest.

After the storm, then-Gov. Mitt Romney asked President George W. Bush to declare Essex, Middlesex and Suffolk Counties federal disaster areas, according to the Boston Globe. That fall, the state legislature proposed spending $5.7 million on a flood prevention project to protect against future floods. Those funds would be matched by $22 million in federal money. Romney vetoed it. This week, Romney has come under fire for suggesting that the federal government get out of the business of disaster relief. But his record in Massachusetts doesn't lend much support to the suggestion that states can handle it alone. During the time of the Peabody fight, John Barrett, then the Democratic mayor of North Adams, was the vice president of the Massachusetts Mayors Association. He said the issue of flooding in Peabody was critical and that local officials had reached out to the legislature for help. "Every time it rained, it wiped out their downtown," Barrett told HuffPost. Barrett chalked Romney's veto of the Peabody project up to a lack of familiarity with infrastructure in the state. "This was not unusual for him. He didn’t understand infrastructure improvements. It was just the bottom line. He never visited communities. He never understood the issues. He never sat down with mayors or city managers. He never understood why those things were in the budget," Barrett said. "That money was requested by locals. It was a major league problem.” Dan Bosley, a former Democratic state representative in Western Massachusetts, agreed. "I think it was just the fact that Romney didn't understand these issues." He said he never saw Romney out with a rain slicker checking on towns like current Gov. Deval Patrick has done. "I don't think it was because he was heartless, he just didn't know. That's how he ran his state," Bosley said. "His understanding of why you have government, I don't think he ever had it." The Boston Globe reported that September that local officials were outraged, and doubly insulted that Romney claimed to have vetoed the money due to a lack of sufficient information. Peabody officials yesterday lashed out at Governor Mitt Romney's decision to block $5.7 million to pay for a flood control project in downtown Peabody. Romney blocked the money as part of $76 million in election-year spending he vetoed last week. At a State House press conference Friday, Romney said he had tried to contact Peabody officials to obtain more information about the funding, but was unable to reach anyone. Yesterday, state Senator Frederick E. Berry said ... "We hand-delivered all kinds of information. They had all the information they needed ... I don’t want to use the word 'lie,' but ... how he could say he didn't get the information? That's not true." Yesterday, Romney's communications director, Eric Ferhnstrom, said the governor stands by his statement. "Governor Romney is not a rubber stamp for the expenditure of taxpayer funds. If there is no information to support a particular expenditure, our inclination is to be cautious and to wait until a rationale is put forward," Ferhnstrom said. "In this case, we endeavored to get answers to our questions but none were forthcoming. We would be happy to take another look and if it appears to be a necessary and worthwhile expense we will include it in the next" spending bill the administration proposes. In May 2006, Peabody flooded again, and local officials quickly blamed Romney, and slammed him for doing a tour of the disaster area. As the Associated Press reported: Romney's critics saw more than a little political hype in the media blitz. "The first thing I wouldn't do is showboat for the national cameras and say I was going to prevent looting on the North Shore," Democratic candidate for governor Chris Gabrieli said ... Critics also faulted Romney's 2004 veto of a $5.7 million flood control project in Peabody, hit hard by the rains, and his request for just half a million dollars for the state's dam safety office. Senate Ways and Means Chairwoman Therese Murray, D-Plymouth said, "Peabody today is under water" because of Romney's action. Romney defended the veto, saying he wasn't given a full explanation of how the money would be spent."</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1351630875146</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 17:01:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351630979008-69</Id><Topic><Title>GM CEO: under Romney "you could have written off this company, this industry and this country."</Title><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1351545326456</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-29 17:15:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Did President Obama save General Motors?"

That they are not to be violated but with His wrath? Indeed, I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just and that His justice cannot sleep forever. On April 21, 1803, Jefferson wrote this to Dr. Benjamin Rush, also a signer of the Declaration of Independence: "My views are the result of a life of inquiry and reflection and very different from the anti-Christian system imputed to me by those who know nothing of my opinions. To the corruptions of Christianity, I am indeed, opposed, but not to the genuine precepts of Jesus himself. I am a Christian in the only sense in which He wished any one to be; sincerely attached to his doctrines in preference to all others". James Madison is known as the father of the U.S. Constitution and the 4th president of the U.S. "Religion is the foundation of government. We have staked the whole future of American civilization, not upon the power of government, far from it. We have staked the future of all of our political institutions upon the capacity of mankind for self-government; upon the capacity of each and all of us to govern ourselves, to sustain ourselves according to the Ten Commandments of God" In 1788, Madison also stated: "The belief in God all powerful wise and good, is so essential to the moral order of the world and to the happiness of man, that arguments which enforce it cannot be drawn from too many sources nor adapted with too much solicitude to the different characters and capacities to be impressed with it". The early Fathers LOVED GOD, plain and simple. The liberal retards out there would have you think that GOD was not in their thoughts and plans....</Msg><Username>mandan14shooter</Username><Timestamp>1351630988369</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 17:03:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351631147371-71</Id><Topic><Title>the great republican Teddy Roosevelt supported progressive taxation</Title><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1351620935908</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 14:15:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Pigshyt!

The ad leaves the clear impression that Jeeps built in China come at the expense of American workers. The ad miscasts the government’s role in Fiat’s acquisition of Chrysler, and it misrepresents the outcome. Chrysler’s owners had been trying to sell to Italy-based Fiat before Obama took office. The ad ignores the return of American jobs to Chrysler Jeep plants in the United States, and it presents the manufacture of Jeeps in China as a threat, rather than an opportunity to sell cars made in China to Chinese consumers. It strings together facts in a way that presents an wholly inaccurate picture.

Jefferson stated that he believed that none of the bible miracles were true and that most of the bible is a "dung heap". Jefferson wrote his own version of the story and teachings of jesus the man and moral teacher not a god and this "jefferson's bible" was what he used at home: ". Jefferson's condensed composition is especially notable for its exclusion of all miracles by Jesus and most mentions of the supernatural, including sections of the four gospels which contain the Resurrection and most other miracles, and also passages indicating Jesus was divine" wiki In an 1803 letter to Joseph Priestley, Jefferson states that he conceived the idea of writing his view of the "Christian System" in a conversation with Dr. Benjamin Rush during 1798–99. He proposes beginning with a review of the morals of the ancient philosophers, moving on to the "deism and ethics of the Jews", and concluding with the "principles of a pure deism" taught by Jesus, "omitting the question of his deity". also note that the 1783 USA treaty of tripoli declared that Article 11, states: "As the government of the United States of America is not in any sense founded on the Christian Religion,-" this was passed unanimously, it was printed in newspapers and there was no disapproval.

I prefer what God set up as a standard. ALL income under a poverty level is tax free. ALL income above that level is taxed at the same rate. Actually it wasn't even referred to as "income" but "increase." If the laws of that time had been followed it would have amounted to about 13%. The tithe was a civil tax and most Levites were civil servants. Only a small amount went to the temple and the Aaronic priesthood. But the egotistical thieving madmen have taken over and like the dogs they are they never have enough.
