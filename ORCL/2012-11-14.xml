It would be deleted. Just a hint. You can start with all the ex officers of Goldman-Sachs now in government employ and others from years past.

The votes are still being counted, but as of now it looks as if Democrats have a slight edge in the popular vote for House seats, 49%-48.2%, according to an analysis by the Washington Post. Still, as the Post's Aaron Blake notes, the 233-195 seat majority the GOP will likely end up with represents the GOP's "second-biggest House majority in 60 years and their third-biggest since the Great Depression." So how did Republicans keep their House majority despite more Americans voting for the other party—something that has only happened three times in the last hundred years, according to political analyst Richard Winger? Because they drew the lines. After Republicans swept into power in state legislatures in 2010, the GOP gerrymandered key states, redrawing House district boundaries to favor Republicans. In Pennsylvania, Democratic candidates received half of the votes in House contests, but Republicans will claim about three quarters of the congressional seats. The same is true in North Carolina. More than half the voters in that state voted for Democratic representation, yet Republicans will fill about 70 percent of the seats. Democrats drew more votes in Michigan than Republicans, but they'll take only 5 out of the state's 14 congressional seats."</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1352910713358</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 11:31:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352914970291-18</Id><Topic><Title>TADF BIG OCTOBER NEWS.TADF 2000% GAINS POSSIBLE ON ACQUISITIONS ANNOUNCED.

TADS is certified by the United States Government as a private-sector military contractor and has been granted the required security (MARKETWIRE via COMTEX) -- Tactical Air Defense Services, Inc. (OTCQB: TADF), an aerospace/defense services contractor that offers tactical aviation services, aircraft maintenance, and other aerospace/defense services to the United States and Foreign militaries, is pleased to announce that it has purchased an F-5 aircraft mission and procedures cockpit training simulator for $250,000, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, AeroTech Corporation. The F-5 training device uses a commercial COTS computer system, housed in a specifically fabricated F-5 cockpit, to provide a realistic F-5 flight simulation experience. The F-5 simulator is used to train pilots for basic flight characteristics and for emergency situations, and to complement actual flight time in an F-5 aircraft. TADF is one of only a few commercial companies to own an F-5 aircraft simulator, and is comparable to the two F-5 simulators that were recently sold by L-3 Communications to the U.S. Navy for approximately $3 million each.
