It's disgraceful that the Obama Administration's first response was not to condemn attacks on our diplomatic missions, but to sympathize with those who waged the attacks.” Obama made a general remark about defending America against acts of terror. He did not say it was a terrorist attack by al Queda. Obama's first instinct was to apologize. He went on a week long campaign to color the murder or our ambassador as due to a protest about a film. Obama apologized for the film at the UN. Obama has routinely downplayed terrorist attacks on America and said 9/11 was an inside job. Obama spins the truth to suit his position. He is a horrible leader.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1350472729746</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 07:18:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350473100511-2</Id><Topic><Title>Obama Benghazi cover-up</Title><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1350472729746</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 07:18:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Candy Crowley: He Was Right Moderator: Romney was 'right in the main' on Benghazi, but 'picked the wrong word' BY: Washington Free Beacon Staff October 16, 2012 11:41 pm After the debate, debate moderator Candy Crowley said Republican nominee Mitt Romney was “right in the main” but “picked the wrong word” on the Obama administration’s immediate response to the terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya, that left four Americans dead. Crowley interrupted Romney during the debate, insisting that President Obama had in fact called the attack an “act of terror.” ROMNEY: I want to make sure we get that for the record because it took the president 14 days before he called the attack in Benghazi an act of terror. OBAMA: Get the transcript. CROWLEY: It — it — it — he did in fact, sir. So let me — let me call it an act of terror… OBAMA: Can you say that a little louder, Candy? CROWLEY: He — he did call it an act of terror. It did as well take — it did as well take two weeks or so for the whole idea there being a riot out there about this tape to come out. You are correct about that. In a statement given in the Rose Garden on Sept. 12, Obama emphasized an anti-Islam video, before saying that “no acts of terror would shake the resolve of this great nation.” The administration’s narrative on the attack over the next two weeks was muddled. On Sept. 16, U.S. Ambassador Susan Rice attributed the attack on the U.S. Consulate to violent protests stemming from a “heinous and offensive” video. On Sept. 25, the president himself declined to call the attack an act of terrorism during an interview with “The View,” saying that an investigation was still ongoing. Update (12:22 a.m.): After the debate, “Romney was actually right on Libya” trended on Twitter in the United States:</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1350473100511</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 07:25:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350474481749-3</Id><Title>used to think a 55-45 Romney win was reasonable</Title><Msg>but as we draw closer to the election, 55-45 is being overly generous to Obama.

Hollande and Obama cut from the same cloth. Neither has any idea of how a healthy economy works. The situation is very serious. Some business leaders are in a state of quasi-panic,” said Laurence Parisot, head of employers’ group MEDEF. “The pace of bankruptcies has accelerated over the summer. We are seeing a general loss of confidence by investors. Large foreign investors are shunning France altogether. It’s becoming really dramatic.” MEDEF, France’s equivalent of the CBI, said the threat has risen from “a storm warning to a hurricane warning”, adding that the Socialist government of François Hollande has yet to understand the “extreme gravity” of the crisis. The immediate bone of contention is Article 6 of the new tax law, which raises the top rate of capital gains tax from 34.5pc to 62.2pc. This compares with 21pc in Spain, 26.4pc in Germany and 28pc in Britain. “Let’s be clear, Article 6 is not acceptable, even if modified. We will not be complicit in a disastrous economic mistake,” Mrs Parisot told Le An alliance of private organisations in France has issued a protest entitled “State of Emergency for Business”, warning that confiscatory tax rates threaten lasting damage to the French economy. Mrs Parisot said the policies border on economic illiteracy: “The idea of aligning taxes on capital with those on wages is a profound economic error. It is scandalous that the French have been left in such economic ignorance for years.”</Msg><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1350475687868</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 08:08:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350477449252-6</Id><Title>Obama sound like a stupid fkin nggr</Title><Msg>Romney presents his 5 point plan giving detail descriptions of each point.

Mitt Romney that President Obama called the Benghazi attack an "act of terror" soon after the attack on the U.S. consulate. Nearly all of the audible applause came from those sitting away from the actual debate, but when FOX News' camera shot moved to a bird's-eye view it became apparent that the only applause from the participating debate audience came from first lady Michelle Obama. Mitt Romney's wife Ann was also sitting with the debate participants. According to the rules both campaigns agreed to, or the memorandum of understanding (MOA), there is to be no clapping from members of the debate audience. The rule: Article 9, Section A, Subsection 7: "All members of the debate audience will be instructed by the moderator before the debate goes on the air and by the moderator after the debate goes on the air not to applaud, speak, or otherwise participate in the debate by any means other than by silent observation, except as provided by the agreed upon rules of the October 16 town hall debate."</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1350480423532</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 09:27:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350480707418-14</Id><Title>Yahoo News Says "Obama Wins"!!</Title><Msg>Right... on lies, distortions and ad hominem attacks!

He looked more presidential than Obama did and showed himself to be an articulate, capable, attractive, compassionate leader with sound ideas. Obama came over as boorish and Biden-esque. He did not learn from his Vice President's mistakes. When a president gets into a bar room brawl, he loses his dignity and his aura, key assets for an incumbent. Romney was polite but firm. Obama seemed quarrelsome, frustrated, nasty, and cranky. But the key reason for the Romney win was substantive: 1. Romney made very clear the case against Obama's economic record and Obama's rebuttal about 5 million jobs was pathetic. 2. Romney injected the China issue, big time, and tapped into a strong public sentiment on the issue. 3. Romney made the effective case that Obama is anti-oi, coal, and gas and that this has doubled gas prices. 4. Romney was very effective in differentiating himself from Bush-43 and in establishing that, unlike the GOP of the past, he was for small businesses not big businesses 5. Romney rebutted the attacks on him over Chinese investments. 6. Romney explained his tax plan well and to everyone's satisfaction. 7. Obama erred in trying to make us believe that he always felt Libya was a terror attack. We all heard him blame the movie. Obama scored points over the 47% statement by Romney, immigration, and by his response to the accusation that he went to Vegas after the murder of the Ambassador. But this debate goes to Romney. It seals his momentum and will lead to a big win.</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1350483786036</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 10:23:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350485220200-18</Id><Title>Democrat Lies!

What I find particularly troubling is the lack of journalistic objectivity from The Sun in regard to what Vice President Joe Biden said, which in the heat of the moment sounded authoritative and sincere ("VP rivals come out swinging," Oct. 12). Here are four points on which one can easily score The Sun and Biden a zero: First, on the account of Mr. Biden saying that Obamacare would absolutely not force Catholic organizations and others to pay for contraceptives, the written response from the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops regards this as false. Secondly, in the matter of Mr. Biden lambasting Rep. Paul Ryan for voting for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, while inferring that he voted against the wars, the answer again was false. In the matter of Syria being five times larger than Libya and having one-fifth the population, the answer again is false (it is one-ninth the size, but has greater than three times the population). Finally, in the matter of "our" not knowing about the Libyan embassy's request for additional security, the answer is false. The State Department denied requests multiple times. One would hope that someone at The Sun would seek answers to these questions: Was Mr. Biden lying or what he shifting blame to try to deflect criticism away from President Barack Obama's failed leadership? Or has Mr. Biden simply lost it? It is quite possibly a little of each. And this leads one to question his competence as the next in line to be President of the United States.

On the one hand, in the era when Obama was born, a man would almost certainly be circumcised as a matter of course, regardless of race, creed, or religion. Most American men and boys are circumcised, and it wasn’t until the last few years that the practice was even questioned. But Obama was supposedly born to kind of a free-thinking mother, and he was born in Hawaii, both features that make it possible that he is not, in fact, circumcised. It’s complicated. The ladies on The View want to know before they vote again.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1350502067305</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 15:27:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350502272159-37</Id><Topic><Title>Biased CNN moderator</Title><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1350477808745</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 08:43:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A Frank Luntz focus group made up mostly of former Obama voters say they now support Mitt Romney.

You're going the wrong way bozo. All he does is bash Romney's ideas. Obama and Pelosi are the reason the last 4 years have been horrible for many, with progressively slowing GDP, divisive infighting and misery. Cautious companies aren't hiring for fear of being too successful thus becoming the target of the next oppressive regulation or windfall tax.

About This Blog Archive E-Mail RSS Send Print | Text Obama’s New Firewall: Ohio, Iowa, New Hampshire, and Nevada By Jim Geraghty October 17, 2012 5:05 P.M. Comments 73 Major Garrett, writing in National Journal: What also became clear after the dust began to settle from the rumble on Long Island was the electoral map has narrowed and Obama’s team, while conceding nothing publicly, is circling the wagons around Ohio, Iowa, New Hampshire, and Nevada. Plouffe said that Obama remains strong in all four states, but he would not discuss the specifics of internal polling or voter-contact analytics, saying only that Obama has “significant leads” in all four places. It is uncharacteristic of Team Obama to concede any terrain, but Plouffe offered no such assurances about Obama’s position in North Carolina, Virginia, or Florida. Romney advisers have seen big gains in all three states and now consider wins likely, although not guaranteed, in all three. They are similarly upbeat about prospects in Colorado but not confident enough to predict victory. That Plouffe left Colorado off his list of states where Obama’s leading and can withstand a Romney surge might be telling. Chalk one up for Suffolk University Political Research Center’s David Paleologos, which said they would stop polling North Carolina, Virginia, and Florida last week. Fascinatingly, the description of Plouffe’s comments puts New Hampshire in the “firewall” pile, when the last three polls have Romney up by 4 (ARG) a tie (Suffolk) and Obama ahead by 1 (Rasmussen).</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1350523546290</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 21:25:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350523555775-78</Id><Topic><Title>Romney Already Getting Threats</Title><Username>passthebuckaroo</Username><Timestamp>1350512231470</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 18:17:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Study: Black Americans Feel Less Empowered Under Obama Than They Once Did By Elizabeth Flock October 17, 2012 RSS Feed Print In this Oct. 7, 2010, file photo, President Barack Obama greets people after speaking at a campaign rally for Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley at Bowie State University in Bowie, Md. In this Oct. 7, 2010, file photo, President Barack Obama greets people after speaking at a campaign rally for Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley at Bowie State University in Bowie, Md. Four years after Barack Obama was elected president, this is not exactly a "post-racial" America. A new study from Washington University in St. Louis finds that under Obama, many black Americans feel less free than whites when it comes to political participation. [SEE: Political Cartoonists Take On President Obama] From 2005 to 2011, only 45 percent of blacks said they believed the government would allow them to make a public speech, while 67 percent of whites believed they could, the study found. The study found that while the election of Obama initially boosted feelings of political empowerment among black Americans, those sentiments significantly faded in the years that followed—especially among conservative and religious blacks. These two groups make up a large segment of the black population, with 56 percent of blacks identifying as "born again," and 39 percent of blacks as "somewhat conservative," according to the study. "First we saw the 'empowerment effect,' the boost that happens when a member of your group gets elected to an important political position," says study author James L. Gibson, a professor of government and African-American studies at Washington University. Gibson's findings are based on national surveys conducted between 2005 and 2011.</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1350523555775</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 21:25:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350526450741-79</Id><Topic><Title>speaking of mooches and shirkers</Title><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1348149757238</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 10:02:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Simple political ploy dummy.

Don't be silly! You keep bringing this topic up over and over and I will STILL come back and ask: Where is the Legislation to arrange to PAY for this? Or arrange assistance to pay for this? IT'S NO WHERE! Not even 26+/- years later! But the DEMOCRATS keep bringing this up as one of THEE REASONS we must have nationalized health insurance/health care! It is a stupid reason! There are LOT'S of ways for dealing with this problem besides nationalizing our health insurance/care industry. (One of the simplest ways would be a manuscripted, aggregate excess casualty insurance &amp; reinsurance agreements! It would be nice if the government(s) stepped up to the plate and helped out too! THEY created the problem!) WORST OF ALL! After all the fuss about 20 million uninsured! No it's 30 million uninsured! No it's 40 million uninsured! And we MUST have national health care to cover all these uninsured! After all that, some studies are coming back saying even WITH ObamaCare we will STILL have 30 million uninsured who are not covered by the program.
