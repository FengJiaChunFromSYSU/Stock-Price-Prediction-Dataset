Smaller government is promoted by the very companies that make record profits while forcing their employees to accept public assistance. While McDonald's enjoyed profits of 130 percent over the past four years, and Yum! Brands (Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and KFC) made 45 percent, and while the Walton family made $20 billion in one year, the median hourly wage for food service workers and Walmart employees is about $9 an hour. Many workers are stuck at the $7.25 minimum wage, which according to the National Employment Law Project is worth 30 percent less than in 1968. Food service and big box store employees, among the fastest-growing job segments in the nation, are making barely enough to stay out of poverty. And it's not just the employees who are subsidizing their bosses. We all are. Low-wage employees are more dependent on the food stamps and Medicaid that are paid for by our tax dollars.</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1355146845319</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 08:40:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355147114405-10</Id><Topic><Title>Bob Costas says</Title><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1355138520668</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 06:22:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Shut up you idiot..like the REAL gun owner the other day in Pa who killed his 7 year old.........db,...most people do OK with their guns(mostly because of luck) but as a gun owner/concealed weapons permit holder for 20 years I WANT SANE gun laws.I don't believe we have them.</Msg><Username>dropkickpubs4321</Username><Timestamp>1355147114405</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 08:45:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355147612534-11</Id><Title>Wisconsin is a classic case of rewarding major corporations with piles of cash</Title><Msg>Wisconsin is a classic case of rewarding major corporations with piles of cash that they do not need.

Kohl’s, which manages to pay its CEO Keith Mansell $9.4 million, nonetheless justifies taking $62.5 million in taxpayer dollars. “Wisconsin spends at least $1.53 billion per year on incentive programs including tax rebates, according to the most recent data available,” the New York Times reported.

Billionaires Warn Higher Taxes Could Prevent Them From Buying Politicians Posted by Andy Borowitz WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—Introducing a new wrinkle into the already fraught fiscal cliff showdown, a consortium of billionaires today warned that if their taxes are raised they will no longer have enough money to buy politicians. The group, led by casino billionaire Sheldon Adelson, commissioned a new study showing that the cost of an average politician has soared exponentially over the past decade. While the American family has seen increases in the cost of food, health care and education, Mr. Adelson says, “those costs don’t compare with the cost of buying a politician, which has gone through the roof.” The casino billionaire points to his group’s study, which puts the cost of purchasing an average House member at two million dollars and an average senator at several times that. “And let’s say you buy a Senator like [South Carolina Senator] Jim DeMint and he decides to quit,” Mr. Adelson says. “Good luck trying to get your money back.” The Vegas magnate complains that the media has ignored billionaires’ essential role in giving jobs to politicians who would otherwise have difficulty finding “honest work of any kind.” “Billionaires are providing employment for a group of seriously incompetent and marginal people,” Mr. Adelson says. “You raise taxes on us, and who’s going to create those jobs? I really don’t think people have thought this through.” Adding insult to injury for America’s billionaires, he says, “the simple dream of someday owning a President is slipping out of reach.” “People think a billion dollars buys you a President, but they’re wrong,” he says. “It barely gets you a lemon like Mitt Romney.”</Msg><Username>alsmith581</Username><Timestamp>1355149001397</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 09:16:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355149492400-13</Id><Topic><Title>Warning from America's rightwing billionaires:</Title><Username>alsmith581</Username><Timestamp>1355149001397</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 09:16:41 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Little bit of humor there.</Msg><Username>dropkickpubs4321</Username><Timestamp>1355149492400</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 09:24:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355149652787-14</Id><Topic><Title>Warning from America's rightwing billionaires:</Title><Username>alsmith581</Username><Timestamp>1355149001397</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 09:16:41 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>For the right price Boehner will hand out cash right on the floor of the US House of Represenative as he has done before.

The poll finds that only 27 percent of respondents approve of how Republican leaders in Congress are handling negotiations on the fiscal cliff so far. An astounding 63 percent disapprove. By comparison, 52 percent approve of President Barack Obama's handling, while only 43 percent disapprove. Earlier on Tuesday, a Washington Post/Pew Research poll found that 53 percent of Americans would blame Republicans if no deal is reached. Only 27 percent said they would blame Obama.</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1355194473298</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 21:54:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355199661410-56</Id><Topic><Title>Free phones started with Repubs</Title><Username>passthebuckaroo</Username><Timestamp>1355157768662</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 11:42:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I believe I just dropkicked dropkick. hahahahaha!
