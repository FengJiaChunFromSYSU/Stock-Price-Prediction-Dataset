President Obama is a little uneasy with the way journalists have been dragged into the Justice Department’s aggressive pursuit of national security leak investigations. In fact, he has ordered Attorney General Eric Holder to conduct a 45-day review of the department’s guidelines on the issue. That bit of news was buried in the middle of the president’s hourlong speech today at National Defense University. “Journalists should not be at legal risk for doing their jobs,” President Obama said. “Our focus must be on those who break the law.” And then the news: “I have raised these issues with the attorney general, who shares my concern. So he has agreed to review existing Department of Justice guidelines governing investigations that involve reporters, and will convene a group of media organizations to hear their concerns as part of that review. And I have directed the attorney general to report back to me by July 12th.” then we learn this: Attorney General Eric Holder personally signed off on the warrant that allowed the Justice Department to search Fox News reporter James Rosen's personal email, NBC News' Michael Isikoff reported Thursday .Bottom line is that Holder gets to investigate himself. O knows that the low info voters out there won't notice and we know the left won't care.</Msg><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1369394798011</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-24 07:26:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369398409715-6</Id><Topic><Title>tea party tax frauds and cheats</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1369346003009</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 17:53:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>" The real scandal about the IRS is that they’ve been overwhelmed with dark money groups claiming nonprofit status since the passing of Citizens United, and conservative groups have outspent liberal groups on political spending by 34-1, according to a Center for Responsive Politics analysis of the IRS and FEC records. Open Secrets reported, “Conservative nonprofits that received tax-exempt status since the beginning of 2010 and also filed election spending reports with the Federal Election Commission overwhelmed liberal groups in terms of money spent on politics, an analysis of Internal Revenue Service and FEC records shows.”.... ...Karl Rove’s Crossroads is the biggest spender, reporting spending more than $87.9 million since 2010, but it’s still waiting to be officially approved as tax exempt. Gee, do you think the IRS will be able to be objective when it comes to Crossroads’ overtly political purpose, or will they feel pressured to rubber stamp Karl so as not to cause offense...?

Many of the crimes are pretty well known and have been substantiated by reliable people. These things have gone on regardless of which group of thugs control this government. The Fast and Furious operation was a clear violation of our laws. Has anyone been charged? I can list many others including the drug running from the Golden Triangle during 'Nam and the current operation going on out of Afghanistan. Plenty of evidence tying this government into cocaine running from Columbia too. It was flown into Mena, Arkansas while Billie Bob Clinton was governor and may still be going there. Voting?

How much power are we going to allow these vermin? This is as un-American as it gets. This goon should have been kicked to the curb when Fast and Furious was exposed. I said it before, the gang Obama appointed and trusted to high office may be the ones who bring his reign to an end. It won't be the Repubs fault. Some Dems are scrambling to un-do the damage while others are shaking their heads in disbelief. Historical records will show that for the first time a sitting Pres was castigated by his own party. And rightly deserved.
