It does make me nervous to think I supplied 3-4 people with guns. I guess it's legal though. I don't think I'll ever feel comfortable again doing that when I think about what could happen. Too many guns out there. I've also sold a dozen guns to a pawn shop figuring let them be responsible for what happens later. Looking back, even that makes me somewaht uncomfortable.

I hear it wouldn't Lanza's Mother acquired the guns and nothing in the current legislation would have stopped her from owning them. The fact that there already serious laws against murder did not deter Lanza one bit.</Msg><Username>bullwinkle.themoose</Username><Timestamp>1365884761098</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-13 16:26:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365884999401-37</Id><Topic><Title>There are many examples of armed citizens stopping gunmen, so let's all be a little more truthful.</Title><Username>say92liberals</Username><Timestamp>1365881577590</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-13 15:32:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Dropkickpubs - you aint nuthin'!
