In fact, the bill subjects the White House, members of Congress, and their staffs to the same reforms and requirements as the rest of the American people. White House, Congress, and federal employees are subject to same health care reforms applied to American people White House, Congress required to carry health insurance like everyone else. Starting in 2014, Americans will be required to have minimum health insurance coverage, with exemptions for certain people with religious objections or the inability to afford coverage. The bill does not exempt government employees such as leaders and staffers at the White House and Congress. Insurers covering government workers will be subject to insurance regulations. The insurers participating in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, through which federal workers obtain health coverage, are not exempt from the regulations imposed by the bill on insurers. These regulations include prohibitions on lifetime limits on coverage and denial of coverage to those with pre-existing conditions, and the requirement to spend 80-85 percent of premiums on medical claims, among others. Bill does not require Americans to enroll in health care exchange plans. Contrary to the suggestion that participating in the exchange plans is mandatory, there is no such requirement, ......</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1366895318310</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-25 09:08:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366899359475-12</Id><Topic><Title>it's a lie that "congress staffers ""could be"" exempt from Obamacare.. a lie repeated by the lying liar pubbies like seaburgc</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1366895318310</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-25 09:08:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>mesa, it's being reported in politico.

The most recent Supplemental Assistance Nutrition Program (SNAP) statistics of the number of households receiving food stamps shows that 23,087,886 households participated in January 2013 - an increase of 889,154 families from January 2012 when the number of households totaled 22,188,732. The most recent statistics from the United States Census Bureau-- from December 2012-- puts the number of households in the United States at 115,310,000. If you divide 115,310,000 by 23,087,866, that equals one out of every five households now receiving food stamps. As CNSNews previously reported, food stamp rolls in America recently surpassed the population of Spain. A record number 47,692,896 Americans are now enrolled in the program and the cost of food stamp fraud has more than doubled in just three years.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1366904257972</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-25 11:37:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366904347646-25</Id><Topic><Title>it's a lie that "congress staffers ""could be"" exempt from Obamacare.. a lie repeated by the lying liar pubbies like seaburgc</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1366895318310</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-25 09:08:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Lawmakers, aides seek Obamacare exemption...

Totally in character. Way to go OBAMA!. It's all politics, just like this message board. Oh, and that sequester thing? That was his idea, too! And ya gotta love the way he is always campaigning. Yessiree! He is using his learned community organizing skills very well. Keep the people stirred up to anger against -- whatever suits the need. Never let a crisis go to waste. Wow. That guy is really good. He has those STUPID LIBERAL PUKES eating out of his hand, right along with the "no information" voters -- you know, the ones just like you who ask when to vote, where to vote, and for whom to vote. Idiots. No wonder this country is in such a mess. Oh, and that question as to why it is so hard to sell freedom in this country: easy -- the limosine liberals -- you know, the ones like Obama who take a 2 week vacation every month, they sell financial freedom for those hard-pressed dumkopfs who refuse to take responsibility for themselves. Yes, it must be grand to realize that the government is so kind and generous to the plantation residents. Of course, they never ask where all that money comes from. As far as they are concerned, it's just "Obama money that he gets from his stash." Yeah, just like the first slave owner in this country. What? You didn't know it was a black man in Virginia? That indentured servant thing really helped him get way ahead. And on the topic of history, that democrat-created KKK really had a good deal going, keeping those rascally republicans out of the south and the poor former slaves on the plantation and fearing for their lives. What? You didn't know it was democrats who created the KKK? They surely did -- and it was political. And what about gun ownership? How many of those Bostonians were cowering in their homes hoping that the "bad guy" (wait, can I say that about a Muslim terrorist?) would not come breaking into their unarmed homes and them with no way to protect their families from -- who knows?</Msg><Username>bogeyman32</Username><Timestamp>1366930662050</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-25 18:57:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366930772291-46</Id><Topic><Title>Guess what, dropkick?
