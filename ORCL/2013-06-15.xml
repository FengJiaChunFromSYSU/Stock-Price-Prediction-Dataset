The nut just hasn't been taught you can't say those things in public... just to your friends and the people buying your father's senate seat for him. " Racism is learned from racist parents . "These are the things we have learned to day about how members of Senator Jeff Flake's family talk and feel about minorities. Gay people are "fa**ots, Mexicans are the #$%$ of the Earth and Black people should be killed. Welcome to Arizona. Arizona Senator’s Son Used Homophobic, Anti-Semitic Language On Twitter Sen. Jeff Flake’s high school–aged son Tanner used Twitter to threaten the #$%$” who stole his bike that he “will find you, and … will beat the #$%$ out of you,” joked about an acquaintance stealing one-liners because he’s Jewish, and went by the name “n1ggerkiller” in an online game. “I’m very disappointed in my teenage son’s words, and I sincerely apologize for the insensitivity. This language is unacceptable, anywhere. Needless to say, I’ve already spoken with him about this, he has apologized, and I apologize as well,” Sen. Flake said in a statement to BuzzFeed. Although Tanner has since locked his Twitter account, a series of tweets from January and February show the Arizona Republican’s son repeatedly using the slurs. Additionally, Flake posted screenshots of scores from games on “Fun Run,” a social gaming app. The screenshots show that Flake goes by the name of “n1ggerkiller.”</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1371301762473</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 09:09:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371307163760-12</Id><Topic><Title>Racism learned from parents?

It's hard to believe that a year ago, when Obama was locked in an electoral battle with Mitt Romney, that we were actually debating as a country whether or not we wanted to go to war Iran. Despite evidence that sanctions were working on Iran, hurting the economy and creating the conditions for electoral change that we saw this weekend, Romney pushed for a completely different policy, criticizing Obama's consensus building containment policy. Romney backed an Israeli strike against Iran's nuclear reactor. In addition, his adviser, Dan Senor, left open the option for America to hit Iran unilaterally. Imagine how we'd be preparing for Operation Iranian Freedom now, instead of celebrating the results coming out of Tehran. Rowhani was the architect who negotiated a suspension of Iran's nuclear program, torpedoed by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad when he was elected back in 2005. That occurred partly as a result of President George W. Bush's ill-advised decision to label part of moderate cleric Mohammad Khatami's government as part of the "axis of evil" (though Bush redeemed himself by not backing a plan for Israel to hit Iran in his last year of office). ........................."</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1371346137823</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 21:28:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371347979114-39</Id><Topic><Title>NO ONE WATCHED MessedUpNBC for two hours this past Friday night!</Title><Username>ourfirstpantroglodytepresident</Username><Timestamp>1371345538744</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 21:18:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>BSNBC is not a news network, it's a comedy channel in the style of Jon Stewart.
