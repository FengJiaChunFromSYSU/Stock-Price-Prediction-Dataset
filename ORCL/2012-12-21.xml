Local time in USA would be 5 to 8 hours later depending on your time zone and if you are following daylight savings time or not. But this is SO WRONG! It is culturally arrogant and historically and archeologically anachronistic. 1) I don't think the ancient Mayans of 500 AD to 900 AD were calculating the time of the Winter Solstice based on the Greenwich Meridian in England! LOL! 2) I don't think the Angles-Saxons, Jutes, Celts or whoever else was in England at the time were calculating the Winter Solstice (at Stonehenge maybe?) using the Greenwich Meridian either! LOL! 3) I am also pretty sure that neither culture ran their "railroads" based on standard time and time zones either! LOL! (That's a joke, OK. Neither culture had railroads at that time!) 4) Thus the Mayans would have calculated the time of the Winter Solstice at local time, in some major city of their empire, maybe Tikal, Copan, Chichen Itza or some similar significant place. I am told that most of Guatemala is in the Central Time Zone, so that would be a reasonable approximation. Thus 12:11 AM, 12/21/2012 Central Standard Time (daylight time does not apply.) CST is GMT - minus 6 hours Thus about 06:11 AM GMT Time.</Msg><Username>bullwinkle.themoose</Username><Timestamp>1356148459373</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-21 22:54:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356148608374-27</Id><Topic><Title>Apocalypse</Title><Username>nazyoyo</Username><Timestamp>1356124182308</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-21 16:09:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>PS: The EXACT local time would vary by the Mayan city's latitude &amp; longitude.</Msg><Username>bullwinkle.themoose</Username><Timestamp>1356148608374</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-21 22:56:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356149404664-28</Id><Topic><Title>Apocalypse</Title><Username>nazyoyo</Username><Timestamp>1356124182308</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-21 16:09:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>One post I saw suggested that if the ancient Mayans were so good a predicting the future how come their civilization collapsed around 900 AD? Truth is the ancient Mayans were not so wound up in ideas of apocalypse. Their Long Count Calendar ended on the Winter Solstice of 12/21/2012 because that was like the odometer of an old car: it ran up to 99,999 miles on that day then then rolled over to 00,001. Nothing to magic about that. Yes it started a new age and ended a former one. But the ancient Mayans were not so wound up on the idea of the end of the world. An old age ends. A new age begins. The Mayan Calendar is interesting because it may have been developed by the Olmecs (1500 BC to 400 BC) and includes the concept of a place holder zero. They were the first culture in the world to use a zero digit as a place holder. Their "zero" digit was a little sea shell picture. Classic Mayan Civilization was from 500 AD to 900 AD but there is evidence that there was a pre-Classic Mayan culture that ran back to the first century BC.</Msg><Username>bullwinkle.themoose</Username><Timestamp>1356149404664</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-21 23:10:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356149620029-29</Id><Topic><Title>Apocalypse</Title><Username>nazyoyo</Username><Timestamp>1356124182308</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-21 16:09:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You are in "heaven" for all eternity taking it up the butt from 72 "virgin" men!
