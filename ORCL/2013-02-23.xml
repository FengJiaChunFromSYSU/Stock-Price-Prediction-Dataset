Well, that sounds great. However the list of companies that are refusing to sell to gov are ones I've never heard of. If well known companies such as Glock and Beretta start refusing then I'd say they are on to something.</Msg><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1361625154263</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-23 08:12:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361630546739-2</Id><Topic><Title>firearm companies refuse to sell to gov agencies</Title><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1361625154263</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-23 08:12:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Mesa, yet again you demonstrate your idiocy.</Msg><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1361630546739</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-23 09:42:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361631158176-3</Id><Topic><Title>Pope arrest and trial possible?</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1361630936374</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-23 09:48:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Mesa's on a roll again.</Msg><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1361631158176</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-23 09:52:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361634108993-4</Id><Topic><Title>Pope arrest and trial possible?</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1361630936374</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-23 09:48:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Mesa, my values are superior to yours.</Msg><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1361634108993</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-23 10:41:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361635361245-5</Id><Topic><Title>Pope arrest and trial possible?</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1361630936374</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-23 09:48:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Cowardly? How do you figure? It's been years since sex abuse in the Catholic church was the topic du jour. There is no more to be said about it that hasn't already been said. Yet you use the Pope's resignation as a reason the bring up stuff that's already been discussed to death. Only makes sense in your deranged state of mind.</Msg><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1361635361245</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-23 11:02:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361637844573-6</Id><Title>Bob Woodward says obama owns sequestration</Title><Msg>or is it secastration? Anyway, that is what Bob Woodward said, not that the low information voters such as Mesa and Phil would ever acknowledge it. If Obama says repubs are to blame that's good enough for Mesa and Phil. ............................................................................................................................................................................ From the Politico: Journalism icon Bob Woodward wrote in a new Washington Post op-ed first that the sequester was the “brain child” of the White House, calling out President Barack Obama for saying it was created by Congress. “My extensive reporting for my book ‘The Price of Politics’ shows that the automatic spending cuts were initiated by the White House and were the brainchild of [Jack Lew, then-budget director during the negotiations] and White House congressional relations chief Rob Nabors — probably the foremost experts on budget issues in the senior ranks of the federal government,” Woodward wrote on a piece posted on Friday night. Woodward continued: “Obama personally approved of the plan for Lew and Nabors to propose the sequester to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid [D-Nev.]. They did so at 2:30 p.m. July 27, 2011, according to interviews with two senior White House aides who were directly involved.”</Msg><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1361637844573</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-23 11:44:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361638356131-7</Id><Topic><Title>Bob Woodward says obama owns sequestration</Title><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1361637844573</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-23 11:44:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I also believe the cuts need to happen.

I said cuts need to happen. Truth is there are no real cuts. I mean, we're talking $85B out of a mere trillion, right? And they act as if life as we know it will end. Again, low info voters like Mesa will believe it. Further, truth is that it will be far less than 85B. Due to that gawdawful principle known as baseline budgeting where automatic increases occur each year, the cuts will not amount to 85B. In fact, I think there will be more spending than last year. How's that for a cut??</Msg><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1361639373804</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-23 12:09:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361639635276-9</Id><Topic><Title>Bob Woodward says obama owns sequestration</Title><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1361637844573</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-23 11:44:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I might were he to acknowledge it was his idea.

If silence was required of all the cardinals and bishops at the time, then according to demessy, all of them should be responsible. I don't know of anyone, Catholic or otherwise who didn't condemn the church hi-archy for keeping silent. All the priests who were involved have been ex-communicated or are in jail. If demessy doesn't have someone or something to vilify, his day is ruined. However, don't expect him to ever bring up the subject of liberally sick NAMBLA.</Msg><Username>passthebuckaroo</Username><Timestamp>1361647652987</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-23 14:27:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361648726892-13</Id><Topic><Title>More Idiotic babbling from demessy</Title><Username>passthebuckaroo</Username><Timestamp>1361647652987</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-23 14:27:32 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hey, how's it going phyllis?
