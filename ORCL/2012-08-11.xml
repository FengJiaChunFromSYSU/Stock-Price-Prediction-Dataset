I did hear one or two radio talk show hosts complaining that the Olympic Games are a lib thing: track &amp; field for diversity and world peace. That sort of thing. One commentator complained that the games have often or not have intensified hostilites and maybe lead to war. 1936 Berlin Olympics for example. I heard complaints about some of the countries included in the games including: Puerto Rico (as its own country) and the (so called) Palestinian territories. I heard complaints that the Olympic organizers declined to have a moment of silence for the Is real ie team that was murdered by terrorists years ago. (On the anniversary of the event.) I haven't heard anybody contend that it was Obama's Team and they wanted his team to lose. Nor have I heard anyone claim they wanted black Americans to do poorly during the games. I have heard a number of complaints about free condums. Both "official" free condums and "unofficial" free condums. And about the supposed orgy of sex going on after the athlete's personal events are over. There is a certain amount of rivalry between America &amp; China. Last I heard, USA had more oeverall medals. But China may have had a few more gold medals. Don't know if that held up to the end. America was doing well in some of the later events. I was staying over at a customers house and got to watch some of the events. The gymnast Gabby Douglas was pretty cool. At another customers house I got to watch some of the running and the beach volley ball. I also got to see the Canadians doing synchronized swimming. How boring is that? But I think your claim that Conservatives (or Republicans) are cheering for Obama's Team to lose is just plain all wet. Among other things, these athleates have been traing for years before Obama became president. And they represent America, not Obama. We all like to see America doing well.</Msg><Username>bullwinkle.themoose</Username><Timestamp>1344657725000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 00:02:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344658079000-2</Id><Topic><Title>Boy, 9, Dies of Rare Amoeba Infection After Swimming in a Lake</Title><Username>dropkickuuuuuuu</Username><Timestamp>1344656969000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-10 23:49:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Apparently the amoebas can live is lakes with somewhat stagnant water.

These republicans call themselves Christians, which is Blaspheme! They need to be exposed. The party of GREED has no place calling themselves the “Party of God.” If you focus on the scripture you will see how sick these republicans are, as they betray their Imagined Creator. Therefore, how can they be trusted? I don’t like democrats, but I hate republicans worse, because they use GOD to commit their Crimes.</Msg><Username>ivanthedestroyer111</Username><Timestamp>1344723352000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 18:15:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344726202000-40</Id><Topic><Title>.Three more U.S. soldiers killed by Afghans in grim day for NATO..</Title><Username>dropkickuuuuuuu</Username><Timestamp>1344724515000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 18:35:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>that's what happens when you trust mudslums.</Msg><Username>emmma.garcia</Username><Timestamp>1344726202000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 19:03:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344730769000-41</Id><Title>Oh Oh, anti-man alert</Title><Msg>Our Homeland Security Secretary Napolitano is being sued for discrimination against men. Two agents have filed suits this week. A lesbian who was appointed by Obama because she was a lesbian to show he was pro-gay is now barricading the dept from straight men. This is too funny. Gay Power, hahahahahahaha! Almost every person Obama has picked is making his administration look like a remake of SNL or the cast of the Big Bang Theory. Biden, Eric Holder, Napolitano, slip in Pelosi and Reid. They should have their own sitcom.</Msg><Username>passthebuckaroo</Username><Timestamp>1344730769000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 20:19:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344731434000-42</Id><Topic><Title>ryan is a fake.of course.as pointed out here earlier</Title><Username>dropkickuuuuuuu</Username><Timestamp>1344719744000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 17:15:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You're still an idiot buckwheat, just because a VP supports certain policies doesn't mean he'll get Congress to agree. This raking Ryan over the coals is typical liberal goon spin. Nothing gives any pol the power to implement any form of legislation without the express vote of the body of government that controls what goes and what doesn't.
