In plain terms the officers, who paid for the ad themselves, said they support Mr. Romney: "We, the undersigned, proudly support Governor Mitt Romney as our nation's next president and commander-in-chief." The ad then goes on to list all of the officers, in alphabetical order, in four columns of print. The retired admirals and generals said they decided to take this public stand to try to head off "having to live through four more years of what has been experienced since January 20th, 2009."

After throwing the objects like so many dice outside his hut in Kogelo village, Dimo, who says he is 105 years old, points to a white shell and declares: "Obama is very far ahead and is definitely going to win." It's not a surprising result in Kogelo, Obama's late father's hometown in western Kenya and where expectations of another Obama election victory were high on Monday. Most Kenyans consider Obama, the son of a white mother from Kansas and a black father from Kenya, as one of their own.

To paraphrase Dickens, it was the best of coverage and the worst of coverage. If you were President Obama, you got the best of coverage and photos of you with halos around your head. Your made-up autobiography and “composite” girlfriend were a blip in the news, your radical positions downplayed and the ongoing failures of your administration – economy, fast and furious, foreign policy in general – were all given short shrift in the major media. Even your massive failure on Libya where four Americans were killed was somehow “utterly contrived” and CNN’s Candy Crowley covered for you during the debates. Every silly thing your PR people thought up from Big Bird to bayonets to binders received journalistic attention. The major media, on the other hand, turned Mitt Romney into a caricature straight off a Monopoly card. They hollered “Bain” like it was a scene from “Batman,” dug into long-forgotten high school pranks and tried to depict him as radical right-wing, a well as bash him for his faith. A casual comment about the “47 percent” became “seismic” or a “disaster.” Things like the massive decline in the job participation rate and Obama’s $16-trillion nation debt were afterthoughts to news coverage. To paraphrase Dickens, it was the best of coverage and the worst of coverage. The 2012 presidential election wasn’t like the awfully spun race of 2008. It was worse. The media’s longstanding war against conservative women which dominated the race four years ago, turned into a media-created “war on women” that somehow involved the GOP. Rush Limbaugh’s calling the obscure, money-hungry Sandra Fluke a #$%$” became major national news. The vice president saying the GOP wanted to put “y’all back in chains” garnered little notice even though nutty Biden is one heartbeat from the Oval Office. Perhaps journalists were simply projecting as a result of their own attacks against Palin, Bachmann and O’Donnell. While it wasn’t a war on women, it sure was a war on truth and truth lost most days. The top issue to voters was the economy, but you’d never know it from the news coverage. Even the GOP primary, moderators pushed social issues to give Team Obama ample distractions from the 23 million under and unemployed. When economic news was covered, it looked nothing like it had during the Bush administration. This time journalists found or created a silver lining inside every dark cloud. High gas prices weren’t bad, they were “improving.” And lousy economic growth was seldom called a major Obama failure.</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1352126692701</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-05 09:44:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352126751100-6</Id><Topic><Title>Let me see,Obama has a large lead with the women's vote,the Latino vote,</Title><Username>whycantphiligetawoman</Username><Timestamp>1352044340106</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 10:52:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Surging Mitt says Obama ‘blue it’ in once-loyal Keystone State By S.A. MILLER in Morrisville, Pa.,and GEOFF EARLE in Cincinnati Last Updated: 8:49 AM, November 5, 2012 Posted: 12:36 AM, November 5, 2012 Mitt Romney yesterday stormed into Pennsylvania in a bold move to try to snatch away one of President Obama’s strongholds, as new polls showed the race tightening in the Keystone State with the election just a day away. “What a Philadelphia welcome,” Romney said to thunderous cheers from about 20,000 supporters who greeted him as he took the stage to the stirring theme song from the movie "Rocky." “This audience and your voices are being heard all over our nation, and they are helping the people of America understand we’re taking back the White House because we’re going to win Pennsylvania,” Romney told the rally at Shady Brook Farms in the suburbs of Philadelphia. Reuters Mitt Romney attends a rally yesterday in Cleveland, Ohio. Six hundred miles away, in New Hampshire, Obama moved to protect his flank in a swing state where he holds a slim lead. “I know I look a little bit older, but I am not ready to give up the fight, and I hope you aren’t either,” he told a rally of 14,000 people in Concord. “We have come too far to turn back now. We have come too far to let our hearts grow faint.” Romney’s rally in the Philadelphia suburbs to woo voters who backed Obama in 2008 was part of his strong push to expand the electoral map for Republicans. He also is making a play for Iowa, New Hampshire and Wisconsin. These are all considered swing states, but Pennsylvania hasn’t gone Republican since 1988, Wisconsin hasn’t since 1984, and Iowa goes Democrat more than not. A Romney upset in Pennsylvania, with its 20 electoral votes, would dramatically improve his chance of racking up the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House. Republicans have poured more than $10 million into the state in recent ad buys, forcing Democrats to divert resources from other battlegrounds into the state, as well. To try to head off an upset in Pennsylvania, Obama sent former President Bill Clinton to campaign for him today in Pittsburgh, Philadelphia and Scranton. “They’re worried about losing Vice President Joe Biden’s hometown [of Scranton], and they are going to lose Joe Biden’s hometown,” Romney adviser Stuart Stevens told The Post. “We’re at the point now where the bluffing is over,” he said.</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1352126751100</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-05 09:45:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352127682406-7</Id><Title>If voting made any difference----</Title><Msg>it would be against the law.</Msg><Username>lewcor</Username><Timestamp>1352127682406</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-05 10:01:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352129041177-8</Id><Topic><Title>Let me see,Obama has a large lead with the women's vote,the Latino vote,</Title><Username>whycantphiligetawoman</Username><Timestamp>1352044340106</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 10:52:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Most Kenyans consider Obama, the son of a white mother from Kansas and a black father from Kenya, as one of their own.
