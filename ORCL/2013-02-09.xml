If there was another option for SS and Medicare, it still comes out of your pocket and you would still pay for welfare "entitlements". The individual is "entitled" to SS because they paid into it. I have a retirement savings account besides SS. Based on a screwball liberal concept, that would be an entitlement. Don't you see the logic?</Msg><Username>annieshenanigan</Username><Timestamp>1360429504428</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-09 12:05:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360431124510-5</Id><Topic><Title>Only liberals, socialists, and morons consider Social Security and Medicare as an entitlement</Title><Username>indahouzza</Username><Timestamp>1360415549114</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-09 08:12:29 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Too bad they have been turned into world-class Ponzi Schemes, where the only thing that keeps them going is NEW money!!</Msg><Username>moveon_moveoutnow</Username><Timestamp>1360431124510</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-09 12:32:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360441818150-6</Id><Topic><Title>UE rose 2.8% in w's last year</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1360440008628</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-09 15:00:08 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Unemployment Reality When President Bush took office in Jan-2001 U/E rate was 4.2%. It wavered up an down with a high of 6.3% in Jun-2003. When the Democrats took over Congress in Jan-2007 U/E rate was 4.6%. U/E Rate stayed low until the Democrat Congress sabotaged the economy in 2008 to get Barack Obama elected. The UE rate increased to 6.8% by Nov-2008 (elections) and then 7.3% in Dec-2008 and 7.8% in Jan-2009. In Feb-2009 Democrat President Barack Obama did a "Stimulus Package" to assure us that U/E rate would stay under 8%. Instead U/E rate increased to 8.9% in Feb-2009 and eventually to a high of 10.0% in Oct-2009. The U/E rate remained over 9.0% for all of 2010. America voted in a Republican majority House of Representatives in Jan-2011, but the Senate &amp; Presidency continue to be Democrat controlled. And the Democrats insist on pursing dogmatic non-solutions to unemployment ("tax the rich.") The U/E rate decreased to being over 8% for most of 2012, then at the end of the year, just in time to influence the elections the calculated number decreased to being below 8% for the first time in 43 months. Analysis of the data shows that the decrease in U/E is NOT because of an increase of employed, but rather because of a increase of people dropping out of the labor market. Some due to early retirement. Others to disability. Others just disappeared from the market. In fact the employment participation rate is the lowest its been in about 40 years. And this is all due to Democrat policies destroying employment, opportunity and income in America since 2007.</Msg><Username>ourfirstpantroglodytepresident</Username><Timestamp>1360441818150</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-09 15:30:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360441972702-7</Id><Title>It's another day and delucks345 posts same old BS</Title><Msg>Same old, same old.
