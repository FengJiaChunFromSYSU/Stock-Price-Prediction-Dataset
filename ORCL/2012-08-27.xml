He was 78. Nelson, who suffered from emphysema, died Thursday night in his Massachusetts home on Cape Cod, the Sesame Workshop said Friday. "Every description of his characters describes Jerry as well," said "Sesame Street" executive producer Carol-Lynn Parente. "Silly, funny, vulnerable, passionate and musical, for sure. That voice of his was superb." Although he'd been in declining health for some time "his attitude was never bad," Parente said Friday. "He was always so grateful for what he had in his life."

It is not the first time Obama has sat down with Glamour — he did so in 2008, along with John McCain — but it is his first time as a sitting president. ... Glamour pitched them on a big audience, said Washington editor Linda Kramer Jenning. “There’s a lot of attention being paid to young, women voters,” Jenning said. “That’s the calling card that opens the door.” It took five months to lock down some face time. Jenning said Leive asked the president about women’s health care, among other topics, even though the interview took place before the recent uproar over the antediluvian comments about rape by Missouri Rep. Todd Akin.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1346086162004</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-27 12:49:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346086331000-30</Id><Topic><Title>Rendell: Ryan a Fiscal Fraud</Title><Username>dropkickuuuuuuu</Username><Timestamp>1346084401000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-27 12:20:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Last "budget" Obama suggested go ZERO votes in the House and ZERO votes in the Senate.

Per Wikipedia: G W Bush's in office Jan-20-2001 to Jan-20-2009 Highest seasonally adjusted U/E rate during his term was 7.8% in Jan-2009. By the way, even on a "Not seasonally adjusted" basis, Bush started with 4.7% and ended with 8.5% which is still NOT double. The "seasonally adjusted" data is what most economic reporters refer to as the "official" unemployment rate. Yes, dear, "BLS" means "Bureau of Labor Statistics." (Why in the world would you mistake it for crime statistics. It is true that the Obama statistics SHOULD be a crime against America!) Barack H. Obama took office on Jan-20-2009 Barack H. Obama's First (and hopefully last) term in office will end Jan-20-2013. (Spot me a day or two due to Sundays or holidays.) Using seasonally adjusted data (which is what most knowledgeable people use): When Obama too office the U/E rate was 7.8% As of Jul-2012 it is 8.3% and increasing. He has been in office for 43 months and the U/E rate has been over 8% for 42 of those months. During his term it has averaged over 9%. On a "not seasonally adjusted" basis, Obama has had U/E rate over 8% for every month he has been in office. Also, this table gives annual averages: 2009 = 9.3% 2010 = 9.6% 2011 = 8.9% You are so dumb and so uninformed!</Msg><Username>orsa_novus</Username><Timestamp>1346092203000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-27 14:30:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346092550000-40</Id><Topic><Title>Doofus, you can review the statistics at the BLS</Title><Username>dropkickuuuuuuu</Username><Timestamp>1346086167000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-27 12:49:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>PS: Feb-2008 U/E rate = 5.0% I guess you typeoed 2009 as 2008.

Jackson asks why GOP 'spared' by tropical storm By Daniel Strauss - 08/27/12 04:53 PM ET Samuel L. Jackson on Monday tweeted it was "unfair" that Tropical Storm Isaac had spared the GOP convention in Tampa and appeared to be heading for New Orleans. Jackson said in a profanity-filled tweet that he was "not understanding God's plan" given the fact that the strorm was not disrupting the Republican gathering. "Unfair s---," the Oscar-nominated actor known for his colorful language said on Twitter. "GOP spared by Isaac! NOLA prolly f----- again!" Less than a half-hour later, Jackson apologized for the earlier tweet, writing that it had stirred up a hornet's nest. "Apologies to God, Tampa, da GOP&amp; Isaac(sp)! Who played the Race card?!," he said on Twitter. Jackson isn't the only one to issue strongly worded language questioning a link between politics and Isaac. Over the past few days, conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh has suggested that serious warnings about tropical storm weather by the federal government was the Obama administration attempting to scuttle the Republican National Convention. Earlier on Monday, MSNBC host Chris Matthews accused presumptive GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney and other Republicans of playing the race card against Obama.</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1346109220350</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-27 19:13:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346109656000-50</Id><Topic><Title>TWELVE American GI's Shot Dead By Islamic Scum Afghan Troops!

But it is also at a rate of about $1.4 trillion per year, which is a rate 224% FASTER than Bush was increasing it! We can also observe that Obama is the Historic First President to NEVER have a budget! NEVER! Now, when Obama was voted into office in 2008, we had economic problems, and HIS job was to fix them!

According to droopydick, that is ALMOST DOUBLE! So from now on I will insist that Obama DOUBLED the average unemployment rate! And for 43 MONTHS TOO!</Msg><Username>orsa_novus</Username><Timestamp>1346121172000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-27 22:32:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346121683000-63</Id><Topic><Title>Bush AVERAGE eU/E Rate v.
