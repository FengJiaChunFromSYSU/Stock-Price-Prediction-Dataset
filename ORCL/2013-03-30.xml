Written 2,000 years ago. Flavius Josephus's, "Antiquities Of The Jews." The most interesting part is from the end of the Old Testament until the time of Christ. He writes of some things that most Christians are very deluded about. They make many things much clearer about what really went on and the liars that have tried to hide truth for those 2,000 years. Josephus was a true Israelite, a scholar and a soldier.
