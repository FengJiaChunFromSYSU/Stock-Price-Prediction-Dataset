CBS News reports that is has unearthed documents from the Diplomatic Security Service (DSS), an internal watchdog agency, that implicate the State Department in a series of misconducts worldwide. The memo, reported by CBS News’ John Miller, cited eight specific examples, including allegations that a State Department security official in Beirut “engaged in sexual assaults” with foreign nationals hired as embassy guards and the charge and that members of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s security detail “engaged prostitutes while on official trips in foreign countries” — a problem the report says was “endemic.” Former State Department internal investigator Aurelia Fedenisn told CBS News, “We also uncovered several allegations of criminal wrongdoing in cases, some of which never became cases.” Often times, other DSS agents were simply told to back off of investigations of high-ranking State Department members. Fedenisn told CBS that “hostile intelligence services” allow criminal behavior to continue. In one such cover-up, investigators were told to stop probing the case of a U.S. ambassador who was suspected of patronizing prostitutes in a public park. The memo states that the ambassador was permitted to return to his pos</Msg><Username>hikemanymiles</Username><Timestamp>1370873569554</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-10 10:12:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370874441139-10</Id><Title>shameful stat</Title><Msg>In Richmond Va 86% of black families are headed by a single mother.

The Diplomatic Security Service, or the DSS, is the State Department's security force, charged with protecting the secretary of state and U.S. ambassadors overseas and with investigating any cases of misconduct on the part of the 70,000 State Department employees worldwide. CBS News' John Miller reports that according to an internal State Department Inspector General's memo, several recent investigations were influenced, manipulated, or simply called off. The memo obtained by CBS News cited eight specific examples. Among them: allegations that a State Department security official in Beirut "engaged in sexual assaults" on foreign nationals hired as embassy guards and the charge and that members of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's security detail "engaged prostitutes while on official trips in foreign countries" -- a problem the report says was "endemic." The memo also reveals details about an "underground drug ring" was operating near the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad and supplied State Department security contractors with drugs. Aurelia Fedenisn, a former investigator with the State Department's internal watchdog agency, the Inspector General, told Miller, "We also uncovered several allegations of criminal wrongdoing in cases, some of which never became cases." In such cases, DSS agents told the Inspector General's investigators that senior State Department officials told them to back off, a charge that Fedenisn says is "very" upsetting. "We were very upset. We expect to see influence, but the degree to which that influence existed and how high up it went, was very disturbing," she said.</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1370877148693</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-10 11:12:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370877864493-12</Id><Topic><Title>Snowden Is An American Hero!!

NSA has massive database of Americans' phone calls Updated 5/11/2006 10:38 AM ET By Leslie Cauley, USA TODAY The National Security Agency has been secretly collecting the phone call records of tens of millions of Americans, using data provided by AT&amp;T, Verizon and BellSouth, people with direct knowledge of the arrangement told USA TODAY. The NSA program reaches into homes and businesses across the nation by amassing information about the calls of ordinary Americans — most of whom aren't suspected of any crime.The spy agency is using the data to analyze calling patterns in an effort to detect terrorist activity, sources said in separate interviews. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS: The NSA record collection program "It's the largest database ever assembled in the world," said one person, who, like the others who agreed to talk about the NSA's activities, declined to be identified by name or affiliation. The agency's goal is "to create a database of every call ever made" within the nation's borders, this person added. For the customers of these companies, it means that the government has detailed records of calls they made — across town or across the country — to family members, co-workers, business contacts and others. The three telecommunications companies are working under contract with the NSA, which launched the program in 2001 shortly after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the sources said. The program is aimed at identifying and tracking suspected terrorists, they said.</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1370887107654</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-10 13:58:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370887370144-27</Id><Title>This Just In</Title><Msg>AP is snooping on the WH Reported this conversation "Another scandal, Mr. Pres?"

State Department brass quashed several internal probes into possible sexual assaults, prostitution solicitation and drug dealing by diplomatic personnel overseas, according to a bombshell broadcast report today. Internal memos by the department’s internal watchdog, the Inspector General, showed there were open investigations last year of several state employees - including an ambassador suspected of trolling a park for prostitutes — that simply went away, allegedly because of pressure from high-ranking State Department officials, CBS News reported. Memos showed that probes included allegations of: - An ambassador who “routinely ditched his protective security detail … to solicit sexual favors from … prostitutes” in parks. - The security detail of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had “engaged prostitutes while on official trips in foreign countries” in a practice that is “endemic.” - That a State Department security official in Beirut sexually assaulted foreign nationals hired as embassy guards. - A drug ring was being run near the Baghdad embassy, which supplied narcotics to state department contractors. But in a final Inspector General’s report on Diplomatic Security Services, that followed up on these accusations, all references to these alleged wrongdoings were removed, according to CBS. “We also uncovered several allegations of criminal wrongdoing in cases … some of which never became cases,” said Aurelia Fedenisn, a whistleblower and former investigator for the Inspector General. “We were very upset.

Maybe you should stop listening to Limbaugh. You quote him more than anyone here. Too funny that liberals listen to him and Fox News. You should be watching BSNBC, their ratings are at a 7 year low. No wonder, their lineup in primetime is made up of crackpots who babble the same nonsense we hear here. Fox News is still #1 partly due to dumb liberals like you who hate them but tune in. Duh!</Msg><Username>passthebuckaroo</Username><Timestamp>1370921901706</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-10 23:38:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
