His dad ran a small local newspaper and was in with "Moonbeam" Brown's father in CA. I talked to him at length and believe I actually got him to see how wrong he was. Some time later he visited Turkey and was caught with marijuana and put in prison. I was really sorry as I felt he was really trying to come up with truth. Don't know what happened to him after that. I will say though that the so called "right" are under many illusions too. They fell for the "Big Lie" about Iraq and Saddam.

Hey, they give you endless undeclared an illegal wars that channel trillions of dollars to the military industrial complex. I've heard a story that volunteer firefighters that worked on Arizona's fires last year STILL haven't been paid. I had cataract surgery over six months ago. I was supposed to get a small rebate from the U.S. on my new reading glasses. I have yet to see it. Yes, it's bad when thieves run corporations but it's much worse when they run government. I'm a disabled vet and can't get to see a VA doctor here in less than a year. I was told that in an emergency I would first go to a private hospital and then apply for admission to the VA Hospital. Many others are in the same boat.
