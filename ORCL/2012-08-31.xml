At least according to the State Department. Chief Diversity Officer John Robinson penned a column in the department's latest edition of "State Magazine" advising readers on some rather obscure Ps and Qs. Robinson ticked off several common phrases and went on to explain why their roots are racially or culturally insensitive. The result was a list of no-nos that could easily result in some tongue-tied U.S. diplomats, particularly in an administration that swaps "war on terror" for "overseas contingency operation" and once shied away from using the word "terrorism." For instance, Robinson warned, "hold down the fort" is a potentially insulting reference to American Indian stereotypes. "How many times have you or a colleague asked if someone could 'hold down the fort?'" he wrote. "You were likely asking someone to watch the office while you go and do something else, but the phrase's historical connotation to some is negative and racially offensive." He explained: "To 'hold down the fort' originally meant to watch and protect against the vicious Native American intruders. In the territories of the West, Army soldiers or settlers saw the 'fort' as their refuge from their perceived 'enemy,' the stereotypical 'savage' Native American tribes." He singled out another phrase, "Going Dutch," as a "negative stereotype portraying the Dutch as cheap." And "rule of thumb," he wrote, can according to women's activists refer "to an antiquated law, whereby the width of a husband's thumb was the legal size of a switch or rod allowed to beat his wife." Further, he explained, "If her bruises were not larger than the width of his thumb, the husband could not be brought to court to answer for his behavior because he had not violated the 'rule of thumb.'" He went on to urge caution over the word "handicap," as some disability advocates "believe this term is rooted in a correlation between a disabled individual and a beggar, who had to beg with a cap in his or her hand because of the inability to maintain employment."</Msg><Username>liberals_plague_humanity</Username><Timestamp>1346419582655</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 09:26:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346420720000-14</Id><Title>dropkick does one post every 6.4 minutes</Title><Msg>For 2 1/4 hourr!

Case in point was the rush of "fact check" stories claiming Ryan misled when he talked about a shuttered auto plant in his home state. Washington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler posted a piece — "Ryan misleads on GM plant closing in hometown" — saying Ryan "appeared to suggest" that Obama was responsible for the closure of a GM plant in Janesville, Wis. "That's not true," Kessler said. "The plant was closed in December 2008, before Obama was sworn in." What's not true are Kessler's "facts." Ryan didn't suggest Obama was responsible for shuttering the plant. Instead, he correctly noted that Obama promised during the campaign that the troubled plant "will be here for another hundred years" if his policies were enacted. Also, the plant didn't close in December 2008. It was still producing cars until April 2009. An AP "fact check" also claimed that "the plant halted production in December 2008" even though the AP itself reported in April 2009 that the plant was only then "closing for good." CNN's John King made the same claim about that plant closure. But when CNN looked more carefully at the evidence, it — to its credit — concluded that what Ryan said was "true." mp3Subscribe to the IBD Editorials Podcast Media fact-checkers also complained about Ryan's charge that Obama is cutting $716 billion from Medicare to fund ObamaCare. Not true, they said. Medicare's growth is just being slowed. But Obama achieves that slower growth by making real cuts in provider payments. And in any case, the media always and everywhere call a reduction in the rate of federal spending growth a "cut." So why suddenly charge Ryan with being misleading for using that same term? In any case, Obama himself admitted that he's doing what Ryan says. In a November 2009 interview with ABC News, reporter Jake Tapper said to Obama that "one-third of the funding comes from cuts to Medicare," to which Obama's response was: "Right." The rest of Ryan's alleged factual errors aren't errors at all; it's just that the media didn't like how he said it. But since when is it a fact-checker's job to decide how a politician should construct his arguments? This isn't to say that journalists shouldn't check facts. Of course they should. The problem is that the mainstream press is now abusing the "fact check" label, using it to more aggressively push a liberal agenda without feeling the need to provide any balance whatsoever. And, as the reaction to the Ryan speech shows, they are now blatantly using it to provide air support for Obama. Is it any wonder that soon after Ryan's speech ended, the Obama campaign rushed out an ad using the media's "fact check" stories as its source?</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1346423270690</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 10:27:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346423872294-17</Id><Title>Clint forgot that it was Bush who invaded Bushghanistan</Title><Msg>The 82-year-old actor was critical of Obama’s war in Afghanistan, saying he should have considered that Russia fought unsuccessfully there for 10 years."....... yeah, why didn't you tell that to ajole bush and the gop who invaded and occupied Bushghanistan?????? obama is the guy who simply went and killed bin laden which is what W should have done instead of invading and occupying iraq and afghanistan putting it all on the charge card.</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1346423872294</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 10:37:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346424419991-18</Id><Topic><Title>GOP = trillions in tax cuts to rich, and trillions in tax hikes to the middle class</Title><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1346344200978</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 12:30:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ryan is just a liar. the $700 billion cut from medicare is 10% over 10 years. and what was cut was medicare advantage that only 25% of seniors use and which costs about 15% MORE than the very same treatment from traditional medicare... that 15% in higher costs is just gop corporate welfare a gift to the big insurers..........

Vote for Us!" The footage of Eastwood rambling and mumbling to his "Harvey" - President Obama - will be played to audiences a hundred years from now as the Most Bizarre Convention Moment Ever. The people of the future will know nothing about Dirty Harry or Josey Wales or a Million Dollar Baby. They WILL know about the night a crazy old man hijacked a national party's most important gathering so he could tell the President to literally go do something to himself (i.e. ---- himself). In those few moments (and these days, it only takes a few moments—see Anthony Weiner), he completely upended and redefined how he'll be remembered by younger and future generations. A few years ago, at the annual National Board of Review film awards held at Tavern on the Green in New York, I was there to hand out one of the honors. When it came time for Eastwood to accept his, he went up to the microphone and growled to me in front of the audience, "If you ever show up at my house with that camera, I'll shoot you on sight." The audience laughed, I laughed, but the person who issued the threat wasn't laughing. That creeped me out a bit. I made sure never to go stand on Clint Eastwood's lawn. But as I said, the best outcome from the incident last night was that it showed just how out of touch Republicans are these days. It's as if they want a divorce from us, the American mainstream, so they can go live in the land of legitimate rapes and ice caps that don't melt. Most Americans don't live there on Planet Koo-koo, and I don't suspect many will be visiting there any time soon. Thanks, Clint: you made our day!

If tradition means anything that would put silver at 100/oz. So it seems that silver is very undervalued. Some the the reports I've been reading say silver should outperform gold. Silver has lots of industrial uses. Gold has few. Plus, if things fall apart silver can be used for real money. I have some junk silver.

And Paul Ryan’s budget would gut disaster funding, making it much harder to get aid to our fellow Americans in their time of need,” he added. All of which is perfectly true. Last year, House Republicans created yet another crisis over the budget, with emergency disaster funding as their hostage.
