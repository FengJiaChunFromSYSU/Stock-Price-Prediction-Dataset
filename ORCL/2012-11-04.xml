Of course, he has to make good on his promise in Florida that none of us senior citizens will ever lose a penny of what the GOP denigrates as our retirement “entitlements,” and that all of his anti-socialist budget balancing cuts will be exclusively at the expense of younger folks. It’s only socialism when government benefits are extended to people other than us. I am down with the tea party types who demand that the government keep its clammy hands off our Social Security and Medicare programs. Yes, as long as Medicare remains a for-profit, free-market program, we seniors won’t have to contend with death panels like under Obamacare. What we need instead of that socialist claptrap with which Obama has enslaved us is the insurance coverage that Romney required people in Massachusetts to purchase. Oh yes, true Obamacare is exactly modeled on Romneycare, but just consider the source. When Romney mandated that citizens in his state be required to buy health insurance, it was an extension of the free market. But when Obama gets the same requirement passed for the rest of us, you just know how dark his motives are. At least we non-Kenyan white males do." robert sheer</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1352045205243</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 11:06:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352045362361-37</Id><Topic><Title>creator of Faux news, Murdoch blames Christie for possible Romney loss</Title><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1352045015085</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 11:03:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Bet you know nothing about Rupert Murdoch.

A business coordinator at a power company in western Georgia confirmed that workers from his electric-utility employer were not permitted to help restore power to New York consumers because they would not join the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW). The revelation comes on the heels of similar stories reported about power crews from Alabama and Florida who volunteered to fix downed power lines after Hurricane Sandy left millions in the Northeastern United States in the dark this week. “We’re not a large utility, so we were only able to send up two or three crews,” Glenn Cunningham, a business continuity coordinator with Diverse Power in Georgia.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1352045948157</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 11:19:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352046033590-39</Id><Topic><Title>Let me see,Obama has a large lead with the women's vote,the Latino vote,</Title><Username>whycantphiligetawoman</Username><Timestamp>1352044340106</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 10:52:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Boy, what are you going to do when reality hits you in the face?

One key to the outcome on Election Day will be the racial and ethnic mix of the electorate. In 2008, approximately 74% of voters were white. Polls show increased enthusiasm among white voters and decreased enthusiasm among Hispanic voters. It is significant because Romney attracts 58% or more of the white vote. If the white turnout increases on Election Day, it will be very difficult for the president to win. Black voters are far more likely to have voted already than any other segment of the electorate. Early totals show Obama trailing in the early vote or behind where he needs to b All the negative spew from Obama has affected the country. Over one-out-of-four Americans (27%) say the upcoming election has negatively affected their personal relationship with a friend or family member.

With all that excitement over voting for the first black prez, all Obama could get was 53%. Here we are 4 years later. Of the 47% who voted for McCain the, how many of them will vote for Obama now? Virtually zero. Of the 53% who excitedly voted for Obama then, do you think it's barely possible that at least 3% of that 53% won't vote for him now? Very possible. Likely in fact. My daughter and son-in-law, as an example, both voted for Obama 4 years ago. They both will vote for Romney this time. It's not complicated except in your simple liberal mind.</Msg><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1352054748001</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 13:45:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352065248111-44</Id><Title>I know the problem---</Title><Msg>with the lefties on this board.
