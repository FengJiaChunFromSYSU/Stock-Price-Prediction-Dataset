Ann says women should not be allowed to vote. And you are such a "prostitute" as Rush would say, for spouting off your political ideas, You should only talk about motherhood and about how women do not deserve equal pay for equal work as per the gop. Plenty of people in the gop think that women should not even be allowed to vote and certainly the rightwing billionaire Theil says just that. . i bet you just hate it that 17% of the US Senate are women, for instance.........and nevermind that 51% of the USA are Women. If i was as scummy as a rush or a coulter i would wish that you and yours get raped often and pregnant each and every year and have to bear and raise each and every rapist's kid, and give them visitation rights and then they can rape you again and have more kids with you, all as per your slutty political ideas.</Msg><Username>granniefritz</Username><Timestamp>1347108111056</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-08 08:41:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347108837749-3</Id><Title>a republican woman's fantasy</Title><Msg>"take away women's right to vote..........It's a personal fantasy of mine.' ann coulter "I think women should should not vote " ann coulter "It would be a much better country if women did not vote.

More than half (43) of those months have been under President Obama – more than the previous 11 presidents combined. This is why the biased Gallup poll is worthless. Much better to look at the econometric model that the University of Colorado has developed over the last 32 years. The UC model has NEVER been wrong in predicting the presidential winner. This year, the model shows that Romney is the clear winner. Read details of how Obama gets taken to the woodshed here: If Obama does win in November, it will demonstrate that the US has passed a point of no return. That is, when the 49% of people who pay no Federal Income Taxes, the 33% of people who receive some type of welfare, the 43 million people who are now on Food Stamps, and who knows how many people who are voting fraudulently with the help of ACORN and Eric Holder, are voting to assure their flow of free money.

Roll Call reporter Steven Dennis Tweeted: We shouldn’t be surprised at this, though it is incredibly ironic that the party that claims that the opposing party is waging a “War on Women” is promoting such trash. They already have their line up of “pro-death” women including the very open, sexually promiscuous Sandra Fluke of “I want free contraception and I want the government to pay for it” fame. The real culprits of the war on women is the Democrat Party. They openly encourage women to be sluts and then to be murderers because of their promiscuity by aborting children when they become pregnant. They encourage all forms of sexual promiscuity, including homosexuality. In fact, a report was out today that Planned Parenthood will be hosting an invitation-only “Sex, Politics, and Cocktails” party on the first night of the DNC in Charlotte, NC at the Privilege Club. According to the Charlotte Observer, Sex, Politics, and Cocktails is Planned Parenthood Action Fund’s invitation-only signature party. At this event we will highlight the Planned Parenthood Action Fund’s“Women are Watching” campaign and will feature Cecile Richards, Planned Parenthood Action Fund President, PPAF endorsed candidates, members of Congress and other guests. Well nothing says how much women are loved and respected like having a sex-themed party hosted by those ready to take women’s money regardless of the psychological or physical trauma that a woman will endure from an abortion or the fact that a child will be murdered. At least now we know why Bill Clinton is really attending the DNC. It’s not bad enough that women dress themselves up as vaginas in broad daylight to say how much they are disrespected by Republicans, now they will be donning these tasteless “#$%$s Vote” buttons as well. Again, nothing says “respect me” like putting on a five foot vagina costume and walking around Washington, D.C. with a sign which reads, “Congress: Respect Women.” Next thing you know, the DNC will be having pole dancers on stage and paid #$%$ for by the DNC itself. Part of that may already be going on.</Msg><Username>liberals_plague_humanity</Username><Timestamp>1347112262296</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-08 09:51:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347112373262-6</Id><Title>all male republican panel to decide women's healthcare</Title><Msg>Issa's all male panel on contraception , not something that women need concern themselves with or even offer any input.
