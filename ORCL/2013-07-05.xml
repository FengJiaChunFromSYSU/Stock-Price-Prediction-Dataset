Take Oliver Stone for example who on the Fourth of July actually said of the United States at a film festival in the Czech Republic, "The world is in danger with our tyranny." As The Wrap reported moments ago, Stone also said during a press conference at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival, "It's a disgrace that Obama is more concerned with hunting down Snowden than reforming these George Bush-style eavesdropping techniques...To me, Snowden is a hero, because he revealed secrets that we should all know, that the United States has repeatedly violated the Fourth Amendment." "He should be welcomed, and offered asylum," Stoned continued, "but he has no place to hide because every country is intimidated by the United States. This should not be. This is what's wrong with the world today, and it's very important that the world recognizes and gives asylum to Snowden. Everyone in the world is impacted by the United States' Big Brother attitude toward the world." But he didn't stop there. In front of a room of mostly European journalists, Stone said, "We need countries to say no to the United States." "The United States is the dominant power in the universe, with its eavesdropping abilities, cyber abilities," he continued. "And the world is in danger with our tyranny." And this is what an American says in the Czech Republic on the Fourth of July. How disgraceful.</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1373025687929</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-05 08:01:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373026192480-2</Id><Topic><Title>Obama's Team, The Muslim Brotherhood, Loses BIG In Egypt!</Title><Username>corpusamericana</Username><Timestamp>1372943912789</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-04 09:18:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Exactly....

Not sure, but what difference does it make? The stupidity of liberal equality means forcing the acceptance of abnormal behavior. They should make it a law that these misfits can't transgender until they're 18 or out of school. What about a transgendered girl showering with the boys? Sheesh, only in Calif. I would guess that normal kids would protest this move.

Like the first-responders to 9/11 and other emergencies, and members of the armed forces, they put themselves in harm’s way (or chose a job that did so) because they wanted to serve. Economics, and much of public policy and political strategy, assume that people are motivated by self-interest, that the definition of acting rationally is to maximize what you want for yourself, and that other values – service, duty, allegiance to others, morality, and shared ideals – are either irrelevant or negligible.

Zimmerman then informed the police dispatcher that Martin started running. The dispatcher told Zimmerman to not chase after Martin. "I wasn't following. I was going in same direction as him," Zimmerman told Serino in an interview a couple days after the shooting. "That's following," Serino replied, incredulous. Another police investigator, Doris Singleton, then jumped in, asking Zimmerman: "Do you think he was afraid?" she asked. "You never told him you were? You could have told him? Right?" Zimmerman replied: "He caught me off guard.”</Msg><Username>hydroponicoctopus</Username><Timestamp>1373059621158</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-05 17:27:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373061103324-23</Id><Topic><Title>USA has 10 times the teen pregnancy rate</Title><Username>hydroponicoctopus</Username><Timestamp>1373031002696</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-05 09:30:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>gop is against sex education which is proven to reduce teen pregnancy and therefore the need for teens to have abortions.</Msg><Username>hydroponicoctopus</Username><Timestamp>1373061103324</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-05 17:51:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373064424029-24</Id><Topic><Title>OK for anyone to chase after strangers who are not doing anything wrong, and then kill them if they put up a fight?</Title><Username>hydroponicoctopus</Username><Timestamp>1373059182747</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-05 17:19:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>never hurt or in mortal danger?
