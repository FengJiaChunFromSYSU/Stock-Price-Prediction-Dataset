Thus, Mr. Buffett calculates his taxable income by first deducting his payroll expense, and only pays taxes on the remainder. His secretary pays 20% tax on her income so that, in essence, is the only tax that was paid on Mr. Buffett's revenue that was attributable to her salary. When a corporation that Mr. Romney owns stock in decides to distribute some of it's profits as a dividend to Mr. Romney, it must pay taxes on that income BEFORE it distributes the dividend... and that tax maxes out at the highest corporate tax in the world... 35%. When Mr. Romney receives it, he must then pay tax on the dividend he receives, at up to 15%. Together, Mr. Romney and his corporation ends up paying a tax that can amount to as much as 50% of the income the corporation earned. Because BOTH are taxed on it, it's essentially "double taxed". Again, for the neanderthals: Warren's secretary: 20%... Warren himself: 0%... total at both levels: 20%. Mitt Romney: 15%... Mitt's dividend paying corporation: 35%.... total at both levels, up to 50%. Mr. Obama wants to widen the gap in 2 ways: 1. Tax dividends as "ordinary income", making the top rate 35% for the dividend receiver. 2. Raise the top bracket to 39.6% plus the Obamacare surcharge of 3.8% for a max bracket of 43.4%. Under Obama's proposal, the max tax on earnings distributed as dividends would be 43.4% at the individual level plus 35% at the corporate level for a total max rate of 78.4%... which compares to just 20% that Warren Buffett and his secretary collectively pay. Mr. Obama's speeches typically say that he thinks the wealthy should pay "just a little bit more"... ... anybody who thinks a total tax rate of almost 4 TIMES what Buffett and his secretary pay is "just a little bit" should have their intelligence evaluated accordingly. Hope this helps. *** Excellent post. Lemmings are easily swayed to vote for the candidate the lib media makes popular while piling on the candidate who actually had good ideas for resurrecting the economy -- unfortunately, the majority of the voting public is stupid and can be manipulated by race (vote black), abortion scare tactics or immigration promises.

It may take election experts years to unravel the mystery of why Mitt Romney was convinced he had won the 2012 presidential election, as a new report shows some skewed internal poll numbers, and explains Romney’s two trips to Pennsylvania. But at the same time, the article from The New Republic’s Noam Scheiber shows inconsistencies with reports from November 5 and November 6 about the numbers that might have convinced Romney and his team that he had a good chance of beating President Barack Obama in Ohio. Obama’s resounding win is starting to take on more of a resemblance to Harry Truman’s “upset” in 1948, with Romney playing the role of Thomas Dewey. Obama wound up with 332 electoral votes, taking every swing state except North Carolina. Somehow, the Romney campaign was seemingly convinced that he would win one of the final three swing states, or make a strong showing in Pennsylvania. In the article, Scheiber goes over Romney’s internal polling numbers from six swing states with Neil Newhouse, the Republican pollster who did the surveys on the weekend before the election. Scheiber obtained the numbers from a source and Newhouse agreed to talk about the six states. The conclusion is that Romney, based on his internal polls, thought he had at least 267 out of the 270 electoral votes needed to win the election, and the election would be decided in four states: Ohio, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Nevada The campaign was also convinced it had momentum in the overall election as voters headed to the polls. The Romney campaign also believed Pennsylvania was a closer race that Wisconsin, which is why Romney appeared twice in the Keystone State just before the election. There’s little discussion in The New Republic story about Nevada, so you can scratch Wisconsin and Nevada from the swing state list, which leaves Ohio and Pennsylvania as the states where the Romney campaign thought it could win the presidential election. The New Republic provides Romney’s internal polling numbers for Pennsylvania, which showed Obama with a three-point lead. So it seems like Ohio was the focal point of the campaign. The New Republic didn’t obtain detailed Ohio internal polling numbers, but it reported that Newhouse said that Romney trailed in their internal polling by just two points in Ohio on the weekend before the election. There was a widely circulated report about the Ohio internal polling from the Daily Mail on November 5, Election Eve, that said Newhouse had Romney up by one point in Ohio and the Romney team thought the races in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania were even. The Romney team denied the Daily Mail report on November 6, which was Election Day. But the Daily Mail report also had the Romney team forecasting a three-point lead in New Hampshire, which matches the number supplied to The New Republic. The difference could be explained by the fact that the New Republic numbers are an average of the Saturday and Sunday polling numbers, and the Daily Mail numbers could be from just Sunday, which could have Romney gaining several points in each swing state. Moving forward to Election Night, CNN reporter Peter Hamby dropped a bombshell in the early evening, revealing that Romney’s internal polling showed Obama with a five-point lead in Ohio on Sunday. Then blogger Taegan Goddard published internal GOP exit polls that showed Romney trailing Obama by four points in Ohio and that Romney only had exit poll leads in two swing states. In the end, Obama won Ohio by 1.9 percent, and we have three different Romney internal polling numbers for Ohio. The Daily Mail report had Romney up by one point; the New Republic report had Obama up by two points; and the CNN report had Obama up by five points.</Msg><Username>alsmith581</Username><Timestamp>1354401389467</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-01 17:36:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354401427212-43</Id><Title>What ever happened to stromrider?</Title><Msg>I don't have anyone to drive into paranoiac fits anymore.</Msg><Username>renew_aileen_again_again</Username><Timestamp>1354401427212</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-01 17:37:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354401551119-44</Id><Topic><Title>Does alsmith = = droopydick????</Title><Username>renew_aileen_again_again</Username><Timestamp>1354401333318</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-01 17:35:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Oops!
