Ryan sought to connect with voters in small- and medium-sized towns across Ohio by repeatedly telling them how much their community had in common with his own hometown of Janesville, Wis. Now, post-election, the Wisconsin congressman is blaming his Republican ticket loss with presidential contender Mitt Romney on a huge turnout of urban voters for President Obama. One flaw in that analysis may be that election results indicate the Romney-Ryan ticket didn’t exactly connect with the voters back in Janesville, either. A struggling blue-collar manufacturing town of 63,575, Janesville lies on the eastern edge of Rock County, Wis., and unofficial election tabulations from the county clerk there show that only 37% of Ryan’s hometown neighbors voted for him and his running mate. Meanwhile, Obama and Vice President Joe Biden got 62% of the Janesville vote.</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1352987053337</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 08:44:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352988312251-4</Id><Topic><Title>Gee!!

Calif gas is still the highest in the country and most people limit their daily rounds aside from commuting to work. Depressed areas like yours and other parts of Fla and the US, gas is lower for a variety of reasons. People will not be spending as much this year. Not only for their limited budgets due to higher prices but too many are still without jobs. I can always count on you to make a fool of yourself.

Rick Scott, now says "if I can get to 'yes,' I want to get to 'yes.'" Florida was a leader in the failed effort to overturn the law in the Supreme Court, and a group formed by Scott ran TV ads opposing it before it passed Congress. But the governor told the AP this week he wants to negotiate with the federal government to try to help the nearly 4 million uninsured people in his state. — In Iowa, GOP Gov. Terry Branstad says he is postponing a decision because Washington has not provided enough information about key details. But his spokesman, Tim Albrecht, said Iowa is exploring a partnership exchange that could include several states. Albrecht said they're confident they can get to a state option if needed. Ohio, like Florida and Iowa a state Obama carried in the election, is leaning toward a partnership with the federal government despite GOP officials' continued misgivings about the law. — In Mississippi, Republican insurance commissioner Mike Chaney formally notified Washington on Wednesday that his agency will proceed with a state-run exchange, disappointing GOP Gov. Phil Bryant, who remains staunchly opposed to Obama's law. Chaney, too, says he wishes the law could be repealed, but he worries that "if you default to the federal government, you forever give the keys to the state's health insurance market to the federal government." As for trying to fight the feds, Chaney observed: "We tried that 150 years ago in the South, and it doesn't work." — In New Mexico, the administration of Republican Gov. Susana Martinez had been quietly working to put the law into place as the political storm swirled. With a fifth of its population uninsured, the state is planning to run its own exchange. "The party is over. The opposition is over," New Mexico Human Services Secretary Sidonie Squier told the AP. "Whatever states didn't think they were going to do it, I think they're going to have to do it whether they like it or not. It's a done deal now."</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1353017824251</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 17:17:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353020960586-46</Id><Topic><Title>gop led states start warming up to Obamacare</Title><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1353017824251</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 17:17:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Crooked pols ALWAYS warm up to crooked deals. Go talk to the doctors that have to put up with it. Before I ever had any insureance of any kind I was able to pay my medical bills on a Telephone craftsman's pay with no problem. I bought a house and paid for three kids and dental costs out of my pay and still managed to save money. Since insureance has come in I notice the medical fees have gone up exponentially. Somehow, even before insureance even destitute people managed to get what was needed.</Msg><Username>lewcor</Username><Timestamp>1353020960586</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 18:09:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353021114913-47</Id><Topic><Title>Every time Obama wins an election the markets drop like a rock</Title><Username>howie_is_long</Username><Timestamp>1353006374342</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 14:06:14 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You ain't seen nuttin' yet.
