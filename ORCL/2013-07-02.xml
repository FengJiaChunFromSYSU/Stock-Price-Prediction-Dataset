It even has a name: Christian Domestic Discipline (CDD). There are, at this point, two main websites related to this “discipline”: A Domestic Discipline (DD) marriage is one in which one partner is given authority over the other, and has the means to back up that authority, usually by spanking. A Christian Domestic Discipline (CDD) marriage is simply a traditional, male-led, Christian marriage which utilises aspects of Domestic Discipline. It is set up according to Biblical standards. Therefore, in a CDD marriage: •The husband is the head of the household, whilst the wife is submissive to her husband as if the Lord Himself was her husband. See Eph. 5:22-24. •The wife is to reverence her husband. She is to obey him, so long as his instructions are not in opposition to God's commands. See Titus 2:5, Acts 5:29.</Msg><Username>hydroponicoctopus</Username><Timestamp>1372768163378</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 08:29:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372768470390-2</Id><Title>Nite, nite!</Title><Msg>Going under 30 today.</Msg><Username>happyperson_1</Username><Timestamp>1372768470390</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 08:34:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372771940102-3</Id><Topic><Title>Nite, nite!</Title><Username>happyperson_1</Username><Timestamp>1372768470390</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 08:34:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You are asleep.
