Against the intuitive grain of 60 million viewers and a breathlessly fawning press who winced through a painfully dismal showing, Obama was content that he had delivered the rhetorical goods. He only realized he sank like a Chevy Volt dropped in water after his senior aides broke the news to the surprised, and disturbingly oblivious, Commander in Chief. Apparently, the most transparent President in history in also the least self-aware. Obama thinks he is the divine ruler. The emperor has no clothes. Senior aides had been wrought with anxiety for weeks that Obama wouldn’t fare well since he stubbornly refused to rigorously prepare: “’President Obama made it clear he wanted to be doing anything else – anything – but debate prep. He kept breaking off whenever he got the opportunity and never really focused on the event.” While campaigning in Nevada, Obama even poked fun at his own reluctance to hunker down: “ It’s a drag. They’re making me do my homework.” Nobama is a post turtle.

His dripping contempt was palpable on the stage, as he refused to make sustained eye-contact with Romney, looking down at his shoes as if they were outfitted with a teleprompter. In fact, the President spent much of the debate rambling through vapid talking points like he was lost in a fugue-state, tongue tied and generally torpid. It was obvious that he did not adequately prepare but now we know it wasn’t because of a demanding schedule (the day before the debate he visited the Hoover Dam instead of practicing, much to his advisors’ chagrin). He shirked what would seem like a top priority duty because he couldn’t muster even the feint of respect for an opposing viewpoint, disgusted that someone has the audacity to challenge his ex officio proclamations. That's when you know this bum has to go. He thinks he's god when in fact he's screwed the country for 4 years. You could see the same attitude in Biden's mocking chuckling. Our growing suspicions about Obama and Biden have been confirmed. Despite all the contentless folderol about the virtue and wonder of bipartisan cooperation Obama spouted during his first campaign for president, Obama loathes dissent and only begrudgingly and condescendingly tolerates being contradicted. His brand of strident confidence crosses a line into elitist hubris, shorn of every follicle of humility, convinced that all who disagree with him are benighted fools or evil adversaries. Obama, Biden, Pelosi and Reid are the reason for gridlock waste and corruption in Washington.

The network also said Ryan bested Biden in virtually every other category. The poll showed that 28 percent said that Ryan helped Mitt Romney more than Biden helped President Barack Obama, while just 21 percent said the other way round.

The live-call poll, conducted by Glen Bolger of NMB Research and provided to POLITICO by American Crossroads communications director Jonathan Collegio, shows Obama winning statewide 48 percent to 44 percent. (Check out POLITICO's polling center) That result already puts Romney in a surprisingly competitive position in a nominally blue state. But in Maine's second congressional district, Romney actually tops Obama 49 percent to 44 percent. In most states, that such a result wouldn't mean much. But Maine is one of two states in the country that splits its electoral college vote by congressional district. The second congressional district, encompassing the northern and western part of the state, is largely rural and overwhelmingly white — groups that Obama has never done well among. (Also on POLITICO: Cold calculus of Maine's 3-way race) During redistricting, the Republican legislature also shifted two towns — Waterville and Winslow — that went heavily for Obama in 2008 from the second congressional district into the first — giving the GOP ticket a boost by removing two population centers from the district. The idea of a state splitting its electoral vote is not farfetched either. Obama famously won a single electoral vote in Nebraska's second congressional district — encompassing Omaha and its suburbs. The poll points to the surprising possibility of a similar situation in Maine — a state that has not voted for a Republican at the presidential level since 1988. The poll surveyed 500 statewide likely voters, polled October 7-8 — giving the poll a margin of error of about plus or minus 4 percent.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1350151346444</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-13 14:02:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350151804190-19</Id><Topic><Title>Mitten's is such a crook he can't even show 10 years of tax returns</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1350092861418</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 21:47:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Mitten's is such a crook he can't even show 10 years of tax returns" yep , so very true....... banking in the caymans is something Romney has in common with OJ Simpson...... and hiding tax info he has in common with al capone.</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1350151804190</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-13 14:10:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350151891665-20</Id><Title>Study Destroys Theory That Tax Cuts Spur Growth,Congressional Research Service (non-partisan),</Title><Msg>New Study Destroys Theory That Tax Cuts Spur Growth Do tax cuts really spur growth?

Darrell Issa..scrumbum</Title><Msg>Editorial: Protecting our diplomats isn't a political game Published: Saturday, Oct. 13, 2012 - 12:00 am | Page 14A In the past, the United States favored openness over fortress walls for its diplomatic facilities around the world. That shifted in a big way in the deadly 1980s, when a number of terrorist attacks occurred during the presidency of Ronald Reagan. And, now, with the attack on the U.S. consular outpost in Benghazi, Libya – killing the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans – Congress and the president should examine diplomatic security anew. The 1980s should provide some perspective for that task. In April 1983, terrorists attacked the U.S. embassy in Beirut, Lebanon, killing 63 people, including 17 Americans. Six months later, terrorists attacked peacekeepers' barracks in Beirut, killing 241 U.S. Marines and 58 French paratroopers. Then in September 1984, terrorists attacked the U.S. Embassy that had moved to East Beirut, killing 23 people, including two Americans. Congress appropriated more funds for diplomatic security and then-Secretary of State George Shultz formed the Inman Commission to make recommendations. The House passed HR 4151, the Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986, on a 389-7 vote, the Senate passed it on a voice vote and President Reagan signed it. Today, unfortunately, what should be a genuine bipartisan effort to #$%$ our needs in Libya and the security climate for our posts around the world has turned into a partisan witch hunt – led by U.S. Reps. Darrell Issa, R-Vista, and Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah. Yes, Regional Security Officer Eric Nordstrom, who testified before Issa's committee on Wednesday, had requested and was denied a 60-day extension through mid-September of temporarily assigned U.S. security professionals and a training team that was building a corps of local Libyan bodyguards. Ambassador Chris Stevens knew the security configuration in Benghazi and he understood the real dangers as well as anyone; other high-level diplomats had been recently attacked. Yet on the 9/11 anniversary, he chose to be in Benghazi, 400 miles from the U.S. Embassy in the capital of Tripoli. Would a handful more U.S. diplomatic security officers have been able to protect the consulate from the attack that killed Stevens and three other Americans? Not according to Nordstrom, who told Issa's committee that "having an extra foot of wall, or an extra-half dozen guards or agents would not have enabled us to respond to that kind of assault." Further, Nordstrom expressed the real issue: "I'm concerned that this attack will signal a new security reality, just as the 1984 Beirut attack did for the Marines; the 1998 East Africa bombings did for the State Department, and 9/11 for the whole country." That is what is being overshadowed in the Issa circus and what our political leaders must address. Our Diplomatic Security Service has been stretched thin providing security to U.S. diplomatic posts in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iraq. Further, the same House Republicans who are criticizing diplomatic security in Libya, including Republican vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan, have aggressively slashed the budget – cutting the administration's request for embassy security by $128 million in 2011 and $331 million in 2012. House Republicans propose to cut the administration's request for 2013 by $216 million. We cannot assure our diplomats perfect security. As Nordstrom told Issa's committee: "It is critical that we balance the risk-mitigation with the needs of our diplomats to do their job, in dangerous and uncertain places. The answer cannot be to operate from a bunker."

During the summer, he wondered, “when is Romney going to look like a challenger?” He subsequently defended himself from an apparent barrage of negative tweets from Romney supporters, saying, “of course I want him to win, save us from socialism, etc.” As Mediaite noted, when a Murdoch-type figure in the media espouses such clear-cut political beliefs so publicly, “the question arises as to whether these opinions will eventually trickle down through their outlets.”</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1350159241115</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-13 16:14:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350160712405-27</Id><Title>Vote for Obama because he's black</Title><Msg>In his inaugural speech, Obama said he wanted to remake America.

I hear we have a detachment of marines protecting or embassy in Barbados, WI. And another detachment of marines protecting our embassy in Paris, France. (Neither places are know to be hotbeds of terrorism.) I think Obama KNEW our Benghazi Embassy was going to be attacked and ALLOWED it so he could make his wussy speech at the UN about why we need an international law prohibiting defamation of Islam. He had the speech prepared in advance...probably in advance of 9/11/2012.</Msg><Username>caliente.zorra</Username><Timestamp>1350184080204</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-13 23:08:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350184468471-31</Id><Topic><Title>into a partisan witch hunt –led .

Mr. Levin also points out that "Rules for Radicals" suggests these usages and even the words "Hope" and "Change" since these all sound good and can be eqasily interpreted as good things by the uninformed, useful idiots.</Msg><Username>caliente.zorra</Username><Timestamp>1350184907009</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-13 23:21:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
