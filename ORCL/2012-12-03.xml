Tom Coburn, R-Okla., sought to amend the bill to stop the Veterans Affairs Department from putting the names of veterans deemed too mentally incompetent to handle their finances into the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, which prohibits them from buying or owning firearms. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., objected, saying the measure would make it easier for veterans with mental illness to own a gun, endangering themselves and others. "I love our veterans, I vote for them all the time. They defend us," Schumer said. "If you are a veteran or not and you have been judged to be mentally infirm, you should not have a gun." Currently, the VA appoints fiduciaries, often family members, to manage the pensions and disability benefits of veterans who are declared incompetent. When that happens, the department automatically enters the veteran's name in the Criminal Background Check System.</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1354544468294</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 09:21:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354544583351-20</Id><Topic><Title>gop to ok buying for the mentally ill, (i kid you not, and this just shows how creepy the gop and the nra are)</Title><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1354544468294</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 09:21:08 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>correctiton in subject, sorry. gop wants to OK gun buying by the mentally ill</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1354544583351</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 09:23:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354544951879-21</Id><Topic><Title>gop to ok buying for the mentally ill, (i kid you not, and this just shows how creepy the gop and the nra are)</Title><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1354544468294</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 09:21:08 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Mesa, if guns were illegal to own, please explain how criminals would no longer have them or be able to get them.

Wikipedia says BOTH of John Kerry's parents were named "Kerry" before they got married. John Kerry's paternal grandparents changed their names and religions after they left the Austor-Hungarian Empire in 1901 or 1902. It was discovered in 2003 by Felix Gundacker, a genealogist[4] working with The Boston Globe, that Kerry's paternal grandparents, who had been born "Fritz Kohn" and "Ida Löwe" in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, changed their names to "Frederick and Ida Kerry" in 1900 and converted from Judaism to Roman Catholicism in 1901[5][6] or 1902.[7] Fritz' elder brother Otto had earlier, in 1887[6] or 1896,[4] also embraced Catholicism. The "Kerry" name, widely misinterpreted as indicative of Irish heritage, was reputedly selected arbitrarily: "According to family legend, Fritz and another family member opened an atlas at random and dropped a pencil on a map. It fell on County Kerry in Ireland, and thus a name was chosen.
