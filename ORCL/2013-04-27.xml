Just as the Pharisees did long ago. They took truth and perverted it through their "Interpretations."

The people of this country sit idly by while people like George Bush sit with people like El Presidente "Zorro" (Fox) and the Prime Minister of Canada and openly plot the dissolution of this country. You have a very powerful group in New York whose express purpose is the destruction of this nation. They've been working at it since 1920.

There is no law against it but character, conscience and self-respect he lacks. Liberals seem to see that as an endearing quality. When it's a conservative who strays they go bezerk, Same with a gay conservative. Liberal tolerance is not inclusive.

Flood wasn't worldwide and scripture doesn't say so. Just a poor translation (deliberate?) and dumb bells that won't look for the truth. The word, "erets" translated "world" and later "Ararat" simply "a land or country, ANY land or country. Mt "Ararat" wasn't known as such until over a century ago. It was Mt. Masiv before that. Look to the Tarim Basin as the site of Noah's flood. Interesting as they are finding Celtic settlements and graveyards all through that region. One large graveyard beside a large Asian lake is beside a flooded city in that lake. Like the 20,000 graves beside the Dead Sea but no city. Uh oh they found what looks like a city under the Dead Sea. Sodom and Gomorrah?</Msg><Username>lewcor</Username><Timestamp>1367106303939</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-27 19:45:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
