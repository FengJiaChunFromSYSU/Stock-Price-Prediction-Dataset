"The politics has been relentless." So let's see if we get this. Democrats shoved an unpopular, expensive, ill-conceived and poorly written law down the country's throat with no Republican support, and without bothering to see whether states would want to take on the thankless and costly task of helping the feds implement it. And now that many of these states are rebelling, it's the Republicans' fault? Obamacare will collapse under its own weight.</Msg><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1365769049137</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-12 08:17:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365769384586-6</Id><Topic><Title>IN DEPTH ORCL Analyst Report .</Title><Username>zelmastafford</Username><Timestamp>1361112271314</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-17 09:44:31 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thank you very much!</Msg><Username>alycenapier</Username><Timestamp>1365769384586</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-12 08:23:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365769797250-7</Id><Topic><Title>Sebelius setting stage to blame repubs for coming collapse of Obamacare</Title><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1365769049137</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-12 08:17:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ya really think that's what's gonna happen?

Officials say the number of people entering the U.S. illegally is way up and, tragically, the number of undocumented immigrants who have been found dead in the unforgiving Texas Brush Country is way up, and is on path this year to beat last year's record for the number of people found dead in the ranch country. Linda Vickers, who owns a ranch in Brooks County, which is Ground Zero for the immigration debate, pins the blame directly on talk of 'amnesty' and a 'path to citizenship' for people who entered the U.S. illegally. She recalls one man being arrested on her ranch not long ago. "The Border Patrol agent was loading one man up, and he told the officer in Spanish, 'Obama's gonna let me go'." Border Patrol agents report that immigrants are crossing the border, and in some cases surrendering while asking, “Where do I go for my amnesty?”</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1365772389349</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-12 09:13:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365772446964-12</Id><Topic><Title>IN DEPTH ORCL Analyst Report .</Title><Username>zelmastafford</Username><Timestamp>1361112271314</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-17 09:44:31 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Awesome report!</Msg><Username>frederickprice70</Username><Timestamp>1365772446964</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-12 09:14:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365773128934-13</Id><Topic><Title>Oracle Corporation UPDATED CHARTS!</Title><Username>rageliofay</Username><Timestamp>1359385325825</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 10:02:05 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Cool picks.

By Jason Cumming, Staff Writer, NBC News An explosive device sent to "America's toughest sheriff" was intercepted by police in Arizona on Thursday, officials said. A suspicious package addressed to Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio's downtown Phoenix headquarters was X-rayed by officers in Flagstaff, Ariz., according to authorities. A bomb team later destroyed the device. The FBI, U.S. Postal Inspection Service and Flagstaff Police were investigating. Arpaio, 80, has earned headlines nationwide as a result of his tent city jail and immigration roundups.

At first reports suggested the young diplomat was part of an armed convoy that was bombed, but new reports say that she was actually on foot. And that the group she was with got lost on its way to deliver books. ABC reported earlier in the week: Afghan security officials told ABC News that the State Department convoy had just left its headquarters in Qalat and joined the convoy of the local provincial governor who was also headed to the school book giveaway. That's when two suicide attackers attacked the convoy. The security officials said there was an initial car bomb detonated by a remote device. Then a suicide bomber wearing a suicide vest appeared and caused more casualties. Afghan sources say the school event had been announced a day in advance, which possibly allowed attackers enough time to plan the attack.</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1365775231131</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-12 10:00:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365775751093-17</Id><Topic><Title>Sebelius setting stage to blame repubs for coming collapse of Obamacare</Title><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1365769049137</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-12 08:17:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Drop, there are a lot of dems that think it's going to happen.

Meanwhile: The economy is still poor. Unemployment is still high. The number of people on disability has doubled since Obama became president. record numbers of people are seeking early retirement. (Both putting stress on the Social Security System, =that Barack Obama weakened with the "payroll tax cut.") The employment participation rate is down by 10 or 12 million! There hasn't been a national budget in four years! The fed is devaluing our currency by printing another trillion of fiat currency every year. Obama is doing his best to lose wars in Iraq &amp; Afghanistan. Meanwhile: Obama goes out golfing and extravagant public expense. I am sure he is the most golfed president in history. He and Michelle continue to have extravagant vacations at public expense. And they like extravagant live entertainment night at the White House at public expense. They enjoy living like extravagant, arrogant aristocrats at public expense! And the same party that encourages 1.5 million abortions every year wants to discard our constitution because 26 people (mostly children) were murdered with a semi-automatic rifle in Connecticut. All of national debate since December has been focused on gun control. And the Liberal media slops it up like pigs at a trough! (Not that I am in favor of murdering children. But the hypocrisy of parading a few grieving parents before Congress while promoting 50 million abortions and doing effectively nothing about 12 million unemployed is just STAGGERING!) It is four months since this post of Jan-12-2013 and it is obvious that the issue about gun control is a distraction from the economic failures of the Obama Administration.</Msg><Username>bullwinkle.themoose</Username><Timestamp>1365787120929</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-12 13:18:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365787352368-33</Id><Topic><Title>Protected by Federal Law</Title><Username>passthebuckaroo</Username><Timestamp>1365785827377</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-12 12:57:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hey, its only about 1.5 million abortions of innocent babies each year!
