Robbins 7:13p.m. EDT March 20, 2013 U.S is now less popular in the region than at the end of the George W. Bush administration. President Obama's first journey to Israel as president comes amid earth-shattering change in Middle East, much of it for the worse. The Arab Spring, which once raised hopes of freedom and dignity, has diverged onto the dark path of Islamist authoritarian rule. In Syria, tens of thousands of people have died in a bitter civil war that might have recently seen its first use of chemical weapons. And Iran continues its march toward nuclear weapons capability, heedless of international condemnation. Obama's effort to seek peace between Palestinians and Israelis is in tatters. That's why the White House has been lowering expectations for Obama's trip to Israel all this week. He will announce no new peace plan, grand design or major foreign policy initiative. His advisers are calling the trip a "listening tour." That is what you call a state visit when you have little to say.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1363957340229</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 09:02:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363958792220-8</Id><Title>ORCL vs MSFT</Title><Msg>Which is a better trade or investment?</Msg><Username>tlee22202</Username><Timestamp>1363958792220</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 09:26:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363958820064-9</Id><Topic><Title>Economy is Bad.

It's all on record. Saddam was warned in UN resolutlion after resolution. The Iraq War had nothing to do with 9-11 as the right to be stupid Americans keep wailing. Now I see why John Kerry made the "stupid" remark. He had to explain Dems.

I also know their Finances and performance drivers as well as any Wall Street analyst. Having fired every decent CFO that would work within 5 miles of her, Safra is now managing the forecast and market communications. Good job in Q3 Safra? Greg and Jeff would not have screwed up like this. True to form Safra felt no need to warn the market that Oracle would grossly disappoint, leaving a false market to trade for 3 weeks in between the close and announcement. There is a consistent pattern over the years of indifference toward shareholders and keeping the market informed. Did Mark or Safra play any role in creating the carnage in Q3? Of course not it was those incompetent sales people that failed to execute!. News flash Safra and Mark, those folks are under your leadership. How about passing on your obscene stock option issuance this year Larry, Safra and Mark. This is not a performance worthy of the highest paid CEO in North America if not the world. Oracle has an incredible franchise on commercial software that is grossly undervalued purely in my view on the basis that investors hate the management. Sure Larry is a legend who can afford to buy any sailing trophy he wants (take me on in a single design class L's), Safra is the Valleys best nut crusher and apparently Mark can play tennis(at least as well as Larry), their issue is that they are not trustworthy and they have retained the spoils of a killer strategy for the CEO and top management with minimal regard for the other 60% of shareholders. They issue the buy backs to themselves in options. From the highest paid CEO in the US - We expect better. Give up your options this year guys and we might forgive you.</Msg><Username>oracleyoda</Username><Timestamp>1364010251067</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 23:44:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message></Date>
