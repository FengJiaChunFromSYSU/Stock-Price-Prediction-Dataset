I just use the term "money printing" to relate to the level that an Obama supporter might be at. Yes, the subjects of high-powered money, the money multiplier, monetary velocity, PQ=MV, etc. is a great subject to discuss, but people on this board are going to glaze over if you talk about it. One of Obama's biggest constituencies is the under-25 crowd... I know 2 of them personally who voted for Obama because they saw him on TV with Justin Bieber and thought he was hip... ... how far do you think a discussion on the inner-workings of the federal reserve would get with people like that, Lew?
