In a new ad, the former Arkansas governor and ordained Southern Baptist minister warns Christians that their votes "will affect the future and be recorded in eternity" and they must cast a ballot that will "stand the test of fire." The video, entitled "Test of Fire," features symbolic fiery imagery and is narrated by Huckabee: Christians across the nation will have an opportunity to shape the future for our generation and generations to come. Many issues are at stake, but some issues are not negotiable: The right to life from conception to natural death. Marriage should be reinforced, not redefined. It is an egregious violation of our cherished principle of religious liberty for the government to force the church to buy the kind of insurance that leads to the taking of innocent human life. Your vote will affect the future and be recorded in eternity. Will you vote the values that will stand the test of fire? This is Mike Huckabee asking you to join me November the 6th and vote based on values that will stand the test of fire. The nuts are out in full force. Mr. Chick-Fil-A is bringing the crazy for Romney in the final week of the campaign.</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1351775228331</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 09:07:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351775409684-6</Id><Title>someone dropped the dime on Sen.

Libya's former Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril believes he did. Perhaps you'll recall when George W. Bush stood on the flight deck of the U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln and a banner positioned behind him read "Mission Accomplished" regarding Iraq on May 1, 2003. It was a moment that haunted him throughout the rest of his presidency and beyond, as the Iraq War continued on for eight and a half more years. And just as many Democrats say Bush made a premature call after the sacking of Baghdad and the toppling of the Hussein regime, so too the former Libyan PM says Obama counted his eggs before they hatched. Jibril has "accused the United States and its NATO allies of high-tailing it out of [Libya] as soon as dictator Moammar Gadhafi was disposed a year ago." He says the quick departure created "a power vacuum" that has allowed radicals, like those who attacked the Benghazi consulate, to strengthen their numbers and flourish. According to Jibril: After the collapse of the regime, the immediate task of our friends was to help us rebuild the government before they withdrew from Libya. [But] the moment the regime fell down, they felt that their mission [had] been accomplished. I think it was a premature decision.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1351787692220</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 12:34:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351787892111-35</Id><Title>Mittens hides his tax returns, hides the details of his tax plan, Mitts is a shady, secretive character huh?</Title><Msg>"The candidate has not answered any questions from reporters in the past three weeks."

When supporters arrived at the rally-turned-relief event, they were treated to the 10-minute video about Romney’s life, which was first unveiled at the RNC. The event ended with supporters lined up to hand over supplies and meet Romney. But according to BuzzFeed, this donation process was also staged: Empty-handed supporters pled for entrance, with one woman asking, “What if we dropped off our donations up front?” The volunteer gestured toward a pile of groceries conveniently stacked near the candidate. “Just grab something,” he said. Two teenage boys retrieved a jar of peanut butter each, and got in line. When it was their turn, they handed their “donations” to Romney. He took them, smiled, and offered an earnest “Thank you.” The Red Cross, meanwhile, said they were grateful for the supplies but encouraged people to donate money or blood as a more efficient way to help the relief effort."</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1351788118800</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 12:41:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351788573045-37</Id><Topic><Title># ORCL Featured on Squawk Box #</Title><Username>tonyjefferson976</Username><Timestamp>1348245999301</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 12:46:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>thanks for the interesting report</Msg><Username>rayboston342</Username><Timestamp>1351788573045</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 12:49:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351788652531-38</Id><Title>Mitts lied about Jeep</Title><Msg>.

(CBS Atlanta) — The reverend who gave the benediction during President Barack Obama’s inauguration said America is “going to hell,” and white people may go with it. Rev. Joseph Lowery, 91, made the comments at St. James Baptist Church in Forsyth, Ga., as part of a Southern Christian Leadership Conference tour to encourage African-Americans to vote for Obama, according to the Monroe County Reporter. The paper reports that Lowery apparently told parishioners in the crowd that he is back to believing that all white people will not get into heaven because of what’s been happening during the campaign. “I’m frightened by the level of hatred and bitterness coming out in this election,” Lowery said, according to the County Reporter. Lowery blasted blacks for costing Obama the state of Georgia in the 2008 election because 390,000 African-Americans decided to stay home and not vote. “I don’t know what kind of a n***** wouldn’t vote with a black man running,” Lowery extolled, according to the paper. “All that he did with the stimulus was genius. Nobody intelligent would risk this country with Romney.” Lowery added that “America is going to hell in a hand basket.” Forsyth Mayor John Howard, who took part in the event, told the County Reporter that he was “pretty shocked” by Lowery’s statement. “The Bible doesn’t say anything about white or black to go to heaven,” Howard said. “I have great number of black and white friends. I’ve been in the military. I make friends with everybody. I’m too old for enemies.” Lowery, along with Martin Luther King, helped founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference in 1957. Obama awarded Lowery with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2009.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1351797872880</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 15:24:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351799352569-49</Id><Topic><Title>Dear Mr. Larry Ellison, are there any plans to match Bill Gates' investment in Galena Biopharma's international NewVax vaccine program?</Title><Username>qe3and4</Username><Timestamp>1351783106662</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 11:18:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Accumulating large quantity of shares is often done of an entire qtr..</Msg><Username>catamaran_outremer5x</Username><Timestamp>1351799352569</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 15:49:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351803059244-50</Id><Topic><Title>the credibility of seabugg</Title><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1351787377732</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 12:29:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>now sebuggc lies and bear false witness.........what a s.cu.mmy an immoral person seabugc is!

He and congress more responsible than Obama is. If you're concerned about debt and jobs: -Tax the rich -Spend the money on infrastructure improvements. It's a no-brainer. If you're concerned about debt only: -Simpson Bowles is the only way to go. Shared sacrifice. Romney's fraudulent plans increase debt.</Msg><Username>egik_egak_egoogimak</Username><Timestamp>1351823415990</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 22:30:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351823586686-69</Id><Topic><Title>Remember - Real Quality of Life Determined By State's Rights - Romney</Title><Username>mackgreene33</Username><Timestamp>1351819691363</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 21:28:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The argument is used when there's some regulation a politician doesn't like (such as Obamacare).

Look who is talking about reversed courses/ Mike Bloomberg was originally a Democrat who became a Republican of convenience so he could run for Mayor of NYC. If he tried it as a Democrat he would have ended up in nasty primaries against Democrat Lilliputians who believed that Mayor of NYC was their personal entitlement program. He just bought his way onto the Republican ticket, almost unopposed and then won the election against the Lilliputians the Democrats ran. And he remained a nominal Republican during the Bush years since that was convenient for his purposes and NYC's. Once Obama won, he became an "Independent" and has ever since been more Democrat leaning since that suits his &amp; NYC's needs now that we have a Democrat President. At heart, he is a big nanny-state &amp; gun-control liberal who is also pro-gay and pro-abortion. He was never a "Tea Party" member! His endorsement of Obama makes me puke.</Msg><Username>bullwinkle.themoose</Username><Timestamp>1351824835812</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 22:53:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351825315077-73</Id><Topic><Title>independent and former Republican, Bloomberg endorses Obama</Title><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1351805344926</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 17:29:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Bloomberg could never run for President. First he's Jewish and that wont fly. Second he has been a Democrat and Republican and Independent, nanny-state-Liberal and now Independent cum Democrat. There is no national party that he has been loyal too and I think none will support him. He might try a run for Governor of NY State after Andrew Coumo screws things up. Andrew Coumo will surely run for President in 2016. So Bloomie could take over. But I think New Yorkers will be fed up with Bloomberg by then. He has overstayed his welcome in NYC.</Msg><Username>bullwinkle.themoose</Username><Timestamp>1351825315077</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 23:01:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
