Best case is Bush tax cuts get extended for 1 year. Recession has started already in the USA. Question now is does Obama want to re-create the Great Depression with the largest tax increase in US history or do we just have a short 6 month recession after Greece leaves the Euro next week? Obama has shown no leadership in his first 4 years. He is a divisive idealogue. That is the substance of his begin. He will use is inauguration to blame Bush and Republicans and claim he has a mandate to rule as socialist dictator. 4 more years of misery.
