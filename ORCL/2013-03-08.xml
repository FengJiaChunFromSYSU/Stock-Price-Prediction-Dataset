Paul Ryan (R-WI) railed against the Medicare savings included in the Affordable Care Act, campaigned against President Obama’s desire to increase marginal tax rates on the very wealthy, and promised that a Romney administration would offset the looming sequester. But next week, just four months after losing the November election, Ryan plans to unveil a budget that incorporates many of the policies he campaigned against, since the very changes he opposed as a vice presidential candidate can now help him reach his goal of balancing the budget in 10 years — and go a long way towards reducing the deficit: 1. Savings from Obamacare. On the campaign trail, Ryan criticized Obama for cutting $716 billion out of Medicare and using it to expand access to health care for millions of Americans through Obamacare.The House Budget Committee Chairman and most House Republicans had voted to preserve the savings in the GOP budget in 2012, though Romney and Ryan promised to restore the cuts if elected in November. Ryan is preserving the savings in this year’s budget even as the National Republican Congressional Committee is still attacking Democrats for the reductions</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1362749283491</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 08:28:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362749300999-8</Id><Topic><Title>Paul Ryan Balances New Budget By Embracing Obama Policies</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1362749283491</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 08:28:03 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>2. War savings. Ryan’s budget “will make adjustments for an expected decline in war spending, a move that could reduce assumed expenditures by up to $600 billion over the next decade.” But Ryan’s has consistently derided war savings as “phantom savings.” “The savings that they’re talking about, they suggest that they’re going to be in Afghanistan and Iraq at current levels for 10 years and then they have a withdrawal that saves $1.1 trillion. So a lot of the savings they’re claiming, I think, are phantom savings,” Ryan said when Democrats included the same number in their budget. 3. Revenue from the fiscal cliff deal. Ryan’s budget will include the roughly $620 billion in revenue raised by the deal to avert the so-called “fiscal cliff” that Obama signed in January. Though Ryan ultimately voted for the deal, he was opposed to the tax increases that were used to raise that money. “Our fear is that if you raise tax rates you hurt economic growth,” Ryan would claim. Ryan’s budget is also expected to include savings from the so-called sequester, which Ryan voted for but later opposed. During the presidential campaign, he claimed that its defense cuts are “devastating,” though after losing admitted, “that $1.2 trillion in spending cuts, we can’t lose those spending cuts. “</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1362749300999</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 08:28:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362749645100-9</Id><Topic><Title>More gun laws = fewer deaths, 50-state study says</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1362667119586</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-07 09:38:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>CHICAGO ( News) - For the first time, the Cook County medical examiner's office has posted photos of unclaimed bodies on their website in an effort to help identify them. The program is generating some controversy because of the graphic images, but for the sake of people missing loved ones, this is a decision where the medical examiner believes the ends justify the means. The site contains information about when the bodies were found and where, along with as much identifying information as possible—including, in some cases--photos of the victim's face. "We're hoping that that photo can trigger somebody's memory, that you know, that person grew up down the street from me, or that person used to live nearby and I know where their mom is," Cook County Medical Examiner Dr. Steve Cina says.

At the time of his arrest in July after discussing attacks on local bridges with a federal undercover agent, the 58-year-old had 20,000 rounds of ammunition, a stock of firearms and materials to construct grenades, according to court documents. He also conveyed threats against President Obama to the agent, describing extensive booby traps he had built and proclaiming his militia would "resist in the event the government started rounding up patriots." That is a mainstay claim among militias driven by conspiratorial ideologies that accuse federal agencies of preparing concentration camps to one day round up well-meaning patriots. Kimbley pleaded guilty in November to unlawful possession of a firearm and attempt to make a firearm in violation of federal law. In his defense, his public defender attested, "Everything said by Mr. Kimbley is no different than what his idol, TV commentator Glenn Beck, typically states on the air and is protected free speech."</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1362752564995</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 09:22:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362752577653-20</Id><Topic><Title>how many of you get whipped into a pantie wad knee jerk spasm by glenn beck?</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1362750952846</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 08:55:52 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No... you are up are upset with the free speech rights associated with the support of those groups... we have known for years that #$%$'s and klansman have the right under the constitution to exist... demonstrate... and spew their filth....

Patty Murray (D-Wash.) in retribution for her vote for health care reform, so-called "Obamacare." Wilson was sentenced in October to a year and one day in prison. In a letter submitted to attest to his good character during sentencing, one of Wilson's cousins said that "his fears were grown and fostered by Beck's persuasive personality" and that Wilson was "under the spell that Glenn Beck cast, aided by the turbulent times in our economy." A third man, Byron Williams, faces counts of attempted murder and a host of weapons charges after a shootout with police officers on his way to San Francisco last summer, where he allegedly planned shootings at the ACLU and the Tides Foundation — two frequent targets of Beck's rants (the Tides Foundation was almost unknown to the public until Beck began attacking it regularly). Williams later described Beck as "like a schoolteacher on TV." Nearly two years ago, extremist Richard Poplawski fatally shot three Pittsburgh police officers when they responded to a domestic dispute at his home. The killings drew attention to the allure of Beck's rhetoric when a man described as Poplawski's best friend said the killer was "obsessed" with some of Beck's theories.</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1362752583930</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 09:23:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362752757390-22</Id><Title>Just wait til a liberal judge releases bin Ladens son in law</Title><Msg>because he was illegally abducted by Obama's CIA...

Vera was one of the ACORN employees portrayed in O'Keefe's videos as offering assistance in setting up a nonexistent child prostitution ring. After his encounter with O'Keefe, Vera contacted the police to report "possible human smuggling," unaware that he had been duped. Vera claims he lost his job as a result of O'Keefe's deception after the conservative's video of their encounter was posted on a Breitbart website. According to the settlement documents obtained by Wonkette, O'Keefe has agreed to "pay Vera $100,000.00," and that "as part of this settlement O'Keefe states that at the time of the publication of the video of Juan Carlos Vera he was unaware of Vera's claims to have notified a police officer of the incident.

RUGABER WASHINGTON (AP) - A burst of hiring last month added 236,000 U.S. jobs and reduced the unemployment rate to 7.7 percent from 7.9 percent in January. The robust gains suggested that the economy can strengthen further despite higher taxes and government spending cuts. The February jobs report issued Friday provided encouraging details: The unemployment rate is at its lowest level in four years. Job growth has averaged more than 200,000 a month since November. Wages rose. And the job gains were broad-based, led by the most construction hiring in six years. The unemployment rate had been stuck at 7.8 percent or above since September. The rate declined last month because the number of unemployed fell 300,000 to just over 12 million, the fewest since December 2008. More than half the decline occurred because 170,000 of the unemployed found jobs. An additional 130,000 stopped looking for work. People who aren't looking for jobs aren't counted as unemployed. The unemployment rate is calculated from a survey of households. The job gains are derived from a separate survey of employers. Stock prices rose as trading began at 9:30 a.m. Eastern time, an hour after the jobs report was released. Another day of stock gains would give the Dow Jones industrial average its fourth straight record close. Employers did add slightly fewer jobs in January than the government had first estimated. Job gains were lowered to 119,000 from an initially estimated 157,000. Still, December hiring was a little stronger than first thought, with 219,000 jobs added instead of 196,000. Robust auto sales and a steady housing recovery are spurring more hiring, which could trigger more consumer spending and stronger economic growth. The construction industry added 48,000 in February; it's added a solid 151,000 since September. Manufacturing gained 14,000 jobs last month and 39,000 since November.</Msg><Username>alsmith581</Username><Timestamp>1362754981871</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 10:03:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362755085227-33</Id><Topic><Title>I would rather have 12 years of Bush</Title><Username>passthebuckaroo</Username><Timestamp>1362706072827</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-07 20:27:52 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why are Republicans SUCH losers?????????????</Msg><Username>alsmith581</Username><Timestamp>1362755085227</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 10:04:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362755346825-34</Id><Topic><Title>ORCL Insiders SELLING?!</Title><Username>caballero_ashley</Username><Timestamp>1362318802861</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-03 08:53:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>thanks a lot!</Msg><Username>derrick_zirkle</Username><Timestamp>1362755346825</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 10:09:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362756691700-35</Id><Topic><Title>ORCL Report and Stock Poll</Title><Username>moyasefangelina</Username><Timestamp>1361889545234</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 09:39:05 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I was really looking for some great news.

Syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer on Fox News's Special Report Thursday observed, "The President’s travel expenses alone for the golfing outing with Tiger Woods would pay for a year of White House visits." "So I suggest that perhaps he curtailed the travel, or perhaps auction off the set of clubs and he might be able to allow those Iowa tots to come through the White House," Krauthammer added.

The gop knows they need to overcome their racism, misogyny, homophobia and so forth, but they are so full of hate and dogma that it might be an impossible task for them. Republicans should get back to their roots: The Square Deal was President Theodore Roosevelt's domestic program formed upon three basic ideas: conservation of natural resources, control of corporations, and consumer protection. Thus, it aimed at helping middle class citizens and involved attacking plutocracy and bad trusts while at the same time protecting business from the most extreme demands of organized labor. ... Roosevelt was a Republican who believed in government action to mitigate social evils, and as president denounced “the representatives of predatory wealth” as guilty of “all forms of iniquity from the oppression of wage workers to defrauding the public.”[2] Booker T. Washington, the most important black leader of the day, was the first African American to be invited to dinner, on October 16, 1901, at the White House, where he discussed politics and racism with Roosevelt.</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1362765296652</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 12:54:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362766092760-45</Id><Title>pub obstructionism &amp; pub sequester mean that pubs own jobs</Title><Msg>As The New York Times reported Monday, corporate profits have been skyrocketing ever since 2008 -– rising an average of 20.1 percent a year for four years in a row......................... pubs want to cut spending and fire people and hey, even though the "job creators" have been rolling in profits and low tax rates they didn't create jobs.

They hate savers and are bent on killing them. Let me add that the main problem of the economy, is that the rich accumulate all the money rather than spend it. If they invest it, it's only to get a return in dividends, or interests. Compounding thereby gives them exponentially growing fortunes while the rest of the population is increasingly in debt. There are only 2 ways out of this: the capitalist one: depression, the socialist one: redistribution.</Msg><Username>nazyoyo</Username><Timestamp>1362767466393</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 13:31:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362767865191-48</Id><Topic><Title>Sgt.
