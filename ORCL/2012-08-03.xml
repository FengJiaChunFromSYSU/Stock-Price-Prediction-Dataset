" nope you are just a liar. Fact is all are quite clear that in the long term excessive debt is a drag on the economy and has to be dealt with, as per the CBO who say the same. The cbo has pointed out that the Obama stimulus added couple points to gdp growth and also cut UE by a couple of %. They are quite clear the long term debt must be dealt with, and they show that both parties have a plan that will accomplish putting USA debt on a sustainable path. Neo keynesians like Krugman (and Roubini) have voiced exactly the same. The cure to the depression (no demand) is stimulus, once the emergency is over, taxes can be raised and so forth to deal the the debt LONG TERM.</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1343997162000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-03 08:32:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343997326000-3</Id><Topic><Title>obama lived a more NORMAL tougher life than</Title><Username>dropkickuuuuuuu</Username><Timestamp>1343952020000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 20:00:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yeah, how many are like the romneys and write off $70K for dressage.... taking your horse to the prom as john stewert put it?......... or have offshore bank accounts???</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1343997326000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-03 08:35:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343997710000-4</Id><Title>165,000 New Jobs - 8.3% Unemployment - 350,000 People Fired!</Title><Msg>And half of the new jobs were at Chick-fil-A!!

Ryans plan.....will do it, 3. or obviously a combination of the both. I have also shown that there is no hurry to do a fix, though the sooner the better.

Reagan took office Jan-1981, U/E was 7.5%. During his first term it increased to over 10% but decreased to 7.4% in Oct-1984. And it continued to decrease to 5.4% by Jan-1989 when Reagan left office. Obama took office Jan-2009 with U/E at 7.8%. It increased to be over 10% then decreased to mid-8%s and has been in the mid-8%s ever since. During 2010 and 2011 the U/E rate AVERAGED around 9%.

In many metro areas, the advantage comes much sooner. In Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and Tampa, for example, owning beats renting after 1.6 years, the study finds. Zillow determined the breakeven horizon—the point at which owning becomes more financially advantageous than renting the same home--for more than 200 metro areas and 7,500 cities around the U.S. Unlike a simple purchase price-to-rent ratio, the breakeven horizon takes into account such other data as taxes, tax deductions, down payments, utilities, appreciation, maintenance, opportunity costs, and fluctuations in the rental market."

Even the Vietnam War was largely financed by a surtax on incomes, paid largely by wealthier citizens rather than by the transfer of a payroll tax-generated social security Surplus to cover U.S. budget deficits. " and when did the trend of LOWER national debt each year after WW2 end?................. yep, Reagan turned that around! and he TRIPLED the nation's debts with his tax cuts and ENDED the entire post war history of a lower national debt each year.</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1344042355000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-03 21:05:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344042641000-101</Id><Topic><Title>did nazoyo comment about news story saying in some parts of US 3 years of rent</Title><Username>dropkickuuuuuuu</Username><Timestamp>1344033887000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-03 18:44:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"In some black gueto in Detroit?
