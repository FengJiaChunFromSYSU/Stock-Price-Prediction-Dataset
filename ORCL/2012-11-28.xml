In NJ shore areas the WATER did nearly all the damage. Inland WIND did most the damage, not water. What do you WANT? One year ago wind knocked down huge number of trees inland NJ in storm aprox one year prior to this storm and STILL this year countless number of trees came down even after being seriously THINNED out last year.usually that cuts down on number of trees dropping from new storm but not this time.

I've mentioned this before. 1. Geography in the NJ-NYC-LI region: Hurricane winds tend to pull water along the shore of Long Island, westward and into NY-NJ coastline. This magnifies the storm surge. The local geography is not caused by man made global warming or anthropogenic climate change! 2. Hurricane Sandy made land fall coincidentally with a Full Moon High Tide. There are two really big high tides each year. One in the Fall and the other in the Spring. This was the Fall Big High Tide. It greatly magnified the storm surge and water damage. Full Moon High Tides are not caused by man made global warming or anthropogenic climate change. Trees fell down: There was a hurricane analyst who was shocked by the number of trees that were blown down by Hurricane Hugo in 1989. We had a hurricane last year, and it blew trees down. We had a hurricane this year and it blew trees down. If you connect the dots you will conclude that hurricanes blow trees down. Duh! A Cat-1 hurricane or high wind Tropical Storm are still serious, powerful, dangerous storms that can cause lots of damage. But everyone keeps saying Sandy was a "superstorm" which it was NOT. It was a minimum hurricane. (And lucky for us that it was!) It is also a fact that we can EXPECT much worse hurricanes in NY-NJ-LI region. Hurricane Gloria of 1985 was a CAT-3 hurricane. CAT-3 hurricanes have been predicted as plausible in the NY-NJ-LI region since the 1950's. Over the last 126 years, several CAT-3 hurricanes have occurred, roughly once every 20 to 30 years, over NY-NJ-LI. CAT-1 hurricanes are more common. And please take note that the power of each hurricane class goes up geometrically, not linearly. More Trees Down: We had a big snow storm about three years ago that took a lot of trees down too. At least it did on Staten Island. Oh: "Sandy was a 'Frankenstorm' that was steered by the jet stream!" DUH! ALL HURRICANES ARE STEERED BY THE JET STREAM! DUH!</Msg><Username>bullwinkle.themoose</Username><Timestamp>1354117879171</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 10:51:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354119763028-7</Id><Topic><Title>Times are appropriate to keep an eye on ORCL dealing</Title><Username>sheilaboyer71</Username><Timestamp>1354116943744</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 10:35:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good alert</Msg><Username>johnsonsjohny</Username><Timestamp>1354119763028</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 11:22:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354126133322-8</Id><Title>Again with their #$%$ lies about the "war on christmas"</Title><Msg>STOP with that,..there's no such thing..all in your heads.</Msg><Username>dropkickpubs4321</Username><Timestamp>1354126133322</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 13:08:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354127076569-9</Id><Topic><Title>Again with their #$%$ lies about the "war on christmas"</Title><Username>dropkickpubs4321</Username><Timestamp>1354126133322</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 13:08:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>repubs for the most part don't REALLY believe there's a war, they're just PRETENDING.</Msg><Username>dropkickpubs4321</Username><Timestamp>1354127076569</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 13:24:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354127983186-10</Id><Topic><Title>Times are appropriate to keep an eye on ORCL dealing</Title><Username>sheilaboyer71</Username><Timestamp>1354116943744</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 10:35:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I love it.

The top 1% of American's provide 38% of federal income taxes. That's high. Obama's proposal is for them to shoulder 42 to 44% of all federal income taxes. Yes, Virginia... that's "confiscatory" and it's the reason why the wealthy are leaving... just ask Apple's Steve Wozniak (fled to New Zealand) or facebook's Edwardo Saverin (moved to Singapore with his $3 billion). This is what happens when a country becomes "overly socialized" and punishes those who are most able to invest in job-creating businesses... they leave, and the country's capital base is destroyed along with all of the jobs it produces. We've seen it in hundreds of countries over the past 75 years that elected people like Obama and punished it's investors. The democrats aren't budging (so far) on spending. The U.S. maintains the most extravagent social-welfare system on planet earth. A person at the poverty line in the U.S. has, by FAR, the most affluent standard of living on earth relative to a person at the poverty line in ANY other country. Clearly, it needs to be reigned in... but so far, the democrats havn't budged... they want the VOTES of the 48% of American households that receive a government check each month and they're winning elections as long as they can keep the deficit spending tap gushing federal dollars. America has a tax problem... we're chasing all of our investment capital to foreign countries. America also has a spending problem... our poor have the best standard of living on earth for a poor person. It's un-sustainable... but if we go over the fiscal cliff, the media will blame it on the Republicans, for sure.

Throughout history, when country's punish capital, they decline economically over time... and when they reward capital, they flourish and grow. There are NO EXEPTIONS to that. Obama is punishing capital. He is sustaining the highest corporate tax rate on the planet. He wants to raise the capital gains rate from a max of 15% to at LEAST a max of 23.8%. His proposal for dividends, which are already "double taxed", is to take the portion of the tax paid by the recipient from a maximum rate of 15% to a maximum rate of 43.4%... and when THAT's added to the max of 35% that the corporation pays (warren buffett's secretary's income was deducted by warren, the companies who paid mitt romney his dividends were fully taxed on that income), it adds up to a whopping 78.4% of the original corporate income. The past 4 years have seen HUGE shifts of capital offshore. Corporations are hoarding cash overseas and "domestic stock" mutual funds have been hemorraging assets for years in favor of bonds, gold and "emerging markets" mutual funds. It's epidemic... we are "de-capitalizing" at a very rapid rate of speed. $1.2 trillion deficits and all this money-printing by the fed should be producing 7 to 9% GDP growth, and in any other economic cycle, they would... yet here we are, chugging along at 2% growth, a 50-year low in capital spending, and a "labor participation" rate that is near an all-time low (THE all time low was set in september of this year). We are the most spend-thrift society in earth history. Our social welfare system is the most generous of all time in ANY country... our savings rate before the crash of "08 was 0% (zero). Everybody puts all their savings into the house they live in... not the stock of corporations that employ people... because their house gets fabulous tax treatment and corporate stock gets hammered by the tax man. There's no more fuel for "keynsianism" to work... it all goes into consumer's pockets who go to walmart to buy chinese stuff... and the only thing that's left is a higher national debt. We borrow 40 cents out of every dollar. Obama's proposal to tax the rich raises only 1/15 of the deficit using "static" modeling (which assumes that taxpayers won't change their behaviour at all if you raise their taxes). Obama's $80 billion in additional revenues from taxing the rich will quickly become $10 billion in a few years as more Steve Wozniaks and Edwardo Saverins flee the U.S. and stop paying taxes alltogether. I hope you get it, dropkick. We've seen this movie play out so many times in places like Venezuela, Cuba, etc. and looking at the long-term statistics on the U.S... it's clearly happening here just like it happens EVERYWHERE that success is punished and "equal outcomes" are sought.

The reason he did was because he wanted to make a point... a point that would rely on the fact that 95% of americans don't understand the concept of, the "double taxation of dividends"... ... in fact, a neanderthal on this bulletin board doesn't either... and he obviously voted. In his speech, Mr. Obama emphasized that Warren Buffett's secretary paid taxes of almost 20% of her income, while Mitt Romney paid less than 15% tax on total income that dwarfed hers. It sounded unfair... and it played perfectly on the ignorance of the average american voter. For the 5% of americans that understand the concept, read no further. For the other 95%, here is how it works: When Warren Buffett pays his secretary, he is able to "deduct" her salary as a "payroll expense". Thus, Mr. Buffett calculates his taxable income by first deducting his payroll expense, and only pays taxes on the remainder. His secretary pays 20% tax on her income so that, in essence, is the only tax that was paid on Mr. Buffett's revenue that was attributable to her salary. When a corporation that Mr. Romney owns stock in decides to distribute some of it's profits as a dividend to Mr. Romney, it must pay taxes on that income BEFORE it distributes the dividend... and that tax maxes out at the highest corporate tax in the world... 35%. When Mr. Romney receives it, he must then pay tax on the dividend he receives, at up to 15%. Together, Mr. Romney and his corporation ends up paying a tax that can amount to as much as 50% of the income the corporation earned. Because BOTH are taxed on it, it's essentially "double taxed". Again, for the neanderthals: Warren's secretary: 20%... Warren himself: 0%... total at both levels: 20%. Mitt Romney: 15%... Mitt's dividend paying corporation: 35%.... total at both levels, up to 50%. Mr. Obama wants to widen the gap in 2 ways: 1. Tax dividends as "ordinary income", making the top rate 35% for the dividend receiver. 2. Raise the top bracket to 39.6% plus the Obamacare surcharge of 3.8% for a max bracket of 43.4%. Under Obama's proposal, the max tax on earnings distributed as dividends would be 43.4% at the individual level plus 35% at the corporate level for a total max rate of 78.4%... which compares to just 20% that Warren Buffett and his secretary collectively pay. Mr. Obama's speeches typically say that he thinks the wealthy should pay "just a little bit more"... ... anybody who thinks a total tax rate of almost 4 TIMES what Buffett and his secretary pay is "just a little bit" should have their intelligence evaluated accordingly. Hope this helps... at least for those on this board with an ability to read and understand how it all works.

You REALLY think you OWN ORCL when you have 100 shares or whatever. Ya think you own F, actually OWN the company? That dividend money is BRAND NEW TO YOU and the corporation BARELY paid ANY income tax on it to begin with. YOU as the shareholder are NOT the corporation. That is brand new money to you. If you can maybe prove the corp paid 30% tax on that money(the DIDN'T) MAYBE you shouldn't be fully taxed on the dividend. You want to pay Mitt Romney taxe rates? Too BAD! LOOK what your ridiculously irresponsible anti tax s has caused. The BIGGEST tax is $16 tril in debt.</Msg><Username>dropkickpubs4321</Username><Timestamp>1354143087810</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 17:51:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354144320277-29</Id><Title>.and how mnay GD repub presidents have been in office since dividends have been taxable?

Socialists always feed off of the ignorance of the populace to curry favor. Warren Buffett's secretary at the state-of-the-union address was a case in point. Still, there are simple solutions. The whole reason why dividend taxes were reduced to 15% in the first place was because they were "double taxed". It still meant that those earnings were getting the cr@p taxed out them... just less punatively, that's all. I don't know of a single person who wouldn't be fine with taxing dividends as ordinary income... as long as the paying corporation could deduct them. Obama stridently opposed the idea... both because he's a socialist and ideologically opposed to it... and because he knows that 95% of americans are ignorant as to the reason why it's fair and beneficial to the country to do it. Same with capital gains. A couple of years ago, the GOP proposed indexing capital gains for inflation just as earned income is in the tax tables. Obama flatly rejected the idea. That means that if somebody buys a stock for $10,000 and it rises to $10,900 over 3 years during which the rate of inflation was 3% per year, he has no gain in "real" terms, but he pays taxes on the $900 nominal gain anyway. Thus, his tax on his "real" return is effectively 100% because he didn't make any money after accounting for inflation... but he was still taxed on it... ... in the tax tables, the rate threshholds rise each year for inflation... so Warren Buffett's secretary doesn't pay taxes on any pay increase that matches inflation. EVERYTHING in the U.S. is biased aginst productive investment and employers and biased toward consumption and laborers. Take "FICA" taxes, for instance. Obama lowered the "employee" half from 6.2% to 4.2% so that workers would have more take-home pay to take down to walmart to buy chinese stuff... but he left the "employers" half at a 6.2% rate and thus doesn't incentivize them to hire more employees. 60% of Americans surveyed don't even KNOW that the employer normally pays for half of their future social security, and vote accordingly... let alone the fact that CURRENTLY, employers are actuallly paying for 60% of their employee's future social security. Similarly, almost 70% of Americans surveyed think that when they're laid off, that the GOVERNMENT pays for their first 26 weeks of un-employment benefits... whereas in reality, the employer is subsequently taxed via his SUI tax for those benefits. The reality is that unemployment insurance is effectively a 26 week severance package paid for by the employer... who compares that with the cost of employing labor in other countries and hires either here or there depending on such incentives. Bottom line: Mr. Obama is the most anti-capitalism/pro-socialism president in american history and 90% of the arguments he ran on depend on americans not understanding the facts and principles that I'm posting about today.

The ones willing to abide by the program will be overworked and underpaid. The notion that doctors order unnecessary tests is a bogus excuse to support a plan that questions their experience and knowledge and views them on the same level as garbagemen, rather than professional, independent service providers. Sure , let's get rid of all the ones who feel a responsibility to their patients. Obamacare will take away that objective by forcing doctors to run by government rules. When the light finally goes on with these liberal goons, it will be too late.
