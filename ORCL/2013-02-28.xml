You even think that sequestration, which suposedly cuts spending by a mere 2 cents or less on the dollar, will spell catastrophe for much of the country. Worst case for Obama is that when sequestration happens no one will notice. However, his main job is to make sure people notice in a painful way. That's why illegals were let out of jail in AZ even before any cuts happened. Yet Obama claims to know nothing about it.

The data indicate that a number of unions in the service, retail and hospitality industries peg their base-line wages to the minimum wage. The Labor Department's collective-bargaining agreements file has a limited number of contracts available, so we were unable to determine how widespread the practice is. But the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union says that pegging its wages to the federal minimum is commonplace. On its website, the UFCW notes that "oftentimes, union contracts are triggered to implement wage hikes in the case of minimum wage increases." Such increases, the UFCW says, are "one of the many advantages of being a union member."</Msg><Username>indahouzza</Username><Timestamp>1362063997970</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 10:06:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362064103700-18</Id><Topic><Title>Sequestration</Title><Username>passthebuckaroo</Username><Timestamp>1361473279032</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-21 14:01:19 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I like the secastration idea!

ABC'S JONATHAN KARL: A senior White House official acknowledges that a top aide (now known to be Gene Sperling) told the Washington Post's Bob Woodward that he would regret what he wrote, but insists there was no threat. "Of course no threat was intended," the White House official tells ABC News. "The note suggested that Mr. Woodward would regret the observation he made regarding the sequester because that observation was inaccurate, nothing more." Furthermore, the White House adds: "Mr. Woodward responded to this aide's email in a friendly matter." Woodward's "friendly" response came on Saturday. He didn't come forward and call the initial email a threat until late Wednesday.</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1362064192795</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 10:09:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362064401051-20</Id><Title>Wood wards notes prove with No doubt Obama demanded the sequestration, ..</Title><Msg>...lied about it's effect, got caught lying, and is now pretending it will have limited effect!

(Rick) Berman is a former labor management attorney and restaurant industry executive who currently works as a lobbyist for the food, alcoholic beverage and tobacco industries. He is the sole owner of Berman &amp; Co., which sponsors many non-profit front groups that defend his corporate clients' interests by attacking their critics, allowing his paying clients to remain out of public view. He is the President, Executive Director and Director of the Center for Consumer Freedom (CCF). CCF's 2005 IRS return states that Berman works 23 hours a week for the group for which he is paid $18,000. [1] In spite of its name, CCF is more concerned about industry than the consumer. He is also the Executive Director and President of the Employment Policies Institute Foundation the American Beverage Institute and the Center for Union Facts. [2] According to a July 31, 2006, profile of Berman in USA Today, his company has 28 employees and takes in $10 million dollars a year, but "only Berman and his bookkeeper wife" know how much of the $10 million ends up in their own pockets. [2] Rick Berman has earned the nicknames "Dr. Evil," the "Conservatives' Weapon of Mass Destruction" and the "Astroturf Kingpin" for his repeated use of the strategy of forming non-profit front groups that advocate for the interests big business while shielding those same businesses from disclosing financial support for these efforts.[3][</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1362066992930</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 10:56:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362067471589-29</Id><Title>indahouzza lies then quotes another liar to back him up</Title><Msg>indahouzza quoted a paid shill, a hired propagandist to back up his lies about the min wage.

He is the sole owner of Berman &amp; Co., which sponsors many non-profit front groups that defend his corporate clients' interests by attacking their critics, allowing his paying clients to remain out of public view. ...... He is also the Executive Director and President of the Employment Policies Institute Foundation the American Beverage Institute and the Center for Union Facts. [2] Tobacco industry involvement Rick Berman conceived the idea of the Guest Choice Network, a front group to help advance the goals of Philip Morris' Accommodation Program while appearing to be more of a grass-roots-led effort. [5] Berman became head of the Guest Choice Network. Berman cites an Oak Ridge National Laboratory/Roger Jenkins study that downplays the effects of secondhand smoke. Berman is also counsel for the American Beverage Institute, which also fronts for the tobacco industry. Philip Morris funded Guest Choice Network, also known in PM's files as "Vendor #340875." Evidence of PM funding is a check for $200,000 dated May 29, 1996, to fund "Guest Choice Network and its activities."[6] and a check for $600,000 dated December 15, 1995.[7] A March 28, 1996 PM "privileged and confidential" email from Marty Barrington to Denise F. Keane, both of PM, states, You'll remember that PM USA Corp. Affairs contributed $600,000 in '95 to get this Network, organized by Rick Berman, up and running. Berman is now looking for another $300,000, principally for an educational newsletter, and Corp. Affairs wants to contribute. As of this writing, PM USA is still the only contributor, though Berman continues to promise others any day now ...[8] Philip Morris saw Berman as a "hospitality industry insider as well as a legislatively astute individual" who could help them achieve their goal of preserving smoking in restaurants. Barbara Trach at PM wrote in an October 1995 memo that "Berman's current client list is a virtual who's who in the chain restaurant industry." Berman was introduced to Philip Morris through employees of Miller Beer, who were familiar with him and his work. Berman originated PM's strategy of broadening the focus of the "smoking issue," and "expanding it into the bigger picture of over-regulation."[9] Pro-Alcohol industry activity Berman formed a group called Beverage Retailers Against Drunk Driving" (BRADD), a pro-social drinking group, in response to Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD).[10]</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1362067471589</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 11:04:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362068630590-30</Id><Topic><Title>Look at this report.

F&amp;S: What about the other uses, for self-defense and target practice? BIDEN: Well, the way in which we measure it is—I think most scholars would say—is that as long as you have a weapon sufficient to be able to provide your self-defense. I did one of these town-hall meetings on the Internet and one guy said, “Well, what happens when the end days come? What happens when there’s the earthquake? I live in California, and I have to protect myself.” I said, “Well, you know, my shotgun will do better for you than your AR-15, because you want to keep someone away from your house, just fire the shotgun through the door.” Most people can handle a shotgun a hell of a lot better than they can a semiautomatic weapon in terms of both their aim and in terms of their ability to deter people coming. We can argue whether that’s true or not, but it is no argument that, for example, a shotgun could do the same job of protecting you. Now, granted, you can come back and say, “Well, a machine gun could do a better job of protecting me.” No one’s arguing we should make machine guns legal.</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1362073842887</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 12:50:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362075109841-37</Id><Topic><Title>ORCL is too fantastic to pass up right now.

The USA is actually taking in LESS revenue than the average since the end of WW2 House Speaker John Boehner claimed the federal government will take in more revenue this year than any other year in history. That’s true in nominal dollars, but not as a percentage of gross domestic product — a measure preferred by most economists that accounts for growth in population, inflation and earnings. In fact, as a percentage of GDP, revenues this year are actually lower than the historical average since World War II.</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1362077616840</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 13:53:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362078066991-42</Id><Topic><Title>ORCL is too fantastic to pass up right now.
