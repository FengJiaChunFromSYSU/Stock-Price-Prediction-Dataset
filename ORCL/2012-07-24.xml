WASHINGTON -- House Republicans routinely beat the drum about the hard work they have done in passing "more than 30 jobs bills" that are now before the Democrat-controlled Senate, going nowhere, as the economy gasps for air. Boehner even carries around in his jacket pocket a 4-by-8-inch card that lists off their jobs bills, and he encourages his members to flash their cards at campaign events. Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody's Analytics, agreed that the bills would have almost no effect on job creation in the short term, though he was slightly more optimistic about their long-term prospects. "These kind of changes will matter over a period of three to five years," Zandi said. "It takes that long before businesses can digest changes and respond to them." He noted, though, that legislation as narrowly targeted as the Republican package is unlikely to do much for real job creation. economists [said] that regulation has had a minimal impact on the unemployment rate. Their claim is backed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which shows that just under 16,000 jobs, or 0.4 percent, were lost because of "government regulations/intervention." "It's just hard to believe that the paperwork requirements to starting a business represent a major impediment to starting businesses right now," Burtless said.

OWS was manufactured by the Obama Admin, Pelosi &amp; Reid and nurtured by the liberal whore media as their answer to the Tea Party. In spite of all the media hype, OWS was never as big as the tea Party. And the Tea Party is quiet and working in peoples homes and voting in Congresspersons and Senators. We won't get a Tea Party President at this time, more like a RINO. But at least Romney will not be Obama! The Tea Party has already changed American politics and will continue to do so in the future.

In the ad, the president – sitting in the White House chief of staff's office – lays out his view of the choice voters face this November. White House officials confirmed that the ad was filmed in the Chief of Staff's office after ABC News inquired about it, a reporter having recognized the décor. Officials denied there was any concern about the propriety of the president being filmed inside the West Wing in a campaign ad, noting that previous presidents had done so. http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/obama-ad-filmed-west-wing/story?id=16847014#.UA9EQVaLzkc</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1343178064000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 21:01:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343178078000-89</Id><Topic><Title>Private Pension Plans shortfalls increasing</Title><Username>nazyoyo</Username><Timestamp>1343174780000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 20:06:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Messssssebird, the CBO was your bible when they first scored Obummercare as saving billions in future healthcare dollars.

Business owners know hard work, long hours lead to success -- and an early grave By Perry Chiaramonte Published July 24, 2012 David Ruff's father, Edward (l.) and his uncle, Lonnie (r.) started building their family business when they were just kids on bicycles. Next Slide Previous Slide Long hours and hard work helped Joey Vento build a landmark restaurant in Philadelphia from the ground up, but that work ethic may have also sent him to an early grave. That's why Eileen Vento's blood boiled when she heard President Obama declare last week that small business owners like her husband owed others for their success. “That is ridiculous. My husband had $6 in his pocket when he started.” Vento said to FoxNews.com about Joey Vento, who opened Geno’s Steaks in 1966 in the neighborhood of South Philly. “He worked hard his whole life to build the place up. We made a lot of money. Unfortunately he didn’t get to enjoy it.” - Eileen Vento, widow of cheesesteak king Joey Vento “He worked hard his whole life to build the place up. We made a lot of money. Unfortunately, he didn’t get to enjoy it,” she added. Vento worked at the shop right up until a heart attack killed him last August at age 71. His widow believes 45 years of toil to build a prosperous life for his family took a toll on him. She bristled at the comment Obama made during a campaign stop in Roanoke, Va., last Friday when he said business owners owed some of their success to help along the way, noting that government often provides the infrastructure needed for success. “If you got a business, you didn’t build that. Somebody else made that happen,” Obama said. "If you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help. There was a great teacher somewhere in your life. Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we have that allowed you to thrive." The comments created a backlash among small business owners and others across the country who feel that entrepreneurship is the backbone of the American economy. Vento's sister-in-law said Joey Vento owed his success to his own hard work and the loyal customers he cultivated. “He went there at 3 or 4 in the morning and stayed until 11 every night. He did it seven days a week,” said Diana Vergagini. “And when he wasn’t there he'd call in at every shift change asking, ‘How did we do? What’s the bread count? What’s the steak count?’” Vento gained national notoriety in 2006 when he posted a sign at the order window that read, “This is America: When ordering please ‘speak English.’” The president's slight of entrepreneurs also riled David Ruff, owner of Petit Jean Meats, in Morrilton, Ark. He said his father and uncle began building the business in the 1920s, when they were kids and would deliver meat on their bicycles throughout the town, located an hour north of Little Rock. They spent their lifetimes making it a success, and Ruff remembers his father Edward's pride when they built a new 70,000-square-foot facility in the 1980s. "When you start work at 12 years old and at 73 to see what it has become...," he said. "You can't help but be proud of that." Edward Ruff died of heart failure in 1990 at age 73, but he lived to see the company he devoted his life to become a success. And his son, who now oversees a business that employs 70 people and has annual sales of $14 million, resents any implication that Petit Jean Meats was built on anything but generations of sweat. "There wasn't a handout," David Ruff said. "We had to borrow the money from the bank. We didn't have any guarantee. "This is what the president doesn't understand, the risks that people take." "People work their tails off for 20-30 years before they see a return."</Msg><Username>liberals_plague_humanity</Username><Timestamp>1343178157000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 21:02:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343178288000-91</Id><Topic><Title>James Holmes looks like OWS Protester!</Title><Username>hollymackrelamos</Username><Timestamp>1343097536000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 22:38:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Did somebody spray paint his hair when he was passed out?</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1343178288000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 21:04:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343178379000-92</Id><Topic><Title>Oracle Corporation could literally skyrocket from here</Title><Username>tawnyrosica</Username><Timestamp>1343148369000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 12:46:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Lock and load.

Harding and Calvin Coolidge). When combined with the sharp decline in incomes during the early depression, the result was a serious deficit in the federal budget. Congress, desperate to increase federal revenue, enacted the Revenue Act of 1932, which was the largest peacetime tax increase in history. The Act increased taxes across the board, so that top earners were taxed at 63% on their net income. The 1932 Act also increased the tax on the net income of corporations from 12% to 13.75%. The final attempt of the Hoover Administration to rescue the economy occurred in 1932 with the passage of the Emergency Relief and Construction Act, which authorized funds for public works programs and the creation of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC). The RFC's initial goal was to provide government-secured loans to financial institutions, railroads and farmers. To pay for these and other government programs and to make up for revenue lost due to the Depression, Hoover agreed to one of the largest tax increases in American history, the Revenue Act of 1932 raised income tax on the highest incomes from 25% to 63%. The estate tax was doubled and corporate taxes were raised by almost 15%. Also, a "check tax" was included that placed a 2-cent tax (over 30 cents in today's economy) on all bank checks. Economists William D. Lastrapes and George Selgin, conclude that the check tax was "an important contributing factor to that period's severe monetary contraction." Hoover also encouraged Congress to investigate the New York Stock Exchange, and this pressure resulted in various reforms. This has all happened before. The Democrats are he*ll bent on re-creating the Depression. The world is upside down. Franklin D. Roosevelt blasted the Republican incumbent for spending and taxing too much, increasing national debt, raising tariffs and blocking trade, as well as placing millions on the government dole. Roosevelt attacked Hoover for "reckless and extravagant" spending, of thinking "that we ought to center control of everything in Washington as rapidly as possible." FDR accused the Republican of "leading the country down the path of socialism". Now Obama is the socialist. Romney is our saviour.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1343178906000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 21:15:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343179062000-97</Id><Title>The importance of Social Security</Title><Msg>Not everyone is going to get rich in the stock market and most can't work into their 80s; hence the wisdom of a tax on all employment of 12.4%, half paid by employees half by the employers.
