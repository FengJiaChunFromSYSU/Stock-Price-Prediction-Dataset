I was listening to a hunting show on the radio a couple of weeks ago and the discussion was about new groups of enviro-freaks being formed by CA libtards that have moved here and trying to get bills passed to limit fishing and hunting in a bunch of places. They said it wasn't going to happen soon, but eventually enough of them would be here to start getting laws passed. Libtards screw up their own states and then move somewhere else and start the process again, same thing happened to Phoenix when I lived there in the late 80s...</Msg><Username>alamowes</Username><Timestamp>1360929820181</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 07:03:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360931987552-3</Id><Topic><Title>CA businesses to kiss off state</Title><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1360857449077</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 10:57:29 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yeah I've heard of this. Over time I'm guessing they can pull it off. Moreover, I suppose there are enough libs to pull that off in every state they choose to effect w/o effecting the demographics of the state they're moving from. Probably enough in CA alone to effect that.</Msg><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1360931987552</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 07:39:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360934219179-4</Id><Title>Obama Lives Like Louis XVI 24/7 &amp; Tells The "Real" Bin Laden Killer To Screw-Off!</Title><Msg>Obama is and always will be a total F ing Fraud Phony Liar... who uses the Military for show &amp; tell, nothing more!

The Communist pigs in Russia lived like Rajahs while their subjects lived in poverty. What would you rather "own", a large corporation or a whole nation? Maybe even the world? "Communism" was financed by big money much of it coming from banks in the U.S. and Europe. Many big "Capitalists" were made by dealings with them. Armand Hammer of Occidental Petroleum was one such. "Igor and his dad were in bed with Hammer too. In spite of "Socialism" in England the rich just keep getting wealthier. The royal family is among the richest in the world. It's called THEFT. Most people are to stupid to know what's being done to them. They believe in the free lunch promised them by the thieves.</Msg><Username>lewcor</Username><Timestamp>1360942830994</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 10:40:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360950522383-11</Id><Topic><Title>Did anyone else see this ORCL?</Title><Username>macmanimanadeline</Username><Timestamp>1359741245959</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 12:54:05 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Fantastic.

You were saying sales were rebounding when it was prices you meant. Prices and sales are two different things, you know. I don't live in Marin Cty, I used it as an example. My niece does live in Marin and coincidently she is a loan broker so I do have some first hand account of what the market is. You use Silicon Valley as a marker for all of Calif "off the charts".? duhhh! Anything else I want to discuss, yes, my cave sits on 5 acres in wine country with a hot tub and a view you won't find in flat, yuppie Silicon Valley.</Msg><Username>annieshenanigan</Username><Timestamp>1360974666231</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 19:31:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
