" not true, It's a great deal for the 6.2% YOU put in. People would not get the employer's 6.2% contrbution if there was no SS or if the gop kills SS. That IS one reason they WANT to kill it... to keep that 6.2%.

Anything a Repub says is twisted, convoluted and re-worked. It wasn't because he has Biden syndrome. Romney knows how Dems can dirty the playing field and that is well documented thru ads and personal attacks. Speaking of playing it safe, Obama is not having many press conferences. Reporters are being shooed. His new strategy is doing the talk show circuit. He wants to avoid any questions about his record. But in 2008 he had the media living on his porch for the daily spin.

Like most kids their age they were not politically motivated prior to this election. They've gotten a reality check and are now eager to use that vote even if only in protest. Obama is not convincing the next generation that he can meet the challange of putting things right. So far, he's just offered coulda, woulda, shoulda, blaming the other side.
