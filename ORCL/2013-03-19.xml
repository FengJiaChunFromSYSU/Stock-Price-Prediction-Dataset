By the late 1960s Americans had been involved in the the Vietnam War for nearly a decade, and the ongoing conflict was an incredibly contentious issue, says PBS: In 1967, with American troop strength in Vietnam reaching 500,000, protest against U.S. participation in the Vietnam War had grown stronger as growing numbers of Americans questioned whether the U.S. war effort could succeed or was morally justifiable. They took their protests to the streets in peace marches, demonstrations, and acts of civil disobedience. Despite the country’s polarization, the balance of American public opinion was beginning to sway toward “de-escalation” of the war. Nixon’s Presidental campaign needed the war to continue, since Nixon was running on a platform that opposed the war. The BBC: Nixon feared a breakthrough at the Paris Peace talks designed to find a negotiated settlement to the Vietnam war, and he knew this would derail his campaign</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1363702349370</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 10:12:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363702755230-14</Id><Title>should the USA have abandoned Bush's invaded and occupied Afghanistan in 2009?</Title><Msg>funny how the righties whine about the war they pumped and were 100% for.

Insane liars. The fmr commandant of the US Marine Corps, and mid east expert, General Zinni said that Bush's Iraq invasion was a " brain fart". Saddam's Iraq was not a threat to anyone, had no wmd, and they were not connected to 911 and in fact, they were enemies of al Qaeda and Islamic extremism....and enemies of iran... that is the reason the USA helped put saddam in power and that is the reason Reagan aided and armed saddam....... so it does seem nuts that we paid such a high price to put in another bunch of thugs, this time thugs who are friends of Iran and who ARE Islamic radicals. It's great that saddam is dead, but it wasn't worth the cost and the thugs in power there are certainly no friends of the USA and they are every bit as bad as saddam.</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1363703207467</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 10:26:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363703419241-17</Id><Topic><Title>ORCL Report and Stock Poll</Title><Username>moyasefangelina</Username><Timestamp>1361889545234</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 09:39:05 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I am from Chicago.

I write this letter on behalf of the 4,488 soldiers and Marines who died in Iraq. I write this letter on behalf of the hundreds of thousands of veterans who have been wounded and on behalf of those whose wounds, physical and psychological, have destroyed their lives. I am one of those gravely wounded. I was paralyzed in an insurgent ambush in 2004 in Sadr City. My life is coming to an end. I am living under hospice care. I write this letter on behalf of husbands and wives who have lost spouses, on behalf of children who have lost a parent, on behalf of the fathers and mothers who have lost sons and daughters and on behalf of those who care for the many thousands of my fellow veterans who have brain injuries. I write this letter on behalf of those veterans whose trauma and self-revulsion for what they have witnessed, endured and done in Iraq have led to suicide and on behalf of the active-duty soldiers and Marines who commit, on average, a suicide a day. I write this letter on behalf of the some 1 million Iraqi dead and on behalf of the countless Iraqi wounded. I write this letter on behalf of us all—the human detritus your war has left behind, those who will spend their lives in unending pain and grief.

In response to the passage of two new gun control bills in Colorado last week, Sheriff John Cooke told the Greeley Tribune that he "won't bother enforcing the laws." One bill requires gun buyers to pay for their own background checks, a service that was previously free and now estimated to cost the buyer $10-$12 per purchase. The second bill puts a 15-round limit on magazines. Cooke says of the new laws: "They're feel-good, knee-jerk reactions that are unenforceable."</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1363710049730</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 12:20:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363710138809-28</Id><Topic><Title>IN DEPTH ORCL Analyst Report .</Title><Username>zelmastafford</Username><Timestamp>1361112271314</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-17 09:44:31 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good report :)</Msg><Username>bermudez.dexter</Username><Timestamp>1363710138809</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 12:22:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363711278520-29</Id><Title>Lefties need to quit revising history &amp; whining on Iraq war and get some facts.</Title><Msg>Some crystal clear facts on the Iraq war: 1)well over 70% of the American public supported upending the Saddam regime 2)it was the established policy of the U.S. government, a policy set by Pres.

A major step, he said, would be to get combat troops out of the country by about 16 months after taking office. Obama went a few months over that 16-month timeline, but he accomplished the removal of combat brigades this week.
