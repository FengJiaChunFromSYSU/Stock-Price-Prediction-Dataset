There is only so low they can go before they have no impact, or a negative result. See, you can put $100 in the bank and save it for a year. At the end of the year you will have $101. Whoop-Tee-Do! And now inflation has devalued your $101 so it only buys $97 worth of stuff. So what's the point of saving? Right now real estate is a mess. Saving is worthless. Bonds are scary (if interest goes up, bond values will plummet!) So people pump money into the stock market which has fantasy values.</Msg><Username>ourfirstpantroglodytepresident</Username><Timestamp>1347941148259</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 00:05:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347941358586-2</Id><Topic><Title>"Romney May Have Critized Obama's Islamic Pandering Too Soon!" ...

Dan Señor even said Bush would go down in history for helping to improve the future of the region by letting the people vote for their leaders. The same three have recently been maligning Obama, telling us how terrible that he has pushed for democracy in the region. Look at the results, how awful. Obama has let them vote for leaders that do not affiliate with the West!

What was the source of Obama's foundation in Marxism? Throughout his 2008 Presidential campaign and term in office, questions have been raised regarding Barack Obama's family background, economic philosophy, and fundamental political ideology. Dreams from My Real Father is the alternative Barack Obama "autobiography," offering a divergent theory of what may have shaped our 44th President's life and politics. In Dreams from My Real Father, Barack Obama is portrayed by a voice-over actor who chronicles Barack Obama's life journey in socialism, from birth through his election to the Presidency. The film begins by presenting the case that Barack Obama's real father was Frank Marshall Davis, a Communist Party USA propagandist who likely shaped Obama.

In August 2011, the New York Post reported, It was as if the Playboy Mansion met the East EBond at a wild party at private-equity titan Marc Leder's Bridgehampton estate, where guests cavorted nude in the pool and performed sex acts, scantily dressed Russians danced on platforms and men twirled lit torches to a booming techno beat. The divorced Sun Capital Partners honcho rented a sprawling beachfront mansion on Surf Side Road for $500,000 for the month of July. Leder's weekly Friday and Saturday night parties have become the talk of the Hamptons—and he ended them in style last weekend with his wildest bash yet. Russell Simmons and ex-wife Kimora Lee attended a more subdued party thrown by Leder—who's an event chair for Simmons' Art For Life charity—on July 29 together.

McKinnon In his comments to fundraisers captured on video, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney said 47% of Americans would almost automatically vote for President Barack Obama because they were “dependent” on the government, in part because they received government benefits and paid no federal income taxes. In a press conference late Monday, Mr. Romney said his comments were “not elegantly stated” while at the same time reiterating the main point. Our translation: If you don’t pay federal income taxes, you may not be swayed by a candidate that wants to cut them. Here’s a rundown of the data behind Mr. Romney’s argument, some of which he correctly stated and other parts of which don’t hold up so well. Entitlements: According to the Census Bureau, 49% of Americans in the second quarter of 2011 lived in a household where at least one member received a government benefit. (The total population at the time was 305 million). That’s up from 30% in the 1980s and 44.4% in the third quarter of 2008, a recent growth in part attributable to the bad economy of President Obama’s first term. The Census Bureau broke the data down like this: 26.4% of U.S. households had someone enrolled in Medicaid (the health-care program for low-income Americans) 16.2% of households had at least one member receiving Social Security. 15.8% lived in a household receiving food stamps 14.9% had a member with Medicare benefits 4.5% of households received assistance with their rent 1.7% had a member receiving unemployment benefits. The large majority of Medicare and Social Security recipients have paid payroll taxes in many cases for decades to qualify for those benefits. More In 2012 There can be a lot of overlap in which programs benefit certain households. For example, millions of people receiving Social Security benefits also receive Medicare health benefits. Many Americans covered by Medicaid are also receiving food stamp benefits. Mr. Romney implied that anyone receiving government benefits wouldn’t likely be one of his voters. But there’s no clear partisan split among beneficiaries, especially for broad-based federal retirement and health-care programs. Taxes: Mr. Romney correctly noted that nearly half of Americans pay no federal income tax. Who are all these people? And how did we get here? Here’s a quick answer. Roughly half of U.S. households that pay no federal income tax are exempted because of basic provisions such as limitations on tax for low-income earners, according to a 2011 study by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. The other half benefit from targeted breaks (known to tax geeks as “tax expenditures”), such as assistance for the working poor and for children in moderate-income families. Seniors also benefit from some of these targeted breaks. To analyze which breaks are most important in moving people off the income-tax rolls, the TPC study arranged these tax expenditures into eight categories: Elderly tax benefits (the extra standard deduction for the elderly, the exclusion of a portion of Social Security benefits, and the credit for the elderly); Credits for children and the working poor (the child tax credit, the child and dependent care tax credit, and the Earned Income Tax Credit); Exclusion of other cash transfers (such as welfare and disability payments); Tax-exempt interest and some other deductions, such as for retirement savings; Itemized deductions; Education credits; Other credits; and Reduced rates on capital gains and dividends (zero rate on gains and dividends that would otherwise be taxed at 10% or 15%, 15% rate combined with credits). The TPC found that of the 38 million households that are made nontaxable by tax expenditures, “44% are moved off the tax rolls by elderly tax benefits and another 30% by credits for children and the working poor.” So how did we get to the point where almost half of American households pay no income tax? Since the 1970s, Congress and successive presidents have begun creating more and more tax breaks to benefit broad swaths of the population (and some very narrow gauges too). Democrats generally have been more supportive of the particular breaks that push people off the income-tax rolls, but Republicans have supported a few too, and they also have pushed breaks that benefit higher-income people. More In Taxes The basic exemptions for very low-income people have been around for a while and are pretty non-controversial. Many of the breaks that benefit the elderly also have been supported by members of both parties, who realize older Americans are among the most consistent voters. Breaks for military personnel – such as the exemption for combat pay – also are widely popular.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1347990363693</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 13:46:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347990391645-46</Id><Topic><Title>47% of voters have for sure written off Romney</Title><Username>iseek_the_truth_03</Username><Timestamp>1347982832634</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 11:40:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Issues 2012 No.23 September 2012 THE FOOD STAMP RECOVERY: The Unprecedented Increase in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program 2008–12 Diana Furchtgott-Roth1 Senior Fellow Manhattan Institute. EMAIL THIS | PRINTER FRIENDLY DOWNLOAD PDF 27 Three years after the end of the 2007–09 recession, which officially began in December 2007 and ended in June 2009, 47 million people each month are using the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). At the beginning of the recession, fewer than one in 10 Americans received SNAP benefits. Nearly 15 percent of Americans now use SNAP benefits, formerly called food stamps, a program administered by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). This translates to more than one in 7 Americans currently using SNAP benefits, a record non-emergency high.[2] There is much concern surrounding this unprecedented increase in America's SNAP program, which began in 2008. Food stamp participation has always increased during a recession and in the initial stages of a recovery. The purpose of this report is to determine whether the recent increase in SNAP participation is comparable to increases during other recent recessions. Our results demonstrate that levels seen since the end of this recession are far higher than in prior recoveries (see Figure 1). While the 36 month periods following the recessions of the early 1980s saw decreases in food stamp usage, the recessions of the early 1990s and in 2001 saw increases between 1 and 2 percent over the same period, in comparison with an increase of 3.5 percent following the recession ending in 2009. In addition to the difficult job market, this is because of changes in the program that began in October 2008, including expansion of benefits and elimination of the cap for child care expenses. History of Eligibility Inception and Expansion of the Food Stamp Program Since its inception on a national scale in 1964 through the Food Stamp Act of 1964, eligibility requirements have periodically been expanded and tightened with each reauthorization bill. Large increases in participation reflect not only population growth and economic variation, but also responses to eligibility changes. For instance, the program originally had a purchase requirement meaning that recipients were required to purchase food stamps, "paying an amount commensurate with their normal expenditures for food and receiving an amount of food stamps representing an opportunity more nearly to obtain a low-cost nutritionally adequate diet."[3] This requirement was later eliminated. In 1971, P.L. 91-671 "Amendments to the 1964 Food Stamp Act" standardized national eligibility and work requirements. It also expanded the Food Stamp Program to Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. In 1974, P.L. 93-347, Domestic Food Assistance Program authorized USDA to pay 50 percent of states' administrative costs. There were 10 million participants in 1971. This grew to nearly 14 million in 1974. Limitations in the Late 1970s and Early 1980s The Food Stamp Act of 1977, which went into effect January 1, 1979, set the net income threshold for food stamps eligibility at 100 percent of the poverty line. For current eligibility thresholds, see Table 1. The 1977 Act also eliminated categorical eligibility and replaced a number of income deductions with a standard deduction. The Act restricted student and alien eligibility, and penalized household heads who voluntarily quit jobs. However, the resource limit was also increased. The most significant structural change to the program under this Act was the elimination of the purchase requirement. Once the purchase requirement was eliminated in January 1979, there was a 1.5 million increase in food stamp program participants. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 added a gross income limit of 130 percent of poverty (for households with no elderly or disabled members). Expansions in the Mid- to Late-1980s In response to widespread domestic hunger problems, legislators eased requirements for participation. The resources limit was increased to $2,000, categorical eligibility was reinstituted, the homeless became eligible, and the advanced earned income tax credits were excluded from income calculations. Also, sales taxes on food stamp purchases were eliminated, and applying medical deductions was made easier. Table 2 and Figures 2, 3, and 4 show the average income and benefit levels per participant in real terms from 1989 to 2010.</Msg><Username>liberals_plague_humanity</Username><Timestamp>1347990391645</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 13:46:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347990748648-47</Id><Topic><Title>“My job is not to worry about those people."</Title><Username>nazyoyo</Username><Timestamp>1347986910615</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 12:48:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You stooge of Satan.

The emails, obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request and published by The Daily Caller, often show department public affairs chief Tracy Schmaler communicating with Media Matters bloggers. Sometimes, the emails were in response to inquiries. Other times, Schmaler was pitching ideas, according to the Caller. In a January 2012 email chain, Schmaler sent a Media Matters writer lines from House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Darrell Issa's comments at a recent hearing. She reportedly underlined passages where the California Republican tries to explain the difference between Operation Fast and Furious and other anti-gunrunning operations under former President George W. Bush. Hours later, an article appeared on Media Matters' site titled "Rep. Issa Ties Himself in Fast and Furious Knots." Daily Caller editor Tucker Carlson, also a Fox News contributor, said the emails show "moment-to-moment coordination" between the department and Media Matters. "We received a massive amount of these communiques that indicate direct coordination between the Obama Justice Department ... and Media Matters to subvert news stories," he said Tuesday. "This proves coordination." Emails from late 2010 also reportedly showed Schmaler sending Media Matters information to help challenge claims that the department dealt lightly with New Black Panther members who allegedly intimidated voters in Philadelphia in 2008. Another March 12 email showed Schmaler pointing out "false" statements made by Tea Party Nation founder Judson Phillips in a Fox News interview. Phillips called Operation Fast and Furious a "political operation" -- pushing a claim that the administration let guns walk across the Mexico border to build a case for gun control. The Media Matters writer then wrote a blog slamming Phillips' "right-wing conspiracy theory," and also sent the text to Schmaler. The Daily Caller reported that throughout the exchanges, Media Matters staffers were often sending to Schmaler the full text of what they wrote about the department's critics.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1348015565417</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 20:46:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348015763364-76</Id><Title>Want to win the lottery</Title><Msg>Live in America where anybody can achieve anything.

A review of transcripts by The Daily Caller indicate that no questions have been asked by the reporters who cover the president about Sebelius during official White House briefings or gaggles since Sept. 12, when the U.S. Office of Special Counsel said in a report that the cabinet secretary violated the Hatch Act earlier this year. It’s still up to President Obama whether Sebelius should keep her job or face some sort of punishment after being found in violation of the Hatch Act. (WATCHDOG: Obama must punish Sebelius or Congress can impeach her) The ethics office said Sebelius violated the law on Feb. 25 while delivering a speech to Human Rights Campaign while serving in her official capacity as cabinet secretary. In her speech, she called for Obama’s re-election, and the election of the Democratic candidate for governor in North Carolina. The Hatch Act prohibits certain civil servants in the federal government from engaging in political activity on the job. “While a violation of the Hatch Act occurred, Secretary Sebelius’ statements would have been permissible if they had been made in her personal capacity,” the report said. Even though reporters haven’t inquired during press conferences and gaggles, White House spokesman Eric Schultz told The Associated Press that, “These were extemporaneous remarks … the U.S. Treasury has been reimbursed, and Secretary Sebelius has met with ethics experts to ensure this never happens again.” Ads by Google The news about Sebelius was overshadowed last week by the attacks on America’s diplomats in the Middle East. But Torie Clarke, a former Assistant Secretary of Defense under Donald Rumsfeld, argued while guest hosting WMAL’s Mornings on the Mall on Monday that a double standard may be at play. “If it were a Republican official who had done this, the outrage would be continued and loud and would have been on the Sunday talk shows beyond Benghazi and anything else,” Clarke said.</Msg><Username>liberals_plague_humanity</Username><Timestamp>1348016822050</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 21:07:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348017113252-82</Id><Topic><Title>gop hates minimum wages but whine that those living on them pay no income tax</Title><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1347993076127</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 14:31:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Message from Blue Cross Blue Shield Professor Emeritus John W.
