Marginal rates are a meaningless political description, while effective rates are an economic/accounting measure of reality.

A spokesman for the North's General Department of Atomic Energy said scientists will quickly begin work "readjusting and restarting" a uranium enrichment plant and a graphite-moderated, 5-megawatt reactor that could produce a bomb's worth of plutonium each year. Experts considered the uranium announcement to be a public declaration from Pyongyang that it will make highly enriched uranium that could be used for bomb fuel.</Msg><Username>onedinosaur</Username><Timestamp>1364924297311</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 13:38:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364925626669-34</Id><Topic><Title>Time to Raise Taxes on Rich : Ben Stein,conservative &amp; republican</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1364919691741</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 12:21:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"North Korea vows " you blather, but #$%$, Bush found all the wmd, and spent trillions to find them.</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1364925626669</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 14:00:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364926225128-35</Id><Topic><Title>Time to Raise Taxes on Rich : Ben Stein,conservative &amp; republican</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1364919691741</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 12:21:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Even that db is right on occasion.</Msg><Username>dropkickpubs4321</Username><Timestamp>1364926225128</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 14:10:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364932576418-36</Id><Topic><Title>Time to Raise Taxes on Rich : Ben Stein,conservative &amp; republican</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1364919691741</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 12:21:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>true, mostly Ben stein is a jerkarse.....but at least he got his head out of his rearend and can see that taxes should be raised on incomes over $250K, and that workers in low wage jobs do deserve a living wage,...and that the tax cuts for the rich never did a bit of good for the economy or anyone but the rich who got richer while everyone else got poorer.</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1364932576418</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 15:56:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364933311870-37</Id><Topic><Title>Analyst ORCL Price Target Reduced =SEE REPORT</Title><Username>vandammarc</Username><Timestamp>1364409400371</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-27 14:36:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>fantastic</Msg><Username>ramozsergio</Username><Timestamp>1364933311870</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 16:08:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364935413116-38</Id><Topic><Title>=(BREAKING NEWS) Analyst Downgrades ORCL =(MUST READ)</Title><Username>johnnyford834</Username><Timestamp>1363881147525</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-21 11:52:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>great update.</Msg><Username>whitejack319</Username><Timestamp>1364935413116</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 16:43:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364941059157-39</Id><Topic><Title>Walmart: America's real 'Welfare Queen' (the rich got richer, everyone else got poorer, the walton's are tax subsidized )</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1364827676049</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 10:47:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ALL our problems come from the WMT equation....ALL!
