I talked to a young man years ago whose father ran a small local newspaper. His dad was a flaming red "liberal". Pat Brown, Gov. of California at the time rewarded the father by giving him a state bank charter. (Another "liberal" bankster bleeding workers with usury) I think this young man began to get an inkling of what it really was all about. I was very sad to hear that while traveling abroad in Turkey he got caught with some Marijuana. I don't know what they did to him but they are very harsh. I blame the dad as much as the young guy. "Anything goes" with most of the "liberal" bent and the boy was caught up in that type of teaching.</Msg><Username>lewcor</Username><Timestamp>1353552448858</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 21:47:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
