We've mentioned Carter perhaps being only US pres. in modern times who wasn't responsible for killing innocents.

The woman, who wishes to remain anonymous, inherited the gun from her father who had brought it home with him from Europe as a memento from World War II. The two officers conducting the gun buy-back, who are resident gun experts for the Hartford Police Department, informed the owner she was in possession of a Nazi Assault Rifle, the first of its kind, that dates back to 1944. The gun is called a Sturmgewehr 44, literally meaning "storm rifle," and is the first "modern assault rifle ever made, eventually replaced by the AK 47 in 1947 by Russia, who copied the German design of the Sturmgewehr 44," Officer Lewis Crabtree, one of the two officers who discovered the gun, told ABC News.</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1355245098632</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 11:58:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355245162273-29</Id><Topic><Title>There isn't a single decent republican here.

Our line gang worked Christmas Day at the Convair plant in San Diego. We went to a second floor engineering floor via an outside staircase. There was a fence covered with black tarps as high as the second floor. We could see over it. It was a German V-2 being redisigned to later become our Atlas missile. I was surprised that we were let into an area where we could see it as the whole program was hush hush. I later did quite a bit of work at Convairs Sycamore Canyon Test Site. Got to go into the bunkers that had all the instrumentation and visual ports with very thick glass.

Our line gang worked Christmas Day at the Convair plant in San Diego. We went to a second floor engineering floor via an outside staircase. There was a fence covered with black tarps as high as the second floor. We could see over it. It was a German V-2 being redisigned to later become our Atlas missile.
