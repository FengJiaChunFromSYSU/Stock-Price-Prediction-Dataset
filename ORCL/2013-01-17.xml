Keep buying those slave labor made goods and help her make another billion or two. And, at the same time much of the profit goes to arm the Red Army. You know the tratorous NWO gang has had plans to police the U.S. with foreign troops. Perhaps they will use the Chi-Coms.</Msg><Username>lewcor</Username><Timestamp>1358440897843</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 11:41:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358446496220-4</Id><Title>Make Chinese jeeps in the USA?

Obama does not want guards in our schools, but ismis okay for his girl's schools (forget the secret service, I am referring tom the armed guards their schools actually hire for all the rich kids going there). Note also that despite his lip service, Obama, like most politicians, is against charter schools and school choice all while sending HIS kids to super-safe private schools.
