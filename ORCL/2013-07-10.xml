CCUR has only 8.754mm s/o, a market cap of $69.07mm, cash of $22.37mm, no debt, and an enterprise value of $46.7mm. CCUR's enterprise value is only 0.74X revenues of $63.23mm, 6.55X operating cash flow of $7.13mm, and 8.34X free cash flow of $5.6mm. CCUR's EPS was up 175% last quarter and it just raised its dividend by 100% to $0.48 per share for a yield of 6.1%. CCUR is the leader of some of the world's hottest technologies! CCUR leads the video on demand (VOD) delivery business with over 2.4mm streams deployed worldwide and 4 of America's 6 largest cable TV operators as clients. The #2 VOD technology vendor Seachange (SEAC) is currently trading for $11.50 and has an enterprise value of $262.4mm or 1.68X revenues of $156.11mm, 15.05X operating cash flow of $17.43mm, and 19.32X free cash flow of $13.58mm. An enterprise value of 1.68X revenues would value CCUR at $14.69 per share. An enterprise value of 15.05X operating cash flow will value CCUR at $14.81 per share. An enterprise value of 19.32X free cash flow will value CCUR at $14.91 per share. CCUR also has the leading Big Data Analytics software being used by pay-TV operators. CCUR tracks the behavior of 35mm pay-TV subscribers and has processed 15 billion media transactions. Big Data Analytics is the hottest space on Wall Street. Tableau Software (DATA) recently had its IPO at $31 and hit a new 52-week high on Monday of $63 for a gain of 103%. DATA's enterprise value is currently 25X revenues. Another Big Data stock Splunk (SPLK) currently has an enterprise value of 22X revenues. CCUR's enterprise value is currently only 0.74X revenues! CCUR will likely break through its 52-week high of $8.45 in the upcoming days and explode to double digits! CCUR's business is booming as pay-TV operators upgrade to provide multi-screen/TV Everywhere access, Network (cloud based) DVR services, and start-over/look-back services!</Msg><Username>bbajf591</Username><Timestamp>1373463675409</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-10 09:41:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373463719069-8</Id><Title>profiling: It's effective and begs the obvious</Title><Msg>In an initiative aimed at rooting out future leakers and other security violators, President Barack Obama has ordered federal employees to report suspicious actions of their colleagues based on behavioral profiling techniques that are not scientifically proven to work, according to experts and government documents.

Greenland is interesting as it's climate changed drastically a thousand years ago due to the shifting of the Gulf Stream. It shifted North between Greenland and Baffin Island causing "Gren" land to become green. At the same time it caused Europe to have a mini-ice age. Also in Greenlands glaciers they have taken air bubbles going back a very long time. At times the CO2 levels have been much higher than now. These periods DID NOT coincide with higher temps.
