When asked about how he felt about the nation’s first black President, Barack Obama, Thomas said he always knew it would have to be a person who was “approved by the elites and the media” because if it was someone who they didn’t agree with, that person would be picked apart. “Any black person who says something that is not the prescribed things that they expect from a black person will be picked apart… So, I always assumed it would be someone the media had to agree with,” Thomas said. Thomas also claimed that he had only met Obama in passing, shaking his hand at the inauguration, but never engaging an in-depth conversation.</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1367582112830</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 07:55:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367587415406-3</Id><Title>Obama is preparing a stern, stern speech on Benghazi</Title><Msg>NOT about the perps or their leader, who has spent the past 7 months vacationing in Northern Africa and Southern Europe, No, Obama's stern speech will be taking everyday Americans to task, such as parents and siblings of the dead, others who were their and have been threatened with severe ramifications if they talk a out it, current soldiers who are left wondering "what ever happened to leaving no soldier behind?" and "why didn't anyone show up to help?", and you and I who just want honest answers.</Msg><Username>gr8mkt</Username><Timestamp>1367587415406</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 09:23:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367587514710-4</Id><Topic><Title>Obama Admin gets TOUGH on Terrorism!</Title><Username>beelzebufo_ampinga_10048</Username><Timestamp>1367525552196</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 16:12:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Maybe her husband will contribute to DNC like the Rich family?</Msg><Username>coughingredink</Username><Timestamp>1367587514710</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 09:25:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367587999405-5</Id><Topic><Title>Let's see -- Clinton committed a felony and lost his license to practice law.</Title><Username>indahouzza</Username><Timestamp>1366931376513</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-25 19:09:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He was born lying.

Most of the stats are essentially unchanged and there is nothing in Table A-1 to explain what is going on. On Table B-1 we find, on a NOT seasonally adjusted basis, that (preliminary) Total Private Employment has increased by 937000 in the following industries (highest to low) Leisure and hospitality: +323000 (preliminary) Professional and business services: +240000 (preliminary) (Tax accountants in April?) Construction: +160000 (preliminary) Retail trade: +107000 (preliminary) Those four account for 740000 of the change. There are about another 107000 scattered elsewhere. So the tiny (0.1 point) dip in unemployment can be explained as seasonal variations in the underlying data, even after it has been adjusted for seasonal variations.</Msg><Username>beelzebufo_ampinga_10048</Username><Timestamp>1367593044580</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 10:57:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367593194536-8</Id><Topic><Title>April 2013 Employment Data Affected by Seasonal Changes</Title><Username>beelzebufo_ampinga_10048</Username><Timestamp>1367593044580</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 10:57:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>For those who like the original data: APRIL-2013 (Changes are March to April) Table A-1 (Household data) Adjusted: Labor Participation Rate: 63.3 (unchanged) Total Employed: 143579 (up by 293) Employment Population Ratio: 58.6 (up 0.1) Unemployed: 11659 (down 83) Unemployment Rate: 7.5 (down by 0.1) Not in Labor Force: 89936 (down by 31) But want a job: 6413 (down by 309) From Table B-1 (Data by Industry Sector) Unadjusted (Includes seasonal): Total private: +937 (preliminary) Leisure and hospitality: +323 (preliminary) Professional and business services: +240 (preliminary) Retail trade: +107 (preliminary) Construction: +160 (preliminary)</Msg><Username>beelzebufo_ampinga_10048</Username><Timestamp>1367593194536</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 10:59:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367593242712-9</Id><Topic><Title>you need need to look at this post if you like (stock)</Title><Username>matthewhunter112</Username><Timestamp>1367591121143</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 10:25:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I hate stock and I hate you.</Msg><Username>beelzebufo_ampinga_10048</Username><Timestamp>1367593242712</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 11:00:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367593434426-10</Id><Title>I cant believe this S##T</Title><Msg>Free stock picks sent to your phone for free.

Nothing less, nothing more. The share of American adults with jobs has barely changed since 2010, hovering between 58.2 percent and 58.7 percent. This employment-to-population ratio stood at 58.6 percent in April. That is about four percentage points lower than the employment rate before the recession, a difference of roughly 10 million jobs. In other words, the United States economy is not getting any closer to recreating the jobs lost during the recession. Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics This lack of progress has been obscured by the steady decline of the high-profile unemployment rate, which continued in April. But the unemployment rate is easily misunderstood. The government counts as unemployed only those who are actively looking for new jobs. As people have given up, the unemployment rate has declined – not because more people are working, but because more people have stopped looking for work.</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1367593434444</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 11:03:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367593503369-12</Id><Title>Weekly options should be banned</Title><Msg>look at how the stock is pinned to 33.50 today.

Once upon a time, the United States was a paradise for entrepreneurs and small businesses, but now the control freak bureaucrats that dominate our society have created a system that absolutely eviscerates them. This is very unfortunate, because by murdering small business, the bureaucrats are destroying the primary engine of job growth in this country. One of the big reasons why there are not enough jobs in America today is because small business creation is way down. As I mentioned yesterday, entrepreneurs and small businesses are being absolutely devastated by rules, regulations, red tape and by oppressive levels of taxation. If anyone doubts that small business in the United States is dying, just look at the charts below. Sadly, this is what the bureaucrats that run things want. They don't want us to be independent of the system. Instead, they are much more comfortable when as many of us as possible are heavily dependent on the system in one way or another. If all of us have to go running to the government or to one of the big corporations for a job, then we are much easier to control. But as the control freaks continue to construct their bureaucratic utopia, they are also killing off what once made the U.S. economy so great. The other day I came across the following two charts in an article by Charles Hugh Smith, and I was absolutely stunned by what I saw. This first chart shows that the number of unincorporated self-employed Americans has dropped back to levels that we have not seen since the mid-1980s even though our population has increased by tens of millions of people since that time...</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1367594180838</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 11:16:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367594634825-14</Id><Title>YeeeeeeeeeHaaaaaaaaa!!

Russia's military announced last month that as part of the nuclear buildup, Moscow later this year will deploy the first of its new intercontinental ballistic missiles called the Yars-M. Details of the missile are being kept secret, but it has been described as a fifth-generation strategic nuclear system that Russian officials say will be able to penetrate U.S. missile defenses using a new type of fuel that requires a shorter burn time for booster engines. The solid-fueled, road-mobile ICBM was tested a year ago, and it is said to have an increased payload capacity for a warhead weighing up to 1.5 tons. The range is 6,835 miles. Like earlier mobile missiles known #$%$-29s and SS-27s, the new ICBM is expected to have up to 10 multiple, independently targetable warheads. Retired Russian strategic forces commander Col. Gen. Viktor Yesin has said the Yars-M “is one of the military technological measures that the Russian military-political leadership has devised in response to the development of a global missile-defense system by the Americans.” Last year, a Russian official explained the new missile’s fuel and anti-missile defense capabilities in an interview with Moskovski Komsomolets. The strategic nuclear weapons specialist said the high-tech fuel “allows for the reduction of the working time of the engines during the boost phase of flight, when it [the missile] is most vulnerable to detection by defensive means.” “As a result, we achieve the most complex part of the rocket boost so fast that the enemy does not have time to calculate its trajectory and, therefore, cannot destroy it,” the official said. “That is, we can say that our ability to overcome missile defense will be signifi</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1367594845220</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 11:27:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367596504758-16</Id><Topic><Title>Deadliest month in Iraq since the US pulled out.</Title><Username>kollesteral</Username><Timestamp>1367543828407</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 21:17:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>wow, we have someone suggesting Vietnam and Iraq were "wins" for the US. wow, just wow.</Msg><Username>kollesteral</Username><Timestamp>1367596504758</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 11:55:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367597192533-17</Id><Topic><Title>higher tax Clinton era was the longest period of peacetime economic expansion in American history</Title><Username>granniefritz</Username><Timestamp>1367452336607</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 19:52:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Despite sequester, DOD signs contract for $59/gallon green jet fuel May 2, 2013 | 12:52 pm | Modified: May 2, 2013 at 6:25 pm 97Comments 148 Share on print Share on email Joel Gehrke Commentary Writer The Washington Examiner ‘Some historians have begun calling Biden the most powerful vice president of modern times’ Photo - A picture taken on Tuesday, Feb. 14, 2012 shows, plane captains pass by F-18 fighter jets on the flight deck of the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN 72) in the Strait of Hurmuz.
