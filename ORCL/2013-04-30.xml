The state has handed over more than 500 documents to the 11-member House Post Audit and Oversight Committee, which today met for the first time and plans to call in officials from the Department of Transitional Assistance to testify.</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1367322824320</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 07:53:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367323904967-4</Id><Title>Hilary lied (again), and this time people died because of it</Title><Msg>Her third lie on Benghazi!

However, a Christian florist can't refuse to supply the flowers for a same sex marriage ceremony because he sees it as immoral in his beliefs. Death penalty opponents murdered 333,964 lives last year by abortion. No trial, no lawyer, no due process.
