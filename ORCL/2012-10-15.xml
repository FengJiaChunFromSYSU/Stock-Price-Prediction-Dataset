Biden said something like we were unaware – nobody told us. The administration is going to pin the whole thing on Hillary. In recent days Obama has come under scrutiny for the way in which it released information about the Libya attacks to the American public. On September 11, 2012 Ambassador, Christopher Stevens, and the other Americans were killed after Islamist gunmen attacked the U.S. consulate and a safe house refuge in Benghazi. Obama and Biden called the attack a spontaneous event in response to a film that portrayed Muslim in an unflattering light. It was all a bullsheet cover-up. Obama and Biden deliberately misled the American people, knowing it was an act of terror. They say the decision was political, that Obama didn't want to disclose that al-Qadea had made a comeback in Libya.

Well, I propose that we also allow Oracle's customers to ALSO vote in proportion to the number of dollars that they spend on Oracle products. They would probably vote to reduce the cost of Oracle products so that our company would start losing a lot of money. Eventually, the word would get out and the number of Oracle customers would swell to far more people than there are shareholders, and they, too, would vote according to their expenditures on Oracle's products to make them as affordable as possible... and Oracle would go bankrupt. Think that's funny?... don't laugh. That's exactly how our country is run and our politicians are elected... and how socialism eventually destroys a society.

They've all been made possible with taxpayer assistance, according to the latest survey of government waste put out by Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla. Known simply as the Waste Book, the report is a watchlist of eye-opening expenditures, which Coburn blames on a "let them eat caviar" attitude in Washington -- at a time when "23 million of our fellow Americans do not have good jobs," Coburn notes. Here are some highlights: - Though skeptics say there's no such thing as a free cellphone or service funded by the federal government, Coburn's report shows otherwise. It estimates that taxpayers are subsidizing phone service at a cost of nearly $1.5 billion a year. Though the roots of the program can be traced back to an effort in the 1930s to make sure all Americans had access to telecommunications, it has morphed into program that provided free cell service to some 16,500,000 participants last year. - Though NASA has no plans or budget for any manned spaceflights to Mars, the agency spends about $1 million each year on developing "the Mars menu." It's an effort to come up with a variety of food that humans could eat one day on Mars. - A $325,000 grant for the development of "Robosquirrel" - a robotic rodent designed to test the interaction between rattlesnakes and squirrels. - An estimated $70 million loss for producing pennies. According to the Waste Book, "The cost to produce a penny in 2012 is more than two times its actual value." After the pennies are manufactured and sold at face value, taxpayers are left to cover the loss. - The report spotlights widespread abuse of the food stamp system - including an exotic dancer who earned more than $85,000 a year in tips, but also collected nearly $1,000 a month in food stamps while spending $9,000 during that time period on "cosmetic enhancements." - Nearly $700,000 from the National Science Foundation to a New York-based theater company so it could develop a musical about climate change and biodiversity. "The Great Immensity" opened in Kansas City this year. Along with the songs one reviewer described as sounding like "a Wikipedia entry set to music," the audience was also able to experience "flying monkey poop." In all, the 2012 Waste Book report details 100 examples totaling nearly $19 billion. Coburn acknowledges that's a drop in the bucket in contrast to the overall federal deficit, which tops $16 trillion, but he says the items are snapshots of the bigger problem. "Would you agree with Washington that these represent national priorities, or would you conclude these reflect the out-of-touch and out-of-control spending threatening to bankrupt of nation’s future?" he said.</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1350357893809</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 23:24:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
