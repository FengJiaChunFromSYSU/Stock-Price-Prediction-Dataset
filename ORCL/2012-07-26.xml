We come through things, but its not always a smooth ride." Warren Buffett Many economists, ...say a better measure of the nation's debt is how much the government owes creditors, not counting $4.7 trillion owed to future Social Security recipients and other government beneficiaries. By that measure, the debt is roughly a third less: $10.5 trillion, or nearly 70% the size of the economy. that is correct. for instance 10% of US debt is "owed" to the federal reserve ...... but not really since the fed pays it back to the government...... and as for SS. well THOSE trillions are not due tomorrow, right?..... (SS is owed over a period out to 2036 or so now , i think. SO.... that 3 trillion or what ever, is NOT really a percent of one year gdp, but a percent of 15 years of gdp... 3 trillion divided by the 225 trillion gdp crude estimate for that period.......(1.3%)) get the picture? YOU are dishonest to say the above is NOT the case. hence, we are at about 70% of debt-owed-to-the-public/gdp, and it has been far worse before in US history. and everything will work out fine as long as we adhere to the extended baseline projection of the cbo, which both ryan's plan and just getting rid of the bush tax cuts would achieve: Summary Figure 1.

For while debt can be a problem, the way our politicians and pundits think about debt is all wrong, and exaggerates the problem’s size. Deficit-worriers portray a future in which we’re impoverished by the need to pay back money we’ve been borrowing. They see America as being like a family that took out too large a mortgage, and will have a hard time making the monthly payments. This is, however, a really bad analogy in at least two ways. First, families have to pay back their debt. Governments don’t — all they need to do is ensure that debt grows more slowly than their tax base. The debt from World War II was never repaid; it just became increasingly irrelevant as the U.S. economy grew, and with it the income subject to taxation. Second — and this is the point almost nobody seems to get — an over-borrowed family owes money to someone else; U.S. debt is, to a large extent, money we owe to ourselves. This was clearly true of the debt incurred to win World War II. Taxpayers were on the hook for a debt that was significantly bigger, as a percentage of G.D.P., than debt today; but that debt was also owned by taxpayers, such as all the people who bought savings bonds. So the debt didn’t make postwar America poorer. In particular, the debt didn’t prevent the postwar generation from experiencing the biggest rise in incomes and living standards in our nation’s history. But isn’t this time different? Not as much as you think. It’s true that foreigners now hold large claims on the United States, including a fair amount of government debt. But every dollar’s worth of foreign claims on America is matched by 89 cents’ worth of U.S. claims on foreigners. And because foreigners tend to put their U.S. investments into safe, low-yield assets, America actually earns more from its assets abroad than it pays to foreign investors. If your image is of a nation that’s already deep in hock to the Chinese, you’ve been misinformed. Nor are we heading rapidly in that direction. Now, the fact that federal debt isn’t at all like a mortgage on America’s future doesn’t mean that the debt is harmless. Taxes must be levied to pay the interest, and you don’t have to be a right-wing ideologue to concede that taxes impose some cost on the economy, if nothing else by causing a diversion of resources away from productive activities into tax avoidance and evasion. But these costs are a lot less dramatic than the analogy with an overindebted family might suggest. And that’s why nations with stable, responsible governments — that is, governments that are willing to impose modestly higher taxes when the situation warrants it — have historically been able to live with much higher levels of debt than today’s conventional wisdom would lead you to believe. Britain, in particular, has had debt exceeding 100 percent of G.D.P. for 81 of the last 170 years. When Keynes was writing about the need to spend your way out of a depression, Britain was deeper in debt than any advanced nation today, with the exception of Japan. Of course, America, with its rabidly antitax conservative movement, may not have a government that is responsible in this sense. But in that case the fault lies not in our debt, but in ourselves. So yes, debt matters. But right now, other things matter more. We need more, not less, government spending to get us out of our unemployment trap. And the wrongheaded, ill-informed obsession with debt is standing in the way." krugman January 2, 2012,</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1343328805000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 14:53:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343328837000-37</Id><Topic><Title>a note to the phonys on debt</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1343326565000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 14:16:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>where I live you end up buying a house several times your annual income.

For that money you would be better off building the house yourself. I bet you could do it in 5 years. You see... in the USA, economic specialization - and the scams wrapped around it - destroys productivity rather than improving it. Hey.... but the government will borrow money to pay the bank for you. You'll just have to pay it back later in taxes. Great deal. Then you fell rich because you own a house worth $800K! (And it doesn't bother you that the same house in Florida or Phoenix is worth maybe $100K) People borrowing money to buy houses like this are AT LEAST as much to blame than the government for the debt problem.</Msg><Username>nazyoyo</Username><Timestamp>1343333061000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 16:04:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343333711000-55</Id><Topic><Title>The importance of Social Security</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1343179062000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 21:17:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's a bunch of IOU's in a file cabinets in West Virginia.
