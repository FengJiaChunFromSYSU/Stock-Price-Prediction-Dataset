After Coulter started to say that Republicans should concede on taxes on the very rich, Hannity wondered why the House didn't just pass a bill extending the Bush tax cuts for everyone. "OK fine, let's do that, but in the end, at some point, if the Bush tax cuts are repealed and everyone's taxes go up, I promise you Republicans will get blamed for it," she said. "It doesn't mean you cave on everything, but there are some things Republicans do that feed into what the media is telling America about Republicans." "So are you saying that, for PR purposes, that they should give in to Obama on the tax rate?" Hannity asked. "Not exactly, I--" Coulter said, before stopping herself and saying, "Well, yeah, I guess I am." "You're saying capitulate to Obama?" Hannity stammered. "We don't have a revenue problem, Ann." "We lost the election, Sean!" Coulter replied. Other right-wing pundits, such as Bill Kristol, have echoed Coulter's argument. Kristol famously said that it wouldn't "kill the country" if taxes on millionaires went up.</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1354807132042</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 10:18:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354807305871-20</Id><Topic><Title>gop lost because they dont listen or talk to the middleclass</Title><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1354805840986</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 09:57:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The vonly reason I've stayed registered as a Republican was that I had some small hope of influencing things in the primaries.

Among its most vocal supporters were Republican war veterans, including President George H.W. Bush and former senator Bob Dole, who was injured in World War II and made a rare return to the Senate floor Tuesday to observe the vote and lend his stature. Other conservatives were deeply suspicious of the United Nations, which would oversee treaty obligations. Those who opposed the treaty included former senator and Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum, the father of a developmentally disabled child who had traveled to Capitol Hill last week to encourage fellow Republicans to vote no. He and other conservatives argued that the treaty could relinquish U.S. sovereignty to a U.N. committee charged with overseeing a ban on discrimination and determining how the disabled, including children, should be treated. They particularly worried that the committee could violate the rights of parents who choose to home school their disabled children.</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1354828137874</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 16:08:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354828420506-65</Id><Title>whiny republicans whine about the lowest income taxes . classy bunch.</Title><Msg>and the whiny republicans are holding the middleclass hostage: no tax cuts for the 98% unless the most wealthy 2% who take in about half of the nations income keep their tax cuts too.</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1354828420506</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 16:13:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354828637016-66</Id><Topic><Title>gop lost because they dont listen or talk to the middleclass</Title><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1354805840986</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 09:57:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>gop message to the middleclass: "let us cut your and your mother's social security so we can continue to pay the lowest rates ever , we don't even want to go back to the clinton era rates which were the next lowest rates on avg ever"........</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1354828637016</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 16:17:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354829004639-67</Id><Title>gop to middleclass:" we doubled the defense budget 2000-2008, and we want YOU to pay for it, with tax cuts for the rich and spending cuts on social security</Title><Msg>nice work gop: double the defense budget and cut taxes to pay for it.

" and when did the trend of LOWER national debt each year after WW2 end?................. yep, Reagan turned that around! and he TRIPLED the nation's debts with his tax cuts and ENDED the entire post war history of a lower national debt each year.</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1354829004639</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 16:23:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354829311264-68</Id><Topic><Title>all 38 no votes were republicans who even peed on GH Bush and bob dole to vote no</Title><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1354828137874</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 16:08:57 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>likey more republicans would vote to prevent TinyTim Cratchit from getting the medical attention his family could not afford on Scrooge's wages.........</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1354829311264</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 16:28:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354829326042-69</Id><Title>Obama wants dictatorial power over debt ceiling</Title><Msg>No wonder he has such admiration and praise for Egypt's new Muslim Brotherhood dictator Morisi</Msg><Username>howie_is_long</Username><Timestamp>1354829326042</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 16:28:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354829378214-70</Id><Topic><Title>Obama wants dictatorial power over debt ceiling</Title><Username>howie_is_long</Username><Timestamp>1354829326042</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 16:28:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you are, as always, a liar.</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1354829378214</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 16:29:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354829626967-71</Id><Topic><Title>gop lost because they dont listen or talk to the middleclass</Title><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1354805840986</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 09:57:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>gop to middleclass: "'what part of 2% don't you understand?... we need to cut the COLA on social security to preserve the bush tax cuts for the 2%,,, who needs money more, your elderly mother or a billionaire who is accustomed to having so much money they can send it to the cayman islands?"</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1354829626967</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 16:33:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354829862945-72</Id><Title>billionaires to the elderly on social security: " we must cut the COLA to preserve our bush tax cut"</Title><Msg>billionaires to the elderly on social security: " we must cut the COLA to preserve our bush tax cut" Please try and understand how important it is to the billionaires that they not be taxed as much as they were in the 1990s or 80s, or 70s, or 60s, 50s,40s,30s, 20s and well, you get the picture.</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1354829862945</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 16:37:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354829951239-73</Id><Topic><Title>gop lost because they dont listen or talk to the middleclass</Title><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1354805840986</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 09:57:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I would cut the rate in the growth of the COLA... and after one has received back 100% of their SS contribution... + say a 4% compounded return... your payment should be frozen.... no more COLAs.... because at that point... you will truly be on the dole</Msg><Username>howie_is_long</Username><Timestamp>1354829951239</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 16:39:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354830076898-74</Id><Topic><Title>billionaires to the elderly on social security: " we must cut the COLA to preserve our bush tax cut"</Title><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1354829862945</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 16:37:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why stop there.. why not go back to before there was an income tax?
