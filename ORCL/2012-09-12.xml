John Nathman speaks on stage with military veterans during the final day of the Democratic National Convention on Sept. 6 in Charlotte, N.C. Experts say the ships in the background are Russian. On the last night of the Democratic National Convention, a retired Navy four-star took the stage to pay tribute to veterans. Behind him, on a giant screen, the image of four hulking warships reinforced his patriotic message. But there was a big mistake in the stirring backdrop: those are Russian warships. While retired Adm. John Nathman, a former commander of Fleet Forces Command, honored vets as America’s best, the ships from the Russian Federation Navy were arrayed like sentinels on the big screen above. These were the very Soviet-era combatants that Nathman and Cold Warriors like him had once squared off against. “The ships are definitely Russian,” said noted naval author Norman Polmar after reviewing hi-resolution photos from the event. “There’s no question of that in my mind.” Naval experts concluded the background was a photo composite of Russian ships that were overflown by what appear to be U.S. trainer jets. It remains unclear how or why the Democratic Party used what’s believed to be images of the Russian Black Sea Fleet at their convention. A spokesman for the Democratic National Convention Committee was not able to immediately comment Tuesday, saying he had to track down personnel to find out what had happened. The veteran who spotted the error and notified Navy Times said he was immediately taken aback. “I was kind of in shock,” said Rob Barker, 38, a former electronics warfare technician who left the Navy in 2006. Having learned to visually identify foreign ships by their radars, Barker recognized the closest ship as the Kara-class cruiser Kerch. “An immediate apology [from the committee] would be very nice,” Barker said. “Maybe acknowledge the fact that yes, they screwed up.” The background — featured in the carefully choreographed hour leading up to the president’s Sept. 6 speech accepting the Democratic Party’s nomination — showed four ships with radar designs not used in the U.S. fleet. For example, the ship in the foreground, on the far right, has a square radar antenna at the top of its masthead. That is the MR-700 Podberezovik 3-D early warning radar, commonly identified as “Flat Screen” for its appearance, a three-dimensional early warning radar mounted on the Kerch, said Eric Wertheim, editor of “Combat Fleets of the World.” Similarly, the third ship has a MR-310 “Head Net” air search radar, shaped like two off-set bananas, at its masthead and is mostly likely the guided missile destroyer Smetlivyy. The first two ships seem to be Krivak-class frigates, but it’s hard to discern from the silhouette, experts said. But the fact they are Russian ships is not in doubt. In addition to the ship’s radar arrays and hulls, which are dissimilar from U.S. warships, the photo features one more give-away: a large white flag with a blue ‘X’ at the ships’ sterns. Polmar, who authored “The Naval Institute Guide to the Soviet Navy,” recognized the blue ‘X’-mark: “The X is the Cross of St. Andrew’s, which is a Russian Navy symbol,” Polmar said. (An anchored U.S. warship, by contrast, flies the American flag on its stern.) Based on this specific group of these ship types, one naval expert concluded that this was most likely a photo of the Black Sea Fleet. “Ships are all Black Sea Fleet,” A. D. Baker III, a retired Office of Naval Intelligence analyst, told Navy Times after looking at the image. “These four ships, at the time the photo was taken, constituted the entire major surface combatant component of the Black Sea Fleet,” Baker said, noting the photo was likely to be six years old or older. (The Kerch is now on the list to be scrapped, Baker said.) Barker, the former sailor who first spotted the errors, believes the seven aircraft streaking by are F-5 jets, a trainer used by the U.S. Navy. Asked to explain how he reached that conclusion, the former airplane spotter ticked off a list: “Twin engine, single rudder, with hard points on the wingtips, with that silhouette is going to make them F-5s.”</Msg><Username>onedinosaur</Username><Timestamp>1347449120959</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 07:25:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347449364030-3</Id><Topic><Title>Romulus and Ryanulus promise more Bush tax cuts on top of the previous bush tax cuts</Title><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1347023457307</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 09:10:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>democrats: Feds out to pile dirt on Espada By BRUCE GOLDING Last Updated: 3:12 AM, September 12, 2012 Posted: 1:09 AM, September 12, 2012 Share on email Share on facebook More Sharing ServicesMore Print He’s going on trial for tax evasion this time around, but the feds want jurors to learn all about the corruption of crooked ex-state Sen. Pedro Espada Jr. In court papers, prosecutors say they should be allowed to show how the Bronx Democrat and his son scammed hundreds of thousands of dollars from their nonprofit Soundview medical clinics to pay for “lavish parties” and other personal expenses. “Evidence of these schemes is intertwined with evidence of the defendants’ willful commission of the charged [tax] crimes,” the Manhattan federal-court filing says. “Also, an understanding of those schemes establishes the context in which the preparation and filing of the tax returns charged in the indictment took place.” The Espadas’ tax-fraud trial is set for Nov. 5. Espada already faces 40 years in the slammer after being convicted of four counts of theft in Brooklyn federal court, where he and his son, Pedro Gautier Espada, face a retrial on charges that a jury couldn’t decide. The son’s public defender, Sabrina Shroff, didn’t return a request for comment. The elder Espada’s lawyer, Daniel Hochheiser, said he would respond to the feds’ arguments in court papers due next month, but declined to elaborate.</Msg><Username>liberals_plague_humanity</Username><Timestamp>1347449364030</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 07:29:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347449448752-4</Id><Topic><Title>Romulus and Ryanulus promise more Bush tax cuts on top of the previous bush tax cuts</Title><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1347023457307</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 09:10:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>democrats: Ethics panel issues Lopez-probe subpoenas, eyeing state bigs By JOSH MARGOLIN, BETH DEFALCO and CARL CAMPANILE Last Updated: 6:51 AM, September 12, 2012 Posted: 12:26 AM, September 12, 2012 Share on email Share on facebook More Sharing ServicesMore Print Subpoenas are flying in the expanded ethics probe into Brooklyn Assemblyman Vito Lopez’s alleged sexual harassment of women, as a state panel investigates the roles played by Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and the offices of Comptroller Tom DiNapoli and Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. Gov. Cuomo, meanwhile, wondered whether Silver will survive the scandal. A source with ties to Cuomo said the governor is concerned that Silver may not keep his post. Aides to the governor have gone as far to say that “Shelly is going down” or, at best, is “damaged goods.” GROPEZ: Assemblyman Vito Lopez, outside his Brooklyn office yesterday, allegedly groped several women. Dana Sauchelli GROPEZ: Assemblyman Vito Lopez, outside his Brooklyn office yesterday, allegedly groped several women. Sheldon Silver: Gov fears speaker is toast Chad Rachman/New York Post Sheldon Silver: Gov fears speaker is toast Complicating the political landscape is that there’s no one in line to replace Silver, who has run the Assembly for 18 years. A Cuomo spokesman shot down reports of his private musings as “made up” and “totally false.” The Joint Commission on Public Ethics has issued subpoenas to several staffers in Silver’s office, another source said. Two attorneys in DiNapoli’s office, chief counsel Nancy Groenwegen and lawyer John Dalton, also received subpoenas, sources said. The legal requests for information went out hours after JCOPE’s board voted Monday to authorize a sweeping probe into the actions of everyone involved. Silver’s office had consulted with DiNapoli aides before agreeing to a secret, $103,080 settlement involving harassment claims filed by two women who worked in Lopez’s office. “We are fully cooperating with JCOPE in the subpoenas,” said DiNapoli spokeswoman Jennifer Freeman. William Collins, an attorney in Silver’s office, had sent several copies of draft “confidential settlement” agreements to Groenwegen, as well as to Arlene Smoler, a top labor lawyer in the Attorney General’s Office. Schneiderman has released documents showing the extent of his office’s involvement. “I’d appreciate any thoughts either of you might have on this draft,” Collins said in a May 29, 2012, e-mail sent to Smoler and Groenwegen. Silver, realizing he may be in the political fight of his life, hired Stu Loeser, Mayor Bloomberg’s former press secretary, as a media consultant to address the crisis. Loeser’s wife, Jessica, is a former top aide to Silver. Representatives for Silver and Schneiderman declined to comment on the subpoenas, other than to say they are cooperating. A lawyer for one of the alleged victims applauded JCOPE’s massive probe. “We believe there should be a full investigation of the handling of this matter by Speaker Silver, the attorney general and the comptroller,” said lawyer Gloria Allred. “We think that the public has a right to know which state employees were involved in decision making in this important matter,” Allred added. The settlements involving Lopez came to the surface after Silver publicly censured Lopez on Aug. 24. Following a probe by the Assembly’s Ethics Committee, Silver blasted Lopez for allegedly groping two other women, not involved in the settlements. Silver has since demanded that Lopez, who quit his post as Brooklyn Democratic Party chairman, resign his Assembly seat. Lopez, who has said he won’t step down, declined to comment yesterday.</Msg><Username>liberals_plague_humanity</Username><Timestamp>1347449448752</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 07:30:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347449831178-5</Id><Topic><Title>Romulus and Ryanulus promise more Bush tax cuts on top of the previous bush tax cuts</Title><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1347023457307</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 09:10:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Dem. governor takes on Obama 5 Comments (17) By CHARLES MAHTESIAN | 9/11/12 3:00 PM EDT West Virginia Democratic Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin isn’t just putting some distance between his campaign and President Obama: He’s gone on the attack. In his first television ad, a 30-second spot titled “Coal Town,” Tomblin frames his efforts as a fight against the White House. “Since the day I became governor, I fought the Obama administration’s war on coal,” he says in the 30-second spot. “I took them to court and we won. I won’t let anyone push us around.” Given Obama’s low standing in West Virginia – a felon won 41 percent of the Democratic primary vote against him in May – Tomblin’s approach is a necessary one. Tomblin not only has to get distance from his party's president, he needs to inoculate himself against attacks from GOP opponent Bill Maloney, who frequently refers to the “Obama-Tomblin economy” and is running Obama-themed ads. In Maloney’s latest spot, a female character ends an ad by saying, “Let’s send a message to Obama.”</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1347449831178</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 07:37:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347450282115-6</Id><Topic><Title>Billions Wasted On Arab Spring!!

A handful of lawmakers voiced outrage Wednesday at the Obama administration’s response to the attacks on the U.S. embassies in those countries and suggested the inclusion of foreign aid could influence their votes. “It makes it easier to vote ‘no’” on the spending bill, freshman Rep. Jeff Landry (R-La.) said at a press event with conservative House Republicans at the Capitol. The House on Thursday plans to vote on a continuing resolution that would extend federal funding through March, preventing a government shutdown before the election or during a lame duck session of Congress this fall. While conservatives pushed to avoid a shutdown fight, they have also raised alarms about the inclusion of additional welfare funding in the bill. “It would show a tremendous amount of leadership from this administration, in light of the recent developments, if the president were to come back and demand that the amount of money that is in the [continuing resolution] for Libya and Egypt be stripped. That would be tremendous leadership,” Landry said. Lawmakers said they planned to bring up the issue at a meeting of the conservative Republican Study Committee on Wednesday, although they acknowledged it would be difficult to strip the foreign aid in so short an amount of time. The stopgap spending bill is expected to pass with bipartisan support, including from Republican vice presidential nominee Rep. Paul Ryan (Wis.). House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers (R-Ky.) said that defunding Libya and Egypt in the continuing resolution (CR) would not be possible. "The CR is closed for changes," he said Wednesday. He said the Foreign Affairs Committee should take up the matter and suggested that moving on aid now would be "premature." In a separate statement Wednesday, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said continued aid to Libya should be contingent on its government’s help in finding those responsible for the attack on the U.S. embassy. Rep. Scott Garrett (R-N.J.) said the administration should be asking several questions in the wake of the attacks, which killed four Americans at the consulate in Benghazi, including U.S. Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens. “Why is it that the United States is bankrolling some of these countries?” he asked. “Why do we continue to bankroll them at the level that we are? We’re waiting for that discussion from the administration.” The conservative lawmakers strongly backed Mitt Romney’s criticism of President Obama, repeating the GOP nominee’s charge that the U.S. embassy in Egypt initially apologized for an amateur anti-Islam video by a U.S. filmmaker that sparked the protests at the American compound.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1347478315081</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 15:31:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347478366874-26</Id><Topic><Title>Obama loses 4% in polls</Title><Username>central_scrutinizer_fz</Username><Timestamp>1347477499697</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 15:18:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Egypt to take legal action in US against Prophet film makers Published: 09.12.12, 19:11 / Israel News Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi asked the Egyptian embassy in Washington to take legal action in the United States against makers of a film attacking the Muslim Prophet Mohammad, the official state news agency said on Wednesday.

According to annual data from the Census Bureau, median income adjusted for inflation – a closely watched measure of the financial health of average Americans – fell to $50,054 in 2011, or 1.5 per cent below its 2010 level and 4.1 per cent below its score when Mr Obama took office in 2009. Although real median income had already started to slide beginning in 2008, before Mr Obama entered the White House, the fact that he was not able to reverse that downward trend could expose him to criticism from Mitt Romney, his rival, that his policies have not aided the middle class. In addition to the drop in overall median income, the data also showed a rise in income inequality last year. The release of the dire median figures also offers the latest reminder of the sluggishness of the recovery, marked by high unemployment and weak job creation, which is prompting Federal Reserve officials to consider a new round of monetary easing as early as Thursday. But while the data on income will have been discouraging for Mr Obama, other elements of the report were more upbeat. For instance, the poverty rate dropped slightly, from 15.1 per cent to 15 per cent, as fewer middle-class Americans struggled so much that they had slid under the poverty threshold of about $23,000 in annual income for a family of four. US households' median income Also, the Census Bureau said that the number of people without health insurance cover declined from 50m in 2010 to 48.6m in 2011, along with the percentage of people lacking coverage, which fell from 16.3 per cent in 2010 to 15.7 per cent in 2011. This will allow Mr Obama to show that his 2010 health reform is already starting to have an effect on the number of uninsured, even though many of the provisions have not kicked in yet. For instance, young Americans under the age of 26 are now allowed to be covered under their parents’ plans, reducing the number of youth without medical insurance. The fresh data on income, poverty and health insurance coverage was delivered as the race for the White House enters its final stretch. With little less than eight weeks to go before voters head to the polls in early November and the sluggish economy at the top of the agenda in many swing states, both Mr Obama and Mr Romney have attempted to demonstrate that they would be best candidate to deliver relief to middle-class Americans. Mr Obama is championing higher taxes on the wealthy in order to protect government spending on programmes that aid the middle class as the best recipe for the country. But the census data could dent a small burst of rising confidence in the economy that has showed up in polls by Gallup and Reuters/Ipsos since last week’s Democratic convention. Gene Sperling, director of the National Economic Council at the White House, said the data reinforced the need to move forward with Mr Obama’s policies, some of which have been blocked by congressional Republicans. “While we have made progress digging our way out of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, too many families are still struggling and Congress must act on the policies President Obama has put forward to strengthen the middle class and those trying to get into it,” Mr Sperling wrote in a blog post. Mr Romney, a former private equity executive, has promised to use his business expertise to create a better environment for hiring and investment that he claims would directly benefit middle-class Americans. “Today’s report confirms that the American dream remains out of reach for too many Americans,” said Andrea Saul, a Romney campaign spokeswoman. “While this may be the best President Obama can do, it’s not the best America can do”. The annual census data can often become a critical reference in US political campaigns. Mr Obama and Democrats in Congress effectively used the stagnation of median household income during the administration of George W. Bush to target Republican economic policies during the congressional election of 2006 and the presidential election of 2008. Real median household income reached its peak at $54,932 in 1999, 8.9 per cent above its current level, under President Bill Clinton and has not been below $50,000 since 1995. Under President George W. Bush, it fell to $52,778 by 2004 before recovering to reach $54,489 in 2007 and then sliding again in 2008.</Msg><Username>hikemanymiles</Username><Timestamp>1347494671402</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 20:04:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347495291677-36</Id><Topic><Title>More Body Bags For Springing Arabs To Freedom!
