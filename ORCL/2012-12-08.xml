Pizza Hut decided to make the perfume after the company's community managers posted a joke on Facebook last August about bottling the smell of fresh-made pizza. Within half an hour “a few thousand people” had responded saying they wanted a bottle. "When our ad team at GRIP brought the idea to us, we absolutely loved it," says Beverley D'Cruz, Pizza Hut Canada's marketing and product development director in a release. "What better way to celebrate our Facebook fans than by providing them with a way to enjoy the fresh smell of Pizza Hut pizza whenever they want!" Pizza Hut cranked out 110 bottles of the limited-edition scent, and only the lucky Pizza Hut Canada Facebook fans who asked for it got one. The rest of us will have to settle for dabbing a steamy slice at the wrists and temples. “Will we be seeing Pizza Hut perfume in department stores any time soon? Only time will tell,” said the release.</Msg><Username>alsmith581</Username><Timestamp>1354973183117</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-08 08:26:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354973998903-8</Id><Topic><Title>gop to middleclass:" we doubled the defense budget 2000-2008, and we want YOU to pay for it, with tax cuts for the rich and spending cuts on social security</Title><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1354829004639</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 16:23:24 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>gop, why don't you throw a tantrum and fillibuster your ajoles off to UNDOUBLE the DOUBLE you did on defense spending 2000-2008?............and remember W came in with federal spending at 1.9 trillion year... he and the GOP congress hiked it 43% in the budget they did in 2005 and W last budget request was for $3.2 trillion........... WOW huge spending increases 'paid' for with tax cuts!! how irresponsible can you get. Spending has REMAINED in the 3 trillions since W put it there......... Spending has increased less than 2% since Obama's first budget in 2010 to what was spent 2012. Bush did the FIRST ever trillion dollar deficit. and before the 2008 election thje CBO stated that there would be many such deficits due to the economic emergeny and the bush taxcuts. the bratty gop just keep on with their tax cut mantra for the rich, but they never come up with any spending cuts on what THEY LIKE...they are ajoles who represent the 2% who hate democracy and the middleclass, hence they demand $112 billion cut over ten years from the elderly on SS......instead of the same cut from defense? Or how about No cuts to SS and the 1$ trillion cost of the bush tax cuts to the 2% cut entirely from defense.a 16% cut?</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1354973998903</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-08 08:39:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354974564914-9</Id><Topic><Title>gop to middleclass:" we doubled the defense budget 2000-2008, and we want YOU to pay for it, with tax cuts for the rich and spending cuts on social security</Title><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1354829004639</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 16:23:24 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In the last four years, who just spent 5-6 trillion smackers we don't have Uh,Obama?Wasn't most of those trillions spent to pay for the creditcard bill that the corrupt Bush administration ran up on various wars,his giveaway to the pharmaceutical companies,taxcut for America's megarich,etc.?</Msg><Username>alsmith581</Username><Timestamp>1354974564914</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-08 08:49:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354983900637-10</Id><Title>obama is a Liar and a Murderer and so is everyone who supports him.</Title><Msg>This FREAK (OBAMANATION) thinks he is slick using France and other Nations as Proxy’s, including Al Quadea to do His filthy Murder.

Scott Walker was sentenced Friday to two years in prison after he was convicted of embezzling more than $51,000 from donations intended to help veterans and their families. Kevin D. Kavanaugh, 62, is the fifth person close to Walker to be convicted as a result of a long-running secret probe, and a sixth person is scheduled to face trial next month. Walker himself has not been charged with wrongdoing. (snip) Kavanaugh, whom Walker had named to the Milwaukee County Veterans Service Commission, was the treasurer of the Military Order of the Purple Heart, a veterans’ service organization. His job included distributing checks of at least $600 apiece to the widows and children of Wisconsin service members killed in action. Prosecutors said Kavanaugh skimmed money from bank deposits and also made phony withdrawals, and then altered the books to mask the transactions. .</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1355008394422</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-08 18:13:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355012992048-22</Id><Topic><Title>Walker appointee given 2 years in prison for stealing from Veterans groups</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1355008394422</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-08 18:13:14 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Gee, I'll bet thewre never was a Democrat that ever stole anything.
