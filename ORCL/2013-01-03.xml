Feinstein</Title><Msg>Senator Dianne Feinstein, I will not register my weapons should this bill be passed, as I do not believe it is the government’s right to know what I own. Nor do I think it prudent to tell you what I own so that it may be taken from me by a group of people who enjoy armed protection yet decry me having the same a crime. You ma’am have overstepped a line that is not your domain. I am a Marine Corps Veteran of 8 years, and I will not have some woman who proclaims the evil of an inanimate object, yet carries one, tell me I may not have one. I am not your subject. I am the man who keeps you free. I am not your servant. I am the person whom you serve. I am not your peasant. I am the flesh and blood of America. I am the man who fought for my country. I am the man who learned. I am an American. You will not tell me that I must register my semi-automatic AR-15 because of the actions of some evil man. I will not be disarmed to suit the fear that has been established by the media and your misinformation campaign against the American public. We, the people, deserve better than you.

In it is a staement by Mariner Eccles who was Chair of the "Fed" in 1929. He was asked directly by a House Committee "What caused the market collapse." He responded; "We (the "Fed")( closed the credit window.". Interesting too is the fact that a handful of market manipulators were given unlimited credit by the major banks to sell short. One of the foremost was Joseph Kennedy, bootlegger and criminal syndicate member. He was worth 20 million in 1929. By 1937 he had 120 million. Rosy the Red rewarded him by making him ambassador to England.</Msg><Username>lewcor</Username><Timestamp>1357232646724</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 12:04:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357234301158-15</Id><Topic><Title>Thanks Larry !!</Title><Username>harrywhojackienfny911burp</Username><Timestamp>1355965310689</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 20:01:50 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Robert Taylor lewzes by harryschmoe.Dec 11, 2012 2:54 AM.Permalink .
