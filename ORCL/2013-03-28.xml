He can't figure out that Obama is doing the same thing as Reagan. But when Reagan was Pres, the economy was moving and jobs were plentiful. Buckwheat can't bear that O-Ali-bama has beat Reagan for spending. This is the liberal excuse for everything, blame the other guy and dismiss reality. It makes them feel better if they bury the facts.</Msg><Username>passthebuckaroo</Username><Timestamp>1364523872537</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 22:24:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364524918822-44</Id><Topic><Title>Libiots just can't stand the fact that Reagan was a great president</Title><Username>dropkickpubs4321</Username><Timestamp>1364509144264</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 18:19:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Read Appendix 9 of the old HCUA Reagan is cited 5 times there. Mama Roosevelt was cited over 200 times thogh. "Conservative" is just a catch word to entrap gullible fools. Just like "liberal".
