One thing they seem to agree on is the cost of benefits for retired federal and state employees. Many state retirees benefits, but not pensions, are funded through disbursements from the feds. Thus school retirees may be asked to pay all or part of their health care premiums and shoulder more of the cost by way of higher deductibles.</Msg><Username>pjmallem</Username><Timestamp>1356279464423</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 11:17:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356284562104-2</Id><Title>I am throwing a hissy fit tantrum</Title><Msg>I am screaming and punching and kicking everything.
