Got our Backs, my azzs! Of course, they will continue to try and cover, bury and sweet-talk his endless F'ups! But at the core, Obama is nothing more or less than an Incompetent, Arrogant, Very Slick Left-wing Radical! It's a Pity that 57,000,000 of us were not enough to end his Reign of Terror... we came up short by a just million or so dumbazz "moderates"... mostly Free Condom worshipping women and Free Tuition loving 20somethings! Nonetheless... the Great White 40% er's, those White Fools who handed Obama yet another Four Years, will rue the day... November 6, 2012!

Nobody even wants to build coal power plants anymore... they cost more to build and nat gas is way cheaper. Energy fact of the week: As natural gas replaces coal for electricity generation, CO2 emissions fall to 20-year low October 4, 2012, New data from the Department of Energy show that coal’s share of U.S. electricity generation has been falling consistently from 50% as recently as 2008 to a new record low of 34.5% in the second quarter of 2012 (see top chart). At the same time, natural gas has been gradually displacing coal for electricity generation and its share has risen to a new high of 32.1% in the second quarter. So in just the last four years, coal’s share of U.S. electricity generation has gone from 50% to just over one-third this year, while natural gas’s share has gone from about one-fifth to almost one-third. &amp; ExxonMobil: Why natural gas will soon replace coal From WSJ article "Exxon Declares Gas is King": "Natural gas will replace coal as the leading fuel for generating electricity in the U.S. by 2025, when it will also become the world's No. 2 overall fuel source thanks to its abundance and a drive for cleaner-burning energy, according to the latest long-term outlook from Exxon Mobil Corp.

But the Obama EPA is going after fracking. The news today is that the EPA is reaffirming its conclusion that Encana (ECA) wells near Pavillion, Wyoming have tainted water with fracking subproducts. This is the first time that water contamination is officially linked with hydraulic fracturing. It's highly likely that such linking will lead to more EPA regulations on fracking, more complaints regarding fracking and ultimately large class-action lawsuits against the companies doing the fracking, such as Encana itself but also Chesapeake Energy Corporation (CHK) and many others. What consequences can these developments lead to, then? More regulation If the EPA decides to more tightly regulate fracking, it's highly likely that complying with such regulations will lead to more expensive drilling. For the same natural gas (UNG) prices, such would necessarily lead to lower profitability for the sector. A Class-Action nightmare Sensing blood, the lawyers might go after every deep-pocketed natural gas fracking company out there. This would then turn into higher legal costs in the most optimistic outcome, and highly damaging awards in the worst case. There are instances, such as with asbestos, where this bankrupted an entire industry. Since the fracking angle deals with poisoning water, it's not impossible for the same to happen here, even if</Msg><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1352310673154</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 12:51:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352310824921-57</Id><Title>I don't hear anyone saying Obama victory and selloff is a buying opportunity</Title><Msg>all I hear is that your exposure to banks... energy... and even technology needs to be limited What a great victory for America and as the market tanks the pension funds dwindle....and who pays for that? why the taxpayer of course Spit on a liberal today... its the only satisfaction you will have left</Msg><Username>howie_is_long</Username><Timestamp>1352310824921</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 12:53:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352311150205-58</Id><Title>Only reason I don't wish for Obama to drop dead is</Title><Msg>it leaves us with an even bigger fool What are the odds they could both croak?</Msg><Username>howie_is_long</Username><Timestamp>1352311150205</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 12:59:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352311347689-59</Id><Title>Apple is even being crushed by Obama victory</Title><Msg>Whats up wit dat lib #$%$?</Msg><Username>howie_is_long</Username><Timestamp>1352311347689</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 13:02:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352311426467-60</Id><Title>Can someone point to a positive....</Title><Msg>that a rational mind can't shred in a second?</Msg><Username>howie_is_long</Username><Timestamp>1352311426467</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 13:03:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352311758660-61</Id><Topic><Title>coal industry is dead</Title><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1352301168794</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 10:12:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>weasel alert, seabugc first lies and blames coal becoming nearly obsolete because of obama..... ........... then he lies again saying that the epa will put a stop to increased nat gas production........jeez......... in fact.... the producers themselves are CUTTING down production.... and LIARS... the epa is working WITH nat gas producers and "Top EPA officials said regulations would ensure pollution is controlled without slowing natural gas production...." and btw, the adminstration is also helping Peabody coal and others develop clean coal technology such as coal c02 capture at power plants.........meanwhile the do nothing gop does nothing but whine and lie and spout off their ignorance.</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1352311758660</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 13:09:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352312512391-62</Id><Title>Forbes:In Obama's Second Term, Shale Gas Production Not Likely to Slow Down</Title><Msg>Forbes In Obama's Second Term, Shale Gas Production Not Likely to Slow Down nov 7 Regardless of the final regulatory outcome, gas production is likely to soar, especially as gas use grows in transportation, industry, and electric generation.

To achieve full political control despite not having an absolute majority in parliament, Hitler's government brought the Ermächtigungsgesetz (Enabling Act) to a vote in the newly elected Reichstag. The act gave Hitler's cabinet full legislative powers for a period of four years and (with certain exceptions) allowed deviations from the constitution.[150] The bill required a two-thirds majority to pass. Leaving nothing to chance, the Nazis used the provisions of the Reichstag Fire Decree to keep several Social Democratic deputies from attending; the Communists had already been banned.[151]............"</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1352346542973</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 22:49:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
