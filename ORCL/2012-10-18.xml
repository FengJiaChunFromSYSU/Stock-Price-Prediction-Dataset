ANDERSON Single Page Print Larger Text Smaller Text Alerts In the wake of the Treasury Department’s newly released summary of federal spending for 2012, it’s now possible to detail just how profligate the Obama years have been. Here’s the upshot: Under Obama, for every $7 we’ve had, we’ve spent nearly $11 (or, to be more exact, $10.95). That’s like a family that makes $70,000 a year — and is already knee-deep in debt — blowing nearly $110,000 a year. Obama SOTU To illustrate this a bit differently, for every Jackson ($20) we’ve had available to spend under Obama, we’ve also borrowed a Hamilton ($10) and a Washington ($1) and spent those too. The only thing is that, under Obama, we’ve (literally) spent the equivalent of 342 billion Jacksons, 342 billion Hamiltons, and 342 billion Washingtons — borrowing all of the Hamiltons and Washingtons. Let’s take a look at the scorecard, based on official government figures. In fiscal year 2012 (which ended on September 30), the federal government acquired $2.449 trillion in tax revenue and other receipts. It spent $3.538 trillion — 44 percent more than it had available to spend. The resulting deficit was $1.089 trillion. In fiscal year 2011 (see table S-1), the federal government acquired $2.303 trillion in tax revenues and other receipts. It spent $3.603 trillion — 56 percent more than it had available to spend. The resulting deficit was $1.3 trillion. Related Stories In fiscal year 2010 (see table S-1), the federal government acquired $2.163 trillion in tax revenues and other receipts. It spent $3.456 trillion — 60 percent more than it had available to spend. The resulting deficit was $1.293 trillion. In fiscal year 2009 — which was, for the most part, President Bush’s fiscal year (his final one) — Obama’s economic “stimulus” added $183 billion (see table 1-2) to the deficit (it would add far more in future years), on top of the deficit that we were already running that year under Bush. So in all, under Obama, the federal government has acquired $6.846 trillion in tax revenues and other receipts, and it has spent $10.711 trillion — 56 percent more than it has had available to spend. Moreover, Obama has amassed this historic record of fiscal profligacy even before his centerpiece legislation has really taken effect. If it’s not repealed first, the colossally expensive Obamacare is poised to present grave new challenges to our fiscal solvency — and to our liberty — once it would become a reality on these shores in early 2014. With one fiscal year of this 7-Eleven presidency still to come (regardless of the outcome on Election Day, fiscal year 2013 will belong to Obama) — and with the specter of Obamacare looming — our national debt is now over $16 trillion. That’s more than $6 trillion higher (see table S-9) than it was during the first presidential debate of 2008, when Obama bemoaned what he called the “orgy of spending and enormous deficits” under Bush. Yet Obama — who recently showed that he apparently has no idea how big our national debt is — amazingly says of that debt, “[W]e don’t have to worry about it short-term.” In other words, if you have $7, spend $11 — let future generations of Americans worry about it.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1350561551550</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 07:59:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350563147937-3</Id><Topic><Title>Romney Told Bosses to Tell Their Employees Whom to Vote For</Title><Username>whycantphiligetawoman</Username><Timestamp>1350556936509</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 06:42:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>seeburg, you beat me to it.

Published: Wednesday, 17 Oct 2012 | 2:37 PM ET Text Size By: Jeff Cox CNBC Retirement packages sparked one of a series of confrontations during the Tuesday debate between President Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney. The exchange took place during a discussion of China policy, with the president accusing the former Massachusetts governor of hypocrisy when it came to tough talk against the nation that boasts the world's second-largest economy. Romney conceded that a blind trust that manages his money does have investments in China, but countered that he wasn't alone. "Mr. President, have you looked at your pension? Have you looked at your pension? Mr. President, have you looked at your pension?" Romney challenged. In one of the debate's lighter moments, Obama countered, "I don't look at my pension. It's not as big as yours so it doesn't take as long. I don't check it that often." The remarks sparked some audience laughter — and yet another Romney rebuke. "Let me give you some advice: Look at your pension. You also have investments in Chinese companies, you also have investments outside the United States," he said. On that score, Romney is likely correct. Many public pension funds have a diversified foreign investment portfolio that includes China. For instance, the California Public Employees Retirement System, or CalPERS, recently announced a $530 million investment in two real estate funds that target China. Most other public pension funds have directed increasing allocations to emerging markets and alternative investment classes to generate returns and bridge exploding funding gaps. As far as size? From the standpoint of a public pension, Obama is well-heeled. As president, he will receive $191,300 annually for life — win or lose in next month's election — and receives a travel allotment as well as mailing privileges. Should Obama lose, his presidential pension kicks in immediately after leaving office. Given that the president enjoys a normal life span, the pension allotment would be worth upwards of $6 million. The federal budget spends about $3 million annually for the four living ex-presidents. Obama also will get Secret Service protection. In addition, Obama may be due a nice pension for the eight years he served in the Illinois Legislature as a state senator. Illinois is infamous for its lavish pension plan for former lawmakers. A Freedom of Information Act request for Obama's pension amount submitted Wednesday to the General Assembly Retirement System of Illinois was not immediately answered, nor was a call to the Obama campaign. But what about Romney? It's extensively documented that Romney is, well, a rich guy. He earned untold millions —though famously circumspect about releasing tax returns — while leading private equity giant Bain Capital and has a substantial retirement plan. His Individual Retirement Account could be worth in the neighborhood of $87 million, as documented in an extensive report from the Washington Post. But as for a strictly public pension? Zip, zero. Romney only served one term as governor of the Bay State and did not take a salary, so he is eligible for nothing. So while Romney appears headed for a happier retirement financially, he'll be footing his own bill — unless, of course, he wins next month. In that case, his nest egg will be even that much bigger than Obama's.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1350573865815</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 11:24:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350574106049-25</Id><Topic><Title>Why did Candy crowley have a transcript of Obamas Rose Gaerden Speech?</Title><Username>balongnieponey</Username><Timestamp>1350528764860</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 22:52:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>As it struggled, A123 showered Democrats with donations, hired pricey lobbyist Troubled battery maker won private meeting and phone call with Obama, a trade mission slot and $250 million in stimulus money before it went bankrupt UPDATED 7:04 AM EDT, October 18, 2012 | BY John Solomon AND Phillip Swarts Why It Matters: Executives of an energy company that received $250 million in federal money made donations to members of Congress while the company was facing bankruptcy. Even as advanced battery maker A123 Systems struggled for financial viability, it played the Washington insider game, where political money and access go hand in hand. The Massachusetts firm dished out nearly $1 million to hire a powerhouse lobbying firm with close ties to President Barack Obama between 2007 and 2009, and two of its top executives made personal donations to several high-profile Democrats in Congress as it won federal funding for its efforts to build the next generation of lithium batteries for electric vehicles. And its president and CEO, David Vieau, an early financial backer of President Barack Obama, scored five invitations to the White House in 2009 and 2010, including a meeting he attended with the president, White House logs show. And when the company opened a new Michigan plant, Obama made a high-profile call to congratulate. The company offered a compelling storyline for an administration eager to create jobs and spur alternative energy: it would employ hundreds of new workers at two plants in the politically critical state of Michigan that was hoping to revive its lagging auto industry. The efforts paid off. The company managed to get several lawmakers in both parties to support its request for federal funding, securing almost $6 million during the end of the Bush administration and then a $250 million grant from the American Recovery and Reconstruction Act after Obama took office.</Msg><Username>hikemanymiles</Username><Timestamp>1350574106049</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 11:28:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350574710732-26</Id><Topic><Title>Why did Candy crowley have a transcript of Obamas Rose Gaerden Speech?</Title><Username>balongnieponey</Username><Timestamp>1350528764860</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 22:52:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Haven't figured out that these things are all scripted in advance yet?

They are, after all, trying to win our votes. But when Mitt Romney talks about women, when he says he believes that we can do any job a man can do, I know from experience that he's speaking from the heart. I served as Lt. Governor with Mitt Romney when he was Governor of Massachusetts. In fact, of the twenty top positions in the Romney administration, ten of them were filled by women, more than any other state in the nation. Romney's Chief of Staff was a woman - Beth Myers. As we took office, our administration actively sought to recruit the best and brightest women the Commonwealth had to offer. And Governor Romney wasn't just checking a box. He sought out our counsel, and he listened to our advice. We didn't always agree, but we were always respected. Mitt Romney didn't judge the people who were in his administration by their gender. He wanted the best, male or female. There's no greater evidence that Mitt Romney will represent all Americans than his record of treating all people fairly and impartially. His was a brand of leadership that got things done by bringing people together, not dividing them. We need that kind of leadership today. People are hurting in this country, and women especially have been suffering. The numbers are stark. Five-and-a-half million women are unemployed. Under President Obama, the number of women living in poverty has climbed to a record high of nearly twenty-six million. Despite President Obama's best efforts -- and despite his soaring rhetoric -- his policies simply haven't worked. In the two debates we have seen so far, we've heard the President give excuses for his disappointments, but we haven't heard him offer a specific plan or concrete proposals detailing how the next four years will be any different than the last four years. We can't afford four more years of the status quo. What we need is change, and that is precisely what Governor Romney is offering. He has a plan that will create twelve million new jobs, one that will get our economy moving again and lift Americans back out of poverty. He'll do it by offering strong leadership and by working across the aisle with Republicans and Democrats. I know that he can accomplish these goals because I have seen him do it before. And when he does succeed, millions of women will have good jobs with rising pay and new opportunities to fulfill their dreams. That is the kind of empowerment and equality that we need now more than ever. Watch this video and show your support for Mitt Romney -- contribute today.

The company manufactures power conversion devices for solar energy, though it does not manufacture the solar panels themselves.

Democrats used at least $5 million from corporations and took a roughly $8 million loan from Duke Energy, the country’s largest electricity provider. The Associated Press was the first to report the corporate fund-raising. It is legal for convention organizers to accept corporate cash, and Republicans did the same for their convention in Tampa. But Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz promised “the first convention in history that does not accept any funds from lobbyists, corporations or political action committees.” “This will be the first modern political convention funded by the grassroots, funded by the people,” Wasserman Schultz added last year, during a convention kickoff event. Much of the other $24 million raised by Democrats came not from grassroots donors but from corporate foundations, special interest groups and wealthy individuals, some of whom exceeded the convention’s self-imposed, $100,000 cap on individual gifts.</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1350584091728</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 14:14:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350584780672-56</Id><Topic><Title>ORCL price per share could probably blast off!

(Photo: Getty) President Barack Obama is in New Hampshire today for a campaign event. According to the White House pool report, after he arrived at the airport in Manchester this morning, President Obama stopped to shake hands with “a couple dozen supporters” on a rope line. The crowd at the airport included two toddlers holding American flags who were greeted by the president, but apparently “looked a bit disinterested.” “I do great with the 2-3 year old crowd,” President Obama joked. His remark reportedly earned laughs from the people on the rope line.

The question you should be asking is how did Romney screw that up so badly? He went all in on trying to nail Obama and it backfired on him badly. He got into the nitty gritty details rather and staying on the broad theme that security was botched, that we should have been better prepared than we were, etc. Instead he tried to nail him on specific words in the Rose Garden speech, got an arrogant "now I've got you!" gleam in his eye, and then got humiliated on national TV. If you think this is the moderator's fault, you're not being honest or you're just one of those "excuse people" who want to blame everyone else for your failures. This was simply Mitt making a mistake and pulling defeat out of the jaws of victory on this one point. He screwed up, plain and simple.

Susquehanna Polling and Research provided The Washington Examiner with a poll it conducted for state party officials that shows Romney with a 49 percent to 45 percent lead over President Obama. It's the first poll to show Romney leading among likely voters in the Keystone State. "The polling is very clear that the race is certainly up for grabs and Republicans have a tendency to never believe it," Susquehanna President James Lee told The Examiner. Romney isn't spending much time or money in Pennsylvania, which hasn't backed a Republican presidential candidate since 1988. Every other Pennsylvania poll shows Obama ahead, though by a narrowing margin. A Quinnipiac University poll taken around the same time as the Susquehanna poll shows Obama leading Romney 50 percent to 46 percent. Susquehanna's automated poll of 1,376 likely voters was taken between Oct. 11 and 13, before the second presidential debate Tuesday that many saw as a comeback for Obama since his Oct. 3 showdown with Romney. Lee said Romney has made significant gains in the all-important suburbs of Philadelphia, a ring of counties that helped push Obama to victory in 2008. "Republicans haven't been able to do that in 20 years," Lee said. "Romney has made some major inroads." Lee said Romney also gained ground in western Pennsylvania, where socially conservative, blue-collar Democrats have turned their backs on Obama.</Msg><Username>hikemanymiles</Username><Timestamp>1350609649964</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 21:20:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350609918254-89</Id><Topic><Title>Mitt: promise to keep your promises</Title><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1350597956365</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 18:05:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Coal miners in southeastern Ohio are blasting an ad from President Obama that claims they were forced to "be props in (Mitt) Romney's commercial." Romney appeared at an Aug. 15 event in Belmont County surrounded by 500 coal miners, and claimed that unnecessary regulation by the Obama administration's Environmental Protection Agency amounts to a "war on coal," and has helped put thousands of miners' jobs in jeopardy. The Obama campaign countered with an ad charging the miners were forced to attend the Romney rally, and that they lost a day's pay. That ad followed a mining company official's acknowledgement that workers were told attendance was "mandatory" -- though he claimed they weren't really "forced" to attend. "These ads state that we were forced to attend this rally, and that is blatantly false." A group of 500 miners has now penned a letter and released a video insisting that no one was forced to attend the rally and demanding that the Obama campaign disavow the ad. The workers at Century mine, in Beallsville, Ohio, which is operated by Murray Energy subsidiary American Energy Century, said they "voluntarily and enthusiastically" attended the event. "These ads state that we were forced to attend this rally, and that is blatantly false," coal worker Mitch Miracle said on the video, reading from a letter sent to the president's campaign. "Since your approval is attached to these ads, you may not wish to support these mistruths. Why would you lie about the 500 working miners who have signed this letter? We, the employees of Century mine, would request that you immediately stop these false ads." Footage from the video is now part of yet another anti-Obama ad from nonprofit PAC Checks and Balances for Economic Growth. The Obama campaign did not respond to a request for comment about the ad or the miners' claims. Coal is a key issue in the southern part of hotly contested Ohio, and Murray CEO Robert Murray has been a vocal critic of Obama's energy policies and a big contributor to Republican politicians, including Romney. Accusations that the miners were forced to attend the Romney rally started when a group of employees who feared they'd be fired if they didn't attend reportedly complained via phone calls and emails to WWVA radio host David Blomquist, who questioned Murray Energy Chief Financial Officer Rob Moore on the air. Moore acknowledged that some employees were told the event was mandatory, but insisted that they were not "forced" to attend. "There were no workers that were forced to attend the event," Moore told Blomquist. "We had managers that communicated to our workforce that the attendance at the Romney event was mandatory, but no one was forced to attend the event. "We had people that did not show up that day and there were no consequences or repercussions taken against any employee that did not attend the Romney event." Workers were not paid for the day's work, whether they attended the event or not, Moore acknowledged. He said the mine had to be shut down for "safety and security" reasons during Romney's visit, and likened the no-pay policy to times when weather or power outages shut down the mine.</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1350609918254</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 21:25:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
