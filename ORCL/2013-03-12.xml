She also is charged with illegal voting in 2008 and 2011. The 58-year-old veteran Cincinnati poll worker, indicted Monday, faces eight counts of voter fraud. Two others, one of whom is a nun, have been charged separately. Richardson had admitted on camera to a local TV station, "Yes, I voted twice," claiming she was concerned that her vote would not count. She also said there "was no intent on my part to commit any voter fraud." "I'll fight it for Mr. Obama and Mr. Obama's right to sit as president of the United States," she proclaimed in the interview.</Msg><Username>hikemanymiles</Username><Timestamp>1363066919660</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 01:41:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363080403167-3</Id><Topic><Title>Where will Oracle Corporation?

"The cost of World War II was financed primarily by a highly progressive Income Tax, as well as other taxes on corporations to prevent excess profits being derived from government contracts. Even the Vietnam War was largely financed by a surtax on incomes, paid largely by wealthier citizens rather than by the transfer of a payroll tax-generated social security Surplus to cover U.S. budget deficits.

What's more, their share of the tax burden is increasing. The top 10 percent of taxpayers paid over 70% of the total amount collected in federal income taxes in 2010, the latest year figures are available, according to the Tax Foundation. That's up from 55% in 1986. The remaining 90% bore just under 30% of the tax burden. And 47% of all Americans pay hardly anything at all -- a fact that got Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney into political hot water last year for telling the truth. "There's been a huge myth created that the rich aren't paying anything," said William McBride, the Tax Foundation's chief economist. "The rich pay a much higher rate than the poor."</Msg><Username>onedinosaur</Username><Timestamp>1363094962305</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 09:29:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363095718122-14</Id><Topic><Title>a 4.7% surcharge on the incomes of the top 1% = the $85 billion the gop wants to sequester</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1363094414621</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 09:20:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>oh brother, listen up moron, most of the income the USA goes to the rich..... so, DUH, the rich have to pay MOST of the taxes,, and they paid much more years ago....

Jay Carney, the occasionally charming spokesman for the newly charming president, began his daily media briefing Monday with a smile, a sunny disposition and a bit of percussion on the lectern. Bum-ba-da-bum-bum, he drummed with his hands. “Happy Monday!” began Carney, wearing a festive yellow tie and striking a casual pose. “Good afternoon. Thanks for being here for your White House briefing. Spring is here early.” But it was not long before the White House press secretary was back in his winter of discontent. The first questioner, the Associated Press’s Jim Kuhnhenn, asked Carney to square President Obama’s “charm offensive” with his decision to speak this week to the highly partisan Organizing for Action group. “I think you’re misrepresenting the group,” Carney informed Kuhnhenn. NPR’s Mara Liasson asked him a question about Obama’s yet-to-be-released budget. “Mara, the way you phrase that question, you know, makes me think that you’re still working on a typewriter or something,” Carney told the 57-year-old radio correspondent. He further informed ABC News’s Ann Compton that she had a mistaken understanding of the president’s meetings this week with lawmakers. And when CBS’s Bill Plante pressed him on when Obama would release a budget (it was supposed to have been done last month), Carney leaned forward to arg</Msg><Username>onedinosaur</Username><Timestamp>1363099957724</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 10:52:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363100052750-17</Id><Topic><Title>Clinton had 7 times the job creaton of bush &amp;clinton had the record job participation rate</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1363094067734</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 09:14:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Bush administration created about three million jobs (net) over its eight years, a fraction of the 23 million jobs created under President Bill Clinton‘s administration</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1363100052750</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 10:54:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363100069887-18</Id><Topic><Title>Oracle Corporation on MAD MONEY TODAY!!</Title><Username>efrain.mercer</Username><Timestamp>1362394647203</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 05:57:27 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>useful info</Msg><Username>willard.meyer</Username><Timestamp>1363100069887</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 10:54:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363100186120-19</Id><Topic><Title>U.S. corporations’ after-tax profits have grown by 171 percent under Obama</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1363094147993</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 09:15:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>billionaires are richer than ever and they want lower tax rates than ever .... to be paid for by making everyone else poorer by gutting social security, medicare and medicaid</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1363100186120</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 10:56:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363100307727-20</Id><Topic><Title>gop nonsense on debt (the US government is actually rich...$128 trillion in oil and gas alone)</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1363006700350</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 08:58:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Institute for Energy Research, an industry-funded research outfit, claims the government owns more than $128 trillion in energy resources................................ this is a rightwing, energy industry group so listen to them limbots!</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1363100307727</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 10:58:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363100555846-21</Id><Title>such lamebrains: the gop pumps the same ideas that they lost with in november</Title><Msg>they double down on their loser hand of a pair of twos....cut taxes for the billionaires, cut spending on social security.....</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1363100555846</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 11:02:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363100717279-22</Id><Topic><Title>Where will Oracle Corporation?

A commander-in-chief given to "dithering" on critical wartime decisions. A suspicious and devious White House staff erecting a "Berlin Wall" around a secluded and standoffish president, shielding him from those advisers -- particularly at the Department of State -- willing to convey unpleasant truths. It all sounds rather like the sensational literature that proliferated in the mid-to-late 1970s to chronicle the collapsed presidency of Richard Nixon -- including the description of a White House "Berlin Wall," originally applied, with great fanfare, to those much-maligned (and eventually imprisoned) Nixon aides H.R. Haldeman and John Ehrlichman. Instead, it is President Obama's turn to watch as former aides and journalists rush into print -- with a warp speed that eluded the insider memoirists of the 1970s -- their detailed and dishy accounts of the first Obama term. A forthcoming book by former foreign policy aide Vali Nasr paints the above portrait, describing a president whose decisions "from start to finish were guided by politics." Nasr was a rising academic star, one of the leading scholarly voices on Iran and the Mideast, when the late Richard Holbrooke tapped him, at the dawn of the Obama administration, to join Holbrooke at a newly created office of the State Department: SRAP, short for Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan.
