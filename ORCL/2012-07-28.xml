"Now, consider Marco Rubio. His parents were resident aliens when he was born in 1971, seeking and soon to receive their status as naturalized U.S. citizens. Under the Fourteenth Amendment, "all persons born...in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the states wherein they reside." This "subject to the jurisdiction thereof" clause shows why Rubio is -- and, very likely, why children of illegal aliens are not -- a "natural born citizen of the United States."

Obama was and NOBODY but disgraceful morons ever disputed that. if a US state says a person was born there , you can't undo that or make it go away, it was a FACT and obama never had to do a thing about it. and numbskull. did you miss the 2009 US house resolution affirming Obama was born in Hawaii..... with ZERO votes against?....... so it's your problem if you people want to cry and moan and spend money trying to prove what everyone with honesty and a brain knows: 2 + 2 = 4, but sure sue somebody and throw a tantrum trying to prove otherwise. get it? That obama was born in Hawaii is true just like that is true and the state of Hawaii and the US congress say the same.</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1343505744000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-07-28 16:02:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343506323000-65</Id><Topic><Title>Al Quadea now has "2" international airports</Title><Username>peterthegreat533</Username><Timestamp>1343412121000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 14:02:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"“Whom the Gods Mock, they First drive Insane.” " i guess they mocked you pretty good then</Msg><Username>kollesteral</Username><Timestamp>1343506323000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-07-28 16:12:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343506633000-66</Id><Topic><Title>Jesse Jackson Jr. in Mayo Clinic for depression</Title><Username>redrum_noa</Username><Timestamp>1343445982000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 23:26:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Right.... and we're now paying $3000 a day for his drug rehab!</Msg><Username>pt_bama_nation</Username><Timestamp>1343506633000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-07-28 16:17:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343508128000-67</Id><Title>Clinton vs. Obama</Title><Msg>Bill Clinton cut taxes on Businesses Obama wants to raise them Gasoline was flat at 1.82 under Clinton Obama gas prices up 91% Under Clinton Clinton Food Stamps went down 2 Billion Under Obama up 40 Billion Personal wealth went up 38% under Clinton Obama personal wealth went down 40% Game over.</Msg><Username>wallispumper</Username><Timestamp>1343508128000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-07-28 16:42:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343509192000-68</Id><Topic><Title>Florida Ethics Commission Tosses Out Case Against Rubio</Title><Username>redrum_noa</Username><Timestamp>1343445935000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 23:25:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Libbies always want to stay focused on that certificate of live birth thing.
