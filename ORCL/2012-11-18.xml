Balog’s film, which he made with director Jeff Orlowski and his colleagues in the Extreme Ice Survey, opened in theaters nationwide last week Balog spoke about how his experience “chasing” vanishing glaciers affected him personally: I’ve been profoundly reshaped in my own mind, in my own mentality and life experience, by this. I am really, really, really concerned for my daughters’ future. I have a 24-year-old daughter, and I have an 11-year-old daughter. And I’m quite concerned that the—that by the time they get to be our age, they’re going to be living in a world that’s so radically different from what we’re living in, and it might be not such a great world. I think they’re certain to be living in much more violent extremes of weather, with unknowable geopolitical consequences from that, from perhaps agriculture stress, drought stress, whatever. I’m very concerned about the stability and security and safety of the world that my kids will be in.</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1353259833473</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-18 12:30:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353261058407-7</Id><Title>Obama Forecast</Title><Msg>Medical giant Stryker cuts 1170 jobs, citing Obamacare.

Medical device makers may lose some jobs but their will be more jobs created in primarycare and other areas of healthcare.....all due to 30 million more people having health insurance..... "the mandate that everyone buy insurance could bring as many as 30 million new customers into the industry, causing significant uptick in both use and spending, said Linda J. Blumberg, senior fellow at The Urban Institute Health Policy Center. More money will flow to "pharmaceutical companies, doctors, hospitals, the people they employ, and even insurers," said Joseph White, Luxenberg Family Professor of Public Policy and chair of the Department of Political Science at Case Western Reserve University. Job growth will likely be strongest in the primary care and home care fields, said Joanne Spetz, a professor at the Institute for Health Policy Studies at the University of California, San Francisco. The demand for health-care workers like dietitians, social workers and hospital administrators will also increase. Other Winners Another clear winner is the health-care technology sector, including those that help digitize, manage and secure health-care systems and medical records repositories, said John Birkmeyer, a University of Michigan professor of surgery and director of the university's center for health-care outcomes and policy. IT services companies that can take health-care information and turn it into actionable data will benefit, Birkmeyer added. Expect to see a boom in job creation and greater competition in these sectors, said Joe Flower, an independent health-care analyst and author of "Healthcare Beyond Reform: Doing it Right for Half the Cost." Support areas for primary care will also be hot."</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1353265394580</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-18 14:03:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353266184401-11</Id><Title>Liberal facts are a farce.</Title><Msg>The top dogs in Wash are exempt from Obamacare.

Not only have these layoffs affected the well-being of displaced workers, the layoffs mean fewer high-paying jobs in many communities.

Indeed, you may be surprised to learn that once the lion’s share of the ACA kicks in on January 1, 2014, not only are Members of Congress and their staff obligated to play by the same rules as the rest of us, they will actually be required to follow a more restrictive path to their health insurance than you and I. This line of bull was peddled to an even larger audience by Sean Hannity, a man who never met a fact that he wasn’t willing to ignore while making up a new one to better suit his purpose. During Hannity’s Fox News program of March 24, 2010, Hannity stated, without reservation, that that Members of Congress and their staff were exempt from the requirements of the Affordable Care Act. So, here’s the real deal –As things currently stand, Members of Congress and their staff, until 2014, will continue to participate in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP). This program, considered among the best in the nation, allows federal employees- including Members of Congress and their staff- to choose from a wide range of health plans and select the one that best suits their needs. Note that the current plan is neither ‘government’ insurance, ‘free’ insurance nor any other sort of sweet deal that the public has been led to believe is the case. The federal employee’s program involves private insurance policies with premiums, deductibles, co-pays, etc. Here’s the surprise – come 2014, when the lion’s share of the ACA provisions come on line, Members of Congress and their staff will be required to buy their health insurance on an exchange. In fact, their choices will be even more limited than our own. While it is expected that some 24 million people will elect to purchase their health care policy on a state run exchange, we are not required by law to do so. Members of Congress and their staff, however, must buy their insurance in this way Rick Ungar Forbes</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1353269510889</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-18 15:11:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353283123494-15</Id><Title>Another Farce</Title><Msg>By 2014, huh? Guess what DA. The healthcare plan itself allows people who are insured under private insurance to be able to keep their existing coverage if they're happy with it, meaning they could continue their FEHBP that is provided by private insurance and for which we pay for. I and everyone else could do the same. If everything they told you were actually true, you might not look so stupid repeating it. Lies come from both sides, learn to discern.</Msg><Username>passthebuckaroo</Username><Timestamp>1353283123494</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-18 18:58:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353296864369-16</Id><Topic><Title>Republicans making a mountain out of a mole hill again.</Title><Username>whycantphiligetawoman</Username><Timestamp>1353275602609</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-18 16:53:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>McCain asked how the unfortunate episode in Benghazi could have been prevented.
