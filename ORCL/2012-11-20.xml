People can't grasp the concept of trillions of debt. They wouldn't grasp zillions in debt any better. Are we to believe the debt limit means something? Every time the gov is up against the debt limit they raise it to more unfathomable numbers. So what is the point of a debt limit? We are at infinity.</Msg><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1353419602098</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 08:53:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353425414539-2</Id><Topic><Title>Geithner: raise debt limit to infinity</Title><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1353419602098</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 08:53:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Geithner, ex officer at Goldman-Sachs. A front for the Rothschilds and one of the main movers behind the housing bubble and collapse. How do you like someone like this running your Treasury? But of course, we know the Kenyan would NEVER put someone like this in charge of our money as he is for the poor. He's a stooge for the banksters and make no mistake about it. They intend to collapse our finances and use it as the excuse to incorporate us into their planned global plantation.

As I think about it, Geithner may have a point. Chaney may have had a point when he said deficits don't matter. So trillions upon trillions in debt really doesn't matter. I need to get used to the concept.
