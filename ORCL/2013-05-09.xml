They offset it by making up additional savings (you know, fake doc fix, etc) to offset most of the additional $50 billion thus projecting a minor change.  Some more simple fact and references is as follows: "The Congressional Budget Office has extended its cost estimates for President Obama's health care law out to 2022, taking in more years of full implementation, and showing that the bill is substantially more expensive -- twice as much as the original $900 billion price tag. In a largely overlooked segment of the CBO's update to the budget outlook released Tuesday, the independent arm of Congress found that the bill will cost $1.76 trillion between now and 2022.

The six Democrats — one-quarter of the Big Apple’s Senate delegation — as well as a former press adviser to one of the pols, and a highly paid political consultant, are being eyed by Brooklyn federal prosecutors. All eight were secretly taped last year at the direction of prosecutors by disgraced ex-state Sen. Shirley Huntley, of Queens. Huntley, 74, wore a wire to win leniency in her own fraud case — for which she is being sentenced today in Brooklyn federal court. The senators named in a Huntley court filing unsealed yesterday are John Sampson, Eric Adams and Velmanette Montgomery of Brooklyn; Malcolm Smith and José Peralta of Queens; and Ruth Hassell-Thompson of The Bronx. Sampson, a lawyer and former state Senate minority leader, was arrested Monday on a federal indictment accusing him of looting $440,000 from escrow accounts he managed, and asking a mole in the US Attorney’s Office to get confidential information about a probe that threatened to ensnare him.</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1368101043293</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 08:04:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368101869830-4</Id><Title>Obummercare price tag</Title><Msg>Goes up by 82 billion per year for the next ten years.

Mr. Hicks said he knew then that Islamists were behind the assault. In other words, U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice's public claim at the time that an anti-Islam YouTube video spurred the assault was known inside the government to be false when she and White House spokesman Jay Carney said it. Mr. Hicks said he briefed Mrs. Clinton that night, yet the father of victim Tyrone Woods says she later told him that the YouTube video maker would be "prosecuted and arrested" as if he were responsible for Benghazi. Stranger still, Mr. Hicks says Mrs. Clinton's then chief of staff, Cheryl Mills, ordered him not to give solo interviews about the attack to a visiting Congressional delegation. Aficionados of the Clinton Presidency will recall Ms. Mills as one of Bill Clinton's impeachment lawyers."</Msg><Username>siriusf8</Username><Timestamp>1368126706903</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 15:11:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368128225997-38</Id><Title>He is just a hack.

In government, you retire with dignity and run for president with full media support. Up until yesterday, that was the Benghazi scenario following the death of four Americans including our ambassador to Libya. The Obama administration has lied, stonewalled, bullied, and intimidated – the true marks of an open and transparent administration. And, with a few notable exceptions, the American media haven’t just let them get away it. Heck, they’ve helped. Hill testimony of State Department whistleblowers might change that, but it’s doubtful given the one-sided reporting so far. The Obama administration has lied, stonewalled, bullied, and intimidated – the true marks of an open and transparent administration. NBC said there was an “obvious political undercurrent” to the hearings and accused the GOP of going after the “most popular Democrat,” Hillary Clinton. The New York Times public editor criticized her own paper’s Benghazi coverage and The Washington Post’s Twitter account inexplicably mocked those Tweeting about the case as “Chick-fil-A lovers.” AP even called it a “GOP” hearing, to make sure readers saw it as partisan. A Politico story about CBS showed the truly insidious nature of media bias on this story and how the network held back Emmy award-winning reporter Sharyl Attkisson. “CBS News executives see Attkisson wading dangerously close to advocacy on the issue, network sources have told Politico,” wrote Dylan Byers. So much so that Attkisson is “in talks to leave CBS ahead of contract.” As a result, she hadn’t even reported on the Libya attack for five months.</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1368156979920</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 23:36:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
