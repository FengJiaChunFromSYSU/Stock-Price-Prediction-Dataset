I am surprised yahoo permanently banned him. He has access to at least two computers with different IP addresses. I am sure of that. I thought messybrains &amp; delucks345 were the same poster: old ID new ID. Sort of. Although delucks345 seems less pleasant. I am (almost) sure he is a paid political poster. I could be wrong about that. At one point I was sure he was posting anti-American stuff from Iraq. Maybe he was just a relay. Maybe now that Obama is supreme emperor, issuing executive proclamations, maybe Obama doesn't need to pay political hack posters anymore. Just guessing. Both of these guys have been around longer than I have been on this msg board. (And I've been here, with different yahoo IDs for maybe 8 years.) I've been off lately. Kind of too depressed to continue after the November elections. It's like, what's the point?

Well, lets see: Oct, Nov, Dec, Jan = 4 (four!) months 348 thousand / 4 = about 87 thousand jobs per month, not 150 thousand. (They are getting that number from some other report!) Next I will hear how its all Bush's fault! Or that things would be worse if it weren't for the Stimulus Package. *** WHAT DOES IT MATTER? Companies are slashing jobs, reporting record earnings, stocks are ON FIRE!!. Some stocks are hitting 60 year highs. SUCK ON THAT! OBAMA RULES!!!
