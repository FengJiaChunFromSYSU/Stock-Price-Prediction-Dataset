O's effort to stifle grass-roots activism that government normally encourages. It's the left's way. It's their nature. They are totalitarian. A group of anti-abortion activists in Iowa had to promise the Internal Revenue Service it wouldn’t picket in front of Planned Parenthood. Catherine Engelbrecht’s family and business in Texas were audited by the government after her voting-rights group sought tax-exempt status from the IRS. Retired military veteran Mark Drabik of Nebraska became active in and donated to conservative causes, then found the IRS challenging his church donations. While the developing scandal over the targeting of conservatives by the tax agency has largely focused to date on its scrutiny of groups with words such as “tea party” or “patriot” in their names, these examples suggest the government was looking at a broader array of conservative groups and perhaps individuals. Their collective experiences at a minimum could spread skepticism about the fairness of a powerful agency that should be above reproach and at worst could point to a secret political vendetta within the government against conservatives.</Msg><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1370175583140</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-02 08:19:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370177346882-3</Id><Topic><Title>not only conservative groups.....</Title><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1370175583140</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-02 08:19:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yes, I have been targeted every single year for decades and the totalitarians make me fill out forms and give them fincnacial information and I have to send them money every year.

Oh, some workers took shortcuts........ "Between 2010 and 2012, the number of applications the IRS received each year seeking 501(c)(4) certification doubled.[18] During this period, budget cuts and personnel cuts reduced the IRS's ability to adequately perform its core duties.[19] When the Obama administration requested in 2011 that Congress increase the IRS's $12.1 billion budget by $1 billion to allow the agency to hire 5,100 additional agents, Congress instead reduced the IRS budget to $11.8 billion, and the IRS offered buyouts to 5,400 of its 95,000 employees.[19] The U.S. National Taxpayer Advocate, Nina E. Olson, told the New York Times in January 2012, "The overriding challenge facing the I.R.S. is that its workload has grown significantly in recent years, while its funding is being cut.... This is causing the I.R.S. to resort to shortcuts that undermine fundamental taxpayer rights and harm taxpayers — and at the same time reduces the I.R.S.’s ability to deliver on its core mission of raising revenue."[19]"</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1370183916064</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-02 10:38:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370184396689-13</Id><Topic><Title>why the IRS was reduced to using inappropriate shortcuts</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1370183916064</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-02 10:38:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>agree that Citizens United is a huge factor, but not for the reason you cite.
