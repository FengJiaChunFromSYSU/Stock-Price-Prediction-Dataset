Only 6 PE is 30% of sector average......Strong 2013 guidance calls for over 40 % revenue growth and $1/share net income .…..Two Cloud divisions are growing exponentially …Insiders have purchased 5% of company since 2010 and never sold a share. 4 million share float…. In 2010 NTWK went from $8 to $24 in 4 weeks with 50% lower revenue than today.</Title><Msg>Short-term Target: $16 per Upgrade……… Record 1Q 2013 earnings 2 weeks away…….radar this one In 2010 global software provider Netsol Technologies (NASDAQ: NTWK) went from $8 to $24 in a few weeks. Today NTWK is a much stronger company with far more revenue sources including 2 new high-growth high-margin Cloud Divisions. Unlike 2010, NTWK today has the flexibility to deliver products and services not only from Pakistan but also from excellence centers located in Bangkok, Beijing, the US, and the UK. During 2010 (and 2007) NTWK's market cap reached over $100 million on 50% lower revenues of what is projected for 2013. During the September 4Q 2012 CC NTWK officials stated that revenues are expected to reach $100 Million in 2015 up significantly from the $38 Million reported in 2012. They also expect margins to continue to go up as the high-margin Cloud divisions keep continuing exponentially to revenues. MUST READ ……This Week’s Analysts Comments on Upgrade: We project 13% annual growth to FY14 from FY10 reflecting 80 significant NFS legacy customers in FY14, up from 52, 37, and 28 in FY12, FY11, and FY10, respectively. The new Vroozi Cloud Division contributed $1.3 million in FY12. We expect at least $4 million in FY13 and $6 million to FY14 Our price target is based on the average forward 2013 P/E multiple of 13.2X (up from 12.8X in August 2012). NTWK is trading at 6.4X our FY13 projections. We are forecasting EPS of $0.85 per share. We applied an 11X multiple to our FY13 EPS forecast. We anticipate a richer multiple as earnings momentum builds in FY13. The company guidance calls for $1/share net income in 2013. NTWK is entering FY13 with a $25 million backlog and approximately $100 million in qualified leads. One quarter of the backlog is from four new NFS platform customer implementations that began in 4Q12. In August 2011, NetSol launched its Cloud Vroozi Division, an e-procurement search tool for SAP supplier relationship management (SRM) users. SAP AG is a global vendor of enterprise management systems that has the largest market share (24%) based on a worldwide Gartner survey. Vroozi should provide sales diversification and a higher margin recurring revenue stream. The Vroozi division contributed $1.3 million in FY12 sales and is expected to grow to $4 million in revenues in 2013 NTWK announced its 2nd Cloud Division last week offering an array of products and services to capture a greater % of the cloud applications in North America. The company is implementing this division using their significant software development capabilities and infrastructure. === MORE NTWWK HIGHLIGHTS: - Company projects Doubling/Tripling revenues and net income by 2015 - Significant Institutional investor ownership and growing - Insiders bought over 5% of the Outstanding shares the last 2 years and never sold a single share - Total share count is only 7.5 million shares.

Obama has signed taxmaggeddon into law. He's screwed us while smiling at us. You can't trust Nobama. Greece and Spain are in "depression, not recession", Nobel prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz said on Wednesday, blaming tough austerity measures for their downward economic spiral. Stiglitz also maintained that the International Monetary Fund was "a little too optimistic" in its forecast last week that the eurozone economy would shrink by 0.4 percent in 2012. Eurozone will implode after U.S. elections. Greece runs out of money in November. U.S. reaches debt limit in December. Prepare for austerity: Spending cuts and tax increases. It's all Obama 's fault.

October 22nd, 2012 - 12:01 am I won’t hear what I’d like to hear at the presidential foreign policy debate Monday. What I’d like to hear is Barack Obama resigning over Benghazi, the most extreme public mishandling of an attack on American personnel ever, certainly in my lifetime. If I (or most people) had been president and something like that happened on my (our) watch — and then I had lied about it myself while urging others to cover up — I would be so ashamed of myself I wouldn’t be able to come out in public. But that’s not what happened. In fact, the reverse occurred. The president acted as if it was Mitt Romney’s fault for ever bringing the subject up. And he had a willing co-conspirator in the morally stunted Candy Crowley. Obama’s outrage during the second debate even at being questioned on his response to the terrorist killings is one of the ugliest displays of narcissism I have ever witnessed from a politician and certainly the ugliest if you consider the ramifications of his behavior. That the mainstream media ignored this reaction is a testament to their enduring pathology. Or perhaps to a secret longing for the divine right of kings. But it doesn’t matter. If Barack Obama does not resign on Monday, his reputation will be destroyed forever, even if he wins a second term, because Benghazi will not go away. This is not just because of the seemingly insoluble conundrums described so thoroughly by Watergate author (among other things) James Rosen in his Wall Street Journal oped — “The Three Benghazi Timelines We Need Answers About” — but for a reason yet more disturbing.</Msg><Username>hikemanymiles</Username><Timestamp>1350915269516</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 10:14:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350915270687-9</Id><Topic><Title>Obama Could Blabber Nursery Rhymes Tonight...</Title><Username>inherited_myazzs</Username><Timestamp>1350907338191</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 08:02:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>By Roger L Simon Bio Get Updates From Roger L Simon Should Barack Obama Resign Tonight?

Why am I not surprised you would come up with an airhead response? Obama does not understand or he wouldn't be licking the boots of every rogue nation trying to make nice. He's afraid to offend these animals and it's inviting more harm. Did you read today that Jordan stopped a plan of attack by Al Queda against the US? But if you're happy with how he's handling places like Libya and Afghanistan, by all means applaud his 'genius'. He can't meet with the Pres of Israel because he jaunts off to Las Vegas. No, he sure as hell doesn't understand what his position is as a leader of the free world and he's gotten Americans killed for lack of "understanding". You should read fairy tales, it fits your reasoning.</Msg><Username>passthebuckaroo</Username><Timestamp>1350947146805</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 19:05:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350947324766-28</Id><Topic><Title>Donald Trump gonna bring Obama to his knees Wednesday?</Title><Username>chump.weaver</Username><Timestamp>1350923651801</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 12:34:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Let me guess: Obama birth certificate is a fake.</Msg><Username>nazyoyo</Username><Timestamp>1350947324766</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 19:08:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350950542070-29</Id><Topic><Title>Donald Trump gonna bring Obama to his knees Wednesday?</Title><Username>chump.weaver</Username><Timestamp>1350923651801</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 12:34:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Maybe it's about Vera Baker, who supposedly had an affair with Obama and all of a sudden she is no where to be found.

Cast Your Vote in Urgent National Poll Here. Home | Newsfront Tags: obama | romney | election | debate Report: Obama Has Support of Putin, Chavez, Castro Monday, 22 Oct 2012 08:15 PM By Todd Beamon Three world leaders known for their anti-American views are endorsing President Barack Obama’s re-election, Fox News reports. Venezuela President Hugo Chavez, the socialist-leaning leader who won a fourth term this month, reportedly said that Obama was a “good guy.” Meanwhile, the daughter of Cuban President Raul Castro, Mariela Castro, in June told CNN that, “As a citizen of the world, I would like (Obama) to win.” She had been speaking in Spanish. The Castro family has ruled Cuba under Communism for over 50 years. And in Russia, President Vladimir Putin has said Obama’s re-election could improve relations between the nations. Putin, the former prime minister, also reportedly said the president was a “genuine person" who "really wants to change much for the better." But Putin did tell The Wall Street Journal that he could work with Republican challenger Mitt Romney. The former Massachusetts governor had said Russia was the “No. 1 geopolitical foe” of the US. Putin called the remark "pre-election rhetoric," Fox reports.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1350962808324</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 23:26:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
