You're always accusing people of lying. As to what you call whining, Mickelson pays a combined 64% of his income in taxes. That is more than plenty yet you think he needs to pay more. Despite his apology, Phil is right as the first thing out of one's mouoth is usually one's true beliefs. I strongly suspect he will not be a California resident much longer. Texas would be gald to have him. He can play golf all year there too. Just wait 'til CA implements an exit tax. It will be real interesting to see how they apply it.</Msg><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1359035782489</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 08:56:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359037254384-2</Id><Topic><Title>someone got to Phil Mickelson</Title><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1358956554458</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 10:55:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Mickelson said his total combined tax rate is 64%. I take him at his word. Why not you? his regrets are not because he got caught in what you think is a lie. His agent probably called him on the phone and told him to shut up because Phil's wealthy, the left hates the wealthy, so he makes himself a target by speaking out. That's why his apology. Like many other wealthy Californians, Phil should just shut up and quietly leave the state.</Msg><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1359037254384</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 09:20:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359037340402-3</Id><Topic><Title>Oracle Corporation - UPDATED CHARTS!</Title><Username>oekermankatharine</Username><Timestamp>1358888996310</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 16:09:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nice work.</Msg><Username>lelieachtigstbrooke</Username><Timestamp>1359037340402</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 09:22:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359039109515-4</Id><Topic><Title>PeopleSoft Enterprise 9.1</Title><Username>margeryausthdzbx4734</Username><Timestamp>1303651132000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2011-04-24 09:18:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Amazing thoughts....</Msg><Username>monicamoras490</Username><Timestamp>1359039109515</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 09:51:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359041975187-5</Id><Title>please everyone look at this DWCH</Title><Msg>Analytics8 Worldwide BI solution Behemoth Publishes Rave Reviews on Datawatch by shadowstockblogspot . 2 minutes 26 seconds ago .

However, marginal rates are not the entire story. Per the KPMG study, the Global average marginal tax rate at $100k of earnings is 28.9% with the US at 35%, which is well over the average. At an effective tax rate, level, the U.S. Has the 55th highest effective tax rate at 100k in income of 26%, and has the 53rd highest effective tax rate at 300k in income at.30.5%. It makes infinite economic sense that the effective tax rates in the U.S. should be more reasonable versus those of the rest of the world as the U.S. has the largest, most powerful, most mobile, and best spread economy of all economies in the world. It gets to the age old question, would you rather 90% of one dollar, or 20% of a thousand dollars? The idiots among us (such as the progressive left), gets enamored with the 90% figure, while the rationale fiscal thinker understands the overall superiority of the 20% figure!</Msg><Username>siriusf8</Username><Timestamp>1359044881713</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 11:28:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359045128029-10</Id><Title>dejerks needs a new couch for his mom's basement</Title><Msg>Come on, man!

"If 10% is good enough for Jesus, It should be good enough for Uncle Sam". I've said it before, The Feds only need revenue for salary and travel, the military, foreign aid, medicare, social security and the IRS. They should be able to manage that. Every other agency or dept could be in the control of each state. Raising the amount the states can keep thru taxes would go a long way to keep them out of debt and have enough for education, healthcare, jobs, whatever is most needed. No one has the guts to propose such a sensible reform. I've written to a few reps from Calif, only response was a form e-mail thanking me for writing and a paragraph of the great things they've done. Feinstein is the most useless body in Congress. Calif is near death and she waltzes around without a care.

Shyt.... Obama won't even give us his Harvard grades and passport history, to say nothing of a real Birth Certificate! In a move certain to fuel the debate over Obama's qualifications for the presidency, the group "Americans for Freedom of Information" has Released copies of President Obama's college transcripts from Occidental College ... Released today, the transcript school indicates that Obama, under the name Barry Soetoro, received financial aid as a foreign student from Indonesia as an undergraduate. The transcript was released by Occidental College in compliance with a court order in a suit brought by the group in the Superior Court of California. The transcript shows that Obama (Soetoro) applied for financial aid and was awarded a fellowship for foreign students from the Fulbright Foundation Scholarship program. To qualify, for the scholarship, a student must claim foreign citizenship. This document would seem to provide the smoking gun that many of Obama's detractors have been seeking.</Msg><Username>ivleeg_garbage</Username><Timestamp>1359058529173</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 15:15:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359058573720-37</Id><Topic><Title>btw, who INCREASED spending more, bush or obama? debt whiners???</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1359055971474</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 14:32:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>UR an idiot!

He was a French mathematician associated with Nobel Prize winner Alexis Carel. But, again, you're probably too stupid to understand the grade school math on probabilities. You and others are just like the fools that touted "The Piltdown Man".

No other form of life has the intelligence or capabilities that humans have. We have dominion over mammals, fowl, reptiles, and all other species. Why isn't it the other way around? Did the magic of evolution single out who would be superior. Your hypothesis is quackery. Fossils, smossils. You probably believe that Peking man is related to ducks.</Msg><Username>yourmovepal</Username><Timestamp>1359084295531</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 22:24:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
