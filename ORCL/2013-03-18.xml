E. coli outbreaks. Millions of dollars in economic losses. These are among the scenarios the Obama administration warned about last month as it claimed the sequester would force the U.S. Department of Agriculture to furlough meat inspectors. But while the administration prepares to take that step, it continues to pursue a "partnership" with the Mexican government to "raise awareness" about food stamps. When a top Senate Republican proposed cutting off funds for that program last week -- in the form of an amendment to a budget resolution -- Democrats on the Budget Committee shot it down.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1363614478076</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 09:47:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363615056552-19</Id><Topic><Title>they threw a shoe at bush after he blew trillions there, and gave them universal health care as well</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1363612582866</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 09:16:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This month marks the 10th anniversary of the Iraq War. In October, 2002, I wrote a cover-story about Iraq for the first issue of American Conservative Magazine, entitled “The March to Folly.” My article predicted the impending invasion of Iraq would be a disaster for all concerned. The only victor of war with Iraq War, I wrote, would be Israel, whose nuclear monopoly and regional domination would be assured. So it has come to be. Iraq was split into Shia, Sunni and Kurdish regions. Anger against the US reached new intensity. The titanic bill for the Iraq War was $1 trillion, all of its hidden in the ballooning US national debt. Nearly 5,000 US soldiers were killed; some 50,000 wounded, many with grave brain injuries. Iraqi casualties are uncertain, though the total is likely over one million. Parts of Iraq are contaminated by US and British depleted uranium munitions. Diseases, wiped out under the late Saddam Hussein, have returned. Saddam’s sadistic secret police have been replaced by almost equally cruel security forces of the US-backed Baghdad regime.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for finally admitting on national television that all the fiscal cliffs, sequestrations and budget battles you’ve created are, indeed, artificially fabricated by ideologues and self-interested politicians and not the result of some imminent crisis that’s out of our control. America owes this debt of gratitude to Boehner after he finally came clean on yesterday’s edition of ABC’s “This Week” and admitted that “we do not have an immediate debt crisis.” (His admission was followed up by Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, who quickly echoed much the same sentiment on CBS’ Face the Nation). In offering up such a stunningly honest admission, the GOP leader has put himself on record as agreeing with President Obama, who has previously acknowledged that demonstrable reality. But the big news here isn’t just about the politics of a Republican House Speaker tacitly admitting they agree with a Democratic president. It is also about a bigger admission revealing the fact that the GOP’s fiscal alarmism is not merely some natural reaction to reality, but a calculated means to other ideological ends. Before considering those ends, first remember that Boehner (like Obama) is correct on the facts. As Nobel-winning economist Paul Krugman has pointed out, “Even if we do run deficits, federal debt as a share of GDP will be substantially less than it was at the end of World War II” and “it will also be substantially less than, say, debt in several European countries in the mid to late 1990s.” It is also lower than the 80 percent of GDP level that many economists say starts to put countries in a precarious position.

If we could somehow do that, then there would be plenty of gradual steps that could be taken right now – steps that deal with the debt in measured ways that do the least harm to the overall economy. Those include starting to phase out the Bush tax cuts, which show no correlation with job growth and yet are the single largest driver of annual deficits; starting to reduce defense and war spending, which, job-creation-wise, is one of the least effective ways for the government to spend money; starting to move the United States toward the lest costly, more efficient, and more effective single-payer health care system that most industrialized countries have, and that lowers overhead for employers; and starting to spend more money on social programs that fight economic inequality, with the understanding that driving down such inequality tends to boost macroeconomic growth and consequently boost public revenues (this is the Reagan-esque idea of growing one’s way out of debt)."</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1363619070355</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 11:04:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363619161015-24</Id><Topic><Title>Look at this report.

(AP) President Obama nominated Justice Department official Thomas Perez for Labor secretary Monday -- but the candidate could be haunted by a newly released report that found he gave incomplete testimony on the controversial decision to drop charges against members of the New Black Panther Party. Perez, an assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, would replace Hilda Solis at Labor if confirmed. Obama, touting Perez' personal story as the son of immigrants who became the first lawyer in his family, urged the Senate to act quickly on the nomination. "Tom's knowledge and experience will make him an outstanding secretary of Labor," Obama said. The new report by the Justice Department's inspector general, though, is likely to provide fodder for Republicans. The report challenged testimony Perez gave to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, when he claimed in 2010 that no political leadership was involved in the decision to dismiss three of the four defendants in a lawsuit the George W. Bush administration brought against the New Black Panther Party. The high-profile case involved allegations of voter intimidation outside a Philadelphia polling place in the 2008 election.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1363625273282</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 12:47:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363625948346-35</Id><Topic><Title>repubs,, WHEN will UN take our GUNS!</Title><Username>dropkickpubs4321</Username><Timestamp>1363478731381</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-16 20:05:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>UN, Obama, Schumer, makes no difference who wants to take my guns.

Can they possibly be any stupider? There's a war on guns, a war on the rich, a war on the middleclass, a war on business, a war on 24oz soft drinks, a war on freedom of the press, a war on state laws that undermine federal law. The war on guns flys in the face of what Fast and Furious resulted in. If guns kill people why no war on pornography? Serial sexual sadists confess that porn was a factor in their violence against women.. Pedophiles can get child porn from anywhere in the world and by way of the sex trafficking industry. Dem's go after Fox News for their political views but freedom of expression by way of deviant acts is protected and condonesd, This is why our system, and way of life is crumbling under liberalism.</Msg><Username>passthebuckaroo</Username><Timestamp>1363630087659</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 14:08:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363630174663-39</Id><Topic><Title>ORCL Insiders Selling ?</Title><Username>greenangel751</Username><Timestamp>1363350961728</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 08:36:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>thanks for share</Msg><Username>downwayliam</Username><Timestamp>1363630174663</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 14:09:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363630935956-40</Id><Topic><Title>IN DEPTH ORCL Analyst Report .</Title><Username>zelmastafford</Username><Timestamp>1361112271314</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-17 09:44:31 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nice report !</Msg><Username>gosselinwillie</Username><Timestamp>1363630935956</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 14:22:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363633671896-41</Id><Topic><Title>ORCL Report and Stock Poll</Title><Username>moyasefangelina</Username><Timestamp>1361889545234</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 09:39:05 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I got it.
