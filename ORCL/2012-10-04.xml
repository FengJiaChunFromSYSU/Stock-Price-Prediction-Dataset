Obama's wealth distribution In a completely socialist society, there would be no money. Things such as food, shelter, education and healthcare would be provided to everyone. There would be no poverty and no division of classes based on wealth. Production and distribution of goods and services would be managed by the government rather than being based on market forces, which can fluctuate and lead to recessions in capitalist economies. Critics of socialism say that such a society is impossible to create and sustain successfully. They argue that there would be no incentives for people to work harder — or even hard enough to meet their needs — because they would receive only enough to meet their needs regardless of how much they contribute. 47% of the country is dependent on aid from Obama. The number of people on food stamps has nearly doubled under Obama. In addition, many capable workers would refuse to work at all and still expect to have their needs met.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1349357154833</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 09:25:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349357288213-12</Id><Topic><Title>Larry, watch ( G A L E ) and ( C P R X ) for Bog Pharma partnership before FDA approvals</Title><Username>cprx_gale_soonboth4pershare</Username><Timestamp>1349276285264</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 10:58:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Larry's TEMF is amazing!</Msg><Username>sethmoraies68</Username><Timestamp>1349357288213</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 09:28:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349357398945-13</Id><Topic><Title>Obama certainly is resentful of the country</Title><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1349304560856</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 18:49:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'll be glad when Romney begins to restore normalcy. *** Yeah, this economy will really pick up when Romney takes over.

Facts: This is likely to happen anyway, possibly as soon as the end of the decade, Citigroup said in a book-length report earlier this year. The key factor is not changes in policy, but changes in drilling technology that have let America increase oil production faster than any other nation in the world in the past four years, Citigroup said. Declining crude oil imports, and more exports of natural gas and refined oil products, could reduce the trade deficit by as much as 40(PERCENT), adding 1(PERCENT) a year to economic growth, Moody’s Analytics estimates.

HOW'S THAT SUPPOSED TO COMPEL EMPLOYERS TO GO OUT AND HIRE MORE PEOPLE? There are COUNTLESS incentives in Obama's policies that make it difficult for employers to justify hiring more Americans. Take Obamacare: It requires a business with 50 or more employees to cover their healthcare... but if the business has 49 or fewer employees, they're exempt. Now, I talk to a LOT of business owners and executives at the Chamber of Commerce and virtually ALL of them that are struggling to make money with their businesses (and believe me, this bad, Obama economy makes it hard to run a profitable business these days) are looking at ways to pare their workforce in some way to get their headcount under 50 employees... ... even those who HAVE sufficient business to employ far more than 50 employees are struggling under the financial weight of Obamacare and are having to cut other costs to adapt to it... and that includes downsizing their workforce as WELL. I like Romney because he's a BUSINESSMAN, who has BEEN in those situations and KNOWS what it takes to make businesses successful... and a business can ONLY be successful if it hires hard working people, manages costs, and puts up profits... which, in turn, allows the business to grow and hire MORE employees.

Like Bill Gross's "75 Trillion" dialogue, it's available simply by googling the key words: CARACAS, Venezuela -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has weighed in on the U.S. presidential race, saying he prefers President Barack Obama. "If I were American, I'd vote for Obama," Chavez said in a televised interview that aired Sunday. The Venezuelan leader called Obama "a good guy" and said if the U.S. president were a Venezuelan, "I think ... he'd vote for Chavez." Chavez is running for re-election, seeking another six years in office in an Oct. 7 vote. Obama faces Republican Mitt Romney in his November re-election bid. Venezuela has had tense relations with the U.S. government for years, even though the United States remains the top buyer of oil from the country. "I wish we could begin a new period of normal relations with the government of the United States," Chavez said in the interview on the Venezuelan television channel Televen. Chavez and Obama shook hands at a 2009 summit, but relations have since cooled. The U.S. Embassy in Caracas has been without an ambassador since July 2010, with Chavez rejecting Washington's nominee for ambassador, Larry Palmer, and accusing him of making disrespectful remarks about Venezuela's government. That led Washington to revoke the visa of the Venezuelan ambassador to the U.</Msg><Username>bjspokanimal</Username><Timestamp>1349369915978</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 12:58:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349370796189-61</Id><Title>Willard Mitt Romney reminds me of a Ken doll</Title><Msg>an old and phony Ken doll, but a Ken doll nonetheless.</Msg><Username>granniefritz</Username><Timestamp>1349370796189</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 13:13:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349371187576-62</Id><Topic><Title>mittens dishonest on energy independence</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1349363692094</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 11:14:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>central, messy challanges the truth always, has the same spin as Mr.Ed and he's the biggest goon this side of the equator.

"Where did the favorite go?" it asked on its front page, with a headline below saying: "Obama fails his first televised debate against an incisive Romney." Many fellow EU Socialists have no qualms about saying they want Obama re-elected; it is no secret that many leftist European countries have bowed to pressure from Obama in recent months about the need to avoid a major blowup in the debt crisis ahead of the election, in part so as not to rattle the U.S. economy, several EU officials have told Reuters.

The president has stood for only a single such news conference this year, a March 6 event in the briefing room. Nor does Obama generally allow questioning during brief appearances at the White House, such as when he makes statements with foreign leaders. Previous presidents, including George W. Bush, routinely took a couple of questions on the topic of the day at such gatherings. This doesn’t excuse Obama, who would seem especially obligated to appear before the press given his pledges to maintain an “openness” administration. Remember that first rambling news conference when he went into campaign speech mode during a 15 minute answer to the Huffington Post?

Since Obama made that speech, he has served almost four years in the White House, and African-Americans’ median wealth has crashed, their wages have flat lined, their unemployment has spiked, and their political power has waned. The metaphorical bullet wound has turned septic. The percentage of adult African-Americans in poverty rose from 19.8 percent in 2007 to 23 percent in 2010, according to the Census Bureau. The percentage of African-American children in poverty rose from 34.5 percent to 39.1 percent in 2010. African-Americans’ formal unemployment rate jumped from 9 percent in June 2007 to 14.5 percent in August 2012. You're going the WRONG WAY BOZO!!!! IMPEACH OBAMA NOW!!! IMPEACH PELOSI NOW!!

The power shift was publicly illustrated in June 2012 when Obama announced a path to legal residency for at least 800,000 illegal immigrants. Many say that those immigrants — few of whom have college degrees — will compete for jobs against those hit hardest by the economic downturn, including African-Americans. That deferred deportation policy is poignant, partly because Obama used his 2007 speech to argue that African-Americans be hired to help rebuild New Orleans. “We don’t need Halliburton doing it — we can have the people who were displaced doing that work,” he declared. However, many of the reconstruction jobs went to illegal alien immigrants, partly because immigrants are more willing to move from their communities. After the 2005 flood, the city gained 37,000 Hispanics, even as the majority-black population shrank by 20 percent Obama is a disaster. Obama is not black.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1349402110490</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 21:55:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349402226842-109</Id><Title>Gays more important to Obama than African Americans</Title><Msg>In Obama’s White House, African-Americans also lost out to gays. In 2012, Obama also backed gay advocacy groups’ effort to change marriage form a child-focused relationship to an adult-focused relationship that would include childless same-sex couples. That shift clashed with the socially conservative view held by many African-Americans. In numerous state ballots, African-Americans have voted heavily to support the traditional definition of marriage. Is Michelle really a dude in drag? She's got manly arms and no teats.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1349402226842</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 21:57:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349403712570-110</Id><Title>Obama's America 2012 -- no hope and change for blacks</Title><Msg>Obama gave black America a black eye. It's all about Obama. He ain't done jack for the black community. He used Oprah and then dumped her. Wait a minute. So Obama's strongest demographic is significantly worse off than four years ago, and he STILL expects them to toe the line for him? Amazing. His arrogance is stratospheric. ...sad part is they'll still vote for him... if obama was white, romney would be ahead by 30 points What part of "rac*ist" does the voting public not understand? Jes*se Jackson Jr. is following Obama's lead. Jesse has stayed home and has not gone to work in Congress. He hasn't even campaigned yet he won't take his name off the ballot. He expects black people will vote for him for doing nothing. Several weeks back the Washington Examiner posted a ten part series on Barack Obama's past. Chapter 6 was dedicated to his time in Chicago and a comment was posted by a Joseph Jankovic that was devastating about Obama failing to do anything for the Afro-American community in Chicago. Everyone should read the series. Obama is White. He only SAYS he's black. The only part of Obama that's black is Michelle.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1349403712570</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 22:21:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message></Date>
