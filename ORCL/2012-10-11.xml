From the pool report: Vice President Biden arrived at about 10:50 a.m. at New Castle Airport. He climbed out of a gray SUV, greeted some military (see below) and then walked toward the press gathered near the wing. Asked about tonight's debate he said, "Looking forward to it." Asked about his strategy, whether it was rope-a-dope, he responded: "You ever see me rope-a-dope?" A bunch of Bidens are joining the VP, including: sons Hunter and Beau, daughter Ashley, sister Valerie. Debate partner Rep. Chris Van Hollen and former Sen. Ted Kaufman are on board, as is Shaleigh Murray, who played moderator Martha Raddatz in debate practice. Dr. Biden is traveling separately. Plane was rolling toward Kentucky right at 11 a.m. Air Force Two and the pool began the day at Andrews. Flight to Wilmington took off at 8:15 a.m. and landed at 8:40.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1349972361445</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 12:19:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349972371469-64</Id><Topic><Title>Hilarious!

And the answer is that a sensible hospital would get a manuscripted commercial casualty insurance policy to cover this risk. Probably both as an excess of loss of any one particular claim and as an annual aggregate. Or maybe they could get a reinsurer to do it. Reinsurers do these kind of treaties (e.g. a "treaty" is a the name for a reinsurance "policy") for insurance companies all the time.
