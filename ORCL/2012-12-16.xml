High court fight looms over right to carry a gun Dec 16, 8:16 AM (ET) By MARK SHERMAN WASHINGTON (AP) - The next big issue in the national debate over guns - whether people have a right to be armed in public - is moving closer to Supreme Court review. A provocative ruling by a panel of federal appeals court judges in Chicago struck down the only statewide ban on carrying concealed weapons, in Illinois. The ruling is somewhat at odds with those of other federal courts that have largely upheld state and local gun laws, including restrictions on concealed weapons, since the Supreme Court's landmark ruling declaring that people have a right to have a gun for self-defense. In, 2008, the court voted 5-4 in District of Columbia v. Heller to strike down Washington's ban on handgun ownership and focused mainly on the right to defend one's own home. The court left for another day how broadly the Second Amendment may protect gun rights in other settings. Legal scholars say the competing appellate rulings mean that day is drawing near for a new high court case on gun rights. The appeals court ruling in Chicago came early in a week that ended with the mass shooting in Connecticut that left 28 people dead, including 20 children at an elementary school and the presumed gunman. Laurie Levenson, a professor at the Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, said that along with thorny legal issues, "we have the overlay of these tragedies hitting us on a somewhat regular basis." The author of a book that traces the battle over gun control in the U.S. said he thinks Supreme Court intervention is likely in the short-term. "Since the Heller case, the next great question for the Supreme Court to decide was whether there is a right to carry guns in public," said UCLA law professor Adam Winkler, whose book "Gunfight" was published last year. Roughly 40 states make it easy for people to carry a gun in public. But in California, New York and a few other states, local and state regulations make it difficult if not impossible to get a license to carry a weapon. Illinois and the District of Columbia have been the only places to refuse to allow people to be armed in public. "In some of our most populated states, the right does not exist either because it's completely forbidden or practically forbidden," said Alan Gura, the lawyer who won the Heller case at the Supreme Court. Gun rights advocates and gun control supporters are as split over the issue of having guns in public as they were over whether the Constitution protected gun ownership at all - and along the same lines. Jonathan Lowy, an attorney with the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, said, "If law enforcement makes a determination that somebody would increase the danger to the public by carrying a loaded gun on the streets, then that person should not be carrying a loaded gun. Some people in the gun lobby want to tie the hands of law enforcement." But Wayne LaPierre, chief executive officer of the National Rifle Association, said, "Clearly, the individual right under the Constitution does not apply only to your home. People have lives outside their home and the constitutional right applies outside their home." Sometimes, LaPierre said, "The only thing to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun." Judge Richard Posner of the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals employed similar reasoning in his majority opinion striking down the Illinois law. Posner said that threatening confrontations do not only or even principally occur at home. "A Chicagoan is a good deal more likely to be attacked on a sidewalk in a rough neighborhood than in his apartment on the 35th floor of the Park Tower," the judge said. He homed in on the distinction between inside the home and on the street in his questioning of another recent appeals court ruling that upheld New York's restrictive law on granting people permits to carry concealed weapons. A unanimous panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the requirement that people demonstrate a special need to carry a concealed weapon does not violate the Constitution. "Our principal reservation about the Second Circuit's analysis is its suggestion that the Second Amendment should have much greater scope inside the home than outside simply because other provisions of the Constitution have been held to make that distinction," including the right to privacy that underlies the high court ruling striking down sodomy laws. "Well of course, the interest in having sex inside one's home is much greater than the interest in having sex on the sidewalk in front of one's home. But the interest in self-protection is as great outside as inside the home," Posner said. In dissent, Judge Ann Williams said governments have a strong interest in regulating guns on the street. "It is common sense, as the majority recognizes, that a gun is dangerous to more people when carried outside the home. When firearms are carried outside the home, the safety of a broader range of citizens is at issue. The risk of being injured or killed now extends to strangers, law enforcement personnel, and other private citizens who happen to be in the area," Williams said. Gura represents the challengers to the New York law and he said he will ask the high court to review the 2nd Circuit ruling. Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan has not yet said whether the state will ask the full 7th Circuit court to reconsider its ruling or appeal to the Supreme Court. So far, the Supreme Court has turned down appeals asking it to say more about guns. But that reluctance might fade if the court were presented with a split between appeals courts, typically a strong factor in attracting the justices' interest. The Second Amendment talks about "the right to keep and bear arms and it's as if some courts want to take giant eraser to the words 'and bear' and pretend that they're not there," said David Thompson, managing partner of the Cooper and Kirk law firm in Washington. Thompson represented some plaintiffs in the Illinois case. Northwestern University law professor Eugene Kontrovich said the difference between the New York and Chicago courts over what it means to bear arms could be enough to persuade the Supreme Court to intervene. Winkler, the UCLA professor, said he thinks the Illinois statute would fall if it were to put to a test at the Supreme Court, probably by the same 5-4 vote as in Heller. But it is hard to predict how the Supreme Court might rule on restrictions that fall short of an outright ban on the right to carry a loaded weapon in public for self-defense, he said. "Public possession is a different issue than having a gun in your home," he said.</Msg><Username>alsmith581</Username><Timestamp>1355670592498</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 10:09:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355670837297-8</Id><Topic><Title>Hillary Got Out of Testifying re Libya</Title><Username>passthebuckaroo</Username><Timestamp>1355599184528</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-15 14:19:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>#$%$</Msg><Username>alsmith581</Username><Timestamp>1355670837297</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 10:13:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355670926875-9</Id><Topic><Title>Hillary Got Out of Testifying re Libya</Title><Username>passthebuckaroo</Username><Timestamp>1355599184528</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-15 14:19:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Another #$%$</Msg><Username>alsmith581</Username><Timestamp>1355670926875</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 10:15:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355670995062-10</Id><Topic><Title>Hillary Got Out of Testifying re Libya</Title><Username>passthebuckaroo</Username><Timestamp>1355599184528</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-15 14:19:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yet another #$%$</Msg><Username>alsmith581</Username><Timestamp>1355670995062</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 10:16:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355671095785-11</Id><Title>Nothing</Title><Msg>will change. by alsmith581.0 seconds ago.Permalink . rightwing led USSC and NRA will see to that.

The "days" in the creation story have a different meaning than a 24 hour one. The word translated "day" actually means "an endless age." They also took the word "ertets" which simply means "a land or country" any land or country and turned into Ararat and try to say that the ark came to rest on that mountain. That mountain was never called Ararat untill a little over 100 years ago. It used to be called Mt. Massiv. Again, you need to learn how the corrupt money system in this country operates with "monetized debt". ALL your corrupt pols are tied up with it. It necessitates an ever increasing debt and inflation. It's the biggest Ponzi scheme in existence today. The crooks that run it intend to set it up worldwide. Do a little reading on the subject.

December 13, 2012 Texas Cuts to Family Planning Triple State Expenses When a federal judge ruled in August that Texas can withhold millions of dollars from Planned Parenthood and other family planning clinics, Governor Rick Perry proclaimed it a "win for Texas women." As it turns out, Perry's crusade against Planned Parenthood isn't a win for either the women of Texas or the budget of the Lone Star State. Just as experts predicted, each dollar saved in family planning spending will result in almost four dollars in new costs to care for thousands of new mothers and children the budget axe will produce. As the New York Times explained last week, "When state lawmakers passed a two-year budget in 2011 that moved $73 million from family planning services to other programs, the goal was largely political: halt the flow of taxpayer dollars to Planned Parenthood clinics." Now, Texas Republicans are coming to grips with a looming budget boomerang: The latest Health and Human Services Commission projections being circulated among Texas lawmakers indicate that during the 2014-15 biennium, poor women will deliver an estimated 23,760 more babies than they would have, as a result of their reduced access to state-subsidized birth control. The additional cost to taxpayers is expected to be as much as $273 million -- $103 million to $108 million to the state's general revenue budget alone -- and the bulk of it is the cost of caring for those infants under Medicaid. Ahead of the next legislative session, during which lawmakers will grapple with an existing Medicaid financing shortfall, a bipartisan coalition is considering ways to restore some or all of those family planning dollars, as a cost-saving initiative if nothing else. As Rick Perry might say, "Oops." Austin Democratic Representative Donna Howard was being kind to her Republican colleagues when she lamented, "I know some of my colleagues felt like in retrospect they did not fully grasp the implications of what was done last session." Republican Senator Bob Deuell, one of the leaders in cutting off funding to Planned Parenthood, acknowledged while "it's not the government's role to provide family planning...you have to look at what happens if we don't." Of course, Texas Republicans can't say they weren't warned. As part of their perpetual war against Planned Parenthood, Republican leaders in Washington last year began proposing to "zero out" federal funding for the Title X family planning program. If the likes of Denny Rehberg (R-MT) get their way, Congress would eliminate the $317 million for Title X, a program signed into law in 1970 by Richard Nixon, who proclaimed that "no American woman should be denied access to family planning assistance because of her economic condition." Writing at the Huffington Post, Laura Bassett documented the boomerang effect this Republicans' faith-based cutting would have on the nation's bottom line: The cost of covering a Medicaid-funded birth, including prenatal care, delivery, postpartum and infant care for a year, was an estimated $12,613 in 2008, according to a May 2010 Guttmacher Institute study. This far outpaces the cost of providing birth control and other contraceptive services to low-income women at Title X-funded clinics, which averages only $257 per client per year. Crunching the numbers, every dollar the U.S. government spends on family planning services to help people plan how many children to have and when to have them saves taxpayers about $3.74 in Medicaid birth-related costs. The government spends about $300 million a year on the Title X program, but in 2008 alone, it saved the country $3.4 billion dollars in return. As Ruth Marcus pointed out in February, "Every public dollar invested in family planning care saves $3.74 in Medicaid expenditures for pregnant women and their babies during the first year of care. Imagine the lifetime savings." Title X clinics serve more than 5 million women annually, the vast majority of them low-income. The Guttmacher Institute has estimated that Title X helps prevent nearly 1 million unintended pregnancies annually. The institute says these pregnancies would otherwise result in 433,000 unintended births and 406,000 abortions. "And then," Marcus noted, "there is the other 'important work'...2.2 million Pap smears, 2.3 million breast exams, nearly 6 million tests for sexually transmitted infections." Of course, the Republican crusade to take the knife to women's health care isn't about budgets but ideology. As Texas Rep. Wayne Christian described the battle in the Lone Star State, "Well of course this is a war on birth control and abortions and everything, that's what family planning is supposed to be about." Apparently, that's the same tortured logic Governor Perry used in announcing his intent to replace Planned Parenthood with "crisis pregnancy centers" that don't provide health services. As he put it in signing draconian anti-abortion legislation this week: "To be clear, my goal, and the goal of many of those joining me here today, is to make abortion, at any stage, a thing of the past." Whether or not Texas, with its 46th ranked health care system and fourth highest teen birth rate in the nation, makes abortion a thing of the past, tens of thousands of new babies and hundreds of millions of dollars in new taxpayer spending are in its future.</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1355683972759</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 13:52:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355684020770-30</Id><Title>Allegedly this kid was an atheist</Title><Msg>VAST majority of killers believe in god, db assbuck</Msg><Username>dropkickpubs4321</Username><Timestamp>1355684020770</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 13:53:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355684844200-31</Id><Topic><Title>What prompted the Conn. massacre?</Title><Username>passthebuckaroo</Username><Timestamp>1355681598674</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 13:13:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sure there is... look in the mirror, P ig!</Msg><Username>ivleeg_garbage</Username><Timestamp>1355684844200</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 14:07:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355686757658-32</Id><Topic><Title>Why Romney Lost</Title><Username>passthebuckaroo</Username><Timestamp>1355678014195</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 12:13:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I thought it is obvious: IT'S THE (W)RO(NG)M(O)NEY.

I don’t think these are, which is what puts them in the category of irrationality, flakiness, nonsense, nuttiness, absurdity, craziness. John Cassidy loves the United States. He worked here for almost 30 years as a British correspondent and five years ago became an American citizen. Now he writes for The New Yorker, where he has a blog, and for The New York Review of Books. His latest online effort is titled: “Is America Crazy? Ten Reasons It Might Be.” Writing the day after the Aurora massacre, he said: “Are firearms the only subject on which Americans are, let us say, a little batty? I’m not so sure. ... I am greatly attached to this country and admire many aspects of it enormously. But the dogged persistence of certain American shibboleths has always struck me as somewhat curious. “What are these shared convictions? I could go on all day, but here, for argument’s sake, are 10. Not all Americans subscribe to them, of course. In some instances, the true believers may amount to a small but vocal minority. Still, the popular sentiment underlying these statements is so strong that politicians defy it at their peril.”</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1355697217922</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 17:33:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355697922590-43</Id><Title>no profit in dealing with the mentally ill, big profit in selling guns</Title><Msg>No less than 80 percent of the perpetrators in these 61 cases obtained their weapons legally.
