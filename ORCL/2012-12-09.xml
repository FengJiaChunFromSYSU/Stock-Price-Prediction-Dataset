Cuban-Americans can now visit family on the island as often as they like. Americans can travel legally as part of an academic or religious trip. Perhaps it's for this reason that Obama's standing with the Cuban-American community in Florida stayed largely steady on Election Day, even though the modest openings with Cuba have riled some of South Florida's more conservative exiles. Exit polling showed that 49 percent of Cuban-Americans voted for the Democrat, roughly the same percentage as four years ago. At the same time, Florida voters sent to the House a Cuban-American Democrat from Miami who supports Obama's expansion of travel and remittances to Cuba while still favoring the 50-year-old embargo that limits American trade with the communist country. Joe Garcia defeated Republican Rep. David Rivera, who was implicated in a campaign finance scandal and had supported a traditional, isolationist stance toward Cuba. The victories by supporters of looser restrictions on Cuba travel illustrate changing attitudes of Americans who hail from the island nation: They seem to be less resistant to politicians who promote travel to Cuba and more focused on more traditional American concerns such as the economy, rather than Cuba policy. Those shifting attitudes could have implications for U.S. policy toward Cuba in the next four years, as well as how presidential candidates and politicians approach Cuban-Americans in Florida, an important swing state, in the future. There are plenty of other impediments, chiefly the continued detention of U.S. contractor Alan Gross by the Cuban government, which could delay a further easing of restrictions with Cuba. Gross was arrested in 2009 while working as part of a democracy-building program; he's now serving a 15-year prison term for bringing restricted communications equipment into Cuba. But analysts argue that the political environment is ripe for reducing restrictions on the Cuba travel policy, and they point to both the election outcome and changes on Capitol Hill among Florida's Cuban-American delegation.</Msg><Username>haroldmacinnis</Username><Timestamp>1355056619339</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-09 07:36:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355056746280-3</Id><Title>Obama gains supporters.</Title><Msg>Dec 9, 5:08 AM (ET) By CHRISTINE ARMARIO MIAMI (AP) - The door for travel to Cuba cracked open during President Barack Obama's first term.

Sheik Khalid bin Abdel Rehman al-Hussainan, who was also known as Abu Zaid al-Kuwaiti, was killed when missiles slammed into a house Thursday near Mir Ali, one of the main town's in the North Waziristan tribal area, the officials said. Al-Kuwaiti earlier this year replaced Abu Yahya al-Libi, al-Qaida's second in command, who was killed in a U.S. drone strike in North Waziristan in June, the officials said on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media. But al-Kuwaiti appeared to be much less widely known and was not part of the U.S. State Department's list of most wanted terrorists, as al-Libi had been. Covert CIA drone strikes have killed a series of senior al-Qaida and Taliban leaders in Pakistan's tribal region over the past few years. But the attacks are controversial because the secret nature of the program makes it difficult to determine how many civilians are being killed. Pakistani officials often criticize the strikes as a violation of the country's sovereignty, which has helped make them extremely unpopular in the country. But senior Pakistani officials are known to have cooperated with strikes in the past, and many people believe they still do. Al-Kuwaiti's wife and daughter were wounded in Thursday's drone attack, according to the intelligence officials. His wife died a day later at a hospital in Miran Shah, another main town in North Waziristan. Al-Kuwaiti was buried in Tappi village near Mir Ali on Friday, the officials said. A Pakistani Taliban commander who frequently visits North Waziristan said he met some Arab fighters on Saturday who were "very aggrieved." The Arabs told him they lost a "big leader" in a drone strike, but would not reveal his name or his exact position in al-Qaida. The Taliban commander spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of revealing his identity to the Pakistani government. Al-Qaida's central leadership in Pakistan has been dealt a series of sharp blows in the past few years, including the U.S. commando raid that killed Osama bin Laden in the Pakistani town of Abbottabad last year. A significant number of senior al-Qaida leaders have also been killed in U.S. drone attacks in the country. But the terrorist group has metastasized, and many analysts believe the biggest threat now comes from al-Qaida franchises in places like Yemen and Somalia. ---_ Mahsud reported from Dera Ismail Khan, Pakistan.</Msg><Username>alsmith581</Username><Timestamp>1355058412505</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-09 08:06:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355058519179-6</Id><Topic><Title>THATS A MURDERER IN THE WHITEHOUSE!!! -LOUIS FARAKAHN!</Title><Username>peterthegreat533</Username><Timestamp>1354993132849</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-08 13:58:52 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Pakistan: US drone kills senior al-Qaida leader Dec 9, 7:21 AM (ET) By RASOOL DAWAR and ISHTIAQ MAHSUD PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) - A U.S. drone strike has killed a senior al-Qaida leader in Pakistan's tribal region near the Afghan border, Pakistani intelligence officials said, in the latest blow to the global terrorist network.

Bob Corker (R-TN) came out in favor of allowing tax rates on the wealthy return to Clinton-era levels, arguing on "Fox News Sunday" that Republicans don't have a lot of cards in their hand when it comes to negotiations. Corker argued that once Republicans concede on tax rates, they will have more leverage to negotiate on the spending side of a debt deal, namely entitlement reform. "I actually am beginning to believe that is the best route for us to take," he said. "There is a growing group of folks that are looking at this and realizing that we don't have a lot of cards as it relates to the tax issue before year end," Corker said. "So, a lot of people are putting forth a theory, and I actually think it has merit, where you go ahead and give the president the 2 percent increase that he's talking about, the rate increase on the top two percent. And all of a sudden the shift goes back to entitlements… The focus then shifts to entitlements and maybe that puts us in a place where we actually can do something that really saves this nation. So there is a growing body -- I actually am beginning to believe that is the best route for us to take, to again shift the focus where it needs to be, which is on entitlements."</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1355080694362</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-09 14:18:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355084175425-16</Id><Topic><Title>more republicans come to their senses</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1355080694362</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-09 14:18:14 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Bob Corker has always made sense... an unusual trait for a US Senator!</Msg><Username>moveon_moveoutnow</Username><Timestamp>1355084175425</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-09 15:16:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355086864940-17</Id><Title>More Republicans come to their senses</Title><Msg>When will Dems do the same?
