Per Wikipedia: The Inuit /ˈɪnuːɪt/ (Inuktitut: ᐃᓄᐃᑦ, "People") (pron.[clarification needed] [ɪnwɪt], [ɪnuɪt], [i:nuit]) are a group of culturally similar indigenous peoples inhabiting the Arctic regions of Greenland, Canada, the United States, and Russia. Inuit is a plural noun; the singular is Inuk. The Inuit languages are classified in the Eskimo-Aleut family.[10] In the United States, the term Eskimo is commonly used in reference to these groups, because it includes both of Alaska's Yupik and Inupiat peoples while "Inuit" is not proper or accepted as a term for the Inupiat. No collective term exists for both peoples other than "Eskimo".[11] However, natives in Canada and Greenland view the name as pejorative and "Inuit" has become more common.[12][13] In Canada, sections 25 and 35 of the Constitution Act of 1982 named the "Inuit" as a distinctive group of aboriginal Canadians who are not included under either the First Nations or the Métis.[14]</Msg><Username>bullwinkle.themoose</Username><Timestamp>1366026059270</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 07:40:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366026071750-7</Id><Topic><Title>ORCL Insiders Selling ?</Title><Username>coxevan881</Username><Timestamp>1363886774305</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-21 13:26:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>wow!!</Msg><Username>woodadam554</Username><Timestamp>1366026071750</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 07:41:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366026420139-8</Id><Topic><Title>Florida police officer fired over targets with likeness to Trayvon Martin</Title><Username>dropkickpubs4321</Username><Timestamp>1365998917861</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 00:08:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>True.

From the Alaska Dispatch February, 2013... and BTW, the higher homicide and suicide rates are driven by Eskimos, Inuits, Yupiks and Aluets, not Rednecks... you stupid POS! Happy? "Alaska homicide rate dropping!! And yet, the Alaska homicide rate for 2011, the latest year for which figures are available, was 4 per 100,000 people. That's significantly lower than the 6.4 per 100,000 people for New York City, where Mayor Michael Bloomberg likes to brag about how many guns the New York Police Department has taken away from the citizenry, and about a fifth of the homicide rate for Chicago (19.4 per 100,000), a city with stringent gun control that has been labeled the world's "Deadliest Global City." But none of that really concerns the question that begs an answer. If guns in and of themselves are evil, if more guns means people are more likely to kill other people, why does the death toll for Alaska "firearms homicides" stand at 2.6 per 100,000? Actually, the number is probably lower than that now. The data on specifically how people kill each other -- with guns, knifes, beatings -- dates to 2004, and the Alaska homicide rate has fallen about 25 percent since then. But suffice to say, fewer than half the people killed in homicides in Alaska are killed with a gun. The state's gun-homicide rate is a low number. At 2.6, your odds of being shot and killed in Alaska are lower than your odds of being murdered in the European principality of Liechtenstein (2.8 per 100,000) and about the same as your odds for being murdered in Luxembourg (2.5 per 100,000). Neither country is known as a hotbed of violent crime. The real question is why is death by firearm so much more prevalent in major U.S. cities, most of which have made it harder for people to legally obtain guns than in the Wild West of Alaska?</Msg><Username>ivleeg_garbage</Username><Timestamp>1366027946674</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 08:12:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366029423325-10</Id><Title>BTW some of the native peoples of Alaska are called "Inuits" not "Intuits."

(AP) — Authorities say video surveillance footage from an Albany Wal-Mart store shows a uniformed U.S. Army officer being attacked by a man who had verbally harassed the soldier for his military service. Albany police released the footage after charging 47-year-old Yiqiang Wu of Schenectady with assault as a hate crime for Thursday's fight at a checkout line. The Army captain told police that a man behind him in line began to yell derogatory comments at him about the United States and his service to the nation. Police say Wu then struck the officer several times in the face. The officer was treated at the scene. The video shows the officer, dressed in camouflage fatigues, confronting the man before being attacked. Wu is free on bail. It couldn't be determined if he had a lawyer.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1366040195534</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 11:36:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366040420619-33</Id><Topic><Title>Gun control study 2013: JAMA Internal Medicine says states with most gun laws have fewer deaths</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1366033448545</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 09:44:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>are you just plain stupid? the FACT is that California has a MUCH lower per capita gun death rate than Alaska or Wyoming or Louisiana or Alabama or any of the states with weak gun laws.

Further, at least one person on this msg brd claimed Alaska's murder rate has decreased by half since the referenced statistics were taken. Which implies that Alaska's statistics are highly variable. Thus, what I get is that you are stupid.

Alaska is a unique state. Further at least one poster on this msg brd pointed out that Alaska's overall murder rate declined by almost half over that last few years. I've worked with actuaries and I would bet that Alaska's statistics are too few to be credible. So it is dumb of you to keep blabbering about Alaska. I also point out to you: IF New York City &amp; New York State's rates are so low, why are both Mayor Bloomnannie &amp; Governor Cumquatt RUSHING FORWARD with more extreme &amp; ill conceived gun control laws! For instance, the new gun law prohibits magazines over 7 bullets in size. But nobody manufactures a 7 bullet magazine. So cops are saying, larger 10 round magazines will be OK as long as you only have 7 bullets in them! Not to mention that the law outlaws COPS from having 10 round magazines! It is predicted that the law will flounder and fail due to it's own inconsistent stupidity. And many counties of New York have taken action to subvert the law and not apply the law.</Msg><Username>bullwinkle.themoose</Username><Timestamp>1366054006249</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 15:26:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366054288949-42</Id><Title>Before anyone can blame Obama I want it stated for the record.........</Title><Msg>It's all bush and reaguns fault.</Msg><Username>dropkickpubs4321</Username><Timestamp>1366054288949</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 15:31:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366054763780-43</Id><Topic><Title>Alaskans twice as likely to get killed with a gun as New Yorkers</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1365948398542</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 10:06:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>New York State has about 19.5 million people, about 195.7 X 100,000 and a population per square mile of 411.2.

This is even more true when you filter  out the BS, like suicides and accidents. I live in Chicago, and I guarantee it is more dangerous here than in Alaska. It is a simple matter of numbers, as follows: Alaska:  663000 sq miles, 731000 population Chicago Met area: 234 sq miles, 2700000 population  In short, almost 4  times as many people in 1/2800th as much space. Did I mention Chicago has had basically the most stringent gun laws, and conceal to carry laws, in the  world? Yet, people are  getting shot, and shot at, 25-50 times a night! Give me Alaska,  baby!
