You again broadcast your utter lack of facts and dispense nonsense. Maybe it's time you take off the 3 pointed hat with bells. Geo Bush was a fair minded and courageous leader. And he let Gen.

Question: Do you think we should increase the percentage of americans that don't pay federal income tax from the current 48% of americans to 55 or 60% of Americans? If your answer is: "they pay FICA taxes so #$%$!"... then, do you think it was fair that when they reduced worker's FICA taxes from 6.2% to 4.2% that they should have ALSO reduced the "employers" portion of FICA taxes from 6.2% to 4.2% as well (which they didn't)? Given that 60% of American's surveyed don't even KNOW that employers pay FICA taxes... do you think it's fair that the 6.2% of wages that the employer is contributing should amount to essentially providing 60% of those American's future social security benefits given that the employers are currently paying 60% of each employee's FICA tax? Do you think employers would employ and wealthy people would remain americans if employers had to provide 75% of an employee's FICA taxes and the top 1% was made responsible for 60% of all personal federal income taxes?... ... just how much socialism, un-employment, and lack of capital spending do you WANT in America?... and at what point does our average living standard begin to drop as it has in 100% of all the other countries that hammered free-enterprise capitalism in this way over the past 75 years?
