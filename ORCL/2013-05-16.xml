Wiretapped the House of Representative's Cloak Room 6:14 AM, May 16, 2013 • By DANIEL HALPER Send to Kindle Single Page Print Larger Text Smaller Text Alerts California congressman David Nunes made the claim yesterday that the Obama Justice Department wiretapped telephones in the House of Representative's Cloak Room, an exclusive part of the Capitol where members are able to privately interact with one another. Nunes made the claim on Hugh Hewitt's radio show. Capitol night "I don’t trust the Department of Justice on this," said Hewitt, referring to the subpoenas the Justice Department to obtain the Associated Press's phone records. "Do you, Congressman Nunes?" "No, I absolutely do not, especially after this wiretapping incident, essentially, of the House of Representative. I don’t think people are focusing on the right thing when they talk about going after the AP reporters. The big problem that I see is that they actually tapped right where I’m sitting right now, the Cloak Room," Nunes respond. Hewitt was surprised. "Wait a minute, this is news to me," he said. "The Cloak Room in the House of Representatives," Nunes repeated.</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1368702358864</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 07:05:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368702500674-14</Id><Title>Yaaaaaaaaaaaaa IRS!</Title><Msg>Only in America do y get fired for doing your JOB!

He called for the acting IRS commissioner, Steve Miller, to step down.

Circuit in ruling that President Barack Obama’s recess appointments to the National Labor Relations Board were unconstitutional, concluding that some board actions taken in the wake of those appointments were also invalid. The issue has far-reaching implications for both the NLRB and other boards, including Obama’s Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which has been a frequent target of conservatives and whose director was a recess appointment. The 2-1 decision Thursday from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit (posted here) found that the presidential recess appointment power is limited to breaks between sessions of Congress, not breaks within sessions or other adjournments during which the Senate might meet in pro forma sessions. The reasoning mirrors that in a ruling of the D.C. Circuit Court in January. (Also on POLITICO: Obama tries to stop the bleeding) The 3rd Circuit case centered on decisions the NLRB made on the authority of three members including Craig Becker, who was appointed by the president on March 27, 2010, while the Senate was adjourned for two weeks.</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1368736908944</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 16:41:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368736973220-59</Id><Topic><Title>13 Benghazis That Occurred on Bush’s Watch Without a Peep from Fox News</Title><Username>alsmith581</Username><Timestamp>1368735218412</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 16:13:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The IRS confiscated thousands of Medical Records of patients who should have been protected by the HIPPA Act, ( Health Insurance Portabllity and Accountability Act).

As a result of the department's failure to properly share information, some in the witness protection program who were on the "no-fly" list were allowed to travel on commercial flights, the federal watchdog said. "It was possible for known or suspected terrorists to fly on commercial airplanes in or over the United States and evade one of the government's primary means of identifying and tracking terrorists' movements and actions," the report said. To help protect witnesses from the people and organizations against whom they testify, the US Marshals Service provides cooperating witnesses with new names and identities. "We found that the department was not authorizing the disclosure to the Terrorist Screening Center of the new identities provided to known or suspects terrorists" in the federal Witness Security Program, known officially as WitSec. In response, the Justice Department said it has developed a highly restrictive travel policy that prohibits program participants with no-fly status from traveling on commercial flights. The department said the number of former known or suspected terrorists ever admitted into the witness protection program was a fraction of 1 percent of those in the program. The department said that to date, the FBI has not identified a national security threat tied to the participation of terrorism-linked witnesses in the program.</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1368737613759</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 16:53:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368749203191-63</Id><Topic><Title>13 Benghazis That Occurred on Bush’s Watch Without a Peep from Fox News</Title><Username>alsmith581</Username><Timestamp>1368735218412</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 16:13:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It isn't the attacks but the lack of response when there was time to prevent the killings.

Her annual salary went from $172,500 to $177,000 during the same period. Sign Up for the Politics Digest newsletter! The 2010, 2011 and 2012 bonuses were awarded during the period when IRS harrassment of the conservative groups was most intense. The newspaper obtained the data via a Freedom of Information Act request. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-KY, described the Ingram awards as "stunning, just stunning." earlier today, The Washington Examiner reported that IRS paid out more than $92 million in bonuses during the four-year period of Ingram's awards to her and 16,909 other agency employees. Those bonuses averaged more than $5,500 annually per employee.

As I noted in a story Wednesday, Justice's Director of Public Affairs is supposed to be consulted on all subpoenas to the media or for media-related phone records. In the past, that consultation has prompted the narrowing of subpoenas in some cases and their rejection in other cases, though the ultimate decision rests with more senior Justice Department officials. (Also on POLITICO: Obama attempts 'scandal reduction surgery') The Daily Beast's Daniel Klaidman reported Thursday that the head of DOJ Public Affairs at the time the request for the AP's records came through, Tracy Schmaler, recused herself from the matter because she'd been interviewed by investigators. (FBI agents also interviewed Attorney General Eric Holder, which he said this week was part of his decision to recuse himself.) "In her absence, the job fell to a less experienced deputy," Klaidman's story initially reported. Adding to the murk, a later version of Klaidman's story removed that statement and added this editor's note: "A previous version of this story stated that in Tracy Schmaler's absence, her deputy handled the A.P. subpoena issue. It is unclear who if anyone in the Office of Public Affairs reviewed the matter."</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1368752679518</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 21:04:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368752915236-70</Id><Topic><Title>Obama has most active scandals for any sitting President!</Title><Username>beelzebufo_ampinga_10048</Username><Timestamp>1368719861467</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 11:57:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Terrorists on 'no-fly' list allowed to board commercial flights in US: report From ASSOCIATED PRESS Last Updated: 7:33 PM, May 16, 2013 Posted: 1:51 PM, May 16, 2013 WASHINGTON — The government allowed "a small but significant number" of terrorists into America's witness protection program and then failed to provide the names of some of them for a watch list that's used to keep dangerous people off airline flights, the Justice Department's inspector general says. As a result of the department's failure to share information with the Terrorist Screening Center, some in the witness protection program who were on a government "no-fly" list were allowed to travel on commercial flights, the department's watchdog said. The FBI-managed screening center is the clearinghouse for information about known or suspected terrorists. In a briefing for reporters Thursday, the Justice Department said it had remedied the problem with a restrictive travel policy that prohibits program participants with no-fly status from traveling on commercial flights. The department declined to say how many people in the program actually flew.</Msg><Username>onedinosaur</Username><Timestamp>1368752915236</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 21:08:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368752985819-71</Id><Topic><Title>Obama has most active scandals for any sitting President!</Title><Username>beelzebufo_ampinga_10048</Username><Timestamp>1368719861467</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 11:57:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama confronts IRS, phone hack, Benghazi controversies WASHINGTON — President Obama confronted a trio of controversies Thursday, pledging to work with Congress to ensure the IRS doesn't abuse its power, and claiming no knowledge of any of the scandals.</Msg><Username>hikemanymiles</Username><Timestamp>1368752985819</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 21:09:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368754895222-72</Id><Title>phony gop scandals fizzling like the birther lies</Title><Msg>these new documents [wh emails] "seem to undermine GOP claims that the White House orchestrated a 'cover-up,'" and "debunk the basis many of the Republican's claims of a conspiracy."
