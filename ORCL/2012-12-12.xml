Can't you just make a point without lies? It just shows how stupid and empty your position is that you have to lie about it. and btw, that isn't what mittens and ryan said and you know it: Mittens said medicare would be unchanged for all on it, all near being on it, and everyone else who could 'choose' traditional medicare later. and there was NO mention that people on SS would SOON see some CUTS, which is what the gop NOW says... they want to cut the COLA from NOW and ON. you know THAT will save $112 billion in ten years , a real hunk of the near $1 trillion cost of the tax cut for the 2% over ten years</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1355319189851</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-12 08:33:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355320084787-2</Id><Topic><Title>You follow a Murderer so #$%$ about ethics and standards, fool!

One of the stickiest elements in that proposal has been capping deductions at $17,000 (far below what those in the top 2% typically deduct... their deductions are often 6-figures). Another is only allowing deductions at a 25% rate for those above the 35% tax bracket. The GOP offered Obama the $800 billion in taxes on the wealthy that he asked for in the election. Obama has countered with this set of "demands": 1. $1.4 trillion in new taxes on the wealthy 2. $400 billion in NEW domestic spending 3. Unlimited power to raise the debt ceiling 4. No proposals to reduce spending or reign in entitlements These are the facts as they stand today. The house GOP and Obama should be judged on them accordingly.
