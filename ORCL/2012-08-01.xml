As for any private employer they could choose to offer individual coverage, family coverage or no coverage. Yes I am in favor of anyone having the option to take the cash instead of employer based insurance. Current laws discourages options. Take the full value of your pay and shop freely for the best price and service instead of having health insurance dicated to you by your employer or the government.</Msg><Username>goodnicknamesaregone</Username><Timestamp>1343833481000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-01 11:04:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343833966000-36</Id><Topic><Title>he's just trying to be a ballbuster with his no govt marriages</Title><Username>dropkickuuuuuuu</Username><Timestamp>1343833350000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-01 11:02:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You are correct I don't believe it will happen.

It is possible that a jury will now decide those questions. He wrote that Oracle is obliged to continue to offer its product suite on Itanium-based server platforms until "such time as HP discontinues the sales of its Itanium-based servers." Oracle is also required to port its products to HP Itanium servers without charge to HP, according to the ruling. HP, which is seeks up to $4 billion in damages, said the ruling is "a tremendous win" and expects Oracle to comply with its "contractual obligation as ordered by the court." HP had argued before the judge that Oracle and HP had agreed that support for Itanium would continue, without which the HP equipment using the chip would become obsolete. HP also told the judge in June that the commitment was affirmed when it settled an earlier lawsuit over Oracle's hiring of Hurd.
