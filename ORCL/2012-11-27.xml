Unofficially, state officials are trying to have Sandy declared a "tropical storm" so the the higher hurricane deductibles on home &amp; business insurance will not be activated. Fact is, Hurricane Sandy was wavering between Tropical Storm and Category 1 hurricane. It made landfall with minimum hurricane winds. There is also much blab on PBS about Hurricane Sandy and "global warming" and "climate change." The truth is Hurricane Sandy came ashore at a bad angle, with NYC on the windward side. This is pretty much the luck of the draw. I use to have a software called HurrTrak which would plot the storms within one degree (latitude-longitude) of a selected coordinate. I would bet there were at least a dozen hurricanes in the last 125 years that had TS or CAT-1 winds over the same landfall spot as Sandy. Next, there is a well known geography problem for NYC. Hurricanes pull water along the south shore of Long Island and push it into New York Harbor. This magnifies any storm surge. This geography is not caused by global warming. Further, we had the bad luck of having the hurricane make landfall during a full moon high tide. This magnified the storm surge even more. Full moon high tides are not caused by "global warming." Hurricane Gloria of 1985 came ashore on Long Island with low Category 3 winds, thus much worse Hurricanes than Sandy are clearly plausible. (The 1938 Great New England Hurricane may have had higher Category 3 winds.) I have publications from the National Weather Service which have done regular studies on this. As early as the 1950's they predicted that Category 3 hurricanes should be expected in New Jersey, New York &amp; Long Island. Clearly, much worse hurricanes are plausible for NY, NJ, Long Island and New England, regardless of "global warming"!</Msg><Username>bullwinkle.themoose</Username><Timestamp>1354026664580</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 09:31:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354027944233-16</Id><Topic><Title>Hurricane Sandy was NOT Caused by Global Warming!</Title><Username>bullwinkle.themoose</Username><Timestamp>1354026664580</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 09:31:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You don't know.

Their most recent plan to profit on it fell through when people began to see through the "Big Lie". But don't worry they'll be back.

Yes, Virginia, climate does change all the time and as far back as they can trace it. It has been hotter, colder, dryer and wetter in the past than at present. There has been NO measurable increase in world temperatures since 1998. 14 years. The mid-west during the 30's was much hotter and dryer than any time since. One person that told me about this was a PHD at Scripps Inst. of Oceanography in the 80's. He showed me mud cores taken from the ocean floor that showed climate variations going back 250,000 years. I've also read about what is called the "Eddy Maunder" which directly relates climate change to the Sun's activity going back 4,500 years. You believe the paid liars that are on the NWO banksters payroll and hope to reduce us all to their slaves.

Virtually a waste of time. The comments by Jean-Pascal van Ypersele, the vice chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change were void of fact. According to CBS Report: ***Ypersele's remarks come as global warming has re-emerged as an issue in Washington following the devastating superstorm — a rarity for the U.S. Northeast — and an election that led to Democratic gains.*** Sandy was not a "devastating superstorm." As we discussed earlier, it was barely a CAT-1 hurricane at landfall, and many areas only incurred tropical storm force winds. TS/CAT-1 storms are not a "rarity" in the Northeast but rather an infrequent regularly recurring phenomena. According to CBS report: "After years of disagreement, climate scientists and hurricane experts have concluded that as the climate warms, there will be fewer total hurricanes. But those storms that do develop will be stronger and wetter." This year was somewhat above average for total number of storms, 19. It is tied with four other years for third place since the 1880's. This means the first sentence of this claim is false: we had more storms than normal, not fewer. Further Hurricane Sandy was not a "stronger" storm: it was barely a hurricane. I know of no standard that rates hurricanes for "wetness." So the second sentence of this claim is incorrect and silly. The preliminary ACE Index (measuring the cumulative storm intensity for the whole season) puts 2012 somewhat above average, about 20th in 62 measured years. The bottom of the top third. So, in every way, Mr.Ypersele's remarks are uninformed and stupid. According to CBS report: *** It is not correct to say Sandy was caused by global warming, but "the damage caused by Sandy was worse because of sea level rise," said Princeton University climate scientist Michael Oppenheimer. He said the sea level in New York City is a foot higher than a century ago because of man-made climate change.*** I've read the scientific studies on sea level rise and most suggest the sea hasn't risen very much. Maybe a few centimeters. In fact, in some areas, land subsidence is more significant than sea level rise. Over most of the Atlantic &amp; Gulf Coasts, the claim of "sea level rise" is scientific wishful thinking. So all of the "facts" in the CBS report are wrong, questionable, uninformed or stupid. .</Msg><Username>bullwinkle.themoose</Username><Timestamp>1354074753334</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 22:52:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354075191189-55</Id><Topic><Title>Pravda calls Obama an old style communist whose economic plans will not work!</Title><Username>googleguy000000001</Username><Timestamp>1353948899003</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-26 11:54:59 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I`ve been saying this for years.
