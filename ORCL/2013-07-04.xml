Big Trouble for Zimmer . The right wing hero never touched Treyvon. It means he shot him cold blooded. "After explaining how DNA tests were done, Gorgone said none of Zimmerman’s DNA was found under Martin’s fingernails or on the hooded sweatshirt Martin wore. The prosecution maintains that the lack of DNA undermines Zimmerman’s claim of self-defense." The video of Zimmer entering police facilities showed a clean face. His "injuries" were produced after police released him.</Msg><Username>hydroponicoctopus</Username><Timestamp>1372946504594</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-04 10:01:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372947176410-7</Id><Topic><Title>Zimmer dna evidence big trouble</Title><Username>hydroponicoctopus</Username><Timestamp>1372946504594</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-04 10:01:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>WHO CARES!!!
