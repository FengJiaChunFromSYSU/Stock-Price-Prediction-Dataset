The fact that a company "pleads guilty" to a minor offense, to get the fascists to go away, for a time, does not mean they are really "guilty." It means they took a deal to get the fascists to go away. Lawyers will alwyas suggest that a company pleads guilty and pays a fine because you can not win with the regulators. They will keep coming back and coming back and coming back until they drive you out of business. Other guitar makers use the same wood type from the same sources.

The family physician stopped accepting all forms of health insurance. In early 2013, Ciampi sent a letter to his patients informing them that he would no longer accept any kind of health coverage, both private and government-sponsored. Given that he was now asking patients to pay for his services out of pocket, he posted his prices on the practice’s website. The change took effect April 1. ............................................................................................. Good for him. Now he's been freed up to practice medicine the way he thinks he right. I bet many more will follow suit. My guesss is that the good doctor will do better than he was doing when he accepted insurance.</Msg><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1369844573990</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 12:22:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369844602529-18</Id><Topic><Title>why do pubs demand to hide corporate political donations?</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1369831079136</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 08:37:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>, GIBSON was GUILTY, period. that was another phony gop crock of shizer that the gop shut up about, because, Gibson WAS illegally importing certain items. and don't you think, STUPID, that pleading innocent and winning would have also made the "fascist" Fish and Wildlife Service (all the same people as were with the Bush admin, btw) go away and even look bad and cost less and they could have then kept the seized illegal imports....... ha ha ha....but they WERE GUILTY and THEY ended up looking BAD......lol.</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1369844602529</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 12:23:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369846166286-19</Id><Topic><Title>this doc has ditched all health insurance</Title><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1369844573990</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 12:22:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>it just means his patients have to do the paper work and file their insurance themselves.

It passed by a vote of 25-14. The plan also cuts the state income tax. Now it goes to the House, but its fate there is not very promising. Governor Sam Brownback would like the sales tax to stay at the current rate to make up for income tax cuts last year and the House is inclined to do what the governor wants. The situation has some urgency as the Kansas legislature is working overtime in Topeka to get business completed before their summer break. Aw, poor babies. Enter State Rep. Jeff Melcher, the leader of the opponents of the Senate’s plan. His arguments against the tax rollback are not based on economics, however. He’s worried that lower prices on food will move the poor to buy more… food. Let that one roll around your brain for a minute, I’ll wait. Your head still in one piece? Okay, here’s Melcher’s insane troll logic: “It seems to me we are encouraging the behavior of purchasing food and discouraging the behavior of purchasing anything else.”</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1369868449201</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 19:00:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369868667700-42</Id><Title>righties won't buy the SAME light bulb if it is labled as friendly to the environment</Title><Msg>how nutty is that? a study shows that they are less likely to buy the SAME bulb if it is labled as environmentally friendly</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1369868667700</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 19:04:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369874121289-43</Id><Topic><Title>Kansas Republican Actually Opposes the Poor Buying More Food</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1369868449201</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 19:00:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Jay Carney's reasoning that the IRS scandal was inappropriate caused George Will to explain to him the difference between an inappropriate activity and criminal activity.

I have been using them for years and have not had a single one burn out and if I did there are lots of places to take it.
