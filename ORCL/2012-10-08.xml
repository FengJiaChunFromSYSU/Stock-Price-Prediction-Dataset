Does he even want a second term? Was Obama rattled by developing donor scandal story? SNL mocks post debate Chris Matthews and MSNBC Photo - At a celebrity fundraiser last night in Los Angeles, President Obama acknowledged his mistakes on the campaign trail and asked donors for their continued support. The event began with a concert at the Nokia Theater for about 6,000 donors, headlined by Jon Bon Jovi, Earth Wind and Fire, Stevie Wonder, Katy Perry and Jennifer Hudson. “Everybody here are just incredible professionals. They’re such great friends, and they just perform flawlessly night after night,” Obama said, thanking the musicians for their performance. “I can’t always say the same,” he added to laughter and applause from the crowd. Obama reminded the crowd that his 2008 election also had “bumps in the road.” “Back in 2008 — everybody always remembers the victory, but they don’t always remember the bumps in the road,” he said. “Things always look good in retrospect. But in the middle of it, we were — we made all kinds of mistakes. We goofed up. I goofed up. But the American people carried us forward.” Actor George Clooney also attended the event, delivering a speech on behalf of the President and a video was aired featuring Eva Longoria, Jennifer Lopez, Julianne Moore, Ashley Judd and Beyonce. Later in the evening, Obama attended a fundraising dinner with Clooney at WP24 by Wolfgang Puck for 150 guests at a cost of $25,000 per person. “I am a fairly competitive guy,” Obama said during the event. “Clooney has played basketball with me. And I don’t like to lose — especially not to actors.” “We were on the same team,” Clooney reminded Obama. “We were on the same team,” Obama replied. “I put him on the team — and we did win.”</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1349701754821</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 09:09:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349701758593-8</Id><Title>Obama created Taxmageddon</Title><Msg>Obama signed Taxmageddon into law.

The average American household will get slapped with a $3,500 tax hike next year, according to a new analysis from the Tax Policy Center. Nearly 7 out of every 8 households will pay higher taxes. If Obama is elected he we allow the current tax breaks to expire which would theoretically raise $536 billion for the federal government next year, the analysis said. However, most economists believe a fiscal shock of that magnitude would immediately throw the economy into recession, which would sharply reduce actual collections.

This morning, a new Battleground Poll has Mitt Romney massacring Obama among indies by a whopping 16 points, 51-35. That's a 24-point swing among independents since 2008, a group that makes up anywhere from a quarter to a third of voters, and yet Battleground still has Obama in the lead 49-48…? But if I'm skeptical of those bottom-line numbers, our journalist overlords who have chosen to palace guard instead of question will declare me a "truther." The Battleground Poll also shows an 13 point enthusiasm gap in Romney's favor. Only 73% of Obama's supporters are "extremely likely" to vote, compared to 86% of Romney's supporters. But again, don't question Battleground's 49-48% outcome. In fact, don't question anything anymore -- or the media will question you and mock you as a "truther. " This includes questioning our government about the release of counter-intuitive unemployment statistics very helpful to the president just 30 days out from the election. Though the media hasn't yet decided it's time for a Romney Comeback Narrative, and probably never will, even if he wins -- there's no question Romney is rebounding in every national and swing state poll. Nationally, Gallup has it all tied up among registered voters -- with the president dangerously below 50 at 47%. Rasmussen uses the more reliable likely voter screen and has Romney up 49-47%. In the Real Clear Politics poll of polls, nationally Romney is only down .09%. A week ago he was down over 4 points. In Ohio, according to RCP's poll of polls, Obama's Ohio lead has shrunk to three -- Virginia has Obama only up by 0.3. Florida and Colorado are tied. The good news for Romney is that we are now seeing polls from each of these states with the GOP nominee in the lead. The bad news for Obama is that in most of these swing state polls, he is not hitting 50. Well, actually the worst news for Obama is 85% of the calls made for this new Battleground Poll were made prior to Obama humiliating himself in last week's debate.</Msg><Username>onedinosaur</Username><Timestamp>1349705353358</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 10:09:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349705375012-11</Id><Title>People trust Jack Welch</Title><Msg>You can't trust Nobama.

Trump said he agreed with Welch’s statement about the numbers. “I do, I do,” Trump said. “And I think that they did…a lot of monkey business. I’m telling you, in a month and a half from now, they will do a readjustment like has been happening for the last year and a half. They will do a readjustment and the number will be 8.2 or more.” When pressed on whether he really thought President Barack Obama’s administration cooked the numbers, Trump doubled down. “Everyone knows he didn’t want to lay off certain workers in certain categories, and that’s been well-documented and well-reported that he didn’t want to lay off certain workers in certain categories until after the election,” Trump said. “I mean, that’s monkeying with the numbers.”</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1349707054669</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 10:37:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349707796718-13</Id><Topic><Title>Obama, And "Trickle Down" Economics</Title><Username>bjspokanimal</Username><Timestamp>1349210863126</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 16:47:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>REPORT: Ambassador Stevens Wanted Security Team to Stay in Libya Past August...

Reske Calling Mitt Romney’s performance historic, Gallup noted Monday that in the three days of polling since Thursday's presidential debate the GOP challenger has erased a five-point deficit and is in a 47-47 tie with President Barack Obama. Gallup, as other polls have shown, found that Americans, by a historic margin, overwhelmingly believe Romney won the first debate by a margin of 72 to 20. Even Democrats, by a margin of 49 to 39 percent, believe Obama was bested. “Across all of the various debate-reaction polls Gallup has conducted, Romney's 52-point win is the largest Gallup has measured,” Gallup’s Jeffrey Jones noted. “The prior largest margin was 42 points for Bill Clinton over George H.W. Bush in the 1992 town hall debate.” However, the Gallup presidential tracking poll generally reports on a seven-day average, not three, and in that metric Obama is still ahead 49 to 46. “Even on this basis, the race has become somewhat more competitive compared with before the first debate,” Jones wrote. “Obama held four- to six-point leads in Gallup's seven-day tracking results in the eight days prior to the Oct. 3 debate.” Nonetheless, Gallup called the movement “significant” given both the closeness of the race and “the fact that debates rarely transform presidential election races.” Gallup also pointed out that the “generally positive unemployment report released on Friday may serve to blunt some of Romney's post-debate momentum.” With that in mind, the Rasmussen Reports daily Presidential Tracking Poll for Monday, which is on a three-day cycle, had the two candidates tied at 48 percent. In three polling reports prior to the debate, Rasmussen showed Obama up by two. In two reports after the debate, Romney had jumped ahead by two. “While there have been modest swings in recent months that have favored one candidate over the other, the overall picture is of a race that is both stable and very close,” Rasmussen wrote. “Over the past 100 days of tracking, Romney and Obama have been within two points of each other 72 times. Additionally, on 89 of those 100 days, the candidates have been within three points of each other. That is exceedingly close in a poll with a three percentage-point margin of error.”</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1349717248253</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 13:27:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349717391990-23</Id><Topic><Title>Any idea which way ORCL will trade next week?</Title><Username>jermain.mcbride</Username><Timestamp>1349607567367</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-07 06:59:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I agree with his calls and also agree that he does provide a good service.

Respondents rated the economy and the candidates’ character as their most important considerations and all but ignored the war in Afghanistan as an issue of concern. The Military Times Poll is a secure email survey of active-duty, National Guard and reserve members who are subscribers to the Military Times newspapers (see How We Did It, below). This population is older and more senior than the military population at large, but it is representative of the professional core of the all-volunteer force. The 3,100 respondents — roughly two-thirds active-duty and one-third reserve component members — are about 80 percent white and 91 percent male. Forty percent are in paygrades E-5 through E-8, while more than 35 percent are in paygrades O-3 through O-5. Almost 80 percent of respondents have a college degree — including 27 percent with a graduate degree and more than 11 percent with a post-graduate degree — while an additional 18.5 percent have some college under their belts. And they are battle-hardened; almost 29 percent have spent more than two cumulative years deployed since 9/11, while a similar percentage has spent one to two cumulative years deployed. The Military Times poll shows that Republicans continue to enjoy overwhelming support among the military’s professional ranks. “There is really an affinity for Republican candidates, even though [troops] say that what counts is character and handling the economy,” said Richard Kohn, who teaches military history at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Poll results indicate that about 66 percent of those surveyed support Romney, compared with about 26 percent who say they will vote to re-elect President Obama. When asked about the most important issue guiding their vote this year, about 66 percent of respondents cited either “the economy” or “the character of the candidate.” Less than 16 percent of troops surveyed cited “national security.” And the war in Afghanistan is barely a blip on the radar: Just more than 1 percent put that conflict at the top of their list of concerns. That’s in stark contrast to troops’ feelings about the war in Iraq in the Military Times 2008 election poll, when 16 percent cited that conflict as their top concern.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1349738308007</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 19:18:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349738558897-47</Id><Topic><Title>Chavez &amp; Obama Hatched From The Same Mold!</Title><Username>inherited_myazzs</Username><Timestamp>1349728749421</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 16:39:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>...
