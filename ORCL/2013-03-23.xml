Now it looks like 56 percent will. “Our estimates were far too low,” said Bilmes, who reviewed hundreds of thousands of disability claims and whose updated research will be made public on Friday. “This reflects a great deal of suffering.” The numbers are likely to climb further, she said, noting that the peak year for supporting veterans of World War I was 1969—more than 50 years after the conflict, when surviving veterans required geriatric care. Then there are the so-called societal costs to take into account, including the price of oil, which she believes went up from $25 a barrel in 2002—where it had been for decades—to $140 a barrel three years later in part because of the war. It is now hovering at around a $100 a barrel. “It set off a chain of events that had far reaching consequences,” said Bilmes, who thinks the war’s financial burden on the US Treasury may have also contributed to the US financial crisis in 2007-2008.</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1364043355580</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-23 08:55:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364043586134-4</Id><Topic><Title>Iraq War: $4 trillion price tag and counting (W's crew said $50 billion would do it)</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1364043355580</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-23 08:55:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>According to repubs it didn't cost a trillion</Msg><Username>dropkickpubs4321</Username><Timestamp>1364043586134</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-23 08:59:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364043602274-5</Id><Title>How the US public was defrauded by the hidden cost of the Iraq war</Title><Msg>George Bush sold the war as quick and cheap; it was long and costly. Even now, the US is paying billions to private contractors When the US invaded Iraq in March 2003, the Bush administration estimated that it would cost $50-60bn to overthrow Saddam Hussein and establish a functioning government. This estimate was catastrophically wrong: the war in Iraq has cost $823.2bn between 2003 and 2011. Some estimates suggesting that it may eventually cost as much as $3.7tn when factoring in the long-term costs of caring for the wounded and the families of those killed. The most striking fact about the cost of the war in Iraq has been the extent to which it has been kept "off the books" of the government's ledgers and hidden from the American people. This was done by design. A fundamental assumption of the Bush administration's approach to the war was that it was only politically sustainable if it was portrayed as near-costless to the American public and to key constituencies in Washington. The dirty little secret of the Iraq war – one that both Bush and the war hawks in the Democratic party knew, but would never admit – was that the American people would only support a war to get rid of Saddam Hussein if they could be assured that they would pay almost nothing for it. The most obvious way in which the true cost of this war was kept hidden was with the use of supplemental appropriations to fund the occupation. By one estimate, 70% of the costs of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan between 2003 and 2008 were funded with supplemental or emergency appropriations approved outside the Pentagon's annual budget. These appropriations allowed the Bush administration to shield the Pentagon's budget from the cuts otherwise needed to finance the war, to keep the Pentagon's pet programs intact and to escape the scrutiny that Congress gives to its normal annual regular appropriations. With the Iraq war treated as an "off the books" expense, the Pentagon was allowed to keep spending on high-end military equipment and cutting-edge technology. In fiscal terms, it was as if the messy wars in Afghanistan and Iraq were never happening.</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1364043602274</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-23 09:00:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364043780365-6</Id><Title>repubs, Bill Mahr,,last week ya pointed out didn't like Ca. taxes,,,,you were THRILLED, are ya thrilled this week</Title><Msg>after Mahr said Obama did a great job this past week in middle east??

Now the Bill Is Due. By Andrew J. Bacevich,October 05, 2008 To understand this link between today's financial crisis and Bush's wider national security decisions, we need to go back to 9/11 itself. From the very outset, the president described the "war on terror" as a vast undertaking of paramount importance. But he simultaneously urged Americans to carry on as if there were no war. "Get down to Disney World in Florida," he urged just over two weeks after 9/11. "Take your families and enjoy life, the way we want it to be enjoyed." Bush certainly wanted citizens to support his war -- he just wasn't going to require them actually to do anything. The support he sought was not active but passive. It entailed not popular engagement but popular deference. Bush simply wanted citizens (and Congress) to go along without asking too many questions.</Msg><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1364044188175</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-23 09:09:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364044231773-9</Id><Title>$25 is the next support level?</Title><Msg>Last year it went down from 36 to 25 in august so it may happen this year.

Joseph P. Hoar (Ret.) warned the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the invasion was risky and perhaps unnecessary. Morton Halperin, a foreign policy expert with the Council on Foreign Relations and Center for American Progress warned that an invasion would increase the terrorist threat.[9] In a 2002 book, Scott Ritter, a Nuclear Weapons Inspector in Iraq from 1991–98, argued against an invasion and expressed doubts about the Bush Administration’s claims that Saddam Hussein had a WMD capability.[10] Brent Scowcroft, who served as National Security Adviser to President George H.W. Bush was an early critic. He wrote an August 15, 2002 editorial in The Wall Street Journal entitled "Don't attack Saddam," arguing that the war would distract from the broader fight against terrorism and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which should be the U.S.'s highest priority in the Middle East.[11] The next month, Gen.

State Department analysts had found dozens of factual problems in drafts of the speech. Some of the claims were taken out, but others were left in, such as claims based on the yellowcake forgery.[44] The administration came under fire for having acted on faulty intelligence, particularly what was single-sourced to the informant known as Curveball. Powell later recounted how Vice President #$%$ Cheney had joked with him before he gave the speech, telling him, "You've got high poll ratings; you can afford to lose a few points." Powell's longtime aide-de-camp and Chief of Staff from 1989–2003, Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson, later characterized Cheney's view of Powell's mission as to "go up there and sell it, and we'll have moved forward a peg or two. Fall on your damn sword and kill yourself, and I'll be happy, too."[45] In September 2005, Powell was asked about the speech during an interview with Barbara Walters and responded that it was a "blot" on his record.
