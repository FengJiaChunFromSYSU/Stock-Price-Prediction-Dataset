They doctor all the reports, compare apples and oranges and lie if need be. I've read a lot on the vsubject and talked to people at the UC campus in San Diego that track such things. "Global Warming" AND cooling have occurred over and over in the past. It has gone to much greater extremes than anything we have seen in the past few hundred years. Long before man could have had any effect on it. "Igor" lied through his teeth as he teamed up with George Soros in a "Carbon Exchange". Had it not flopped both would have made many millions of dollars on our backs.</Msg><Username>lewcor</Username><Timestamp>1357665696695</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 12:21:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357677159430-5</Id><Title>Deficits</Title><Msg>Let’s try some accurate current dollar data from the Tax Policy Center, shall we? Bush: 2000 – outlays were 18.2% of GDP at 1.789 trillion with a surplus of 236 billion 2008 - outlays were 20.8% of GDP at 2.982 trillion (including 760 billion for TARP, which was approved by both Obama and McCain) and a deficit of 458 billion [Note that in 2007, despite the Bush tax cuts, two unfunded wars, and the unfunded drug program the deficit was only 161 billion based on ALL TIME RECORD receipts of 2.568 trillion and outlays of 2.729 trillion. Gosh, how oh how did we ever achive record receipts with that mean old Bush tax cut????] Obama: 2009 – outlays were 25.2% of GDP at 3.517 trillion with a deficit of 1.412 trillion 2012 - outlays est. at 24.3% of GDP at 3.796 trillion with a deficit of 1.327 trillion Now, using simple math, Obama is spending at a rate approx. 27% higher than Bush in his last year, which included and extra 760 billion for TARP. Just repeating Bush’s last year of spending including TARP would result in a deficit of just +500 billion versus the 1.327 trillion Obama is building up. Oh, let’s look at deficits! Under Bush, the cumulative deficit was (1.740) trillion for 8 years, and under Obama it is (5.332) trillion for 4 years. Progressives can spin and run, but they cannot hide from the data! Go ahead and keep blindly supporting your progressive masters as your standard of living drops to that of a Scandinavian country.</Msg><Username>coughingredink</Username><Timestamp>1357677159430</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 15:32:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357678722526-6</Id><Title>$5 trillion?</Title><Msg>I have sent people to the emergency room for one-trillionth of that.</Msg><Username>ufcw_shill</Username><Timestamp>1357678722526</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 15:58:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357680844100-7</Id><Topic><Title>short ORCL</Title><Username>markhwang2003</Username><Timestamp>1357318554108</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 11:55:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>much better places? such as?</Msg><Username>blackoutbuzz</Username><Timestamp>1357680844100</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 16:34:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357690371590-8</Id><Title>Funny!
