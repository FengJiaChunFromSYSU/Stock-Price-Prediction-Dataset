It has been decreasing. You can either increase revenue or decrease costs. We will see in a few days if the new CEO has been able to increase revenue in a very difficult year. Layoffs have been used to reduce costs in a way to maintain a viable company. Alternatives, maintain a high cost workforce with reduced earnings to the point of insolvency?. Its a balancing act of retaining only necessary employees to maintain leadership in the industry. IBM has done it in the past. I feel sorry for those laid off but its like cutting off a gangrene limb to save the body. .</Msg><Username>bob787m</Username><Timestamp>1373893691868</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 09:08:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373894190897-3</Id><Title>IBM Q2 Tailwind &amp; Headwind</Title><Msg>The tailwind is the rollover of deals from Q1 -- the CFO said that Q1 rollover is usually about $150 mil so it was 3x at $450 mil. He said the rollover was high margin software and mainframe deals and that Q1 rollover had similar conditions to Q1 2005 when IBM missed EPS expectations. The similarity is that Easter fell in Q1 this year as it did in 2005. He said the rollover was primarily in the US &amp; Europe markets. Apparently Easter does delay business in Europe. he acknowledged that the rollover will be a tailwind for Q2. The CFO also said that currency would continue to lower revenues (and expenses) and the primary currency drop will come from the Yen. he estimated that currency would cut operating EPS in Q2 by $.10. So on the $3.79 Q2 composite estimate it will cost about 2,6%. Given that the CFO said IBM would make the slightly less than 8% growth target of $3.79 for Q2. So it looks like we will see IBM release at least the $3.79 -- or more if a lot of the rollover deals close. He did caution not to count on them all. So IBM 's share price trajectory will depend on IBM's outlook. If they are unable to raise the $16.70 boggy for operating earnings the stock could stay weak going into Q4. At the Barclay's conference on 5/23 the CFO predicted a return to double digit operating EPS in Q4. So the outlook for 7/17 is mixed.</Msg><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1373894190897</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 09:16:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373895177003-4</Id><Title>Deadly week after 7/17</Title><Msg>Ready for diving into deep bloodbath in few more days.
