It has much higher overall margins because of the larger % of software in its sales. In lean times, ORCL will see earnings go down faster than IBM as was the case in 2009. IBM's revenue base is moire diversified than ORCL when you consider Services and Finance - GFS. ORCL trades at about 3.75x its sales while IBM trades around 2x sales reflecting IBM's lower margins and slower growth. So I can't agree that ORCL is much cheaper. Interestingly for this year, the composite analyst estimate for ORCL operating earnings is around 8% growth while IBM's estimate is closer to 9%.</Msg><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1372847612153</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 06:33:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372860666226-3</Id><Topic><Title>biotech symbols, DARA, DRRX</Title><Username>pcyc_70to57centsin2009</Username><Timestamp>1372448542243</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-28 15:42:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>load up before they're acquired.</Msg><Username>pcyc_at57centswasa_pos</Username><Timestamp>1372860666226</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 10:11:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372862182548-4</Id><Topic><Title>comparing Oracle vs IBM, Oracle is much cheaper?</Title><Username>topinvestgun1</Username><Timestamp>1372827253284</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 00:54:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Isn't that like comparing eggs to apples........?</Msg><Username>zer0t0l</Username><Timestamp>1372862182548</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 10:36:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372863478840-5</Id><Topic><Title>Support our DOD VETS move your 401k's and IRA 's to cash Send Wall Street and Congress a message</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1372798545628</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 16:55:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Support our VETS move to cash</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1372863478840</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 10:57:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372863654288-6</Id><Topic><Title>SELL 193 - 194</Title><Username>p1sorell</Username><Timestamp>1372776746593</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 10:52:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Though the markets are down sharply in Europe, stocks here are holding up.

I asked a friend who is a Vice Pres. of HR at another large computer company about IBM employees. She just laughed. Apparently the view is that they under skilled, overpaid, and difficult to manage because they need an incredible amount of direction. Nobody wants them and that's why they are all stuck at IBM until they get laid off. And the problem goes all the way to the top. Have you ever heard of a senior IBM executive being recruited by another industry player? They're like a bunch of antiques that have all been sitting at IBM tarnishing for 40 years. Rommety, Sanford, Mills, Adkins, Loughridge Iwata, etc., etc., etc. Same names since 1980. They brought in an outsider - Gerstner. made progress and recovered from a disaster. But then they went right back and put Palmisano in the big seat. Now another long-time insider CEO - Rommety. Personally I think it's because nobody else wants the job.</Msg><Username>jand2357</Username><Timestamp>1372863897951</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 11:04:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372865689274-8</Id><Title>Sold at $193.23</Title><Msg>PC is dead now..stay away from this stock...Go UPS</Msg><Username>bigk95133</Username><Timestamp>1372865689274</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 11:34:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372866360897-9</Id><Topic><Title>IBM and layoffs</Title><Username>jand2357</Username><Timestamp>1370366399824</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 13:19:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I worked at IBM for 30+ years and you are right, the employees are under skilled but IBM is largely responsible for that. They rarely allow employees to leave one division/organization to join another where they could hone their skills and most of them never have to deal with real world customer problems and implementations. IBM could fix things by rotating people in and out of positions and training them but there is no budget anymore for any of that. In addition, there are tons of chiefs and very few Indians (to coin an old phrase). I now work at a company that is a lot more customer oriented and I have learned so much more in the last 5 years doing this that it is amazing. But IBM is like other large organizations now, they are driven by quarter to quarter results so no one dares to ask for more money to do things the right way.</Msg><Username>nozupforyou</Username><Timestamp>1372866360897</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 11:46:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372866469814-10</Id><Topic><Title>IBM and layoffs</Title><Username>jand2357</Username><Timestamp>1370366399824</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 13:19:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It is fact that IBM now has less than 100,000 employees in the US, just FYI.

An employee at IBM is totally isolated from the rest of the industry. Think about the IBM Social Networking Global Conference. Does anyone outside of IBM care about that? If you want to be in mobile wireless you go to Samsung or Apple or Google. If you want to be in cloud computing then Amazon and possibly now Microsoft are the places. Does anyone really think that DB/2 is where it's at in the database world? How about Lotus? High performance computing is all moving to clusters of graphics processors (IBM has no presence in that market). I could extend this list nearly forever. It's just not a place to be from unless you're in corporate finance. They produce really good corporate finance employees because financial engineering is their strongest business.</Msg><Username>jand2357</Username><Timestamp>1372870418375</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 12:53:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372891177063-15</Id><Title>IBM after earning will be around 170-175</Title><Msg>will miss both Rev. and Earning reduce forecast</Msg><Username>emanuel_dabah</Username><Timestamp>1372891177063</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 18:39:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372891762655-16</Id><Topic><Title>Sold at $193.23</Title><Username>bigk95133</Username><Timestamp>1372865689274</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 11:34:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>he's the one who leaves my packages in the rain.

Since we are in the recovery cycle, I guess sales in Oracle will increase further and faster. A lot of companies has money to deploy. I will wait for IBM to write off its restructuring charge first before I consider it. Thanks for the insight. I know both are dominating in the market and making money. I just don't like IBM sending jobs off shore, very personal feeling. In long term, I think it is bad for North America and depleting skills to software engineer and innovate.</Msg><Username>topinvestgun1</Username><Timestamp>1372907338439</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 23:08:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372908716233-19</Id><Topic><Title>comparing Oracle vs IBM, Oracle is much cheaper?</Title><Username>topinvestgun1</Username><Timestamp>1372827253284</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 00:54:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Buy all the Oracle you can afford as soon as you can.
