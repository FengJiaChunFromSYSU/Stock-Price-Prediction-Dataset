I think it is not only about the Fed, but what sort of bazooka the ECB is about to unload,” said David Rosenberg, chief economist and strategist at Gluskin Sheff + Associates Inc. “It has been all this speculation about QE that revived the market off the summertime lows – it certainly wasn't earnings, revenues or guidance. So a lot is priced in, to be sure – maybe even the whole rally.”</Msg><Username>kit3taylor</Username><Timestamp>1346660466653</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 04:21:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346661347870-3</Id><Topic><Title>CLINT EASTWOOD was ACES!</Title><Username>briggrunner</Username><Timestamp>1346490117830</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-01 05:01:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Clint was definitely entertaining. But also, panning the audience showed many unsmiling faces. I believe (imho) the fact Mormans are pascifists became evident. I'd enjoy seeing a rerun of Clint's GOP performance. At first glance - the performance was just too entertaining. Now, for the serious side of the academy award winning actor/director - knowing Clint's dry humor, it deserves a second look....</Msg><Username>kit3taylor</Username><Timestamp>1346661347870</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 04:35:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346677041408-4</Id><Topic><Title>I'm just going to ignore the facts and vote Obama</Title><Username>sirola1</Username><Timestamp>1346450586335</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 18:03:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You can credit Bernanke for that and he alone.

It seems that Obama would like to bring everyone down to the lowest common denominator. He really wants to help poor people...at the expense of everyone else! That is a change from most presidents who cater to the wealthy. It would be nice to see the GOP work with him instead of blocking everything that he does. He is not a great president. But, he is a good campaigner. He will kick Romney's rear. Most Americans can sense that Romney is a fake!</Msg><Username>qofaslave69</Username><Timestamp>1346678040322</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 09:14:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346691321441-6</Id><Topic><Title>WHERE'S IT SAY IN THE USA CONSTITUTION...?</Title><Username>kit3taylor</Username><Timestamp>1346457477368</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 19:57:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>homosexuals suck.</Msg><Username>gormdd540</Username><Timestamp>1346691321441</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 12:55:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346705804778-7</Id><Topic><Title>The New Message Board Format Sucks!</Title><Username>yield_of_my_dreams</Username><Timestamp>1346074305141</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-27 09:31:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ditto-Sucks</Msg><Username>dino2hootie</Username><Timestamp>1346705804778</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 16:56:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346727338210-8</Id><Topic><Title>47% OF UNION GUYS ARE VOTING FOR ROMNEY</Title><Username>savingamerica794</Username><Timestamp>1346151410084</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 06:56:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The communist party just recently announced it is supporting Obama.</Msg><Username>kit3taylor</Username><Timestamp>1346727338210</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 22:55:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
