I will be in Gold in a few weeks. My new senator Warren will vote yes on each new stimulus package and each increase in the long term debt . Her lips will be attached to the President's behind. I voted for Obama in 2008 because he was going to supposedly cut spending. I no longer desire to be a member of a party consisting of many people voting to get to continue to receive a government paycheck of some sort. Not interested in amnesty for illegals either. My healthcare was up 13% last year and 16% this upcoming year paying for their free healthcare.</Msg><Username>tr01742</Username><Timestamp>1352559462504</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-10 09:57:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352568327198-3</Id><Title>Protect your 401k's if you have not done it yet, Market is going a lot lower fast</Title><Msg>Protect your 401k's if you have not done it yet, Market is going a lot lower fast</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1352568327198</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-10 12:25:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352576743457-4</Id><Topic><Title>Protect your 401k's if you have not done it yet, Market is going a lot lower fast</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1352568327198</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-10 12:25:27 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The only way to protect your 401k is to invest it wisely in proven companies like IBM.

The Republican House won't vote for any tax increase -- they won't buy into it because they told people they would not raise taxes to get elected. It may cause a recession and they don't want to be part of it. Obama will blame them for any recession because of the increase of taxes on those below $250k. The next year will be rough. European and Asian demand is headed down. The US stock market may take a big hit when all the engineers doing defense work out in California get pink slips -- like Boeing is doing right now. But they are not Obama's problem -- after 99 weeks of unemployment they probably won't qualify for food stamps.</Msg><Username>yield_of_my_dreams</Username><Timestamp>1352601020285</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-10 21:30:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352601914335-7</Id><Topic><Title>$183.60 is the critical bottom.</Title><Username>cmegladon</Username><Timestamp>1350587262557</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 15:07:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I wrote this on 10/18 and sticking to it.</Msg><Username>cmegladon</Username><Timestamp>1352601914335</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-10 21:45:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
