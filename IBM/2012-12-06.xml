Trickle down is a failed concept, and the divide between the rich and the poor has never been wider. The rich with a conscience are fine with, and our country has prospered undwr a tax baae FAR higher than what is being proposed." But spending was a lot lower. And folks living in South Dakota didn't have to bail out Detroit and Chicago because they can't collect enough in taxes locally to pay local bills -- not a bailout for a disaster like a hurricane -- Chicago hasn't made a contribution to the Chicago Teachers Pension Fund in years -- has about $10 bil and shrinking by about $500 mil a year -- teachers contribute very little -- the Mayor says RE tax in Chicago would have to double just to save that one fund. What has clearly failed is promising other peoples money that doesn't exist. Social Security and Medicare will have to be means tested or Treasury paper will become junk. So yes -- taxes have to go way up and benefits way down blah,blah, blah.</Msg><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1354800577755</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 08:29:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354804307821-3</Id><Title>Breaking below bottom support</Title><Msg>Not looking good?
