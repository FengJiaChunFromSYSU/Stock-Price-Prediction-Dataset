Raise taxes? The President wants the tax cuts to expire for the wealthy. Their taxes are at historic lows. If they are doing so well now then why aren't they investing? I think you've got it all backwards dude. Since the Reagan era big business has gotten exactly what they want but what they didn't want was to invest in America, they just wanted to maximize profit. That is what the Republican idea of free market is all about. Oh, BTW, congress is the one that sets the budget.

To reach that point, which comes when panels cost below $2 per Watt, prices will have to continue their steep decline. During our visit to IBM's Watson research center, we talked to two people who are working on ways to drive the cost down—but they are taking radically different approaches. The prior referenced article is one of the paths (CZTS), the other is solar concentrators.

To test the system, Watson was first tasked with answering questions taken from Doctor's Dilemma, a competition for trainee doctors that takes place at the annual meeting of the American College of Physicians. Watson was given 188 questions that it had not seen before and achieved around 50 per cent accuracy - not bad for an early test, but hardly ideal.
