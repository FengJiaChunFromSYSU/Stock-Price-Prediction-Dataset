This, and the entire u.s. Tech industry is the laughing stock of the world!!!! creative accounting on the part of farmed out book keeping is what keeps america's wall street lookin' pretty each quarter. Creative accounting, otherwise known as cookin' the books, will no doubt be at the root of today's numbers, bet on it!!! wall street loves to paint ponies green and then pad them with creative paper printing, bond buying and creative accounting. hmmm, my dog could run a business in the u.s. And beat earnings expectations each quarter. How can't you meet and beat when you are cheating the very system that america was once build upon? add an easy irs that looks the other way for large us companies padding the books and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that this quarter too will be a beat and the media will hump this news like it does each quarter. Ever feel like you're hearing the same record playing over and over again?

IBM will enjoy a solid 13-17 multiple based on that figure. $16.70 multiplied by a 15 PE is a $250 stock... Multiplied by current P/E it is $217.... Going higher folks!</Msg><Username>qofaslave69</Username><Timestamp>1358898548811</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 18:49:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358898696597-55</Id><Topic><Title>$18 Billion in Free Cash Flow</Title><Username>qofaslave69</Username><Timestamp>1358898548811</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 18:49:08 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>do you expect x servers to grow?</Msg><Username>majicubby09</Username><Timestamp>1358898696597</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 18:51:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358899002180-56</Id><Title>4 year DECLINE/ "LAME DUCK" BEAR market coming soon !

So yeah 30% return sounds pretty good in 2 years of banking. If you're playing options, you need to time your buys right based on chart movement, else you're just going to throw your dimes away over time and continue to break even or fall just under. That's how you nickel and dime yourself playing a non-turbulent steady riser. What you need to do is go play a condor on Apple if you want money now.</Msg><Username>kistilan</Username><Timestamp>1358901218710</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 19:33:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358901261277-61</Id><Title>people got too bearish, IBM's report wasnt very positive</Title><Msg>But stocks pop big when too many people are bearish and buy put/get short.

Many big boys will see a clear path to $300 pps now in 18-24 months... hence they'll hold and enjoy the dividend. The management is extremely shareholder-friendly and the street loves that! They'll explode out the gate tomorrow and then easily take out the old-high and enter the "Blue-Sky" territory! Shorts in IBM will be squeezed mercilessly now. Cover while you still have moderate losses. The IBM can remain overbought beyond 220 territory much longer than you IBM-short can remain solvent!

It's buy back shares to boost eps and play currency games. Then the market goes up with free Bernanke money. The guy has printed 3T in 4 years. It's all an insider game. Bernanke &amp; co call the banks and tell them what's next. As usual the FED is engineering another "crisis" down the road. Worse the government spent like crazy pre election trying to make things look better.</Msg><Username>rockinl23</Username><Timestamp>1358916724418</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 23:52:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
