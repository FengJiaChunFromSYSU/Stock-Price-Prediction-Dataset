But looks like we may both be wrong.. Looks like IBM will open a little higher.. Dow is up 9 pts... About the whip saw.. I caught them Thurs and Fri, playing that game.. On those weekly options, I bought 10 puts($600.) either late Wed or early Thurs.. Doubled that money, .. IBM had dropped to under $194. I bought 40 of the $195 calls late Thurs($2200.) Sold them Fri morning for $10k).. Made 1 mistake.. Sold them all at $2.50.. Should have sold half and took a chance on IBM going higher.. They ultimatly would have been worth $4. Thats 2 Fri in a row they just drove IBM up all day!! But they burnt me bad the previous Fri.. Most time, IBM after running up, will give part of it back.. I just kept buying puts as they drove it up all day... I have learned one thing.. You can make or lose a lot of money fast, on those weekly options!!</Msg><Username>jrmills0014</Username><Timestamp>1344251217000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 07:06:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344252380000-3</Id><Topic><Title>What will IBM open at tomorrow??</Title><Username>jrmills0014</Username><Timestamp>1344191069000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 14:24:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wixie, if anybody knows how hard it is to beat them playing those options.. Its me... I have lost a fortune.. Quit playing them about a yr ago.. But a couple of mths ago, decided to take $5K and just absolutly gamble playing options with it.. BTW, when I bought those puts on IBM, that $5k was down to $1700. And may get wiped out this week.. Placed my bets, Fri afternoon!!! I think in the next coupld of days.. Oil will drop a couple of dollars and usually the mkt and oil go in the same direction??? Not that either has moved much this morning.. But oil is down 34 cents and Dow is up 13 pts.... So much for my theorie they move in same direction... Don't IBM pay dividend in the next couple of days???</Msg><Username>jrmills0014</Username><Timestamp>1344252380000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 07:26:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344253342000-4</Id><Topic><Title>IBM must acquire both AKAM &amp; RIMM, big blue will fly</Title><Username>casbah45</Username><Timestamp>1343339537000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 17:52:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>IBM will never get in the device business.

Besides Europe's up &amp; down problems, IBM could use a catalyst. NASDAQ hired IBM to review operations after the FB screw up and in the past has worked on various stock exchanges like Korea and is now doing some work on the Spanish exchange. The problems like FB &amp; Knight Capital may be addressable by scalable artificial intelligence which is what IBM seems to be very good at producing. http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=IBM&amp;t=1m&amp;l=on&amp;z=l&amp;q=l &amp;c=%5EDJI</Msg><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1344261134000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 09:52:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344262134000-9</Id><Topic><Title>IBM Had Been Underperforming the DOW</Title><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1344261134000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 09:52:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=IBM&amp;t=5y&amp;l=on&amp;z=l&amp;q=l&amp;c=%5EDJI</Msg><Username>qofaslave69</Username><Timestamp>1344262134000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 10:08:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344264300000-10</Id><Topic><Title>IBM Had Been Underperforming the DOW</Title><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1344261134000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 09:52:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Q2 earnings seems to have driven IBM back on track: http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=IBM&amp;t=1m&amp;l=on&amp;z=l&amp;q=l&amp;c=%5EDJI</Msg><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1344264300000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 10:45:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344267198000-11</Id><Title>Load Up THe Truck Now!</Title><Msg>What an outstanding year we are having even when the market is crashing!!

You can stick all that Tech sheit where the sun don't shine.. With this computerized trading!!! These stks will trade at where the ones selling all those calls and put at every mth can make the most money by X date!!! All I can tell you.. They were some programming fools to have taught ole Watson to run it up to $200. Sell all those $200. calls and then run it back to $195. and knock out all those $195. and $200. calls.. Now should people be stupid enough to bet more money, they can't drive it up vs down.. Then ole Watson will drive it higher... I suggest yall start concentrating on what would make him drive it up and down vs sitting here and talking about what a great Co or a piece of sheit IBM is!!!! By the way.. Not that I am as smart as ole Watson.. But I think, we see IBM do about the same thing this week as last.. You are aware it dropped to like $193. Just last Thursday!!! BTW: That didn't make any sense to me.. I bought me 40 $195. calls that was expiring on Fri.. Did Yall see what IBM done!!!</Msg><Username>jrmills0014</Username><Timestamp>1344286849000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 17:00:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344292087000-16</Id><Topic><Title>IBM must acquire both AKAM &amp; RIMM, big blue will fly</Title><Username>casbah45</Username><Timestamp>1343339537000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 17:52:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You should be able to spot a joke son!!!
