There is no way that an agreement will bring that down to $2 bil a day. I'll wager any agreement is back end loaded with reduced spending and a lot of the tax increases -- they will say that's best for a better trajectory for the economy given that it growing slowly. While the focus is on the Kabuki dance in Washington, the EU has to bail out Greece, Spain, Italy, Portugal, and the gov't spending in those countries is headed down - same is true in the UK. IBM will probably take share and do ok even in a global slow down. DELL &amp; HPQ will be after the same customers because the PC biz is headed south. Let's hope IBM can continue to increase gross profit even if demand is weakening. I'm still on the sidelines waiting for the Fiscal Cliff to unfold and I'm concerned about an EU lead slowdown. I'm in T &amp; VZ. We may be OK in the US for domestic orientated stocks like a VZ or USG if housing continues to recover, however as pointed out by Jim Roach on CNBC this morning consumer spending has only averaged .07% per quarter growth in the 19 quarters since Q1 2008 and in 1998 - 2008 it averaged 3.6% and it's 70% of the economy. Redistributing investor dollars to low income individuals may not hurt the economy immediately, but lowering overall spending will hurt. While Americans deleveraged starting 2008 the Fed leveraged up its balance sheet and the Treasury issued $4 trillion of new debt to deficit spend, Americans have not deleveraged enough and if the US Gov't is going to deleverage by some combination of tax increases and spending reductions. it should slow GDP down. Given the slow demand reflected in recent multinational revenue numbers and Washington set to raise taxes on investors, I don't see a reason to rush back into IBM. We could see a lot of tax selling before YE. Add to the mix event risk in the EU &amp; Middle East and I'm worried enough to wait even though long term IBM will be fine. Like everybody else I'm looking for a good deal.</Msg><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1352840818151</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-13 16:06:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352841463537-8</Id><Topic><Title>$183.60 is the critical bottom.</Title><Username>cmegladon</Username><Timestamp>1350587262557</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 15:07:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Since you were kind enough to enquire, rather than impose a formal inquiry, I'd be glad to.....assuming that post was directed to me. So I'll ask a question of you. Is the $183.60 level an area of support or do you even care? Did I take it to the bank? hahaha Well, if you read my history you'll see I called a drop before the CC and earnings announcement and bought a ton of puts just under $210. Most of that is in the bank...........lol So yeah, I took it to the bank so to speak.....just not "your speak". I'm serious about what I do. And I hope to be long, on the right side of the trade when it turns.
