Well in the first quarter of 2012 he added more, and in the second he added again. Why does Warren Buffett like IBM so much?" Buffett has said the "moat" around IBM's empire is wide -- he likes IBM's ability to retain customers. He loves Sam and said he delivered "big time" for shareholders and trusts IBM's management &amp; BOD to keep things going in the right directions. So he likes a lot of things about IBM who he says treats shareholders with reverence -- issuing stock options to management at 110% of current market is no doubt a key policy to Warren. Buffett really likes IBM's buybacks a lot and he likes symmetry -- I believe in Q1 he increased his stake about 5% and then I believe it was 3.5% in Q2. So as IBM reduces the total share count each Q he is increasing his share count for a doubling effect on his % ownership. I bet Buffett bought shares in July in the 12-14 trading day period in July before earnings when IBM is probably out of the market -- the SEC guidelines are that you don't buy stock back when mgt is in possession of material inside info not yet released to the public. I haven't seen a cost of an av share added but I'm going to check it out. I'll wager he picked some up in the low $180's.</Msg><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1345204261000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 07:51:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345204768000-3</Id><Topic><Title>Buffett Sells INTC &amp; Adds IBM</Title><Username>qofaslave69</Username><Timestamp>1344977925000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 16:58:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He bought $10 billion of stock in 2011 "around $170" according to his interviews. He said he might buy more if it came back down. Well, it never came back down to $170. Therefore Mr. Buffett is buying IBM at $180 and $190 too. He must really like IBM for its long term growth. When a whale like Warrenn Buffett buys stocks there must be a spike in volume? Yes, he did mention that IBM is "reverent to sharholders.". I like that!</Msg><Username>qofaslave69</Username><Timestamp>1345204768000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 07:59:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345210046000-4</Id><Title>10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1</Title><Msg>CRASH !</Msg><Username>dopytrader</Username><Timestamp>1345210046000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 09:27:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345210675000-5</Id><Topic><Title>10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1</Title><Username>dopytrader</Username><Timestamp>1345210046000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 09:27:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That's good son.
