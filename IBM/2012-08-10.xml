Is IBM going to be hit by both China and Europe?" What I look for in IBM is stability. This year, the word from some was that IBM's Q2 would be soft and that the tax settlement break in Q1, which offset a big charge for employee separation and re-org and was the cause of the Q1 beat, meant that the rest of the year would be soft. But we are at a $15.10 boggy. As to a China slowdown this year, IBM has its supply chain operations in China and does a lot of business there resulting in a big staff of employees and consultants. I would expect that IBM would know what is happening in China well before and more accurately than many talking heads on CNBC. IBM proved it's new model in 2009, which can bring earnings and cash flow to the bottom line even if revenue is clocking in reverse. I'm somewhat hedged and not a seller. I'll go with the $15.10 for now.</Msg><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1344614473000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-10 12:01:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344615065000-17</Id><Topic><Title>IBM should acquire entire RIMM, Not only tne Enterprise Bus unit</Title><Username>casbah45</Username><Timestamp>1344611099000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-10 11:04:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Buy all of Rimm and break the company up.

She is good. All indications are that IBM will not be getting in the generic smart-phone biz. A wild card reason for buying the whole thing might be to get some patents that could be valuable. IBM has pioneered systems to organize patents as well as do searches constantly to find possible infringements. It sells these services so if IBM sees patent value they could buy RIMM in total for patents or other valuable assets to IBM. Competing directly with AAPL &amp; GOOG &amp; MSFT in smart-phones would not be part of the plan. Let Meg Whitman at HPQ do that.</Msg><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1344639946000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-10 19:05:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344640851000-24</Id><Topic><Title>MITT ROMNEY WILL SAVE AMERICA</Title><Username>nynynyny461</Username><Timestamp>1341232351000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-02 08:32:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The only way for Mitt to save the Country is for him to slit his Mormon / Cult throat.</Msg><Username>flatsflyer</Username><Timestamp>1344640851000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-10 19:20:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
