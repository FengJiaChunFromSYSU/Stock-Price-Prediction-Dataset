If the Euro was worth $1.35 - $1.40 it would be a nice tailwind for IBM and the billion $ hit IBM took in Q3 on revenue translation would flip to a gain +/- IBM's currency hedges. If we get austerity in the US in the form of more taxes and/or spending cuts the dollar should get stronger. I believe that's a big reason why IBM has stayed below the $200 level since Q3 was reported. I'm on the sidelines waiting to see how Q4 looks before I get back in IBM -- and I really would like to get back in for the LT. But I may be waiting for an entry point after the debt ceiling negotiations are over. Now may be the time to go long the dollar index unless there are no big spending cuts and the dollar weakens. Right now I wouldn't bet against the buck.</Msg><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1357574137318</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 10:55:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357580354196-4</Id><Topic><Title>We Have Met the Enemy and Their is US!</Title><Username>kramer_thek</Username><Timestamp>1357490264623</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-06 11:37:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>These kinds of c &amp; p propaganda posts are worthless -- why it got 4 "thumbs up" is a mystery -- unless a merry band of followers does so for more show: "In the 22 years between 1976 and 1998, the share of the nation's private wealth held by the top 1% nearly doubled, going from 20% to 39%. In 1982 the wealthiest 400 individuals in the “Forbes 400” owned $92 billion. By 2000, their wealth had increased to over $1.2 trillion. Since 1987, the adjusted gross income or AGI of the top 1% has risen 386% while their share of total tax burden has risen 53%." The US GDP has also grown. In 1976 it was 1.824 tril and in 1998 it was 8.793 tril for an increase of 482% -- plenty of it was inflation that Volcker finally shut down in 1981 with 15% T-Bond rates. The GDP in 2010 was $14.508 tril. The wealth held by individuals in the "400" or the "1%" and all the numbers above are at best gross estimates because they are not tracked by the BLS or any other institution using any kind of precise procedures. This post is propaganda.</Msg><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1357580354196</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 12:39:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357583489315-5</Id><Topic><Title>We Have Met the Enemy and Their is US!</Title><Username>kramer_thek</Username><Timestamp>1357490264623</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-06 11:37:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You seen to miss the key points: 1.

For example, IBM traded at about $140 in 1999 and then sank with the rest of the market and didn't recover that market price until 2010. -- for a whole host of reasons including IBM's actions. P/E's have contracted big time. Graph Microsoft. And 2007 - 2012 looks a lot like 1929 to 1945 on a graph but obviously market, economic and world political conditions are much different. I'm not going to blame the mega rich or hedge funds.for p/e contraction. The author of the original post rants about Rush Limbaugh and Fox news. That's meaningless political dogma -- I'm interested in making money and growing my net worth -- that means trying to interpret the market and evaluating individual stocks, bonds, eft's, etc. Who listens to Rush Limbaugh to pick stocks or try and figure out where the economy is headed? I listen to CNBC to hear guys like Bill Gross etc for that. The other stuff is noise. Let's get back to IBM.</Msg><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1357590179446</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 15:22:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357591328759-10</Id><Title>AMZN QCOM CRUS SNDK EBAY and also LVS</Title><Msg>check it out</Msg><Username>jgiled</Username><Timestamp>1357591328759</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 15:42:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357591786243-11</Id><Topic><Title>AMZN QCOM CRUS SNDK EBAY and also LVS</Title><Username>jgiled</Username><Timestamp>1357591328759</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 15:42:08 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>what are we supposed to be checking out????</Msg><Username>jrmills0014</Username><Timestamp>1357591786243</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 15:49:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357595197577-12</Id><Topic><Title>We Have Met the Enemy and Their is US!</Title><Username>kramer_thek</Username><Timestamp>1357490264623</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-06 11:37:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Go back and read my post slowly instead of knee jerk lipping off about propaganda like FOX news or Limbaugh or saying I blame the mega rich for the p/e contraction. I wasn't blaming the mega rich for p/e contraction, but rather HF computer trading that accounts for 70% of all trades made. An active trading day saw 45 million shares on the NYSE in the md-1970s, now the NYSE volume is measured in billions. The wealth corporations are creating for their shareholders is getting sucked up by these trading programs. Pure and simple market manipulation. FYI, certain CEOs are now raising the issue publicly. PS-You are welcome for providing the sources to what you termed propaganda. I suggest instead of bashing other posters on these boards, you take a look at this information.</Msg><Username>kramer_thek</Username><Timestamp>1357595197577</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 16:46:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357598616456-13</Id><Topic><Title>Daniels retires before the s77t hits the fan</Title><Username>cvs9yt</Username><Timestamp>1357406969496</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 12:29:29 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Not a good sign, when first week of the year , your best executive is getting out while the getting is still good, Rev numbers was this guy's thing, I'm thinking there is a big miss coming for the qtr" Every post you have made on the IBM board for the last 10 years has been negative.
