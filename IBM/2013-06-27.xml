If you count Ginny it's 15. They are of course very accomplished folks, some with many years of experience and extensive educations. They lead groups of people who are some of the most talented people in the world. It's understandable that many disgruntled employees and jealous have not's will complain to anyone who will listen. As if posting the sour grapes stuff on a message board is useful. Really, it's an old story. Complaining will not improve your skill set.</Msg><Username>man_the_ramparts</Username><Timestamp>1372330175487</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-27 06:49:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372332659007-3</Id><Topic><Title>History means something</Title><Username>jand2357</Username><Timestamp>1372280981701</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 17:09:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>BAM!

When IBM issues shares against option exercise I suspect they buy them as part of the overall buyback. The amount that IBM publishes is its buyback amount for the prior quarter is gross purchases of both public stock and private deals, if any. If you account for options, about 20% to 23% of the gross cash IBM spends comes back to IBM from the proceeds of option exercise. You can see it by comparing the amounts on IBM's cash flow statements to the quarterly gross amount IBM lists in the earnings PR. So it's the cost of IBM stock comp -- the employee pays the exercise and IBM pays him the difference between his price and market value. IBM has a policy of issuing new stock options at 110% of market -- so IBM options come with a standard time vesting as well as price performance vesting to be worth anything. There are no doubt exceptions by the BOD but the general rule is 110%.. I guess they felt that was fair because of IBM's commitment to share buybacks. It's a good practice. IBM's relentless share buybacks made it a good bet for start ups who will benefit from being acquired to sell into IBM's base. While IBM usually pays net cash for acquisitions, IBM makes individual employment deals with start ups or mature operations staff to join IBM. The buybacks assure that they won't be diluted by future acquisitions.</Msg><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1372353135423</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-27 13:12:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372354496924-14</Id><Topic><Title>Write your congressman about Kim Jong Obama</Title><Username>socalinvestor50</Username><Timestamp>1372346637814</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-27 11:23:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>solar and nat gas exploration ARE creating good American jobs.

It just posted results and revenue was weaker than expected and they took their full year est down. Their consulting fees were down -- their EPS range had a low of $4.24 and the new range has a high of $4.22 -- so it's hard to say but it looks like about a $.10 EPS reduction on about a base of $4.30 so about a 2.5% reduction. It's going to hurt IBM. ACN has been a much better performer than IBM in the last 18 months. And I believe it has around a 16 p/e so better growth has been expected for ACN over IBM.
