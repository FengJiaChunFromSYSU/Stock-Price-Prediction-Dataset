If rates go up the appeal should diminish," said Cramer. "I can see this stock retreating to $80." 3M: "This is one I am very worried about," Cramer admitted. "3M reported a very disappointing quarter and yet failed to go down. In a real selloff this one's got downside; maybe down to $97." United Health: "It reported a good quarter and they did a big buyback, but I don't think it was good enough to stay at $61 on a bad employment number," Cramer said. "I would think that this one could easily travel back to $56-57." In addition Cramer sees potential weakness in a few other Dow components depending on stock specific catalysts. "IBM could trade down $10 on negative news. Also Wal-Mart could lose 10% in a heartbeat," he said. In addition, McDonald's could go back to $92 and Verizon and AT&amp;T may be vulnerable.</Msg><Username>techanalyst_trader</Username><Timestamp>1370577602894</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 00:00:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370610054458-2</Id><Title>Do some DD on MISM.

Whenever an individual or a business decides that success has been attained, progress stops. Every time we've moved ahead in IBM, it was because someone was willing to take a chance, put his head on the block, and try something new. A manager is an assistant to his men. Once an organization loses its spirit of pioneering and rests on its early work, its progress stops. You don't hear things that are bad about your company unless you ask. It is easy to hear good tidings, but you have to scratch to get the bad news. Don't make friends who are comfortable to be with. Make friends who will force you to lever yourself up.</Msg><Username>medchemlead</Username><Timestamp>1370612945485</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 09:49:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370614105522-4</Id><Topic><Title>Dear Ms Rometty</Title><Username>medchemlead</Username><Timestamp>1370571478797</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 22:17:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>MS Rometty is a very accomplished executive.

Socrates was known as a gadfly in his day, goading and provoking a stagnant and ill-functioning Athenian government to action . Ms. Rometty is an extremely talented and accomplished individual, who has steadfastly contributed to the company over many years. She can take the company far if she goes back to Thomas Watson's founding principles, and not follow the American business school model of just pandering to stockholder's needs in the next quarter's bottom line. The interplay of groundbreaking nanotechnologies and computing that IBM can develop if employees are provided a secure, welcoming environment to thrive and bring out their best can make this company thrive as never before. IBM scientists can contribute to technologies that can revolutionize thermodynamically sound energy harvesting and storage, novel functional biomaterials to revolutionize regenerative medicine, combined with advanced software for foolproof diagnostic methodologies, technologies to improve global security and enhance environmental quality. There is a global down-the-road vision of change and growth. that should be prioritized and implemented, not for management to have to wear the quarterly performance blinkers that mar and obstruct the larger panoramic view beyond. Companies like IBM have a soul, and when that soul is crushed with a myopic short-term gain being put in the cross-hairs by its shareholders, rather than the larger mother lode prize beyond in the further future, something gives. Big Blue was built on innovation, and if breathing room and resources are provided for an environment conducive to innovative technologies, the Big Blue sky will be seemingly limitless.</Msg><Username>medchemlead</Username><Timestamp>1370616397679</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 10:46:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370617870194-7</Id><Title>All signs point to a huge run in MISM</Title><Msg>All of the recent developments in MISM make me think that a big move is about to happen</Msg><Username>alexander.beck495</Username><Timestamp>1370617870194</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 11:11:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370629941923-8</Id><Title>Dow......turning lower</Title><Msg>Just after 15H00 we might turn red!!!</Msg><Username>techanalyst_trader</Username><Timestamp>1370629941923</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 14:32:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370632039004-9</Id><Title>Hampton's Beach i'm a fund manger that need a rest for 2-3 months</Title><Msg>Need fast flash crash connection by July.....lol</Msg><Username>techanalyst_trader</Username><Timestamp>1370632039004</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 15:07:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370648690180-10</Id><Topic><Title>Cramer see IBM drop $10</Title><Username>techanalyst_trader</Username><Timestamp>1370577602894</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 00:00:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wow !
