If you look at IBM's Operating EPS it was $3 for Q1 which was $.05 light but Q2 came in at $3.91 which was $.14 over. The $1b spent on reducing staff is going to lift results in 2H. The analysts have lifted their targets so the composite estimate for IBM is now $16.91 adjusted Operating EPS for 2013. But IBM could be weak until Q3 is reported. IBM's base is very predictable -- about 75% of annual revenue converts from starting backlog. The $16.4b of new services signings during Q2 was above average for a Q2 in the last few years. The rest of the annual sales are new sales to existing customers and new customers. The $16.4 bil of services contracts signed were high margin content per the CFO. It was good to see that Consulting contracts were up 31% YOY during Q2. That should help 2H margins. As IBM continues to move to higher margin sales its overall margins have continued to expand because there is also a lot of room for improvement because IBM's margins are not as yet in the top 20% of the S&amp;P 500 and way behind competitors like ORCL &amp; MSFT. Those two just found out that hardware is hard. We also have the probability that IBM will divest some Intel server assets. He said that IBM was not going to close it quickly just to get it done. Lenovo has looked at it -- could also be sold to an Indian or South Korean firm, or another Chinese firm. He thought it would fetch about $.65 Operating EPS -- given the condition of the generic server market you have to assume that IBM is not counting on much in the way of going concern value in that sale -- the assets are probably mostly depreciated on IBM's books.. That sale will lift IBM's margins and offset some margin pressure from shifting $4b of existing revenue to cloud revenue. Given the CFO's history, the probability of hitting $16.90 is high. That does not include the $1b of Q2 expense for the RIF.</Msg><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1374413728428</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-21 09:35:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374444802436-3</Id><Topic><Title>Going back to $200</Title><Username>hoyasparanoia</Username><Timestamp>1374256333554</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 13:52:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I will be surprised if IBM doesn't return to $200.00 soon.</Msg><Username>yuanlin36</Username><Timestamp>1374444802436</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-21 18:13:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374446747647-4</Id><Topic><Title>ibm is overvalued here......</Title><Username>txtrader77</Username><Timestamp>1374178451388</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 16:14:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This is cheap relative to ctsh, acn, and the market trades at 10.6X forward earnings this will be at $225 by Jan 2014.</Msg><Username>gallupingbull</Username><Timestamp>1374446747647</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-21 18:45:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374446898012-5</Id><Topic><Title>2015 earnings expectation</Title><Username>flaxxy703</Username><Timestamp>1374187719513</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 18:48:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If the sun doesn't rise tomorrow it will be the end of the world.</Msg><Username>gallupingbull</Username><Timestamp>1374446898012</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-21 18:48:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message></Date>
