The private sector, in most instances, keeps its eyes on the company's position in the market place and continually strives to improve its performance over time. Companies should not be repositories for unproductive workers or manufacturers of obsolete machines.</Msg><Username>coresabmw</Username><Timestamp>1371396528751</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-16 11:28:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371407137377-3</Id><Topic><Title>Layoffs only mean they're reballancing.</Title><Username>zer0t0l</Username><Timestamp>1371177048549</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 22:30:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Unproductive workers, manufacturers of machines? We can toss off your superficial evaluation because you don't seem to have a clue what this company does or what its services are. The hardware and software factions have already spun off a decade ago the vast majority of these services. Most of the present work was labor intensive applications serving internal and commercial clients. They are not so much changing their business profile as much as they are the placement of workforce. They outsourced to China and Brazil as well as Mexico and the Philippines but seeing that this labor is becoming more costly they now outsource to India for far less. When they find they can exploit cheaper labor elsewhere on the planet then they will move their ops there. This is a limited plan. Your whole concept of dead wood is so ludicrous you come across as ignorant. Anyone who buys your drivel does so because it is what they want to hear and not what exists. They are purging their workforce of thousands of experienced, loyal and highly intuitive people only because they think they can find the equivalent for substantially less money. Whether they can is much more complex a question then many care to ponder.</Msg><Username>nyse_marketmaker</Username><Timestamp>1371407137377</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-16 14:25:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371409874216-4</Id><Topic><Title>From the Hudson valley Patch</Title><Username>medchemlead</Username><Timestamp>1371242194176</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 16:36:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>New York State: Cuomo IBM: Rometty, Palmisano, Clementi Quattro Amici</Msg><Username>medchemlead</Username><Timestamp>1371409874216</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-16 15:11:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371422685987-5</Id><Topic><Title>From the Hudson valley Patch</Title><Username>medchemlead</Username><Timestamp>1371242194176</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 16:36:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good post.

For some reason, the message is not getting through to them. $20 EPS in 2015 will happen, but at what cost? Imagine what 2016, 2017 and 2018 will look like.

To be fair, she has only been in the job for 18 months; in that time, IBM stock has risen at a 7.1% annual rate. But in the last year, the S&amp;P 500 has spiked 24.2% while IBM stock has eked out a mere 4.4% gain. IBM’s formula for profit growth has been to cut costs enough to offset declining sales. In the last year, its revenue fell 2.3% while its net income grew 4.7%. If IBM cut enough people, it could meet its profit numbers. But in April, IBM violated the basic tenet for those who run publicly-traded companies - when it comes to quarterly earnings reports, you must beat expectations and raise guidance. If not, the stock suffers. IBM rarely violated that principle under Palmisano. In April, Rometty announced that in her fifth quarter as CEO, IBM had missed predicted earnings by a nickel and would fire people to cut costs before the end of June.Specifically, Bloomberg reported June 12, IBM posted first quarter profit of $3 a share while analysts expected $3.05 - “the first earnings shortfall since 2005.” In April, IBM said that the job reduction “would be concentrated overseas and mostly complete by the end of June.” Laurence Balter, an analyst at Oracle Investment Research, estimated that with IBM’s $1 billion restructuring charge, IBM would cut 6,000 to 8,000 jobs globally– at most 1.8% of IBM’s total workforce of 434,246 .IBM’s statement was short on details and long on how layoffs are a natural response to industry change and IBM’s business strategy. IBM said “Change is constant in the technology industry and transformation is an essential feature our business model. Since Rometty took over, IBM’s rate of growth in restructuring charges has nearly doubled as revenue shrank</Msg><Username>medchemlead</Username><Timestamp>1371440098107</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-16 23:34:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371440870305-11</Id><Title>IBM Job Cuts so far:</Title><Msg>IBM Job Cuts so far, with more coming (as reported by Alliance at IBM): STG Storage Systems Development: 121 STG lab Services and Tech Training: 52 STG Test Site Design: 59 STG SSE Intellectual Property: 64 BT/IT CIO Enterprise Transformation: 4 Corporate Marketing and Communication: 83 Software Group tivoli: 98 Software group WW Services and Education: 22 STG Semiconductor Research and Dev: 165 SO Delivery Integrated Competencies: 46 GPS Solutions and Delivery: 116 Software Group Marketing: 222 Research: 65 GBS AMS IBM Global Account: 123 STG Operations and Transformation: 34 Software Group NA Software Sales: 63 SO sectors (GSSR): 31 Software Group Information Management: 137 Software group Industry Solutions: 126 STG High Speed links, Cores and Memory: 67 SO Delivery HQ Cloud Development and Delivery: 40 GBS AMS Commercial Delivery: 27 STG Power Software Development: 64 GBS PS BusinessAnalytics: 39 STG Pureflex &amp; System X Software Development: 32 STG Advanced Microelectronics Solutions: 114 STG Worldwide Client Care: 30 STG IBM I Development: 60 TG System Z Software Development: 45 Software Group Security: 22 STG ISV Global Support: 35 IBM S&amp;D Communications Sector: 3 Software Group Rational: 59 ISC Sales Transaction Support OIST: 70 STG Systems Technology Development: 24 SWG Application and Integration Middleware: 86 STG Systems Solutions Dev: 56 GBS CS Industrial Sector: 32 STG Electronic Design Automation: 106 STG Competitive lab and Technical Sales Centers: 35 Software Group Collaboration: 115 Total cut so far: 2792 Looks like lots of technology and software research and development staff have been cut; not top and mid-echelons of business strategy folks, where the roots of the company's problems lie .
