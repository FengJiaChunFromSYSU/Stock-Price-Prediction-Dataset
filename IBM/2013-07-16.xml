I think that's a reasonable #. That would be up 9.7%. That's a higher EPS than it would be without the tailwind of deal rollover from Q1. Based on that, they will probably hit the $25b revenue target. But of course the rest of the year's revenue is the big question. When you think about all the revenue IBM gave up from PC's, DISK drives, printers and other commodity hardware IBM seems to be able to grow revenue as well -- not really much since 2010. I used to think of IBM as a 9' tall quarterback looking downfield from its customer base and R&amp;D platform. I have to think that IBM will find its way to increasing revenue that makes sense. Once IBM is fully into its strategy of hybrid cloud and public cloud we may see the marketplace for cloud moving in IBM's direction. Of the $7b IBM is forecasting for 2015 cloud revenue, $4 bil represents an internal shift in IBM's existing revenue base -- you have to cannibalize or lose customers.. That is one factor holding a lid on revenue growth.</Msg><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1373992604564</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 12:36:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373996682200-11</Id><Topic><Title>Layoffs vs ???</Title><Username>bob787m</Username><Timestamp>1373893691868</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 09:08:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It is a very good point, historically IBM has a swollen middle management rank ( second through fifth line management).Based on Ms Rometty's remarks in attacking her sales force after the 1st quarter disaster, I do see the layoffs in hardware and new acquisitions coming.

There are meaner and leaner companies who will succeed with cloud technologies where a behemoth like IBM cannot. The future and long-term flourishing of IBM lies not in just bolstering short-term next quarter earnings to dampen the voices of impatient vociferous shareholders interested only in short term positions and gains, but in some soul-searching by the corporate Board and Management of what IBM was, is, and should be. Cutting the wrong people such as R&amp;D staff who pioneer leading-edge nanotechnologies and the like, Ex-IBM-ers walk away with generous severances and then go join the competition, which then benefits from the innovative technologies that should be IBM's future. IBM loses out once again, as do shareholders in the long term. True shareholder value lies not in diminishing the company for short-term (and hardly meaningful) gains, but in nurturing its future growth. Management which caves in to very short term fiscal interests and fails to see the long term perspective is not protecting ongoing shareholder value or long-term corporate fiduciary interests, while concomitantly protecting their own contracts and bonuses in the short term. True fiduciary responsibility of Directors and Officers should extend to creating the long-term health of a corporation, not just putting it on life-support temporarily to appease a vociferous few.</Msg><Username>medchemlead</Username><Timestamp>1374003287246</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 15:34:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374007253947-17</Id><Topic><Title>800,000 DOD veterans and ther families need your support, Move to cash take your profits show Wall Street and Congress that it was wrong</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1373900907648</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 11:08:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yep I am just a dumb old hick</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1374007253947</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 16:40:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>13</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374008623122-18</Id><Topic><Title>Layoffs vs ???</Title><Username>bob787m</Username><Timestamp>1373893691868</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 09:08:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I have no idea what you are talking about. IBM consistently spends $6b a year on R&amp;D and consistently records the most patents a year - every year since I can remember. IBM needs to innovate and constantly be a driver of change like it has done with Watson, Smarter Planet, Big Data, Analytics, Cloud and so on. IBM must also change to adopt new technologies developed by others and meet the needs of its customers. You paint IBM as a has been when its one of the most innovative companies on the planet. Ginny has been a driver of change since she pushed for the acquisition of PWC and then led its integration and ran IBM sales worldwide.</Msg><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1374008623122</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 17:03:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374021524373-19</Id><Topic><Title>IBM will publish really ugly results!!!</Title><Username>magiv_hegyoni</Username><Timestamp>1373998588174</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 14:16:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>i never short I buy some put before earning I know what I will lose if I do but my feeling is that governments cut and USA Europe latin america will effect IBM results</Msg><Username>magiv_hegyoni</Username><Timestamp>1374021524373</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 20:38:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374027090185-20</Id><Topic><Title>IBM will publish really ugly results!!!</Title><Username>magiv_hegyoni</Username><Timestamp>1373998588174</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 14:16:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>magiv.....magiv........ please get a hold of yourself.....
