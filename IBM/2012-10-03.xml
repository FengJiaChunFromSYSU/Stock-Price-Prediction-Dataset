That is a nice track record for Big Blue. In 2010, IBM generated $11.67 in earnings. In 2011, IBM generated $13.44 in earnings, and that is a 15% YOY earnings growth. IBM has guided the street to about $15.10 for fiscal 2012. However, the 15% earnings growth which they achieved last year, would mean IBM reports earnings of $15.45 for this fiscal year. If you look at their road map it is quite possible they reach this number." IBM's Op EPS YTD does point to somewhere in the up 14% - 15% range. The first half this year was a tuff compare 1H of 2011 because Op EPS in Q1/11 was up 21% YOY and Q2/11 was up 18%. This year Q1/12 was up 15% and Q2/12 was up 14%. But Free Cash Flow jumped 1H/12 to $5.6 bil from $4.17 bil or up 25% -- I believe IBM had a big IRS payment in Q1/11 for prior year's taxes. Also, in 1H this year, I believe in Q1, IBM took a big separation expense accrual which was offset by a tax credit. I believe the CFO said that IBM would see 2H expense benefit from the 1H separation accrual -- which I believe jibes with the CFO's forecast that 2012 looked like 2H would be a greater % increase over 1H/12. So it looks like a 14% - 15% run rate or $15.32 - $15.46 -- if IBM's Q4 comes in better than Q4/11 which was up 11% vs up 15% for GAAP EPS for Q4/10. So -- if Pure Systems, the new Z mainframe and the to be announced shortly so-called "Project Sparta" big data analytics approach are enough to drive Q3 &amp; especially Q4 we should see the $15.45. It does look like IBM's revenue growth and ORCL's revenue growth are starting to converge as IBM increases the software component and ORCL sheds commodity server operations and moves to big data appliances just like IBM. They have both crushed HPQ -- except IBM didn't have its mole running HPQ as Larry did.</Msg><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1349265396044</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 07:56:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349277906251-3</Id><Title>IBD Buy Point $208.09</Title><Msg>After breaking out Monday, IBM (IBM) remains in a buy zone. The stock cleared a 208.09 buy point in volume 61% above average. The ceiling of the 5% buy zone is 218.49. By simple logic, this shouldn't be happening. Revenue growth was flat in Q1 and dropped 3% in Q2. Europe is the problem. IBM's revenue fell about 15% in France, 12% in Italy, 8.5% in Spain and 11% in Germany in the second quarter. Currency translation was responsible for big chunks of the revenue declines, and Europe's problems don't appear to be fading. So, why does the market like IBM? On Monday, Deutsche Bank affirmed its buy rating on IBM and raised its price target from 225 to 240. The bank sees accelerating hardware growth short term. And favorable product cycles in services and software are expected to drive growth over many quarters. The opinions of analysts, however, aren't nearly as important as the buying and selling by funds. While funds lightened their IBM holdings in Q2 by about 1%, some highly respected funds were aggressively adding to their positions. Fidelity Contrafund increased its IBM stake 11% in Q2 after a 22% boost in Q1. Magellan Fund opened a new position in Q1 and upped its holdings 63% in Q2. While IBM's revenue has taken a hit because of currency, earnings are holding up well. Annual EPS grew 13% in 2009, then 17% and 15%. The Street expects 13% growth this year. IBM has a history of beating EPS estimates. Big Blue has topped the Street's consensus estimate every quarter for the past seven years. The company will report after the close Oct. 16. Analysts expect earnings to grow 10% on another 3% drop in revenue. Margin expansion has helped IBM deliver earnings gains. Pretax margin has almost doubled since 2003 — rising from 10.6% in 2003 to 20.2% last year. Also, revenue growth is strong in certain areas of the world. The BRIC countries — Brazil, Russia, India and China — combined for 12% growth in Q2. IBM's dividend yield is 1.6%. The quarterly payout has more than doubled since early 2008.</Msg><Username>qofaslave69</Username><Timestamp>1349277906251</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 11:25:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349281932605-4</Id><Title>Thank you, fellow traders!</Title><Msg>Nice, and thank you.

I think the range was $20 - $24, and IBM specified the lower end target thinking it was conservative. Things happen though and I personally don't agree with some of the estimates, and thus I personally think higher than $22 a share in 2015 is not going to happen, but I do expect $20 - $22 to be made in 2015.</Msg><Username>cubicalcage</Username><Timestamp>1349310022106</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 20:20:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message></Date>
