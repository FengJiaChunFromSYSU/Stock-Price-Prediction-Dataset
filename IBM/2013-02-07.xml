I was stressed out after earnings watching IBM walk away from me -- again. The worst mistake I've made with IBM was selling prior to Q2 2009 earnings at $100 on a Goldman Sachs downgrade and watching it quickly go to $115 before I got back in. I have added a little T &amp; VZ. Europe looks week. Auto sales in Europe are falling back to 2008 - 2009 levels. It's expensive to live in Western Europe. Young people strive for a smart-phone and rent cars or just ride bikes. The EU economies outside of Germany are slow. France is going to be a drag on Western Europe. So I added to T &amp; VZ because they are US revenue based and smart-phones are becoming ubiquitous here as well. Lurking and waiting to get back in BIG Blue as my biggest position -- because short term cash rates are mighty small. But as long as I was scared out because of slowing world GDP. The emerging market countries need demand from the EU, Asia and the US to keep their economies humming. So at this point I'm waiting for a market slide.

What makes IBM great is their world class staff, but more importantly their business partners. Because of their involvement with IMI[Intermolecular], I honestly think that IBM is headed for groundbreaking technolgies in the 10nanometer chips and beyond. Oh yeah, if you care how IBM is going to do, IMI reports earnings at 1:30pm Pacific Standard Time today 2/7/13. Just see how they do and you will know how IBM will do with their new technologies.</Msg><Username>lloydbraun1</Username><Timestamp>1360269407943</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-07 15:36:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360270503976-4</Id><Title>CVU - Ready to Rally!</Title><Msg>Breakout!</Msg><Username>weinstein_s</Username><Timestamp>1360270503976</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-07 15:55:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360276641677-5</Id><Title>will see 200 soon</Title><Msg>IBM will see 200 very soon.
