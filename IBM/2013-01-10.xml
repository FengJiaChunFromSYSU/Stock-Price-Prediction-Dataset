The only thing Mr. Obama is willing to do when it comes to people and companies who have the financial wherewithal to build businesses and employ americans is to tax the cr@p out of them. Our corporate tax rate tops out higher than any industrialized country on earth. Our top individual tax rate (now 39.6% under Obama) now exceeds every developed country on earth outside of Europe. Obama said we should have a "balanced" approach... so, right after he got his tax hikes with no spending cuts on january 2nd, he got behind the microphone and said that now we need to consider MORE tax revenues. The biggest problem of all is that Obama's biggest supporters like him because they saw him on TV with Justin Bieber. Intelligent Americans and those who pay taxes are marginalized and increasingly have insufficient voting power to derail the onslaught of socialism under Obama... ... man-on-the-street interviewers of Obama supporters who ask those supporters why they like Obama usually get responses that literally take your breath away.
