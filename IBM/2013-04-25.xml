What the Hell does that even mean.Also being that 95% of large corporations have downsized their work force by as much as 60% leaving remaining employees to do twice the work for the same pay. So Perhaps the CEO should Act Faster in her Quest to keep this Dinosaur Profitable. Naaahhh it`s far easier to pass the buck and blame it on the Employees.</Msg><Username>cindy_henning</Username><Timestamp>1366891477525</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-25 08:04:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366892888401-3</Id><Topic><Title>IBM CEO is in panic mode yells st employees to move faster.

Post about the stock instead. And, "Also being that 95% of large corporations have downsized their work force by as much as 60% leaving remaining employees to do twice the work for the same pay." is a really silly thing to type. Please take more time and improve your offerings.
