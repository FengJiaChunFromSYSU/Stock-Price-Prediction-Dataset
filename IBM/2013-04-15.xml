They earned $2.78 Operating EPS for Q1 2012 and the composite analyst estimate on Yahoo for Q1 2013 is $3.05 or up 9.7%. I think that's low and it could be more like $3.14 or up 13%. Were you thinking of Q2? That one should be in the $4 range.</Msg><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1366032684268</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 09:31:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366038182621-3</Id><Title>Market today --- buy-the-dip</Title><Msg>This Gold confused everybody today Gold rush is over no need for protection any more</Msg><Username>jgiled</Username><Timestamp>1366038182621</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 11:03:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366039966615-4</Id><Topic><Title>Market today --- buy-the-dip</Title><Username>jgiled</Username><Timestamp>1366038182621</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 11:03:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That makes a lot of sense. Cypress is a basket case but it seemed to be absorbed by the money from the IMF &amp; ECB. Slower monthly employment reports will be OK as long as there isn't a string of weak reports. The wild-card is if the US economy stumbles under the Sequester, Obama Care and the possibility of the Fed easing back on purchases to inject cash in banks. I didn't like the weak mortgage lending of a couple of big banks. IBM is back to being named the tech bellwether again. That's probably because DELL, HPQ and ORCL have converged on IBM's model. But none have built IBM's base that produces about 75% of annual revenue from backlog existing at the beginning of the year. Let's hope IBM continues to see margin improvement and strong software revenue.</Msg><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1366039966615</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 11:32:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366050274588-5</Id><Title>p1sorell replaced by spcrash.</Title><Msg>Gag me.

Big Blue is doing better than the DOW so far. We'll see how the market looks into the close. I believe Buffett has been adding about 1 mil shares per Q. So IBM is buying about 1 of 20 shares traded. Buffett no doubt has staff overseeing IBM accumulation along guidelines approved by Buffett. He seems to be using IBM's buyback % as a guideline for adding to his own position which went up around 5% in 2012. You have to expect other long term funds to take the lead from Buffett. It's nice to have the improving IBM accumulation cushion for sell offs.</Msg><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1366053884850</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 15:24:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366057159767-7</Id><Topic><Title>SP 500 next 1540 or 1448</Title><Username>spcrash</Username><Timestamp>1366053556119</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 15:19:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The hard way?
