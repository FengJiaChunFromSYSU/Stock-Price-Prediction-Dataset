If the House Republicans voted for a tax increase they will lose credibility -- many of them won election by saying they would fight higher taxation because more taxes would not be good for the economy. Obama &amp; Democrats would like nothing better than to drive a wedge thru House Republicans and isolate the Tea Party Republicans thru votes in the house on a retroactive bill to undo part of the Sequester cuts. As to the Fed -- it has not "bernake with trillions of cash gone to spending" whatever that means. The Fed has injected reserves in the banking system and used financial repression techniques -- the Fed does not "spend" money like the Federal Gov't does. I'm standing by ready to buy Big Blue back. But I sold it in mid-October because of a clear shift downward of world manufacturing demand as seen from reports from DuPont, DOW, 3M, etc including IBM. As to the US, the av increase in consumer demand in the last 19 Q's from Q1 2008 to Q3 2012 has been .7% -- that's with the Fed injecting cheap money into banks and a lot of spending by the Obama admin. The average quarterly increase in consumer spending for the 10 year period 1998 - 2007 was an average 3.6% growth per Q. In the US there is a new normal. It's consumer spending which is about 70% of the US economy and Obama-care that will probably slow down hiring next year in the US.</Msg><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1353326846991</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 07:07:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353338413637-3</Id><Topic><Title>Moment Of Truth</Title><Username>p1sorell</Username><Timestamp>1353010003702</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 15:06:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So it was written</Msg><Username>p1sorell</Username><Timestamp>1353338413637</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 10:20:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353338748051-4</Id><Title>SUCKER RALLY!!!!!!!!</Title><Msg>Looks like these bozos are looking for carbon taxes again.
