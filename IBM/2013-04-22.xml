This kind of drops are inevitable over long term. But what IBM dose with its income determines the value to shareholders over long term. It is clear that IBM prefers to spend large part of it's income in share buybacks. The effectiveness of share buybacks in returning value to share holders is at best suspect. At the surface it looks simple less shares improves PE and thus share price. IBM's over zealously in insisting only effective way to return value to share holders is through buybacks should be alarming to stockholders.When IBM pours profits to buyback coffer, significant part of it pours out through holes. The truth is part of earrings goes to offset shares issued to IBM executives. As long as this is reasonable amount and there is transparency, this is justified, but there is no clarity in this issue. IBM earnings are irrelevant when there is no clarity in how much of it returns to stockholders.

Without knowing your specifics, it's hard to advise. Have you owned it longer than a year? Short term tax gains are a big drag on profits. Buying high and selling low is never a smart thing to do. Ask yourself why you bought the stock in the first place and if the reason is still there. Are you in accumulation mode or are you retired? What's your time horizon? Is the stock in a taxable account or tax deferred? Do you trade within a Roth IRA it's the best legal tax dodge there is. In the long run you want to end up in the 0% tax bracket. What percentage does this holding represent in your overall portfolio? Many experts believe that you shouldn't have more than 10% in any one holding. I don't have any holding representing more than 6% of my portfolio. Know your risk tolerance and don't react to day to day ups and downs of the market. It always has and always will go up and down. Don't pay attention to what happens in a, week, quarter or year, it's insignificant. Don't worry about the yield percentage; it's meaningless, many great companies pay no dividend. The yield may seem low to the uneducated, but it's only due to the phenomenal growth for the past 20 years. It can have a psychological effect though for the weak minded. People who bought at the low of 1993 at 10.50, have seen the stock split twice giving them a split adjusted price of $2.65, which a $3.40 dividend yields 128%. Good for them, you can only hope that you're able to stick to your IPS and build enormous wealth over time too. Trading in and out of stocks is a losers errand. Most of all don't listen to the noise!!! When you encounter trolls make sure to ignore them quickly, since they just bring noise, uninformed bigoted opinions and junk. The boards cleans up nicely too; 50% of the threads automatically disappear from the top. Time to sell??

IBM earnings are irrelevant when there is no clarity in how much of it returns to stockholders. We can no longer afford the share buyback fiasco" Don't agree. l Look at buybacks as a perpetual investment akin to buying a debenture without a maturity date as it's not a one time outflow like a dividend payment. You buy back shares based on current cash flow per share -- Operating cash Flow or Free Cash Flow which in IBM's case is approximated by Operating EPS per share which is pretty much cash flow per share after tax. So that's a measure of current return but the future annual return on purchased shares depends on growth of Total corporate cash flows each successive year which serves as the numerator for per share computations.. Take for example the $18.8 bil spent on shares in 2007 bought in at just under $106. If you use the $16.70 Operating EPS boggy then at $16.70 / $188 yields about a 9% return at current market -- the shares bought in at $106 yield 15.8% this year. It is a tad amorphous in that you can't count old shares but turn it around and look at it from the prospective of an individual investor and measure the value of shares he bought in 2007 for $106 -- there's cap gain and a current 3.2% cash yield on cost.</Msg><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1366658800651</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-22 15:26:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366659230574-26</Id><Title>Cody's take on Apple's earnings (agrees the bar is set very low)</Title><Msg>...Stocks: Apple, Amazon, Netflix earnings on tap — Big earnings reports ahead.

But my point is If IBM spends $2000 in share purchase at ($200 per share) then total number of outstanding shares should decrease by 10. This is not the case and IBM shares decreases only by 7 shares and 3 shares goes to offset the shares issued to senior IBM executives. There is just no transparency on how much of the earrings is funneled to executive share program. The point I am making is how effectively income is returned to stockholders.</Msg><Username>think2ski</Username><Timestamp>1366683590482</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-22 22:19:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366685012878-52</Id><Topic><Title>IBM Earnings Into Balckhole</Title><Username>think2ski</Username><Timestamp>1366648826200</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-22 12:40:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I appreciate your point. IBM does issue a lot of options but as Buffett pointed out on CNBC when he announced his investment, the outstanding option count is much lower today than it was back in the early 2000's when it was run by Gerstner. There were probably a lot of options issued back then because of IBM's mid-90's near death experience. Two key aspects of IBM's buybacks vs new shares from employee options: 1. In general, IBM issues options at 110% of market while most firms do so at market 2. If you compare the stated amount used to buy shares, like the $12 bil listed for 2012 in the Q4 report, to IBM's cash flow statement which has a separate line item for share buybacks you can see the return of cash to IBM from option exercise. So for 2012 IBM spent a gross $12 bil but IBM also received about $1.5 bil from option exercise so the net invested in buybacks was about $10.5 bil. If you take into consideration the extra option shares you also have to consider the cash benefit of the exercise price to IBM. The 10 - 3 = 7 share count example is close -- when I've checked it's closer to 10 - 2.5 = 7.5. The share count is published but you have to look for the cash return for the new shares in the cash flow statement.</Msg><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1366685012878</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-22 22:43:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
