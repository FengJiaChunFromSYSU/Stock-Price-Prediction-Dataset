Why?</Title><Msg>It figures that a day after I take a small position with 15000 shares it drops more. Time to really start buying again. Double down today just a minute ago. If it drops after the first of the year I will have to go in heavy and really start buying. Good luck to all longs on this drop.</Msg><Username>accepted_fact</Username><Timestamp>1356370328852</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-24 12:32:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message></Date>
