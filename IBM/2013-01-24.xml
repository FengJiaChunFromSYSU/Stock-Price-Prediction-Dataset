They disrespect, insult, and degrade employees by resource actions (i.e. firings), unfair performance assessments (that are driven by financials and fake payouts vs. true employee performance) and regularly scheduled salary reductions. It's sad that this behavior is so short-sighted, holding up the fabricated financials and accounting tricks, and solely focused on the 2015 Road Kill (err, Road Map). Eventually that time will end. When all talent has left or been fired, and IBM truly stands for "Indians Badly Managed"... though the India folks are getting screwed royally too, which is why most leave within 1-2 years after getting pathetically trained, but more importantly, "IBM" can be listed on their resume. Here's a thought... happy employees will drive stockholder value... duh! Just wait and see how it all eventually works out.</Msg><Username>washsale</Username><Timestamp>1359073587795</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 19:26:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359074292755-20</Id><Topic><Title>Shouldn't IBM split again?</Title><Username>westonbayer</Username><Timestamp>1359050002704</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 12:53:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yes but the split this time will be ......... 4 4 1</Msg><Username>zer0t0l</Username><Timestamp>1359074292755</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 19:38:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359077969511-21</Id><Title>$195 target on short from $209................. next week</Title><Msg>Gotta close the gap.</Msg><Username>csaintswin</Username><Timestamp>1359077969511</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 20:39:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359080047782-22</Id><Topic><Title>The economy has fully recovered, I can't believe that Obama has saved the country from the Republican party.</Title><Username>krisstubberfield</Username><Timestamp>1359043461721</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 11:04:21 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>They went over $1 trillion after the economic crash that occurred near the end of the Bush/Pelosi/Reid era but they have STAYED over $1 trillion for the entire 4 years of the Obama 1st term when all we did was legislate new entitlements and submit no budgets out of the Reid Senate... all while running up $5 trillion of new debt. Since it's been so fashionable to blame a president's performance on the previous administration... lets stick with your process, Larry... the president before the current term of office was Barack Obama and it's historically the worst, post-recession recovery in American History... ... The worst. We have huge deficits, huge money printing... but we're only getting 2 to 3% GDP growth, a 50-year low in capital spending, and we are very close to the all-time record low rate of "labor participation" (the all-time record low occurred 4 months ago in September). We are a sick country and Obama's socialism is no more the answer than Castro's or Chavez's socialism were... both of whom were ardent supporters of Obama's re-election.</Msg><Username>bjspokanimal</Username><Timestamp>1359080047782</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 21:14:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
