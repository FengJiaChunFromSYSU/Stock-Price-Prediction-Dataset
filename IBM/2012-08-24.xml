Obama's tax-the-rich proposals would jump that to almost 45% by most calculations. The bottom 49% of Americans, in the aggregate, pay NO federal income tax... only FICA, which is an old-age "insurance" program. Many of the nation's "super rich" pay a lower tax rate... like Romney's 13.9%. There is a reason for that... ... Most of Romney's income comes from "qualified dividends", which are taxed at a maximum of 15%...Obama would like to raise that to 39%. Is that fair? No, and here's why: The rate was reduced to 15% because dividends are "double taxed" (no, democrats will NEVER mention that)... first at the corporate level at rates as much as 35%, then at the personal (Romney's) level at 15%... ... the total take is as much as 50%. "earned income", however, (what the rest of us working souls make) may often be taxed higher than 15%, but the companies that pay us DEDUCT that compensation, so it is only taxed ONCE. If you compare what Romney and his corporate payor pays to what somebody like Warren Buffett's secretary and her employer pays... ... IT IS A FAR HIGHER RATE! Obama is hoping that the mentality of the people who vote for him won't pick up on that... ... which is why he had Warren Buffett's secretary seated in the front row during the state of the union speech to claim that she was getting SHAFTED compared to Mitt Romney. Hope this helps.</Msg><Username>bjspokanimal</Username><Timestamp>1345822542000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 11:35:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345823550000-6</Id><Topic><Title>Excellent Read Long</Title><Username>staudtnwwn1731</Username><Timestamp>1345818269000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 10:24:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Am gonna subscribe now.</Msg><Username>smolinskitxun4955</Username><Timestamp>1345823550000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 11:52:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345824205000-7</Id><Title>The "Henry Ford" method to fix broken economies</Title><Msg>Henry Ford paid his employees more than he had to so they could buy Ford cars.

The bottom 49% of Americans, in the aggregate, pay NO federal income tax... only FICA, which is an old-age "insurance" program." Regarding "double taxing" of qualified dividends, do you feel that people who have enough money to invest should not be taxed on that income? By the way, not too many corporations pay a full 35% tax rate. Do some reading.

Your post is pure envy. You hate wealthy people so much that you like the way that Obama taxes the cr@p out of investment capital and gives it to his constituents to take down to WalMart to spend on Chinese stuff. Capitalism is what built the wealth of this country... ... and anti capitalists like Obama are trying to tax capital so badly that it either ends up in China via WalMart... ... or it flees overseas or into tax shelters. The #1 reason for Obama's 8.3% un-employment rate is because nobody will invest in jobs-producing industry. And the reason why nobody will invest in jobs-producing industry is because Obama's anti-capitalism sentiment is so dangerous to those that do. Obama is following the exammple of Venezuela's Hugo Chavez... a man who supports Obama's efforts against capitalism. Raul Castro, who currently rules Cuba is also an avid Obama supporter.
