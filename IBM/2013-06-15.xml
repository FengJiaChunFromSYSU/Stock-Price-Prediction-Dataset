Developers. Research staff. And they are not being placed elsewhere but simply forced OUT with 30 days notice while IBM is hiring in India, where wage are $4 an hour and IBM can charge clients $250 AN HOUR and make profit. So just saying PLACE THESE PEOPLE ELSEWHERE works only if it is the unemployment line. Or a job at Burger King. And most of them have families so I guess they are interested in working.

Now, with the possible of exception of super-Watson, the machine has gone out of IBM for the most part. Corporate policies over recent years have moved away from the machine core of the operations, and the remaining behemoth, endeavoring to become something else and re-invent itself wants to become what is not at its core and its klunky infrastructure will not allow it to be. There has been much wishful thinking, but barring a couple of good software company acquisitions under its belt, IBM's products and services are perceived as klunky and somewhat cumbersome to the user compared to the smoothness of its competitors' offerings. Even Amazon apparently delivered a better product to the CIA than .what IBM was able to offer up, and the national security priorities and interests must, of needs, require the more technically superior, and user-friendlier and more secure system to be deployed and employed. Let the better Cloud product that the CIA says serves national interests better prevail in the battle, and let IBM lick its wounds, change management direction (and/or the management itself) and go back to the drawing board with the learned lessons on what is lacking in its products. Attempting to strong-arm the Federal Government through influencing the GAO will likely only backfire, and the "Guido' style coercive tactics of IBM management will certainly not fly with the American public. National security is too important to allow a product perceived as inferior to be put in place just because the bully pulpit from IBM wants it so. IBM management needs some soul-searching to determine what the company was when it was widely successful, and what its priorities should now be in areas where it can still lead the pack rather than becoming a wannabe of other software developer corporations.</Msg><Username>medchemlead</Username><Timestamp>1371332137577</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 17:35:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371336411644-5</Id><Title>When the "I" got away from "IBM"</Title><Msg>Now they are just a turd. You think it's just a simple layoff? Well putting a target on the employees backs and forcing them to make up paid vacation time and achieving up to 40% overtime without a bonus? Pressure is the name of the game and as you get older you are culled at the time when you have years to go before retirement. As many of these employees were told last quarter to ramp up production, work round the clock and even full weekends to make the quarter's quotas and as many did only to receive pink slips from the latest "resource action".......... you have to be on drugs to think this is benign re-balancing. There was a time when IBM stood for individuals and loyalty to the many US employees who through their sweat made the company the success that the upper management brags about. Now they couldn't care less except to squeeze them of their blood and toss them off. Bowel Movement is the correct name for this soulless corporation.</Msg><Username>nyse_marketmaker</Username><Timestamp>1371336411644</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 18:46:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371343533361-6</Id><Topic><Title>Layoffs only mean they're reballancing.</Title><Username>zer0t0l</Username><Timestamp>1371177048549</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 22:30:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes, they've been laying of so long, it looks like they're perpetually balancing, to keep the deadweight drones in the top-heavy management around the hive's queen bee in a fixed ratio to the worker bee underlings</Msg><Username>medchemlead</Username><Timestamp>1371343533361</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 20:45:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371345283585-7</Id><Title>Business Insider Article- Laid Off IBM Employee Says The Company Is Blowing It By Cutting The Wrong People- Julie Bort</Title><Msg>Laid Off IBM Employee Says The Company Is Blowing It By Cutting The Wrong People Getting a job with IBM used to be the pinnacle of an IT career. Not so much today. IBM is trying to strategically reduce headcount, and laid off over 2,000 people in 2012. It also suffers from a corporate culture of cronyism that is costing IBM dearly, a former employee told BusinessInsider. Note that in its last quarter, IBM's big services business, responsible for 57 percent of revenue, reported $15 billion for the quarter and grew a negligible 1 percent. But its profit rose 11 percent. These cuts are affecting the company's business.Last month, Disney cancelled an IBM contract worth over $100 million annually.Texas booted IBM out of an $863 million, seven-year outsourcing contract. Last month, it awarded a $1 billion contract to IBM's competitors.The state of Indiana cancelled a 10-year $1 billion contract with IBM in 2009 and this year has been suing to IBM to get back the $437 million it had already paid.In recent years IBM has also lost other contracts, including one at the Department of Energy, the source told BusinessInsider.Poor project management is a big issue, the source says. IBM is routinely putting unqualified people into project management positions. "It's very hard to get promoted at IBM unless you know the right people," says the source. "People don't get promotions on merits or skills but on connections." For example, at Disney, IBM had "gone through five project managers and enormous staff transition" during its time there. IBM has laid off more than 1,800 workers in the U.S. and Canada, according to IBM employee watchdog group, AllianceAtIBM. Lee Conrad, national coordinator, says IBM seems to be specifically targeting older, or more experienced, higher paid workers and shipping jobs to cheaper labor overseas. This is part of IBM's stated mission to increase shareholder EPS to $20 by 2015 which it calls Roadmap 2015. Internally, employees call it "Road Kill".</Msg><Username>medchemlead</Username><Timestamp>1371345283585</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 21:14:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371345450164-8</Id><Title>Ginni bragged about using predicitive analytics to screw her own employees.</Title><Msg>She clearly stated in an interview that IBM saved $50M by withholding raises simply because IBMers would not leave because they don't get one. From Seeking Alpha interview. As we’ve worked on productivity, the rest of margins improved, right. You have a perfect example of two different views. One to cost, one to productivity and if I look at this two things that you would tell me typically people do by their gut, not analytically driven because I think that’s the secret about productivity and future is this idea of predictive analytics. And so it’s not just what I felt, but I believe. So as an example salary increases, typically the way most companies do salary increases maybe yours, there is some sort of budget for salary increase to beat up, given to different units, managers and make their decisions, who gets what kind of thing based on their market competitiveness. We have research work on predictive algorithms to predict people who might predict. They didn’t say they were going to leave and did say anything. They were top performers, predict who would be what it would take to make them not even think that way. We did it in one big country. We probably avoided $50 million of what would have maybe been a salary program we have to do there. That to me is pure productivity. That’s not cost cutting. To me is it sickening that IBM is using the very tools it's employees develop to screw them. What a slap in the face to the employees of IBM.</Msg><Username>louscashcow</Username><Timestamp>1371345450164</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 21:17:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371353759191-9</Id><Topic><Title>Layoffs only mean they're reballancing.</Title><Username>zer0t0l</Username><Timestamp>1371177048549</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 22:30:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you just don't get it do you. We here, invest in a company in order to make a profit on our somewhat risky investment. There are no guarantees. Yes we collect a dividend but the dividend is just about average. I NEED for the corporate leaders to make the correct decisions so that The IBM corp. can continue to make profits and increase the bottom line so that the stock price can increase in value and help keep me afloat so that I don't draw from the any of the available government (which YOU pay for), services. Someone or some people losing their job is not my problem or any one else's but maybe yours? I was a long term employee of IBM and lost my job. I'm still here. I'm still alive. I managed. I put food on the table. I paid my mortgage. No one owes anyone a living. Get with it. You have to be multi-faceted today to survive. Get trained in other things. Become a nurse. Mow a lawn. Paint a house. You're a laid off engineer? Sweat some pipes (plumbing for some of you spoiled brats).
