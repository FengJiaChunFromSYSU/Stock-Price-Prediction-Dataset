Atleast you agree that it will create a lot of jobs. I am all for it. if you think 3 pages will create 1000's of jobs, wonder how many the remaining 1997 would. You think doctors and people working in healthcare are poor. It has always been good policy to regulate businesses and create jobs, especially lucrative businesses. Wonder if there were no construction codes and building houses was regulation free. Remove those regulations and fire a couple million. Regulations create jobs. You will get it one way or another.</Msg><Username>pinkal1000</Username><Timestamp>1346946973738</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 11:56:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346957800640-4</Id><Topic><Title>OBAMA SAYING THE SAME OLD THING HE SAID IN 2008 .</Title><Username>usausa514</Username><Timestamp>1346760554599</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 08:09:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Some people never learn. If he is re elected the same losers will be complaining because they cannot get ahead and have not a clue why. They are angry and envious instead of being ambitious and energetic. Some things never change. Either way those who invest instead of save will come out ahead. The only difference will be those who need jobs will not have them if Obama wins.</Msg><Username>thruston</Username><Timestamp>1346957800640</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 14:56:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346962801665-5</Id><Title>CNBC Shills Confused why they can't get Retail Investors Money!!</Title><Msg>Vampires need Fresh Blood for the Crooked Stock Market!
