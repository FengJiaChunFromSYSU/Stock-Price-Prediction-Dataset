They no longer employ even 100,000 Americans. After today, based on published numbers that I will grant are by people other than IBM, it is probably much closer to 75,000. I would estimate that 35-50% of those are new hires at market rate salaries, not generous salaries. Those days left with Gerstner and will never return. If IBM adds value, they do it through their US employees too. It is not a one way street. Those US salaries are also a boost to the economy, you can not say that about the globally sourced employees from China, India and Mexico. Your assumption that Americans do not understand how a capitalistic country runs, is insulting. The idea that because you are an American employee you have to sit down, shut up and take everything they dish at you is absurd. It is not the way this country was founded, and it certainly it not how it has prospered and become the industrial leader of the world. Employees matter and they are the backbone of any corporation no matter where they reside. The American and European employees are treated the worst and are the most senior of the company. Most of the institutional knowledge resides in the US and Europe. I have no issue with expanding and hiring overseas, but I do have a problem with the blind cost cutting to reach the utopian $20 per share in 2015 at the US, European and Canadian employees expense.</Msg><Username>louscashcow</Username><Timestamp>1371063888309</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-12 15:04:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>14</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371068828361-12</Id><Topic><Title>IBM and layoffs</Title><Username>jand2357</Username><Timestamp>1370366399824</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 13:19:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No, they are far into the meat and bone of this beast now.</Msg><Username>hot_shorting_babe</Username><Timestamp>1371068828361</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-12 16:27:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371068867862-13</Id><Topic><Title>IBM and layoffs</Title><Username>jand2357</Username><Timestamp>1370366399824</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 13:19:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Try less than 90K.</Msg><Username>bab4jdb</Username><Timestamp>1371068867862</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-12 16:27:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371069258861-14</Id><Topic><Title>Why the valuation of Local Corp with lower than 40 million is one of the biggest jokes the Nasdaq had ever seen</Title><Username>flankenking</Username><Timestamp>1370326280247</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 02:11:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Extreme idiotic: Yelp has with 22,550,797 Monthly Unique Visitors only 80% of Local Corps 27,804,187 Monthly Unique Visitors, but Yelp has with 1,920 million the 50-fold market-cap of the idiotic low market-cap of Local Corp of only 38 million.</Msg><Username>flankenking</Username><Timestamp>1371069258861</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-12 16:34:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371069404861-15</Id><Title>Why would CIA want IBM cloud, why would anyone?</Title><Msg>IBM has no cloud experience.

Cutting out the middle management and support staff who do all the daily grunt work, while retaining the top cards, who don't really do things themselves, but just delegate, leads to chaos, the swift downhill slide of a corporation, and then its total collapse. That is what is happening here. The hope is that the remaining cards will be highly motivated, rapidly re-group, magically become efficient and build a new strong house from the ground up. The reality is that you need to play with a full deck, or at least the cards that matter. When the "good hand" cards are let go and the demoralized, inefficient dead weight heavyweights are retained, something's gotta give in a not so nice way, and usually does.</Msg><Username>medchemlead</Username><Timestamp>1371077718048</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-12 18:55:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>12</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371080649491-23</Id><Title>Heres the deal.</Title><Msg>Typical greed economics so prevalent on wall street. Started with the republicons. These unfit bassturds have leveraged the company to the point of having no tangible value. Just take a look at that balance sheet. But IBM is not alone. Most "wall street" earnings are being hyped by blue sky goodwill across the board. Another dandy example is Oracle. Many, many traded stocks have negative tangible net worth. Goodwill now exceeds 50% of reported net worth.</Msg><Username>bosshebee</Username><Timestamp>1371080649491</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-12 19:44:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
