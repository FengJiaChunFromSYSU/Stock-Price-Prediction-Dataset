Housing market certainly one barometer that economy is on the upswing. Now if knotheads in Washington would get their #$%$ together, IBM will take care of business like they have for a 100 years. You don't stick around that long without knowing what you're doing and generating a lot of cash. 229 and beyond.</Msg><Username>dino2hootie</Username><Timestamp>1358606178265</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 09:36:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358638101788-2</Id><Topic><Title>2 Things We All Know Obama Hates: "Colonialism"... and "Capitalism".</Title><Username>bjspokanimal</Username><Timestamp>1357675426366</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 15:03:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He hates America and what it stands for..Someday all the idiots that voted him in will be sorry..</Msg><Username>deltarich44</Username><Timestamp>1358638101788</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 18:28:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358638709275-3</Id><Topic><Title>2 Things We All Know Obama Hates: "Colonialism"... and "Capitalism".</Title><Username>bjspokanimal</Username><Timestamp>1357675426366</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 15:03:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If we separate the working folks/ tax payers and those getting handouts into a separate usa we would see who are the true americans &amp; the true bread winners. get a count of all his voters and see how many don't work but receive $$$ aid etc...

I've been checking to make sure the chart wasn't deceiving me, but the MFI/RSI is good on the up, the bottoms and tops are on an upward trend, we're now resting just $2 above the 50 day SMA with a flat 200 EMA to shoot through as well and the cyclic curve indicates upwards. If the CEO was good on her word concerning contracts, the revenue is going to be inbound to firm up resolve of investors. Infact, the upward trend indicates some of these investors know this already. I'm thinking close $197 Tuesday and 2.5% jump on a strong 4th quarter.</Msg><Username>kistilan</Username><Timestamp>1358643803075</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 20:03:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message></Date>
