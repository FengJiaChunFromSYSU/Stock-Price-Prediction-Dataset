The Congressional Budget Office projects that these massive, $Trillion-dollar deficits will continue under Obama's policies for another 4 years if he's re-elected. I contend that we don't HAVE 4 years to get it under control... and that Obama has no plan to do it except by raising $80 billion by taxing the wealthy and sending their investment dollars scurrying offshore and into tax shelters. That $80 billion covers just 1/15 of the annual deficits... Paul Ryan's plan and the Simpson-Bowles plan cover many, many, many times Obama's daily tax-the-rich speeches. Over the past 100 years, we've seen many politicians in many countries that hammered home a hatred for the rich... ... we really need to consider how those countries fared in the wake of their success in punishing the rich... ... Castro, Marx, Mao, Chavez... histroy is replete with leaders that took a similar path and watched badly needed investment capital flee their countries as it is fleeing America and diving into tax shelters today. The only way November will turn out well is if we stop voting for the largess the government heaps onto us... ... and start voting for ours and our Children's future in an America that doesn't end up like Greece.</Msg><Username>bjspokanimal</Username><Timestamp>1345661714000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 14:55:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345663057000-7</Id><Topic><Title>High Un-employment, No Growth, Massive Deficits...</Title><Username>bjspokanimal</Username><Timestamp>1345661714000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 14:55:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>R U rich?</Msg><Username>alreadyhaveauser</Username><Timestamp>1345663057000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 15:17:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345664245000-8</Id><Title>Today's Advice</Title><Msg>Don't gamble; take all your savings and buy some good stock and hold it till it goes up, then sell it.

American investment capital holed up in Singapore doesn't help joe six-pack get a job in Topeka Kansas. If corporations and wealthy americans were applying their capital here instead of sitting on it out of fear of Obama's promises to punish them, we wouldn't be looking at 8.3% unemployment. If Obama weren't spending on government programs like a drunken sailor, we wouldn't be looking at $1.2 Trillion federal deficits. This is lunacy... the last 4 years make another 4 years of Obama look scary as H**l to me!</Msg><Username>bjspokanimal</Username><Timestamp>1345672534000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 17:55:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345678563000-12</Id><Topic><Title>News came out for International Business Machines Corporation</Title><Username>evelynncalo</Username><Timestamp>1345649202000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 11:26:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So how much you lose in that last negative position you took on IBM??

You come on this board with FUD of current administration, and do not provide information on previous or future GOP administrations. The GOP has not been friendly to our GDP or stock market. Do not get me wrong, as Obama has not fulfilled many of his promises.
