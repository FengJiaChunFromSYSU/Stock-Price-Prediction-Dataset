Romney/Ryan are not about taxing the poor and reducing taxes on the so called 1%. If you cut off the head, the body dies. If you demonize the people who have taken chances and have improved their lot in life you: 1) give them an incentive to leave (look at France); 2) tell those who have not taken chances as of yet that is issn't worth it because the government will just take it and redistribute it. This country was founded on providing opportunities (not handouts) to its citizens. There is a BIG difference between helping others by teaching them to fish and it is quite another to fish for them and hand it to them. The first supports ambition while the second promotes welfare states (or socialism). the second is used to buy votes and promotes laziness. America, you are better than this..........vote out the present administration..........they have failed and will never admit it. We need substance not oratory.</Msg><Username>BYMYNUMBERS</Username><Timestamp>1344859385000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 08:03:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344863754000-4</Id><Topic><Title>I'm Worried about Paul Ryan</Title><Username>bjspokanimal</Username><Timestamp>1344816815000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 20:13:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Republicans are crying and trying to pass a law that would eliminate the 5% DoD cuts.

The "fiscal cliff" contains cuts that are half from the defense department and half from domestic spending... ... even though domestic spending, in the aggregate, dwarfs defense spending in the budget.

Clearly, Ryan's house of representatives have proposed more, done more, and compromised more, over the past year than Obama or Reid's senate has.
