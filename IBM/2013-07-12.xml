That's what Corporate Communications' department staff is paid to do, isnt it?" Yahoo should have a jr and senior level stock message board.

IBM put's its plants in remote places just exactly so it is difficult to move to a better job. That way they can pay below standard rates and dump on the employees at will. It's a heck of a lot easier to sell some stock than it is to pull your kids out of school, get your wife to quit her job, sell your house , leave your friends and move thousands of miles on your own nickel.</Msg><Username>e_is_ir</Username><Timestamp>1373663087824</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 17:04:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373668063915-5</Id><Topic><Title>Stop Whining...

It is a great and iconic company with a proven history of seminal computer science. I remain confident that over the long term, IBM will not only adapt and adjust to emerging trends, but also define &amp; drive them. Cloud computing is but one area that comes to mind. However, the main threat over the long term is the employee issue. IBM has a problem with internal culture. It's not enough to pay a decent salary. IBM needs to focus on the total happiness index. It's worth the investment to buy employees coffee, food, throw parties, and morale building off-site events. Stop nickel &amp; diming employees with gimmicks like paying matching 401k once a year. The fact is, Silicon Valley competitors "lavish" their employees. Google, Apple, Microsoft, Twitter, SalesForce, and SAP all have significant Bay Area presence with cutting edge culture. This increasingly attracts the best &amp; brightest, especially the youngest, which is important in rounding out product features &amp; functionality. Remember, IBM is competing against these companies. Don't get me wrong. IBM spends $6 billion annually on R&amp;D. It is a vast organization. It has lots of superb talent. But it really needs a cultural makeover. It needs to win the hearts &amp; minds of the entire workforce. If it doesn't, long term problems will emerge &amp; indeed threaten the viability of a great American company that is now a great global company. Fingers crossed. We'll see short term volatility, but I think IBM will get it right long term.</Msg><Username>banmate7</Username><Timestamp>1373672884049</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 19:48:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373673045152-8</Id><Title>Cramer</Title><Msg>Technology also will command Cramer's attention with earnings from IBM. "The only thing I can say that will make this quarter less problematic is that nobody's expecting much from it. And although IBM delivered a shortfall last quarter I don't think that will be repeated," Cramer said. Now that is scary. I'm successful doing the opposite of this guy but I'm giving him one more chance to redeem himself.</Msg><Username>zer0t0l</Username><Timestamp>1373673045152</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 19:50:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373673293832-9</Id><Topic><Title>IBM Survey</Title><Username>flatsflyer</Username><Timestamp>1373563515111</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 13:25:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>She stopped by my desk and crawled under, I declined.

Revenue per employee at places like Google is 5X greater than IBM. Compaq had that problem. A young dedicated workforce. parties all the time. Product announcements with popular rock bands. Indoor fireworks. First class air travel for all flights over 3 hours. Refrigerators stocked with snacks and free coke machines everywhere. Then when margins tightened everything collapsed. Fee soft drinks alone for 10,000 employees cost $10million annually. IBM has 50X as many employees. They just don't have $500million extra lying around for free soft drinks. And that's just one tiny little example. I realize Google has playgrounds and lounges and all that Silicon Valley stuff. Employees come to work barefooted in shorts and they ride skateboards around the halls. But trust me - it always ends eventually. IBM just does not have the latitude to waste that kind of money.</Msg><Username>jand2357</Username><Timestamp>1373678700370</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 21:25:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
