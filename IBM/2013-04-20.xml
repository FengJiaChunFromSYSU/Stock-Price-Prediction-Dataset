So with PE=13, why is the stock worth any more than the level back then (around $90)? And that view is optimistic because the world economy was not in a complete reset in 2004 with Japan doubling their monetary base and European countries nearing default on catastrophic amounts of debt. Do you really believe GR's statement that they just need to close a couple of open mainframe and software deals? How are they going to deal with an employee base of 467K with fully burdened cost per employee above $100K? That's nearly $50 billion of headcount expense. And most of that expense comes from acquired employees in new companies that they can't really afford to lose right now.

Dividend Investing: A Value Tilt in Disguise?, by Gregg S. Fisher, Journal of Financial Planning, April 2013 READ IT! In seeking to better understand the outperformance of high-dividend-yielding stocks relative to the broader equity market, this paper dissects their return patterns and examines returns over a period of more than 30 years through the lens of risk factors. Results suggest that it was actually the value factor that is inherent in most high-dividend-yielding stocks that was responsible for the outperformance of these stocks over the period studied. The yield factor associated with high-dividend-yielding stocks actually DETRACTED from performance. A takeaway for advisers and investors is that if outperforming the broader market on a medium- to long-term basis is a main objective, applying a value tilt to a portfolio is generally a better strategy than overweighting high-dividend-yielding stocks. If you REALLY believe that it just goes up or down a few bucks, then come on over and let me show you my statements from where I bought at a split adjusted price of $6 in '84, then we'll see who LOL's - LOL!!</Msg><Username>gamalataki</Username><Timestamp>1366481642305</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-20 14:14:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366483198212-23</Id><Topic><Title>RSI, technical analysis indicator looks good!!!</Title><Username>chance_pocketwatch</Username><Timestamp>1366480753659</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-20 13:59:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>1.6%? - Your math skills are not very good.

If you are not a “doubting Thomas”, then you can have that true information you need to make money online – investing just $10 and making %50 - $250 daily into your LIBERTY R. ACCOUNT. REMEMBER: Quitters never win and winners never quit. This investment is what is known as LIBERTY RES. INVESTMENT. Before you continue, I will suggest that you HIGHLIGHT and SAVE this entire post in word or Notepad on your computer so you can come back to it later and read through the program very well so that you understand the way the system works. In my own explanation this is a Liberty Reserve system that yields the members money through compounding process. This is true. With just $10 you will be making unlimited cash into your Liberty Reserve Account (LRA). This is a true and legitimate means to earn a living online. Know this: this investment was also reviewed by DATELINE, 20/20, AND OPRAH WINFREY and clarified in her show, or you may have read about it in the Wall Street Journal, the internet or from friends. If not, then count yourself fortunate, as you will clearly know and use it to change your level. It is below revealed to you in step-by-step detail. This investment pattern had been before , but was with PayPal. But due to PayPal restriction for some countries to get an account with PayPal, Liberty Reserve is been used as it is SAFE and SECURE as PayPal, but without restriction. This is not a secret anymore as many people have been exposed and have taken a chance with this investment and have never regretted it. Don’t get bored here. I am straightaway giving you the knowledge that will set you free from that financial tightness, you have now found that means to offset that debt and live well earning money online.
