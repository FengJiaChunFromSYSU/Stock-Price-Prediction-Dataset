I respond with the same answer over and over again. It won't happen. With that said, I do agree that if Dividend splits start to occur again with other companies for whatever "emotional reason", that the post below does have merit. If IBM meets its 2015 earnings of at least $20 a share, then possibly at that time (2016) a Dividend split might occur.</Msg><Username>cubicalcage</Username><Timestamp>1366808790891</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 09:06:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366809096188-9</Id><Title>Last Tuesday in April</Title><Msg>.....that is when they announce the dividend increase for the next year.

They can easily afford it - they are only paying out about 20percent of earnings." IBM has shown that they don't intend to go over 25% on an initial ttm ratio of divvy / EPS. My hope is that they ease into 25% as a cap on ttm Operating EPS. But the key is that they don't seem to want to risk going to 25% so it's probably more like 23%. If they take it up $.40 to $3.80 or up $.45 to $3.85 that is about 23% of $16.70. So my guess is $3.85 max.</Msg><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1366816673932</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 11:17:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366821715176-12</Id><Title>IBM is the Tech Acquirer of Choice</Title><Msg>Since HPQ and DELL are both struggling. Even if it's a cash offer to buy the start-up, the future of the technology you are selling in your company may also be very important to you. If IBM buys your company on the basis of integrating the technology it means future jobs for the start up entrepreneurs and the staff that got them there. If a start-up has a chance to sell to or sell through IBM, or get to look at a purchase offer that includes future plans for the technology and staff they may take it because IBM is the safer bet. DELL or HPQ could see big corporate disruptions in the near term like parts sold off at fire sale prices so for senior start-up staff who stay employed with the acquiring company you have to wonder about future stock options you might receive as an employee of HPQ, DELL or IBM.</Msg><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1366821715176</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 12:41:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366831222636-13</Id><Topic><Title>Big Tech Is Struggling With Old Age.

IBM used to form small technical groups and let them tackle big problems on their own, and those are wildly successful and the perfect thing to attract young talent. I was lucky enough to be part of those teams twice and the work morale and rewards were fantastic. IBM could do this and shed even more salary currently going to the people who do nothing but push papers and talk big.</Msg><Username>nozupforyou</Username><Timestamp>1366831222636</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 15:20:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366831423103-14</Id><Topic><Title>Last Tuesday in April</Title><Username>margin321</Username><Timestamp>1366809096188</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 09:11:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Agreed, $3.80 is probably where it will end up.
