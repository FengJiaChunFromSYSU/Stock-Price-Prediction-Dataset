I sure wouldn't buy at the current price. Moody's recently announced that they were going to start to downgrade municipal bonds from states and municipalities that are not funding their retirement liabilities on a pay as you go basis. It will be interesting to see what happens if those cities and counties start to show a much bigger % of local taxes going for retirement -- some could be 15% or higher. If that happens there will be a lot of pressure to collect local taxes from AMZN and other internet retailers. Walmart and other brick &amp; mortar retailers are lobbying hard for it. That's a big threat to AMZN's growth rate.</Msg><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1373461368197</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-10 09:02:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373469837913-4</Id><Title>(GLBH) looks prime for a huge breakout</Title><Msg>(GLBH) looks perfect at these levels.

Ginni said at the recent Beirnstein conference that the way IBM entered cloud was to first work on private clouds for customers and then develop capacities for hybrid clouds with private and public elements. She pointed out that the majority of IBM's clients would want a private cloud for security. Apparently future exchanges will allow for the purchase of public cloud services on a spot basis. So the critics who said IBM was behind the curve are going to realize that public cloud services will be a commodity with thin margins. Some high flying cloud providers like Rackspace maybe Salesforce are going to see increasing margin pressure.</Msg><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1373473800145</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-10 12:30:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373474522049-6</Id><Topic><Title>Why Should Anyone Trust Goldman?</Title><Username>nozupforyou</Username><Timestamp>1373383047039</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 11:17:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No one should really trust that Goldman has their best interests at heart.
