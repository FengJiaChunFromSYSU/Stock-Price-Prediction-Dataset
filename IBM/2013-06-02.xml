In fact, Sam Palmisano was Aker's Executive Assistant and had to break the news to him that they wouldn't be able to make the next payroll. Putting together the loans to hold the company together long enough to layoff 250,000 people was immensely difficult. They sold real estate, shut down manufacturing facilities, fired half the company, took out huge loans, and the stock fell from $95 to $45 almost overnight. They even reset executive options with new strikes. Had Gerstner walked away, the company would have simply gone bankrupt and all your stock would have been worth precisely $0. The next time that happens you might not be so lucky. And the trigger might have nothing at all to do with IBM's business. A word to the wise.</Msg><Username>jand2357</Username><Timestamp>1370224061391</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-02 21:47:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370227916441-3</Id><Topic><Title>Bought at $10.00</Title><Username>zer0t0l</Username><Timestamp>1369971489413</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 23:38:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>that is all so true.
