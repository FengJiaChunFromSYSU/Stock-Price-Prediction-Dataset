I'm Blue all over. VZ is my #3. I wonder if VZ will pair up with other providers. I question whether ORCL will wind up with an exclusive arrangement with VZ. IBM's relationship with T goes back a long way thru mutual asset and business unit sales to each other, as well as former IBM exe's running T &amp; predecessors.</Msg><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1349789769230</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 09:36:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349789933453-5</Id><Topic><Title>Split ahead....</Title><Username>eingios</Username><Timestamp>1349529549873</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 09:19:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I like itl. good time for split</Msg><Username>jrryjane</Username><Timestamp>1349789933453</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 09:38:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349790241643-6</Id><Title>Stay with the best</Title><Msg>IBM is one of them COST is second also like GS and JPM</Msg><Username>jgiled</Username><Timestamp>1349790241643</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 09:44:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349790510593-7</Id><Topic><Title>Split ahead....</Title><Username>eingios</Username><Timestamp>1349529549873</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 09:19:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Citigroup begins Buy rated coverage, and assigns a $250 target, on Dow member International Business Machines (IBM).

Mommy, that's nasty. Almost as bad as Rumsfeld sending us that robo-signed letter about daddy dying in Iraq. Did they ever find WMDs that were going to kill me? No, dear, the Republicans lied about the WMDs I'm so sad, can I watch Big Bird? Big Bird had an accident. Instead of TV let me tell you about better days when I was little. About the free cheese Reagan gave us and school lunches with real ketchup as the vegetable and presidents like Nixon who weren't crooks.</Msg><Username>palinbigbazzoo</Username><Timestamp>1349815907725</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 16:51:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
