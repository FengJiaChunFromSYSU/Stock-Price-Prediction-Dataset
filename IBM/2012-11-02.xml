I've been following the daily price movements like a hawk because I want to own IBM for the long term. Yesterday and the day before I shorted IBM when it was up around $3 for the day and closed out both trades for 1.7 points profit in total for both trades. I didn't do that today when it was up because I didn't have a clue what would happen. My choice for President is Romney but I'm not sure a Romney win will be good for the market per se because Gov't spending will be headed down, and there will be a much smaller chance that the numerous municipalities that can't fund pensions will be bailed out. A Romney Administration may also focus on how the Fed will wind down the funding of the American mortgage market etc. and transfer it to private American financial institutions -- in a manner like the old American mortgage backed security markets developed in the late 70's and 80's which produced truly investment grade securities. The shift to the private sector driving the economy in lieu of the Fed may deflate stocks -- don't know for sure of course -- but I'm worried about the stock market thru the election.</Msg><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1351868385367</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 10:59:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351870100574-4</Id><Topic><Title>Still looking for an Entry Point</Title><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1351868385367</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 10:59:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Mr_dinky, There is technical damage on the IBM chart. The stock has heavy resistance at $200! The markets are correcting, and nobody should be in a hurry to be long stocks until the markets start a new uptrend. I am not worried about the price as I just hold the stock because it will all be given to my kids eventually.</Msg><Username>qofaslave69</Username><Timestamp>1351870100574</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 11:28:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351870620706-5</Id><Topic><Title>Market Expecting Romney Victory</Title><Username>p1sorell</Username><Timestamp>1351778746680</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 10:05:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Romney compares Sandy clean up to a footbal field clean up after a game where trashes are thrown in few places. Doe he know that people lost their family, friends and homes and whatever they had and some people are in need of water, food and shelter right now? IBM is #1 defensive stock. Your money is secure and it will gain eventually one way or another. IBM will pay you dividend ($.85 /share) if you can hold your shares by next Thrusday.</Msg><Username>help4all1332</Username><Timestamp>1351870620706</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 11:37:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351873621367-6</Id><Topic><Title>Still looking for an Entry Point</Title><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1351868385367</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 10:59:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Get in the game now before it runs away.</Msg><Username>help4all1332</Username><Timestamp>1351873621367</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 12:27:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351875480672-7</Id><Title>ELECTION</Title><Msg>Romney -- Americans have had enough of mediocity.They now want excellence.</Msg><Username>p1sorell</Username><Timestamp>1351875480672</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 12:58:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351879762382-8</Id><Topic><Title>ELECTION</Title><Username>p1sorell</Username><Timestamp>1351875480672</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 12:58:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What a maroon!

Some patriot. And his Bain Capital took decent paying jobs and sent them to China for 30 pieces of silver. What a fantastic businessman HE is.
