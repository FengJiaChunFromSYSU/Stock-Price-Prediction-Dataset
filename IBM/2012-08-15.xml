Typical liberal spin. The title states "Smallest Spender" while the article states "Slowest Spender". So which is it? In any event, it's still gov. run amok and Obama has done nothing to get it under control as promised (ignored Simpson Bowles initiatives). Maybe we should also talk about Solyndra ($600M taxpayer loss) and GM (current $25B taxpayer loss). There's no disputing that we have "An Amateur" in the White House and it's mind boggling that the libs still stand behind this nobody. Give us a qualified candidate.</Msg><Username>thatgdgreenspan</Username><Timestamp>1345042500000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 10:55:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345043855000-4</Id><Topic><Title>FORBES: Obama SMALLEST GOV.

Adding Compaq was the wrong decision and it was obvious to many. HP needed them like a hole in the head. Just because you're a new CEO (Carly) doesn't mean that you have to attempt to make a splash. Sometimes the best decision is a "no decision". Don't buy Compaq, let someone else do it or just let them flounder.</Msg><Username>zer0t0l</Username><Timestamp>1345065936000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 17:25:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345066263000-7</Id><Topic><Title>IBM Buybacks</Title><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1344957332000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 11:15:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I was the last one to agree to these buybacks because I looked upon them as a gimmick. But as was explained in detail (sorry I misplaced your name) by the first poster on this thread, the stategy goes beyond what is on the surface of a buyback. There are intricate accounting procedures going on that ultimately improves the bottom line.</Msg><Username>zer0t0l</Username><Timestamp>1345066263000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 17:31:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345075471000-8</Id><Title>Cisco</Title><Msg>Cisco's earnings should help IBM shares tomorrow, will see.</Msg><Username>yuanlin36</Username><Timestamp>1345075471000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 20:04:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
