On the PC/Tablet/Smart-phone front HPQ is short product, faces competitors AAPL, GOOG, now MSFT, Samsung, DELL etc. It looks like it will show unit slow down and margin compression that will drop the corporate wide Gross Margin closer to 23% which is less than half IBM's current run rate. On the Enterprise side, HPQ faces IBM, the Indian service firms, ORCL, SAP, DELL etc. HPQ was managed 2006 - 2010 by buying back a net 17% of shares and slashing R&amp;D to pump EPS. HPQ is a big part of IBM's big picture and while I hate to see the demise of a great tech legend, they missed the turn to smart-phones and tablets and IBM passed them up in divesting commodity product and plowing a steady 6% of revenues in R&amp;D for key hardware, services and what appears to be very lucrative artificial intelligence like the Watson systems. So part of IBM's float in market dips is no doubt due in part to HPQ's floundering. Mark Hurd killed HPQ by milking it instead of changing it. Why the HPQ board hired Larry Ellison's favorite tennis partner I'll never know. He killed HPQ.</Msg><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1344434979000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 10:09:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344440119000-2</Id><Topic><Title>News came out for International Business Machines Corporation</Title><Username>vedastonewall</Username><Timestamp>1344439054000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 11:17:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A Yahoo Message Board Exclusive!!</Msg><Username>still_my_dime</Username><Timestamp>1344440119000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 11:35:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344440190000-3</Id><Topic><Title>Great Read</Title><Username>jillapb549</Username><Timestamp>1344439040000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 11:17:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Do NOT click ont he scam url.</Msg><Username>still_my_dime</Username><Timestamp>1344440190000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 11:36:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344443678000-4</Id><Topic><Title>IBM must acquire both AKAM &amp; RIMM, big blue will fly</Title><Username>casbah45</Username><Timestamp>1343339537000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 17:52:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You are so full of it. IBM stock will stay in this range of $5-$10 like MSFT in $4 range sinc the past 5 years, if it does not move to compete with AAPL. AAPL is eating every one lunch, people are just so infatuated with AAPL prodcuts, notto mention the mass media that are totally biased toward AAPL. Any andoriod phone is better than AAPL phone, but folks are just not willing even to look at other phones because folks think AAPL becomes symbol status. AAPL had a great marketing strategy in going after the children of the family, then the children brought on the parents into aapl products. So IBM can revive a great products in RIMM, and beside big blue has the right managment to make so much cash from this chance of acquiring RIMM. Hand Held Devices where every thing is going. do not forget RIMM has the best secure phone in all of the phones. and huge customer base over seas GO Big Blue.</Msg><Username>casbah45</Username><Timestamp>1344443678000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 12:34:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344446607000-5</Id><Title>Its time to protect your shares again.

HP is in a death sprial, Strategy going forward is the key to competing in the tech industry. Sad to see HP missed the boat. IBM has positioned itself to take advantage of Watson and all the other AI apps and analytical software they have developed or acquired. My view is that they will be at $300.00 a shr by 2015...
