If the rate hike to 39.6% over $250k and taxing dividends at ordinary rates will only raise $80 bil - $90 bil a year then how can a deal get done to reduce the current $1 trillion a year deficit? I think a lot more #$%$ will flow before anything gets done.

This is a manipulated market beyond comprehension. Yesterday with the Dow down 70 points with 20 min. to go, big buy programs hit. Today every time the Dow has sold off buy programs have hit. Hedge funds are the culprits up as well as down. How we close today will prove significant. Are the bas*^ards long or short?

The market has been selling off since the middle of September. The DJIA is 9% off its 52 week high and IBM is 12% off its 52 week high.

The decline was a result of a political misreading by JFK, a novice, who went on national TV and demanded that the big steel companies rescind their price increase which they did. Today we have the same situation. Investors dumped stocks because they don't ltrust Obama when it comes to big business and Wall Street. The decline has been mainly poltical - not so much economic. Further more, I don't expect any deal on the fiscal cliff until the 11th hour. If we penetrate 12490 on the close the next support is 12200. A 25% decline would bring the Dow to 10000.</Msg><Username>p1sorell</Username><Timestamp>1353101596012</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-16 16:33:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353103177876-16</Id><Topic><Title>Market Analysis</Title><Username>p1sorell</Username><Timestamp>1353095461467</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-16 14:51:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Our investing styles differ as I do not day trade. I agree with your theory the "fiscal cliff" will not be solved until absolutely necessary. A 25% decline in the DJIA would not surprise me at all. In fact, I expect the DJIA to trade under 10,000 at some point in the future. Is this a correction, or a new bear market? This current bull market is nearly four years old, and it is tired. The market leaders like AAPL (proxy for Nasdaq) &amp; IBM (proxy for DJIA) also look tired. A bear market in 2013 will provide investors an opportunity to buy quality stocks at lower prices. I look forward to bear markets, and don't panic at the inevitable; all stocks go up AND down. Good luck to you!</Msg><Username>qofaslave69</Username><Timestamp>1353103177876</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-16 16:59:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353108340037-17</Id><Topic><Title>See it at $220 in a few months</Title><Username>help4all1332</Username><Timestamp>1353099304678</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-16 15:55:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I am waiting for hitting new 52wk low next month.

Two of the above would not be good for IBM. If there is no deal then the market will probably take a hit. If there is a meaningful deal with spending cuts that will actually cut spending it should drive the US dollar higher against the Euro. That will not be good for US multinationals reporting in USD.
