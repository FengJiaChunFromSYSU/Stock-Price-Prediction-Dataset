The market has moved higher in the 4th quarter of election years 82% of the time since 1944, and it looks poised to continue that trend. Technically, IBM's chart looks healthy, and is forming a double-bottom base which is working on the right side of its cup. The stock reached a high of $210.69 on April 3 and then back off and has been consolidating since. The first bottom was on June 4 of $187, and the second bottom was $181.85 on July 12 and the stock reversed off its bottom on that day. Both bottoms saw average volume of 4 million shares. I purchased stock at $182 as the sellers were exhausted. IBM jumped $12 on July 18-19 on nearly 20 million shares, and has been moving higher ever since. I expect new highs within the next two months, and a catalyst could be the next EPS report? The new buy point is $210.79! Good luck!</Msg><Username>qofaslave69</Username><Timestamp>1344702560000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 12:29:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344710054000-2</Id><Topic><Title>MITT ROMNEY WILL SAVE AMERICA</Title><Username>nynynyny461</Username><Timestamp>1341232351000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-02 08:32:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How very Liberal of you to wish that, good thing YOU arn't in charge.
