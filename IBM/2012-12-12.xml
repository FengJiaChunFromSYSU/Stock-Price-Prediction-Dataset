Well, IBM sure does because while the posts about SHAREHOLDER VALUE GOING UP UP UP, the discontent among the American workforce, what little is actually left as we Roadkill our way to 2015, is going DOWN DOWN DOWN and that impact long term. Look for those contract accounts to become very unhappy with INDIA as American workers leave by choice or are RIF'd before 12/15/2013.
