Just prior to this latest layoff, IBM had moved a bunch of employees to the cloud computing area, but not long after that, they bought a company that specializes in the cloud. Guess what happened to the people they had just moved over there? That's right, they canned them. Maybe this is reality, but it is harsh when you consider those people were not all schmucks like you make them out to be.</Msg><Username>nozupforyou</Username><Timestamp>1372780872923</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 12:01:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372786780178-6</Id><Title>Cairo will celebrate on 4th of July with USA</Title><Msg>The new Egypt</Msg><Username>jgiled</Username><Timestamp>1372786780178</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 13:39:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372789363867-7</Id><Title>Big Blue</Title><Msg>Let's roll</Msg><Username>mitch_blood_green</Username><Timestamp>1372789363867</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 14:22:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372794870780-8</Id><Topic><Title>SELL 193 - 194</Title><Username>p1sorell</Username><Timestamp>1372776746593</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 10:52:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Woith Dow down over 80 at 3:30 the buy programs hit.

There's no doubt that IBM is brutal and often extremely stupid. They've launched and killed hundreds of businesses over the years, missed dozens of opportunities, and even destroyed companies they spent a fortune acquiring. My point is simply to get people to stop counting on them. When they start chopping they really chop - right down to the bone - and then some. If I worked at IBM I would be urgently and aggressively searching for something else with a very short time frame in mind. Because the company will go on but the ride will be gut wrenching. There is not a single senior staff member who wouldn't push their mother in front of a train for another point of margin. And that's exactly what the shareholders want. If both sides know the game then nobody is at a disadvantage. Employees are weak because they are naive.</Msg><Username>jand2357</Username><Timestamp>1372806603472</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 19:10:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372809089362-11</Id><Topic><Title>IBM and layoffs</Title><Username>jand2357</Username><Timestamp>1370366399824</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 13:19:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>jand2357, try as I may. You have about 45 thumbs down while I have only 20 ...at best. I cannot come close to you on this score even though we're on the same wave length. I congratulate you ! To be serious, the posters here that give you thumbs down don't actually comprehend the facts.</Msg><Username>zer0t0l</Username><Timestamp>1372809089362</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 19:51:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
