"that's OK, good riddance to them. We don't want them here in America ANYWAY!" While people like you are saying things like that, successful economies overseas are enacting laws to ATTRACT the investment capital of people like Saverin, Dart, Wozniak... and the countless Billionaires who have taken their investment capital and LEFT the U.S. for countries that are less hostile toward those who invest their money into jobs-producing industry. Investment capital is very "fluid" in today's, global economy. Even you, right this VERY INSTANT, can sell your "domestic stock" mutual fund and buy an "emerging market equity" mutual fund in your 401k and in the blink of an eye... move your money AWAY from Obama's anti-capitalism crusade... ... in fact, that's what's happening: "domestic stock" mutual funds have been hemorrhaging assets for several years now as "emerging markets" mutual funds are rapidly accumulating assets. The stampede of assets out of the U.S. isn't just confined to rich people anymore. As Obama receives the endorsements of socialists like Venezuela's Hugo Chavez and the daughter of Cuba's Raul Castro, America now faces a "fiscal cliff"... much of what came from the failure of the "debt commission" 14 months ago, while our so-called "leader"... Barack Obama completely sat that process OUT. In 3 to 4 years from now, the U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio will exceed that of Greece... ... which is par for the course, since Obama is emulating the POLICIES of Greece's big-government, high-tax approach.</Msg><Username>bjspokanimal</Username><Timestamp>1351271412800</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 13:10:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351273559052-12</Id><Title>Actually, alreadyhaveauser... that's the reply from MOST anti-capitalists...

I think we should tax the wealthy in this country a lot... but NOT so much that it sends them packing. We HAVE to remain competitive with other countries when it comes to attracting global investment capital and encouraging the owners of it to invest it into jobs-producing industry. Currently, the top 1% of U.S. taxpayers provide about 38% of government revenues coming from individual income taxes... and the bottom 47% of U.S. earners pay NO federal income taxes. The point is: That's too HIGH. Many far-east countries have either low or no capital gains tax, yet Obama want's ours to be equal to taxes on ordinary income... and he want's the maximum rate on that to climb to 39.6%. HOW CAN WE COMPETE WITH THOSE COUNTRIES FOR INVESTMENT CAPITAL WHEN WE HAVE A PRESIDENT THAT WANT'S TO PUNISH CAPITAL TO THAT DEGREE? Obama want's Romney's dividend income taxed at 39.6% instead of it's current maximum of 15%... ... COMPLETELY IGNORING the fact that it is AT 15% because it's "double taxed" at both the corporation that ISSUES the dividends and at Romney's personal level. Remember... Warren Buffett "deducts" his secretary's salary. If Obama changes Romney's dividend income to a 39.6% bracket... then THAT tax, combined with corporate taxes that run upwards of 35% means that that income is subject to a total tax of 74.6%... ... HOW IS THE U.S. GOING TO COMPETE FOR INVESTMENT CAPITAL WITH PUNATIVE TAX STRUCTURES LIKE THAT? alreadyhaveauser... 95% of U.S. voters have NO UNDERSTANDING of these economic concepts... but having a president that is cognizant of them is CRITICAL to our country's future. I hope that YOU have the ability to understand it and share it with others because the next 4 years are going to define our country's future for generations to come.

NOT 39.6% for Cap. Gains. From a Bloomberg article May 30 2012 - "The current 15 percent top capital gains rate compares with a 35 percent top tax rate for ordinary income. Unless Congress acts, the top capital gains rate will increase to 20 percent in 2013, raising $36 billion over 10 years, according to the administration. An additional 3.8 percentage point increase for the highest-earning taxpayers is set to take effect in 2013, to help pay for the 2010 health-care law. Romney and Obama would narrow the current 20 percentage- point gap between the top ordinary income and capital gains rates. Obama’s most recent budget called for a 39.6 percent top tax rate and a 23.8 percent capital gains rate, for a 15.8 percentage point difference. Romney wants to cut the top ordinary tax rate to 28 percent, yielding a 13-point gap with the 15 percent capital gains rate." No need to lie, the Romney/Ryan can do that for you.</Msg><Username>alreadyhaveauser</Username><Timestamp>1351281332793</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 15:55:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351294375062-16</Id><Topic><Title>Actually, alreadyhaveauser... that's the reply from MOST anti-capitalists...

Yes, Obamacare raised the top C.G. rate an additional 3.8% for Americans with the most investment capital to allocate across the globe. I can't see any errors in your figures in terms of "what Obama is saying going into the election". That said, Obama has spoken affectionately MANY TIMES about the days that Bill Clinton had capital gains being taxed at 28% in the early 90s... and Obama has vehemently opposed indexing capital gains for inflation. To understand what that means, consider someone buying a stock for $10,000, holding it for 3 years during which inflation was 3% in EACH of those years, then selling the stock for $10,900 (I'm leaving compounding out for simplicity here). The question is: what was his "real" tax rate on that $900 gain? Answer: 100%. Warren Buffett's secretary uses tax tables that are at LEAST indexed for inflation... but that luxury is not afforded to one who invests in the stock of a jobs-producing corporation. Similarly, Obama want's dividends taxed as ordinary income. If Romney paid Obama's 39.6% rate for his dividends, which were, in turn, taxed at 35% by the issuing corporation (eg: double taxation of dividends), then the total government haul is 74.6%... ... I hope you get the fact that people like Edwardo Saverin and Steve Woznaik are fleeing with their investment capital because of confiscatory proposals like that... capital that we need invested HERE, in AMERICAN industry and AMERICAN jobs. I wish you and all the other anti-capitalists in their tents down on wall street had clue-one what Obama's hatred of capitalism is DOING to this country's ability to attract and deploy capital into our economy... ... it's hard to imagine, once you understand these things, just what it is that keeps you supporting somebody who is so clearly in the mold of a Hugo Chaves for U.S. President!
