It's hard not to look back and admire the $18.8 bil buyback in 2007 at about $106 per share. That was with about $12 bil of borrowed money. IBM bought back $10 bil and change in 2008 and then about $7.5 bil in 2009 when the financial credit crisis followed Lehman. It did retire almost all of the 2007 buyback debt incurred for buybacks in '09. The calculations that IBM does on a current basis to justify buybacks are more complex. My guess is that it starts with computing the Operating Cash Flow yield per share if the stock is bought at current market. Using the current Operating EPS boggy to approximate cash flow per share $15.10/ $199 shows a 7.55% current return on each share bought. IBM's investing in it's stock is a permanent investment in equity akin to buying a corporate debenture bond with no maturity date. But in IBM's case, annual cash flow per share is growing each year both from the effects of share count reductions from buybacks but also because total corporate cash flow is growing. If it were only the slices of the pie getting bigger then the Operating Cash Flow per share buyback yield would diminish instead of growing as IBM's share price increases. It's only because the total pie is growing that IBM can continue to buyback shares into the $200's. I believe operating cash flow was up 9% thru Q2. So I'm in the camp that has seen these buybacks as a great use of IBM's cash flow. Because the 7.55% current cash yield at market is just the starting point for a full current value discounted review of yield on buybacks -- some annual growth rate for the perpetual investment analysis would have to be assumed along with a cost of the capital. If you assume that IBM's operating earnings will double over a certain period of years -- say every 6 - 7 years then every 6 - 7 years the 7.55% yield will double. Isn't it great how that works? You can also consider IBM's dividend yield per share of about 1.7% .Each share bought back saves the dividend payment but that's controllable. You can see that IBM has built up additional debt in the last couple of years -- about $2.3 bil add in 2010 &amp; again in 2011. It's easy to see why when IBM's cost of 10 year debt is close to the stock's yield at market. But IBM has walked the line on debt having gotten an increase from S&amp;P from "A+" to "AA-" in April. Since IBM is spending close to an average $3.5 per Q on gross stock buybacks for the last 10 quarters the debt upgrade is an endorsement of IBM's model that incorporates buybacks as an IBM fundamental. The reason why IBM's historical buybacks look so good is due to the revenue mix shift to higher margin software and stable services revenues. And that's the reason why buybacks at $200 and up make sense. Ask Warren. I was inspired to write this post after I heard a discussion on CNBC about the stelth effects of low rates on balance sheets and then income statements. Heavy borrowers like IBM, VZ, and T, my other favorite stocks with high corporate debt ratings,are going to see a continuing lift from refi's and increased borrowing. Right now the lowered corporate interest expense is cushining a soft economy and in the case of a T or VZ, their reduced corporate debt carry is offsetting the reduced debt yields down in their pension funds that they will need to fund. And BTW, the underlying reason VZ trades at a premium to T on a yield basis is because VOD owns 45% of Verizon Wireless so a path to a merger of the wireless subsidiary with VOD is clear. The pension drag is helping to kill the wireline business.</Msg><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1344957332000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 11:15:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344960322000-6</Id><Topic><Title>IBM Buybacks</Title><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1344957332000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 11:15:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There is no reasonable argument that says IBM's buy backs haven't bee positive for stock holders. You don't have to make it any more complicated than, would it be smart for any one to buy the stock with very good inside information? It really isn't any different use of money than buying some other company's stock. When you buy another company's shares you sometimes get a few surprises, but when you buy your own shares you know much more about it's prospects. All of these academic arguments against buy backs are typical of academics who get things too complicated and come up with goofy conclusions. They are only right when the buy backs are done simply to prop up the shares. This happens when you have crooked management running their companies purely for personal gain. When this is the case it's evident in many more ways.

HPQ bought back a net 17% of its stock 2006 - 2010 in the $40's and $50's while at the same time slashing R&amp;D to boost EPS and making flashy acquisitions like EDS and PALM. I calculated that if Hp's R&amp;D would have been just 4% of revenues that just about the entire EPS growth 2006 - 2010 would have been due to the buybacks and resulting reduced share count. Carly put HPQ on the wrong path and Hurd milked the company for stock option gains instead of changing it the way IBM changed. Mark Hurd's changes were a sham and created an illusion of growth. Meanwhile, IBM keep up a 6% of revenue investment in R&amp;D while HPQ was under 3%. Today, IBM brings down more than twice as much cash to the bottom line per dollar of revenue. IBM has had the most successful huge % share buyback of a huge market cap in history. And its all been clean -- things like a corporate policy that awards options to sr mgt at 110% of current market has kept it clean.</Msg><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1344965204000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 13:26:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344970645000-10</Id><Title>IBM paper claims spintronics breakthrough</Title><Msg>from Solid State Technology IBM researchers are claiming a huge breakthrough in spintronics, a technology that could significantly boost capacity and lower power use of memory and storage devices, according to a paper published in science journal Nature.

You have noticed that earnings are still good for most S&amp;P 500 firms. However, the earnings are coming in lower revenues. The quality of leadership is important in managing the earnings. IBM has some excellent leadership. IBM has seen flat revenues while growing EPS at 10% or more. The share buy backs certainly help in this area. Remember, the stock price is based on earnings and not revenue. A P/E is price to earning and NOT price to revenue. IBM has been great for shareholders even if the average employee may gripe about wages and conditions.

I visited their message board occasionally during the whole episode and argued that this company was phony. For awhile Hurd inflated the shares with gimicks but it is a classic example of the buy backs enginered to prop up the shares. It's too bad that many people were true believers with their stock analysis using only the rear view mirror. The early warning was doubling up in a commodity business with the acquistion of Compaq. IBM wisely did just the opposite.
