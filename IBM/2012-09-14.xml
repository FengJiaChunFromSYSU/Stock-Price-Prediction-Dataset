If you really had a lock on the market you wouldn't be wasting time on a message board promoting your prognostications. You'd be busy making real money right?

Let me prodive some background. The stock market went up this week on huge volume, and that is an indication big investment firms are getting into the market. This is not a paint job! Painting is done in light volume. The bond market is unwinding after a 30 year bull run. The bond rates are so low that investors can do better by purchasing blue chip stocks with a yield. That movement will push the DJIA much higher. Uncle Ben this past week just signaled to all bond holders that the party is over and he is spraying them with a fire hose, and promised not to turn it off untill all bond holders flee. It will take some time for the bond trade to unwind. Do not fight the fed! I expect DJIA to trade over 15,000 in 2013. Specifically to IBM; IT spending is expected to increase five fold by 2017. That is a good thing for IBM since it pays in that space. IBM is buying back its own shares and basically controlling EPS growth. IBM is signing contracts all over the world, and is dominating emerging markets. I am long and strong, and will take the 10%-20% that IBM will return(plus dividend). You can stay short and get your balls fried! Good luck!</Msg><Username>qofaslave69</Username><Timestamp>1347674222973</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 21:57:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
