These were significant contracts that would have given IBM the revenue to meet Wall Street expectations, and add to their earnings per share. It may seem logical the US elections (growth down 4% in North America) is a plausible excuse for these contract delays. Also, with the fiscal cliff looming it may have cause for some to be cautious with IT spending. IBM was a stock that value investors could count on, and now we must rely on the words of the CFO. That is a paradigm shift for IBM, and value investors will seek other options in the markets to park their money. It has been my experience that when these types of shifts occur it is best to just wait and watch, and typically these guys are not to be trusted. IBM is a dead stock until the next EPS report when the CFO will have some explaining to do. Either the contracts come through, and there is huge beat on the top and bottom lines. Or, IBM market share is eroding and we will see some layoffs worldwide. There is far too much uncertainty now in IBM and the media is ready to jump on the bear bandwagon. There is nothing positive to propel this stock, and it is likely to drift downwards, or settle at a lower price, for the rest of the year. Do you trust the CFO? It looks like most investors do not! At least, they do not want to wait around for an answer.</Msg><Username>qofaslave69</Username><Timestamp>1350571589075</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 10:46:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350572137963-9</Id><Topic><Title>Sold My IRA Shares</Title><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1350570716066</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 10:31:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Smart move!
