IBM will continue to reinvent itself .. over the years , Big Blue has sold off lots of operations ... the proceeds never go to shareholders , but back in the coffers to fund new projects , or service some debt .... they have also bought hundreds of small companies to assist with growth into new areas ... a breakup would nice for shareholders , but don't look for it ....</Msg><Username>garceman1</Username><Timestamp>1343609526000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-29 20:52:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343609635000-2</Id><Topic><Title>Executive AGE - top dogs getting old ......are your worried ????</Title><Username>tx.icon0clast</Username><Timestamp>1343431905000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 19:31:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>why do you guys continue with this claptrap ??? all it does is tie up resources , which in turn make things more expensive .. at whose gain ??? 15 nanoseconds of thrill when you hit the "post" button .. try getting a life .. it's very exciting ....</Msg><Username>garceman1</Username><Timestamp>1343609635000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-29 20:53:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343609700000-3</Id><Topic><Title>Mainframe Software Maker CA Tanking &gt;</Title><Username>obamaloveswallst</Username><Timestamp>1343417876000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 15:37:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>do you have a point to make ??? like maybe IBM is driving yet another competitor out of business ????</Msg><Username>garceman1</Username><Timestamp>1343609700000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-29 20:55:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
