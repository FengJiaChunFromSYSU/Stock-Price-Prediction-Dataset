So... when, in the future, will cutting spending NOT harm the economy? It's been barely growing at a 1 to 2% GDP rate for years now under Obama despite huge deficit spending and massive money printing at the fed. How long do we continue with this socialist experiment before we look at all the socialist experiments before us and decide to do something else.... .... Greece, Spain, Venezuela, Cuba... how many example of Obama-style experiments do we need to look at before we convince all the Justin Bieber fans that voted for obama that this is the wrong way to go?</Msg><Username>bjspokanimal</Username><Timestamp>1360427808561</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-09 11:36:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360428184347-2</Id><Title>Why is Big Government, Big Deficit, Socialism so Popular in America Today?</Title><Msg>I get that Obama's power comes from the fact that 47 percent of Americans don't pay taxes and 49 percent of American Households have at least one member that receives a government check... both historical records. I also get that the top 1 percent of american earners supplied 38 percent of income tax revenues before the recent Obama tax hike and that that will rise to an all-time record 42 percent this year because of the tax hike. I get how government beneficiaries completely outnumber government contributors at the ballot box in socialist countries and that that is happening in the U.S. now. What I DON'T get is that Americans USED to be able to SEE the horrors of incremental socialism in countless countries that adopted socialism before us and they flatly rejected it. Cuba, Venezuela, etc. have all suffered economic decline over the years and decades as a result of Obama-style policy implementation. Why can't America SEE what huge deficits and rampant money printing lead to. Why can't they see that our current 50 year low in capital spending is destroying our industrial base. Who ARE you people who love Obama but articulate well enough on this board to illustrate that you should know better than to see him as anything more than an economic disease in human form. What would our grandfathers say if they could See Obama's deficits and see how Obama's friend Bernanke is debasing our currency with all this debt-monetization... ... they would roll over in their graves for sure.
