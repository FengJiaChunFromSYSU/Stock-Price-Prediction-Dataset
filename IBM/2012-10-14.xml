Plus the dividends. The same return is accruing to IBM as it is by far the biggest investor in its own shares, except IBM's gains are passed directly through to its LT shareholders. Long term shareholders directly benefit in the form of the underlying share count reductions that have become an IBM fundamental metric. IBM's buyback program is like an extra IBM business segment generating a "profit" that goes directly into shareholder brokerage accounts without being trimmed by Federal and State taxes (so far). IBM has made it clear that investors can count on underlying share buyback arithmetic through 2015. It's a direct pass through of IBM capital to shareholders. IBM shareholders get to decide when to recognize the capital pass through as income.This is why Buffett said, "IBM treats its shareholders with reverence."</Msg><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1350229692124</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 11:48:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350260039146-2</Id><Title>ibm to buy amd</Title><Msg>deal around 7 billion.any takers?</Msg><Username>breuxhab</Username><Timestamp>1350260039146</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 20:13:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350267146175-3</Id><Topic><Title>Crash imminent?</Title><Username>oih_2007</Username><Timestamp>1350056538964</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 11:42:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>As long as the eranings stay good.
