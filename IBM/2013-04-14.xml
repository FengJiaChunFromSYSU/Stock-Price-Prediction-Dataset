But, do not expect IBM to miss this quarter. I expect at least $4 EPS and perhaps softer revenue numbers like $26 billion. I do not expect the stock to tank after the report.</Msg><Username>qofaslave69</Username><Timestamp>1365972819683</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 16:53:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
