That is just incorrect. If you can point me to where I said something like this, I will apologize. 8-) You won't be able to. There are some people on Wall Street and in Congress that would match your description of them. Most would not. Your activity, however, I would put into that category. Once you move to 100% cash, you will, hopefully not have any reason to continue to spam this board with this.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1373112978906</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-06 08:16:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373117203746-3</Id><Title>Rometty's International Business Services (RIBS) Group</Title><Msg>Since Machines seem no longer part of the Management and Board of Directors' focus at IBM, and even software is giving way more and more to call center services, perhaps the corporation should be renamed Rometty International Business Services. I think RIBS has a good ring to it as a stock symbol, all ribbing aside. As long as rank-and-file shareholders want to preserve only short term value and next quarter gains, hand management their bonuses on a silver platter, and fail to have the vision of the long term sustenance of IBM as a global business machines leader, this is the way things are a-tracking.

Did you BUY ? For once this option makes sense. I wouldn't do it myself only because I'm not a risk taker. But then again, how can you lose on those calls if they go above 200 and then if not, you lose your premium. Not a big deal.</Msg><Username>zer0t0l</Username><Timestamp>1373160801086</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-06 21:33:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
