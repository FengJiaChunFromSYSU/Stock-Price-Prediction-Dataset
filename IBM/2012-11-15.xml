Removing tax money and distributing it to the government doesn't change the fact the economy will be sent into a recession. The guys with all the money couldn't support the markets during the 1929 crash. Why expect them to be able to support it now. Short term increase in price due to Buffett and likely move back down again as economy sours and credit rating is downgraded again. I am in cash. Sold IBM at 191 for loss.</Msg><Username>tr01742</Username><Timestamp>1352984170741</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 07:56:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352985753723-2</Id><Topic><Title>IBM price is the same as last year although IBM earns $1.60/shr more</Title><Username>help4all1332</Username><Timestamp>1352926456394</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 15:54:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes , but this year people seems resigned to the idea we will go into a deeper recession due to tax hikes from fiscal cliff. Even if IBM does better, the price goes down due to recession. Just like PHilipp Morris. Doesn't cigarette consumption increase in a sour economy. They hit bottom in 2009 even though they did ok.</Msg><Username>tr01742</Username><Timestamp>1352985753723</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 08:22:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352993378018-3</Id><Title>When will IBM start...</Title><Msg>buying bk shares and prevent this insane free fall in value?</Msg><Username>cangelosi_g</Username><Timestamp>1352993378018</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 10:29:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352995628727-4</Id><Title>In my opinion</Title><Msg>investors need to understand, when a person such as W. Buffet buys additional shares, in his mind, the near term PPS is meaningless. He knows IBM is buying back shares therefore, as an institutional investor, he owns a larger portion of the company and his "share" becomes more and more valuable. Regarding IBM buying back shares, they have the same exact posture. Would you rather buy at full retail or when something is on sale? The near term PPS is meaningless, and in fact better for them if it's lower. They get to buy back more shares. Traders interests and long term investor interests are not necessarily aligned.</Msg><Username>cmegladon</Username><Timestamp>1352995628727</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 11:07:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352995684399-5</Id><Title>Stuart Varney just talking to Duncan Hunter - he says its Obamas Cliff!!</Title><Msg>I figure we got another 10% to go before anyone in Washington takes notice.
