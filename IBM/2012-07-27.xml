I don't think Zuck or the retail investors who invested in that stk even realized how many shrs 2.14B really are... And at $38. you are talking somewhere in the neighborhood of $80B.. Now they are getting a math lesson!! Or better yet, a lesson on how the investment bankers on Wall St, will sell you a pig in the poke.. Here is the amuzing part.. Lets say they raised $70B on the IPO.. If you check out key statistics board of FB.. It shows they have $3.7B cash and $369M debt??? What happened to all those other billions??? I have a feeling a lot of investment banks, are probably retiring after that one IPO!! You would think most the money, invested in that stk would have been going into FB coffers, to run the Co.. What a joke!! Whether you bought the stk at $30. or $38. Of that money.. You now have about $1.50 of it, for all practical purposes!!! They say there is one born every minute!!</Msg><Username>jrmills0014</Username><Timestamp>1343387415000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 07:10:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343388129000-3</Id><Topic><Title>PULL BACK THE CURTAIN: THERE'S NO MIGHTY WIZARD OF OZ BEHIND THERE</Title><Username>moncriefjj</Username><Timestamp>1343337443000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 17:17:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Here is the laughable part!!

Now are you smart enough to figure out what they are going to do?? Hey they know how you are betting, because they are the ones, selling those options... If us dummies, buy enough calls in the money.. They will drive it lower.. Buy more puts than calls, in the money.. They will drive it higher... And in reading that options board.. It shows how many of each has traded.. What we don't know and they do.. If people are buying them or closing out their positions?? Where we may think people are buying.. It may be the very oposite, and the manipulators are actually the ones buying!!!</Msg><Username>jrmills0014</Username><Timestamp>1343391104000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 08:11:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343392910000-5</Id><Title>Market will move down!!!</Title><Msg>GDP number not bad enough for any QE3.

And I know you would like more interaction with the regular, fact based posters who other people sometimes reply to. But of course you wouldn't want to hear from the trash posters here who make fun of you. Try posting about IBM instead of about yourself. Nobody thinks you have a clue where IBM, or the DOW, or the "market" is going from day-to-day.
