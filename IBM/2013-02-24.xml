In a riveting interview on Fox Business, Rogers warned Americans not to trust any of the positive economic news coming from world governments. "I don't trust the data from any government, including the U.S., Rogers said. "We know that governments lie to us. Everybody's printing money, but it cannot go on. This is all artificial." Rogers, who for years has been an outspoken critic of the Feds policies of "Quantitative Easing" says all the money printing is creating false hope that we are in the middle of some kind of super bull market. But in reality, he says, "we're living in a fool's paradise."</Msg><Username>p1sorell</Username><Timestamp>1361715278165</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-24 09:14:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361727013164-2</Id><Topic><Title>Sell Sucker Rally</Title><Username>p1sorell</Username><Timestamp>1361555751057</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 12:55:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I may be an idiot?
