The right to bare arms was all about 'one bullet' guns back then and meant between the Brittich and the ex-pats. What doesn't Americans or DC understand? If children in CO or CONN are being massicured with semi-automatic weapons, GET THEM OFF THE MARKETS. Why wasn't that done years ago? I'll tell you why,,,, crazy gun entusiasts that love muder, that's the only reason out there. Our politicians are being paid billions to allow this and yet they (themselves will go on TV and nevy and resposivility because lying is not a felony. We are living in a lying governed country. And it'll never stop. My Heart-felt suggestion is to leave and find a countrty that maybe as bad (politically) buy at least is a whole lot cheaper to live in.
