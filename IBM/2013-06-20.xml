What does a Bachelors degree in h, el or ps do for the world??? But if you can learn how to make a computer talk to anouther, or know what effect one drug has on anouther in finding cures for deseases ?? Thats anouther story!!! There is big money out there, if you can do either!!! Witnessed by the billions Zuck made off of FB.. I personally know a housewife who decided to take a few Med classes, after her kids got about grown.. Obviously, she had a nack!!! Before long..She was checking out the the results, of the people developing drugs!!!! Last time checked.. Which was a few yrs ago.. She took those classes, expecting to make $30k to $40k per yr... Within 2 yrs she was mking $90k and bonuses... Anouther Co hired her away, by giving her a big signing bonus and $120K per yr!!! About know I figure, she may be getting stk bonuses worth millions, and no telling what kind of salary!!! But if you think just getting a college degree, qualifies you to make a big salary...Have you ever watched Animal House!!! I was working in I E..And make no mistake!! I E does run everything!! But I was still a gofur!! Actually, I was like a chief mst sgt in the military!!! If you needed something.. I could make it happen!!!! Point in this!! Two graduates from Cornell come in one yr!!! One, smartest person I ever known... Other, dumb as a stick... I absolutly believe the smart one, could be CEO of IBM, right now, if he wanted that.. I told you he was smart?? He didn't want it!! In the mean time as the dumb one, got flustated as they won't promoting him as fast as they were the smart ones.. He either resigned or got fired after a few yrs?? Bottom line: Regardless that you got a degree!! Sooner or later, its going to matter what you learned!!! In the mean time.. Some people are smarter than others!!!!! Hell I thought I was the smatest peron on the planet, till I shared an office, with that smart one out of Cornell!! It amuzed me as how smart, he really was!!!</Msg><Username>jrmills0014</Username><Timestamp>1371702670385</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-20 00:31:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371716964704-2</Id><Topic><Title>Sale of servers to Leveno</Title><Username>oppsforegoodnews</Username><Timestamp>1371656329201</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 11:38:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Looks like your bowels are eithe plugged up or flowing too much, get ahold of your own body and then perhaps the flow will stop from your mouth also.</Msg><Username>talktootheboard</Username><Timestamp>1371716964704</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-20 04:29:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371726878900-3</Id><Topic><Title>Stop Whining...

Because the employees care and they are fed up. Most of whom have planned very well for their future, saved, put kids through college, own homes, and all the rest. The problem is that IBM no longer values some employees as they once did. It is not so bad for the new folks, but the people who have been around for awhile are #$%$ and rightfully so. They take the brunt of the cost cutting, longer hours with no compensation, layoffs and job eliminations. IBM shows no loyalty yet expects undying loyalty in return. So this "you are lucky you have a job" #$%$ has reached it's pinnacle and you will see IBMers leaving, retiring and worse of all, giving up on IBM.</Msg><Username>teddyballgameshead</Username><Timestamp>1371726878900</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-20 07:14:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371727795056-4</Id><Topic><Title>Stop Whining...

Some employees is my favorite here, some. Wow, about 2,900 by count now. And jobs? HAHAHA - what jobs. In this wonderful economy, jobs at Burger King and, your valued Home Depot, perhaps but they do not pay very well, do they? I am glad I do not work for YOU.

Those rates will be rising in the coming weeks and months. Some of the blue chip firms have stagnant sales, and are using some of the borrowed money to buy back their own stock. We have seen a ton of buyback programs withing the big cap stocks. These firms are making their EPS numbers on lower revenue, and this is how some of these firms are doing it. One thing to consider in an environment of rising rates is: will rising rates negatively affect firms with stagnant sales, and relying on buyback programs?</Msg><Username>qofaslave69</Username><Timestamp>1371772415853</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-20 19:53:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371772701993-17</Id><Topic><Title>Overvalue stock here..</Title><Username>bigk95133</Username><Timestamp>1371767455505</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-20 18:30:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>what brand Scotch are you drinking?</Msg><Username>zer0t0l</Username><Timestamp>1371772701993</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-20 19:58:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371772939556-18</Id><Topic><Title>One Thing to Consider...</Title><Username>qofaslave69</Username><Timestamp>1371772415853</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-20 19:53:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>the downturn prompted you to say this.
