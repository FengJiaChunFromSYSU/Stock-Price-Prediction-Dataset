The stock is hovering just above $200, and I would expect it to slowly climb to $210. The market has moved higher in the 4th quarter of election years 82% of the time since 1944, and it looks poised to continue that trend. Technically, IBM's chart looks healthy, and is forming a double-bottom base which is currently working on the right side of its cup. The stock reached a high of $210.69 on April 3 and then back off and has been consolidating since. The first bottom was on June 4 of $187, and the second bottom was $181.85 on July 12 and the stock reversed off its bottom on that day. Both bottoms saw average volume of 4 million shares. IBM jumped $12 on July 18-19 on nearly 20 million shares, and has been moving higher ever since. I expect new highs within the next two months, and a catalyst could be the next EPS report? The new buy point is $210.79! Good luck!</Msg><Username>qofaslave69</Username><Timestamp>1345308163000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 12:42:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345313037000-2</Id><Title>S &amp; P 2000</Title><Msg>take it take it and crash</Msg><Username>stock.shah</Username><Timestamp>1345313037000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 14:03:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345332650000-3</Id><Title>Buffett Likes IBM More Than INTC</Title><Msg>A picture is worth a thousands words.

Not many other stocks can tout IBM's numbers. When Investors decide to spend their hordes of cash, the sky is the limit for Big Blue. And yeah guess if you're trading short you might lose a buck or two, but you will do quite well if you go long and especially if you add to your position. I am very pleased with IBM:) Have a nice day.</Msg><Username>dino2hootie</Username><Timestamp>1345346273000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 23:17:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
