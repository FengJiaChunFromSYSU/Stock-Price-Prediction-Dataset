The underlying spending is growing due to the levels of budgets the agencies in charge were projecting and requesting. Having said the above, the cut back in Federal spending in Q4 2012 taking GDP to a negative 1/10 of a point was attention getting. Can the US economy take this pull back of planned spending due to the sequester in stride and grow 2% or more in 2013? I think the spending cuts are about $85 bil a year. Before the Q4 result I would have said yes. I have to wonder now.</Msg><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1361295764707</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 12:42:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361302701043-2</Id><Title>IBM been acting like a real turd since earnings</Title><Msg>Frustrating to be long!</Msg><Username>kudlowsflooziegirl</Username><Timestamp>1361302701043</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 14:38:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361307458561-3</Id><Title>IBM = the dog of the dow</Title><Msg>unfrickenbelievable</Msg><Username>whoozyurdaddi</Username><Timestamp>1361307458561</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 15:57:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361307873540-4</Id><Title>DELL beat by a penny</Title><Msg>lol fwiw</Msg><Username>whoozyurdaddi</Username><Timestamp>1361307873540</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 16:04:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361332430013-5</Id><Topic><Title>Sequester Spending Cuts</Title><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1361295764707</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 12:42:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Write your congressmen with recommendations for spending cuts.
