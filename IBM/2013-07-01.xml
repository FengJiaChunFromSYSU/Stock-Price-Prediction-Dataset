They said that consulting contracts were down by an unexpected 10% which was most of the miss. Accenture had a ttm p/e over 18 before the report which was about 30% higher than IBM. IBM has a more diversified book of revenues than ACN. And it's a slower grower than ACN in good times and rough patches. IBM gets around 75% of annual revenue from the beginning backlog which provides IBM stability and predictability. The remaining 25% of sales breakdown into two components -- Sales to the existing base, Sales to new customers. I'll get concerned when I see IBM's margins start to rollover. IBM has been able to raise margins by avoiding low margin or commodity product and moving to higher margin business like innovative software and engineered systems. It's because of margin pressure that there is speculation that IBM is trying to sell its Intel server business. It makes sense for IBM to shrink down to the highest margin hardware and buy hardware when it's appropriate for a contract. This is exactly what ORCL is doing. So I thought the reaction to ACN and before that ORCL was overdone. I listened to the replay of the CFO at the Barkleys conference on May 24 and he went into some detail about the $450 mil that did not close in Q1. Said it was high margin revenue including big software deals. He also said that IBM would hit the $3.79 composite for Q2 and acknowledged that the deal carryover would be a tailwind for Q2. Also, he expected a pickup 2H with a double digit earnings performance in Q4. The replay is on IBM's site.</Msg><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1372690154414</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-01 10:49:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372692160068-9</Id><Topic><Title>Strong Sell 204 - 205</Title><Username>p1sorell</Username><Timestamp>1372687766003</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-01 10:09:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>your 1st post makes more sense.

The fully burdened cost of an IBM consultant with office space, insurance, electricity, healthcare, benefits, travel expenses, etc. is around $125/hour. Nobody said that was their average income. Besides, they are not booked 100% of the time - not even close. Thus layoffs and outsourcing are the only answer. And by the way - people making $50k per year do not pay 50% income tax. In fact that is the second problem. Most families with incomes that low pay no tax at all - only half of all American workers pay income tax. That was the final issue that sank Romney in the 2012 election. There was no point appealing to most people with lower taxes because they don't pay any tax. Finally, anyone with an advanced degree in engineering or science who works for $85K per year is a major failure. The average income for graduates from top schools with advanced degrees is more than $250K per year - and that's just the average which includes all graduates - very young through retirees. Mid-career advanced degree holders from Ivy league schools average around $300K.</Msg><Username>jand2357</Username><Timestamp>1372715412205</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-01 17:50:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372717652568-16</Id><Topic><Title>BEARISH Territory</Title><Username>hedgecutter10</Username><Timestamp>1372712098448</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-01 16:54:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I appreciate your insight.
