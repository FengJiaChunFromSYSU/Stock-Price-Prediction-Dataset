Ryan is a disgrace to all Catholics. Liars both, and no friend to the working man." That's right you welfare sucking parasite. Were the 1% here you dope. You have to fight fire with fire. Obama didn't underperform in the first debate. He can't run from his record or policies. During the time he has been President permits to drill for oil on Gov't land were cut by 50% and gas prices have doubled He sat on the Canadian Keystone pipeline for 3 years with lame EPA #$%$..Being green is good but not if you do stupid things. The "Arab Spring" could hit Saudi Arabia and those fat sheiks could get slaughtered - Iran tried to kill the Saudi Ambassador to the UN. And we know some of the folks that got Gov't loans for solar panels that cost twice as much as they could be sold for that went belly up were big fund aggregators for Barry. That is a disgrace because it's a clear payoff. He is dragging this country down by the income redistribution necessary to achieve "social justice" which is equal outcomes for all. He is going to spout more #$%$ tonight. Barry is going to lose big time.</Msg><Username>yield_of_my_dreams</Username><Timestamp>1350386437825</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 07:20:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350397092015-2</Id><Title>Time to sell IBM</Title><Msg>IBM best DOW short now.</Msg><Username>pn1409</Username><Timestamp>1350397092015</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 10:18:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350397280066-3</Id><Topic><Title>Time to sell IBM</Title><Username>pn1409</Username><Timestamp>1350397092015</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 10:18:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Apple has run up more why not short that you #$%$ Go away</Msg><Username>colorado_dude4u</Username><Timestamp>1350397280066</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 10:21:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350399409609-4</Id><Topic><Title>Buy $182</Title><Username>qofaslave69</Username><Timestamp>1338496083000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-05-31 16:28:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The chart shows a cup with handle pattern with a $208.09 buy point.

ARMONK, N.Y., October 16, 2012 . . . IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced third-quarter 2012 diluted earnings of $3.33 per share, a year-to-year increase of 4 percent, or $3.44 per share, up 8 percent excluding the impact of UK pension-related charges. Operating (non-GAAP) diluted earnings were $3.62 per share, compared with operating diluted earnings of $3.28 per share in the third quarter of 2011, an increase of 10 percent. Third-quarter net income was $3.8 billion, flat year-to-year; or $3.9 billion, up 3 percent excluding the impact of UK pension-related charges. Operating (non-GAAP) net income was $4.2 billion compared with $4.0 billion in the third quarter of 2011, an increase of 5 percent. Total revenues for the third quarter of 2012 of $24.7 billion were down 5 percent (down 2 percent, adjusting for currency) from the third quarter of 2011. Currency negatively impacted revenue growth by nearly $1 billion. “In the third quarter, we continued to drive margin, profit and earnings growth through our focus on higher-value businesses, strategic growth initiatives and productivity,” said Ginni Rometty, IBM chairman, president and chief executive officer. “Looking ahead, we see good opportunity with a strong product lineup heading into this quarter and annuity businesses that provide a solid base of revenue, profit and cash. We are reiterating our full-year 2012 operating earnings per share expectation of at least $15.10.” Third-Quarter GAAP — Operating (non-GAAP) Reconciliation Third-quarter operating (non-GAAP) diluted earnings exclude $0.29 per share of charges: $0.12 per share for the amortization of purchased intangible assets and other acquisition-related charges, and $0.17 per share for retirement-related charges, including $0.11 per share for the impact of UK pension-related charges. sec</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1350424549958</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 17:55:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350424565690-94</Id><Title>tomorrow you wont be able to sell shares for 200</Title><Msg>ibm is going back to test 190 and more than likely back to 183</Msg><Username>itsabuy11</Username><Timestamp>1350424565690</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 17:56:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350424592399-95</Id><Title>ibm will be in the 200 range tomorrow and for the next ten years</Title><Msg>IBM is a dead stock , it is not a buy at this level .IBM will be trading in the same range for years and lower .</Msg><Username>hout5615</Username><Timestamp>1350424592399</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 17:56:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350424993176-96</Id><Topic><Title>ibm will be in the 200 range tomorrow and for the next ten years</Title><Username>hout5615</Username><Timestamp>1350424592399</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 17:56:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you can be assured it will be trading below 200 thursday if not tomorrow...its going on a downtrend from here, going back to test 190 and more than likely breaking below that for awhile..i think 183 because the market is going to correct in october after heading up and up since june, the correction is overdue...this correction(10+%) will probably start after the majority of earnings are released if not sooner</Msg><Username>itsabuy11</Username><Timestamp>1350424993176</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 18:03:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350425193125-97</Id><Title>How this body shoppee is doing AH?

I think this company is priced to perfection and sub 190 may be in the cards over the next couple of months. The trillions that the gov't threw at big business is losing its' effectiveness and all this "growth" is a mere mirage imo. Bear markets are coming, did anybody hear the music stop or is it still playing?
