What is your definition of progress? 46 million on food stamps, a ton more on disability than in 2008. From 5T to 16T in debt. If you can't stand Romney at least vote for a third party candidate.</Msg><Username>tr01742</Username><Timestamp>1352107596880</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-05 04:26:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352108320556-2</Id><Title>The Devil they know is better than the devil they don't know</Title><Msg>I think that is how some people are going to think when they cast a vote for Pres. Obama. Maybe this country needs to be plunged into an economic abyss and undergo an upheaval to get straightened out. Even if Romney gets elected we may still be headed in that direction.</Msg><Username>tr01742</Username><Timestamp>1352108320556</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-05 04:38:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352110329249-3</Id><Topic><Title>The Devil they know is better than the devil they don't know</Title><Username>tr01742</Username><Timestamp>1352108320556</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-05 04:38:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Snoop Dogie Dog has got to go.</Msg><Username>yield_of_my_dreams</Username><Timestamp>1352110329249</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-05 05:12:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352116383756-4</Id><Topic><Title>Ultra conservative flip flap RR (Rom &amp; Ry) will make you poor and most companies will go BK</Title><Username>salmon_the_man</Username><Timestamp>1352073500166</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 18:58:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>1) Romney and Ryan are republicans, but they are not conservative. 2) Pres. Obama approved of Bush's policy of bailing out the banks, kept Guantanimo (spelling) and kept the war in Iraq going for a few more years despite his promises. Pres. Obama is the half black version of Pres. Bush. 3) If you had the chance to vote for JFK, you probably would, because he was a democrat. You might ignore the fact that he believed in tax cuts for citizens and a strong military , which is in direct conflict with Democrat party principles now. JFK couldn't be a democrat. Not sure what party he would be a member of now.</Msg><Username>tr01742</Username><Timestamp>1352116383756</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-05 06:53:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352123169144-5</Id><Topic><Title>Ultra conservative flip flap RR (Rom &amp; Ry) will make you poor and most companies will go BK</Title><Username>salmon_the_man</Username><Timestamp>1352073500166</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 18:58:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes, I learned that Bush would just suck it up and act presidential, unlike ACORN Activist Obama, and take the heat for Barney Frank's and Chris Dodd's mismanagement of Freddie and Fannie (their encouragement and threats of/to banks to lend to the uncreditworthy... the root cause of the financial meltdown). ACORN Activist Obama never had the decency to call those two out or acknowledge that Bush tried several times to reign those two in. So much for "fairness", huh? A real piece of work.</Msg><Username>thatgdgreenspan</Username><Timestamp>1352123169144</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-05 08:46:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352123699750-6</Id><Topic><Title>MITT ROMNEY WILL SAVE AMERICA</Title><Username>savingamerica347</Username><Timestamp>1352047874383</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 11:51:14 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Cut govt spending.

Corporations are sitting on huge amounts of cash, afraid to invest it, or buying back their own stock (essentiall shrinking instead of expanding and hiring people). They are holding foreign earnings overseas to keep from paying the planet's highest corporate tax rate by bringing it back to America and Obama's tax collectors... WE NEED IT HERE! "Domestic stock" mutual funds' assets are shrinking... bond funds, gold funds and "foreign stock" funds are expanding. If Obama is re-elected, his daily threats to punish individuals and corporations with investment capital will drive even more investment capital out of the country and into un-productive assets like gold and treasuries... just like it did in Cuba under Castro and Venezuela under Chavez... both socialist leaders that support and endorse Barack Obama. We NEED that capital HERE, invested in AMERICAN business and employing AMERICAN workers.
