Last month was the IPO of DATA and it raised $254.2mm at $31 per share, closing its first day of trading up 63.7% to $50.75! DATA is now $54.42 up 75.5% from its IPO and is trading with a market cap of $3.13 billion with sales of only $143mm! The VC firm that funded Facebook (FB), Accel, just announced that they are investing $100mm to start Big Data Fund 2. According to Google Trends, interest in Big Data Analytics has soared every single month in 2013 so far - with buzz up 66.7% since the end of 2012. In the 19 months since Accel formed their first $100mm Big Data Fund, buzz about Big Data Analytics has increased 567%! More Big Data companies are expected to file for IPOs very soon! We are about to experience a modern day Gold Rush as Big Data revolutionizes a wide range of industries - including the cable TV industry! An article "How Big Data Keeps Cable TV Watchers Hooked" recently published discusses how cable TV operators are using Big Data to launch ad campaigns that follow users from TV to the web, while stopping users from migrating to NFLX. The #1 Big Data Analytics firm serving pay-TV operators is already public, but nobody is even aware of it yet: Concurrent Computer (CCUR). CCUR could double or triple fast as Big Data investors begin to discover it! CCUR is currently $7.50 with an enterprise value of only $43.29mm or 0.68X sales of $63.23mm vs. DATA trading with a price/sales ratio of 22! CCUR only needs a business valuation of 2X sales for it to more than double to $17, and a business valuation of 3X sales for it to more than triple to $24.22! CCUR's revenues, gross profits, operating income, and EPS - has risen quarter-after-quarter for 12 months straight! CCUR's 3Q EPS was up 175% YOY and its 4Q results could be very strong due to the recent signing of a HUGE deal with Virgin Media! CCUR has an amazing looking chart!</Msg><Username>goodwe212</Username><Timestamp>1372247091273</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 07:44:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372249745643-2</Id><Topic><Title>Ready to Explode</Title><Username>goodwe212</Username><Timestamp>1372247091273</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 07:44:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The acceptance and early reviews of IBM's new BLU Acceleration supports your comments Hopefully this will support the price of the IBM stock</Msg><Username>bob787m</Username><Timestamp>1372249745643</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 08:29:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372250395115-3</Id><Title>ibm is overvalued here.......</Title><Msg>this should be revealed about the time of earnings.......</Msg><Username>txtrader77</Username><Timestamp>1372250395115</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 08:39:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372252041042-4</Id><Title>PUMPING THE QUARTER</Title><Msg>IBM 199 - 201.</Msg><Username>p1sorell</Username><Timestamp>1372252041042</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 09:07:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372252137678-5</Id><Topic><Title>ibm is overvalued here.......</Title><Username>txtrader77</Username><Timestamp>1372250395115</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 08:39:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That was an intriguing subject and I was hoping to be enlightened by following facts and reasoning.

Can't agree. It's Neo-Classic 2.0 if I've ever seen it, and I've seen it before. Oh yes! Clearly Neo-Classic at its base. That said, I thought we were not going to have pissey to push around anymore. If you must though, let's see a little better effort in the future.

I can remember way back before I finished college when everyone predicted that DEC would put them out of business. Then it was SUN. Then it was Compaq and the Intel revolution. We have certainly all been hearing about the death of the mainframe since 1990. I can name a dozen more - EDS, EMC, DELL, AAPL, HPQ, Oracle, etc. Every one of these companies was going to just walk away with a huge chunk of IBM's business. And it never happens. But half the people here still believe that complete collapse is just around the corner. What a bunch of idiots.</Msg><Username>jand2357</Username><Timestamp>1372280981701</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 17:09:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372294070611-18</Id><Topic><Title>Ready to Explode</Title><Username>goodwe212</Username><Timestamp>1372247091273</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 07:44:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>When things explode they disintegrate, so you headline is appropriate for this pig stock</Msg><Username>teamb562</Username><Timestamp>1372294070611</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 20:47:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message></Date>
