I believe that America had it about right after Roosevelt's "new deal" but went overboard with Johnson's "great society". Obama's takeover of student lending and healthcare... in addition to huge increases in food stamps and endless, 2-year extensions of unemployment benefits amounts to "piling on" and is the reason our debt-to-GDP ratio will exceed that of Greece about 3 years into his 2nd term. In a 2nd Obama term, I know for a fact that a lot of business owners and employers will head to their respective economic bomb shelters rather than building their businesses and hiring people. Obama generates a lot of fear in the people who make our economy work, which is the reason why no one will expand their business more than is absolutely necessary or hire anybody unless they're severely short-handed. As for Obama supporters, 80% of them surveyed aren't aware that employers pay employment taxes beyond the employee taxes that they withhold in paychecks and pass on to the IRS... ... and get this... 98% of Obama supporters surveyed do not know that the reason why Mitt Romney's taxes are under 15% is because his dividend earnings are "double taxed"... at both his personal level AND at the corporate level of the company that paid them (wages and salaries are "deducted" by companies that pay them whereas dividends are not deductable). If Obama succeeds in raising the top tax bracket to 39.6% on dividend income... and the U.S. corporate tax rate remains at 35% (the highest rate in the industrial world), then the total tax bill on dividends will top out at a whopping 74.6%...... ...... once again, only 2% of Obama supporters are even AWARE of that... but I can assure you that EVERY multi-national corporation out there, including IBM, is aware of that and it will go a LONG ways toward determining where those corporations do business and hire their employees. The biggest problem with American elections, by far, is American ignorance.
