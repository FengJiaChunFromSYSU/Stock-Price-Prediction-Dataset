Because of the low dividend payout ratio, the company should be able to raise distributions above the rate of earnings growth for at least a decade." They might be able to and I'd like to see it but they probably won't. The 18.8% av includes some big hikes to make up for some years when the increase was minuscule -- Gerstner's restructuring put IBM behind its 2003 and forward performance which resulted in big catch-up dividend hikes. The IBM BOD has made two things clear, 1. They prefer big buybacks to big dividend increases, 2. They want the trailing payout ratio to be no more than 25%. I expect an increase from $.85 to $.95 and possibly a stretch to $1 buy t that would be a 17.6% increase on an operating EPS run rate around 14% with Free Cash Flow up about 9.6% for 2012. While I'm sure IBM could grow into a $1, the IBM BOD has been very disciplined when it comes to staying with a conservative payout. IBM wants to grow into a bigger dividend my growing eanings but also by reducing share count, and reducing share count has had the priority since 2003.</Msg><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1363988476788</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 17:41:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
