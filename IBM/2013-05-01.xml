Rometti is following the Palmisano tactic of borrowing to increase the dividend and fund buybacks further increasing the negative net worth... their outsourcing strategy for margins is nearing the end of the runway..... soon it will be "cook the books time" just as we did during Akers last years before he was replaced by that great financial engineer.. Gerstner.. .. stock should enter a slow and long slide towards the latter half with Rometti busy buying shares to prevent the slide further exarcerbating a bad situation.. maybe she can persuade Buffet to join in and throw good money after bad.. and bring down Berkshire H as well..</Msg><Username>pbludde</Username><Timestamp>1367413670467</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 09:07:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367421280637-2</Id><Title>playing the 207ish gap left from earnings</Title><Msg>The Bernank will come thru.

Just sitting here drinking... I was pondering, what IBM does with all that other money they earn???? Before this ER...They were reporting ttm, $14.50 per shr.. Hit that by 1.1B shrs!! That equates to a lot more money, than the $5B stk buy back and about $4B in dividends!! Lets at least, promote doofus to Dumb A!!!!!! As for Buffet and even Gates.. I have never considered them no more than people in the right place at the right time... Too become one of the richest people on the planet.... They took advantage of a lot of people.. Every time I see one of them... I would love to smack thier little smerks off thier faces!!! While everybody else considers them as geniuses.. I consider them as #$%$ of the earth, that have just took advantage of a lot of honest people!!!!! Now they are going to share all that money, which I consider they basically stole, with the rest of the world!!! Big deal!! What about the people they took advantage of?? That if treated fairly.. May be well off!! BTW: I ain't never invested in msft or berkshire....They didn't F me out of nothing!!! BTW: What the old farts tell you about life!!! They never told me when you turn 70.. Your deack falls off!!! I turned 70 in March.. Everybody can kiss my .............Just a little info for anyone turning 70!!!!</Msg><Username>jrmills0014</Username><Timestamp>1367433613404</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 14:40:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367434099846-7</Id><Title>Long term holders of IBM should welcome a priced drop...</Title><Msg>The more the price goes down now, the more shares are retired in the share buyback program, Also, short term price drops are caused by 'weak hands' selling to 'strong hands'</Msg><Username>ibji</Username><Timestamp>1367434099846</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 14:48:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>11</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367436901748-8</Id><Topic><Title>IBM might just be the ticker to monitor this year.</Title><Username>garyholmes11</Username><Timestamp>1367436249179</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 15:24:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>may the rally continue</Msg><Username>wesleyanthony618</Username><Timestamp>1367436901748</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 15:35:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367447870889-9</Id><Topic><Title>Long term holders of IBM should welcome a priced drop...</Title><Username>ibji</Username><Timestamp>1367434099846</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 14:48:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So then AAPL was a buy at $705 and RIMM was an even better buy at $85.</Msg><Username>jand2357</Username><Timestamp>1367447870889</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 18:37:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367453910194-10</Id><Topic><Title>Shorting IBM at 215 in March and covering at 197 AH was like taking a candy...</Title><Username>n59218</Username><Timestamp>1366332209326</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 20:43:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>froznicehole: That's the key right there ... where you focus makes all the difference!
