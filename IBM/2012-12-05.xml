Simply put, President Obama has been threatening for years to punish capitalism with high taxes on those who provide and deploy investment capital into the U.S. The special dividends are simply a final, low-tax distribution to shareholders before the dark ages of U.S. investment sets in... ... probably accompanied by low growth, high un-employment, and minimal capital investment that is so characteristic of the countries that have followed the path of socialism and wealth re-distribution before us. We saw just the opposite in 1997, as Bill Clinton worked with the new, GOP dominated congress to lower capital gains taxes and unleash a torrent of tax revenues that grew the economy, minimized unemployment and balanced the budget. Obama's anti-capitalism crusade of punishing the sources of those same revenue streams should be expected to produce the exact opposite result. As for the special dividends themselves, under better presidential leadership, the companies paying these dividends might be expected to RETAIN those earnings and invest them into new american industry and more american jobs. I would contend that it isn't just getting under the wire on the 15% dividend tax that's driving the torrent of special dividends... but also the fact that many american companies simply don't see growth opportunities in the U.S. over the next 4 years, so they may as well return the money to shareholders to ship offshore or dive into bonds and gold. Socialism is a harsh lesson for countries to learn about in this way... but few american citizens truly understand what they're doing when a 20-something votes for Obama because he saw him on TV with Justin Bieber... ... Mr. Obama was highly reliant on such voters to NOT have an understanding of what his main supporters... Hugo Chavez and Raul Castro... had done to their countries before Mr. Obama set his sites on doing likewise to ours.
