Rates going up in the USA will be a counterbalancing effect since USD should get stronger. So IBM should see actual sales go up but translation back into a stronger dollar will hurt GAAP revenues. What mitigates the above is that IBM sources a lot of labor and materials in foreign currency since they, like most US based multinationals, leave foreign cash in place to avoid paying extra taxes by deploying it in the USA. I'm sure that was a consideration that helped move IBM's supply chain to China. That's how it is -- so a lot of IBM expenses and costs will be in foreign currencies and since it works both ways you should continue to see IBM's margins go up even if translated revenue rolls back from currency translation. I can't provide a breakdown but IBM's margins are going up for three reasons: 1. Cost reduction due to efficiency gains, 2. The move away from commodity biz to high value and unique software &amp; hardware, 3. Sourcing cost-of-goods-sold and labor in currencies weakening against the dollar. So while revenue will look like it's drooping the flip side of the coin is margin improvement.</Msg><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1373030230225</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-05 09:17:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373031533843-3</Id><Topic><Title>EU and England Easing Monetary Policy -- Impacts on IBM GAAP Revenue &amp; Expenses</Title><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1373030230225</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-05 09:17:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>very good but at the end of the day, will IBM 'miss' ?</Msg><Username>zer0t0l</Username><Timestamp>1373031533843</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-05 09:38:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373034917054-4</Id><Topic><Title>EU and England Easing Monetary Policy -- Impacts on IBM GAAP Revenue &amp; Expenses</Title><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1373030230225</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-05 09:17:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"...will IBM miss ?" If you're talking about Q2, I think that IBM will meet and probably exceed the $3.79 analyst composite. During the 5/24 or 5/29 whichever it was Barklays IT conference, the IBM CFO said that about $450 mil of deals fit their "rolled forward" category and that for a Q2 they usually see about $150 mil roll forward. He credited the big roil over for the weak Q1. He also answered a question about the Q1 shift and acknowledged that it would be a tailwind for Q2. Her also expected a pick up 2H and said Q4 Operating EPS should be up double digits.</Msg><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1373034917054</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-05 10:35:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373037700959-5</Id><Title>IBM will be back in 195$ range EoD:220$ next week ER</Title><Msg>Pickup MCD too if close above 50dma ===================== eom =============================</Msg><Username>ngmike18</Username><Timestamp>1373037700959</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-05 11:21:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373037717734-6</Id><Topic><Title>Support our DOD VETS move your 401k's and IRA 's to cash Send Wall Street and Congress a message</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1372798545628</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 16:55:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Support our VETS move to cash send a message to WALL STREET and CONGRESS that it is wrong not to support our VETS and there families</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1373037717734</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-05 11:21:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>16</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373038496753-7</Id><Topic><Title>Support our DOD VETS move your 401k's and IRA 's to cash Send Wall Street and Congress a message</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1372798545628</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 16:55:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm a vet.

Then IBM trades down. The CFO was not shy about saying IBM would see earnings up the 8% forecast by the analysts -- $3.79. He also acknowledged that the Q1 roll over of deals will be a tailwind for Q2 so that agrees with what the CFO and CEO said about not getting new deals signed or new services up and running on time. Based on what they have said you have to either think that it's a big con of some sort to get holders to hold or it's the truth. It's obviously going to be a decent Q2. As to 2H, the CFO said he expected a pick up and double digit earnings growth in Q4. You can find the Barklay's conference webcast replay at IBM's site under financial presentations.</Msg><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1373047210314</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-05 14:00:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373048453350-20</Id><Topic><Title>IBM will be back in 195$ range EoD:220$ next week ER</Title><Username>ngmike18</Username><Timestamp>1373037700959</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-05 11:21:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The big question??
