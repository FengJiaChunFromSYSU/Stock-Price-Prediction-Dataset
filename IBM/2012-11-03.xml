No amount of "retraining" and "education" is going to change that. Chrysler is a perfect example. Obama bailed out Chrysler with taxpayer money, allowed it to be sold to the Italians, and now new jobs are being created in China instead of the U.S.. You might blame Obama for that, but I don't. It's Economics 101. On the plus side, jobs sent and created abroad have lifted hundreds of millions out of true poverty (not the U.S.'s liberal definition of poverty) and has promoted world peace. The issue here is competence and integrity, of which this president has very little.</Msg><Username>thatgdgreenspan</Username><Timestamp>1351944883199</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 08:14:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351957971817-2</Id><Title>DO WE GIVE THIS GUY FOUR-MORE-YEARS - TO LEARN THE JOB, A..M.E.R.I.C.A. ???</Title><Msg>I VOTE ROMNEY/RYAN PERIOD.....</Msg><Username>flashywildwest</Username><Timestamp>1351957971817</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 11:52:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351958669121-3</Id><Topic><Title>MITT ROMNEY WILL SAVE AMERICA</Title><Username>savingamerica167</Username><Timestamp>1351255401611</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 08:43:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I got a bunch of thumbs down for stating tax cuts are healthy and historically proven? Plenty of people apparently aren't interested in what steps can help the economy.
