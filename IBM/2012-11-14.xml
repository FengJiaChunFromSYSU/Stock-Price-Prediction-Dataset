The point is that interest rates and equity values used to be determined by buyers and sellers through booms and busts until 9/11. Then Greenspan kept rates low for years and produced the real estate bubble of 2005 - 2007. Now the Fed is buying $40 bil of mortgage securities per month because there is no longer a secondary mortgage market in this country as existed in the late '70's through 2002 which allowed the baby boomers to buy houses. The point is that by leveraging up the Treasury &amp; Fed have absorbed some of the effects of Americans deleveraging after the bubble burst in 2008. But at some point US debt is going to turn down because of the sheer amount of it. Rick wants to take the hit sooner rather than later because the deficit is growing currently at $120 bil per month. The cliff is growing $4 bil per day even though for the last 19 quarters since Q1 2008 consumer spending has only grown an average of .7% per Q while it averaged an increase of 3.6% per Q in the 10 years from 1998 thru 2007. So Rick wants to take the hit now at about $16.5 trillion of debt instead of taking it at $20 trillion. Rick thinks the dive off a $20 trillion cliff will be fatal. He also things income tax alone won't get it done. A wealth tax is another option. I hope this helps.</Msg><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1352913982362</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 12:26:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352915197184-12</Id><Topic><Title>SANTELLI !!! you are a people person</Title><Username>jgiled</Username><Timestamp>1352909696934</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 11:14:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No that did help My problem is manipulation of the market using HFT's and super computers that are the reason for quick selloffs in the market</Msg><Username>jgiled</Username><Timestamp>1352915197184</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 12:46:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352916415931-13</Id><Topic><Title>New York (Obama) Times</Title><Username>p1sorell</Username><Timestamp>1352903473805</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 09:31:13 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>sore(ll) LOSER!
