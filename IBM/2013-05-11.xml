Large block trades are executed to fractions of a cent. And complex trades that include stock, options, bonds, and futures often have very complex pricing where the stock portion is quoted to many decimal places because that is the breakdown from the overall cost of the position. It's amazing that someone would comment on something they know nothing about, then defend the comment. Maybe you should consider the possibility that the multitrillion dollar world of investing has some underlying dynamics that you aren't familiar with.</Msg><Username>jand2357</Username><Timestamp>1368330472391</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-11 23:47:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
