IBM could be in for price pressure for a long time. At this point it does look like Goldman is right. Earnings in Q2 should be good given the CFO's comments. Goldman downgraded IBM about a week before Q2 earnings in July 2009 and the stock dropped down to just below $100 and then within a few days after earnings the stock shot up to $115 and never looked back. I remember it well because Goldman scared me out and I bought back in $115 - $118. Hope it works out this time -- but it looks like it will take longer to get back to an upward slope this time. If IBM's outlook isn't good it will get a few downgrades.</Msg><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1373370337693</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 07:45:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373370627396-4</Id><Topic><Title>IBM downgraded by Goldman</Title><Username>approval_myass</Username><Timestamp>1373367231627</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 06:53:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>so if Goldman was DEAD wrong on IBM in 2009, why do we need to pay attention to them in 2013?

Unfortunately, we believe that pressures on IBM’s growth markets and higher-margin revenue streams may intensify in the near term, weakening some of the key sources of IBM’s earnings and cash flow resiliency in coming quarters.” Furthermore, Goldman Sachs lowered its 2013-2015 estimates on IBM. For 2013, Goldman now expects revenue and EPS to be $103.66 billion and $16.61, down from $104.44 billion and $16.71. For 2014, the firm sees revenues of $105.67, down from $106.73 billion, and EPS of $17.92, down from $18.10. For 2015, revenues are expected to be $108.12 billion, down from $109.21 billion, and EPS is expected to be $20.01, down from $20.07." So Goldman now sees $20.01 down from its prior est. of $20.07 for 2015.</Msg><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1373375548463</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 09:12:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373376763010-15</Id><Topic><Title>Forget more stock buybacks...find some REVENUE!</Title><Username>approval_myass</Username><Timestamp>1373375507008</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 09:11:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It seems like all of these buybacks just provide stock for stock options to make the executives richer.

IBM is the poster child for this. A very small percentage change in the stocks price has a disproportinate effect on the Dow Jones Avr. It easy to come up with some "probably" or "what if" story to base a down grade on. The money wont be made trading IBM. The traders will flock to shares like Ford that sell at low prices on high volume. You can make some quick bucks there where a small move is a significant percentage of the share price. We see these games being played constantly. I agree with those who advise you to get out of IBM if you have a time horizon of less than a few years. You will be getting whip sawed constantly.

The3 2014 Goldman est was $18.10 and it was lowered to $17.92 so that is about 1% lower. Goldman's 2015 est went from $20.07 to $20.01 which is about 3/10 of 1%. Goldman did lower its 12 month share price target from $220 to $200 so that's material. Goldman upgraded IBM to a buy in late 2011 after Buffett bought in. So IBM's 2012 share price performance and thus far in 2013 have not been very good. But there is nothing in Goldman's notes that would indicate a weak Q2 for IBM. In fact the CFO pretty much said it would be a beat because of deals that slipped into Q2 from Q1. So there's not going to be a warning. I don't think IBM has warned in the last 6-7 years -- They would probably not warn unless earnings are going to be off by 5% or more.I believe it warned in 2006.</Msg><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1373382381844</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 11:06:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373383047039-23</Id><Title>Why Should Anyone Trust Goldman?</Title><Msg>Or any other anal-ysts?

In fact, many new SAAS companies simply don't make any money at all in a bid to maintain growth &amp; market share. This obviously puts pricing pressure on companies like IBM and Oracle in this space, never mind pressure on traditional hosted software sales. So sure, there is a good chance the short term outlook will prove challenging. If for nothing else, traditional vendors like IBM, Oracle, SAP, &amp; MSFT are only now beginning to seriously get into the cloud computing game. But, all that said, I would bet on all these companies long term. These companies all make serious money. They have deep war chests, brand, great cash flow &amp; balance sheets. The certainly have the infrastructure &amp; platform components that underpin the cloud. They also have applications that are and continue to be ported as SAAS. IBM in particular comes out with seminal computer science. The R&amp;D budget is $6 billion annually. Is this kind of company really going to lose to WorkDay, SalesForce, and Amazon over the long haul? I don't think so. I think IBM will be prospering in another 100 years...much like the past 100 years. I think it is a good buy at a current PE of 13. Not a bargain, but a very good buy. My advice is to buy in with 50% of your money, holding the rest for dips. Reinvest dividends. You won't go wrong with this long term, particularly for retirement accounts.</Msg><Username>banmate7</Username><Timestamp>1373394041799</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 14:20:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373400576947-32</Id><Title>Goldman lowers estimate a dime....stock tanks</Title><Msg>If you sell this stock based on these morons and 10 cents then I want you out anyway....go!</Msg><Username>ned_digger</Username><Timestamp>1373400576947</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 16:09:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373404648937-33</Id><Topic><Title>Bummer ..

A couple of yrs ago(before I went broke)... IBM was bouncing around $100... Over a period of time.. I had bought $50K worth of $100., $105. + $110. calls... The Fri before they were to expire!! They were worth about $2K!! GS or one of the other thieving b*****ds downgraded it!! I sit here all day.. Thinking should I just take what little I could recoup?? Decided!! F it, let them have it all.. It traded at about $100. all that Fri.. Next week, it went up $15.53??? I ended up making a decent little hit.. But the money I could have made if I hadn't started selling off those 200 calls as it started up the following wk!!! Now was this downgrade, truthfull or, was it because they want to buy??? Hey good luck!!! Here is the question, you can't get an answer to!!! Did GS sell those calls and want the stk down, so those calls will expire worthless... Or was the downgrade, Because they want to buy all the stk, they can, as cheap as possible, going into earnings... Hey!! They ain't in the mkt to lose money!!!!! BTW: I ain't got one penny in mkt anymore!!! But the last thing I would have expected today!!! Was to see IBM, take a hit like this, with mkt up 75pts?? Guess thats why I went broke.. I would have bet a bundle, it couldn't happen.... Just remember, when you are playing options.. If enough dummies are playing it one way.. They ain't doing anything but betting the ones with trillions, they can't drive it the other..How you think, they got those trillions???? They are good at this game!!!!! I was pretty good at it..

Lets help drive it lower.. Lets do like the big boys do!!!! IBM is headed to $170. If you ain't needing to sell.. Just talk #$%$ about it!!! Then go out and buy some long term calls on it!!!! Right now amzn is trading at $100. more per shr than IBM... In 2014, amzn is projected to earn $3.21 On big earnings growth, from $1.31 in 2013.. And IBM is projected to earn $18.31??? While IBM's per shr "" earnings growth"" of $1.70 will be nothing compared to AMZN.. Sooner or later, even the dumbest sob on this planet should realize a stk projected to earn $3.21 per shr in 2014, shouldn't be worth $100. More than one that is projected to earn $18.31 per shr??? And you can bet those figures for IBM are pretty close to being correct, with a little conservitizm built in!! AMZN, who knows???? They could still be losing money?? In the mean time, IBM missed last qtr, and are deffinantly going to miss this qtr, per GS!!! May be headed to $150.????? BTW: I could understand it if amzn had very little stk outstanding... But they got about half as much outstanding stk as IBM has!!!! I think its like 450M to 1.1B shrs... Hell IBM may drop to $120. after they miss for second qtr, in a row!!! Unless you need to sell.. Rejoice!! And take a toe hold!!!!</Msg><Username>jrmills0014</Username><Timestamp>1373412275543</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 19:24:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373420066677-37</Id><Title>Downgrade?
