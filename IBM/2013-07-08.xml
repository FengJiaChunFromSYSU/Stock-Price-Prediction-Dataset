Your message is not only muddled, it's just plain silly. Go back to the mint" Something has to give. The gov't can't just keep spending. So there were no July 4 fireworks at many military bases. In some cases they spent $100k on big fireworks displays. And we need priorities. The $7 b to build electric grids in Africa will necessitate further cutbacks. So who's going to cry about some DOD contractors?</Msg><Username>man_the_ramparts</Username><Timestamp>1373290562832</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-08 09:36:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373291131078-5</Id><Title>IBM next stop 199.50$ @200dma</Title><Msg>========================== eom ==========================================</Msg><Username>ngmike18</Username><Timestamp>1373291131078</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-08 09:45:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373294757933-6</Id><Topic><Title>DOD VETS get furloughed this week for 11 weeks, Wall Street say they support VETS , but they don't</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1373251783880</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-07 22:49:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The almost 800,000 DOD workers are about 90% veterans and work for the GOV not contractors, That's right Wall Street which runs Congress does not have the right priorities and they need to be shown that we need to take care of our DOD VETS</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1373294757933</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-08 10:45:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>13</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373298779156-7</Id><Topic><Title>IBM and layoffs</Title><Username>jand2357</Username><Timestamp>1370366399824</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 13:19:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Buck up!

However, why don't they start with do-nothing managers? Why does IBM need so many VPs, directors, and GMs? IBM is top heavy. No, IBM stock holders should be grateful to American taxpayers for the lucrative contracts that IBM muscles from the US government. We are talking billions of dollars. IBM charges the government $200 per hour on a project, and then turns around and pays Indian or Chinese workers maybe $7 per hour. This is a major scam, and IBM is not the only corporation doing this.</Msg><Username>stnan</Username><Timestamp>1373311103359</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-08 15:18:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373318370786-14</Id><Topic><Title>IBM and layoffs</Title><Username>jand2357</Username><Timestamp>1370366399824</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 13:19:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>IBM has laid off a majority of people who have been with the company 20+ years and many who are retirement eligible with 30+ years with the company!
