The DOW Chairman said they saw both weak demand and they had to lower prices. These companies make materials used all across manufacturing around the world. This has to mean future production and inventory reductions to adjust to lower sales. Europe has both higher taxes and lower gov't spending. I've stayed in T &amp; VZ but that'[s it for equity for me for now. Looking to get back in IBM when the dust clears from the current overall market weakness.

By USA_Jewish_Women 10 22 2012 Great Impression: Mitt Romney's Stunning Turnaround in Past 3 Debates after Huge Negative Ads. The Reasons for Change is Obama has Lost the Support and Respect with Women Voters and Others. People Notice: Most Men and Women are Turned Off Against Barack Obama most everywhere and Across All 50 States, Here is the the Review of Debate 3 on October 22, 2012 By a Jewish Women Focus Group of 7,890 Women Connecticut Across America Our Strong Plea for Change in the White House, Why? The following reasons listed bellow. Note: This review is a agreement amongst a Group of almost 8000 Women watching debates. During the Debate 3, President Barack Obama was Arrogant, Disrespectfully, Angry, Rude and Condescending to Governor Mitt Romney. Obama did not Act or Look Presidential. We Feel Governor Mitt Romney Pasted the Presidential Test and is Ready to Lead USA We Support Mitt Romney, found him to be a Smart, Respectable and Decent Gentleman. Governor Mitt Romney Looked Much More Presidential, Ready to be Commander-in-Chief. Mitt Romney said America Needs a Strong Economy in order to have a Strong Military for our National Security right now and the Future. ...... We All Agree. Women came away from this Debate with a Very Good Impression of Governor Mitt Romney, in that he would be a “ A Safe Pair of Hands.” in Foreign Policy and a Strong Economy. We Trust Him More. Obama lied about Libya on 9 11 ( a 8 hour fire fight, Obama watched did nothing) In Foreign Policy We feel Mitt Romney is Tough Enough to do what’s necessary, but laid-back enough not to do too much and get us into another war. Miit Romney Did Not attack President Obama's Policies, he Simply Pointed Out a Few Needed Improvements in a Very Respectable Way. During the debate Governor Mitt Romney Seemed More Like a Leader, Smart, Respectable, Thoughtful and Considerate. He looked and Acted more Like the New American President that our Nation and the rest of the World Needs so Disparately in These Troubling Economic Times. Governor Mitt Romney was Calm, Thoughtful, Relaxed, Steady, Looked Like A Smart Gentleman and More Presidential. Romney Looked and Acted as if he was Ready to Take the Job as Commander-in-Chief ASAP. President Barack Obama Looked more like a Very Disparate Candidate and Challenger, very Negative, Acted like a Disrespectful Attack Dog Instead of the President of the United States. Mitt Romney Expressed his Concern about Iran's Nuclear Threat that is 4 Years Closer and the USA Support of Israel, our Good Friend and Middle East Ally. The strained relationship with the Obama Administration. Tonight Romney Impressed the Ladies Very much, in that a Vote for Him is a Vote for American Security, Peace and Safety, a Strong Economy, a Strong Military, Millions of Higher Paying Jobs, Prosperity for the Middle Class and Others. and a Quiet Peaceful Life for USA and all People. The World is Much to Scary these days, Americans Aren’t Looking For a Scary Arrogant, Angry. Rude, Disrespectfully and Weak President. Barack Obama is Not the One to Lead us Any Longer Tonight we Came Away with the Feeling that President Barack Obama is extremely a more Scary Candidate then the President of USA. We are Concerned about America's Weaken Relationship with Israel, a Nuclear Iran, our Weaken Economy and the Huge 16 Trillion Dollars Debt, that in itself Threatens our National Security. Americans, Black, White, Latinos, Wake Up, USA Debt is Bigger than our Gross National Product. We Can Not Afford Four More Years of President Obama's Spending, Borrowing and lies. We Can Not Afford Another 5 or 6 Trillion Dollars in More Debt From China or Other Countries. Our Jewish Women's Focus Group of almost 8000 Democrats Therefore Proudly Endorse Governor Mitt Romney as the Next President of the United States of America.
