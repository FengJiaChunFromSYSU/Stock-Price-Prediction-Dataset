This will kill customer support" Customers can be demanding and so can employees. I own the stock so I would like to see robust employment across all of IBM's segments. But that's not likely in the near term as revenue is headed the wrong way at present. On one hand, IBM's Services have been helped by providing Indian employment but on the other hand the Taiwanese have hurt IBM's hardware and may have already killed off IBM's Intel server biz. It's because some very capable people have been running IBM in the last 15 years that the company still exists. Incredibly it employees around 450k people around the world. If business is lost than you can't continue to pay people from revenues that don't result from their work -- at least not for long. If IBM had no Indian employees the Taiwanese would still be there and IBM would be a much smaller company. IBM is a global company and needs to transform itself constantly without the constraints of paying staff for work that has been lost to competitors. Although mistakes happen.</Msg><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1367245141165</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 10:19:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367246869522-5</Id><Title>This will pop out soon</Title><Msg>IBM will slide down as close at $196.25</Msg><Username>chidragon38</Username><Timestamp>1367246869522</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 10:47:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367247160647-6</Id><Title>IBM cut to Sell at Bernstein</Title><Msg>bloomberg</Msg><Username>xman34luv</Username><Timestamp>1367247160647</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 10:52:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367249617239-7</Id><Topic><Title>IBM cut to Sell at Bernstein</Title><Username>xman34luv</Username><Timestamp>1367247160647</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 10:52:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That's from Toni Sacconaghi who has not liked IBM for a long time. I believe he had a $160 price target on IBM in 2012. He has long questioned how IBM would grow enough revenue to hit the $20 per share 2015 boggy. He thinks it should have a lower p/e and he just isn't an IBM fan from the tone of his CC questions. But his concerns about revenue have been born out. He has also been amazed at the increase of IBM's efficiency and product mix in the form of IBM's Services margins. He pointed out a couple of calls back that IBM's margins were better than all of its Indian competitors. Toni Sacconaghi has been a big fan of AAPL and HPQ. I'm pretty sure he still has a $600 price target for AAPL. I believe he had a $60 target for HPQ before the last CEO was ousted after he paid $10 bil for Autonomy and announced that the PC division would be sold or spun out -- when it couldn't possibly be sold or spun out with 15%+ annual revenue drops just ahead. So Tony has mixed results for the stocks that I look at.</Msg><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1367249617239</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 11:33:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367253383178-8</Id><Title>IBm has 2% revenue growth....should sell at 200x earnings in this market</Title><Msg>new high for IBm is coming</Msg><Username>techglass1</Username><Timestamp>1367253383178</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 12:36:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367253884166-9</Id><Title>Back Above $200 After Dividend Increase</Title><Msg>No doubt about it, those who bought in again around $190 already reaping the benefits.</Msg><Username>nozupforyou</Username><Timestamp>1367253884166</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 12:44:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367254153796-10</Id><Topic><Title>IBm has 2% revenue growth....should sell at 200x earnings in this market</Title><Username>techglass1</Username><Timestamp>1367253383178</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 12:36:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Another week like this past week and we're there.

I buy great North American companies at fair or superior value, reinvesting dividends, and hold forever. Obviously I am an adherent of Benjamin Graham &amp; Warren Buffett. Suffice it to say, I have done extremely well investing this way since the mid 2000s. I just wish I studied &amp; practiced this earlier. As such, IBM is a great company for investors like me. It's been around for 100 years. IBM consistently invents seminal hardware &amp; software products. IBM has decent cash flow &amp; balance sheets. IBM is well positioned in big data, analytic, social, and mobile computing...in the context of a private or public cloud, as well as obviously private data centers. IBM can basically deliver the entire stack, with expertise across the horizon of vertical industries. IBM does indeed need some internal restructuring. I think IBM would benefit by being more bottom-up driven, paring down some layers of management. The company still has legions of world class engineers &amp; scientists, but it should build a compelling culture for them...as opposed to being so strict on expenses...but that's my opinion. Nevertheless, I think it is a fool's gambit to go against IBM. Similarly, so is going against Oracle, Microsoft, Intel, and Apple. These companies have deep pockets, make real money, and actually have some combination of IAAS &amp; PAAS as well as SAAS for the cloud. Would you put your money here or in companies like these...or in Amazon, SalesForce, LinkedIn, Facebook, and, soon, Twitter? I'll say this last thing: IBM had $100+ billion revenue and $15 billion profits in 2012.

Obvious signs? Really? You really knew that IBM would miss earnings and that we would see a 5% - 10% decline...and that it would significantly recover, as IBM is almost $200 today? You timed your trading so that it was like "talking candy from a kid"? :) I've worked a lifetime at technology companies and on Wall Street. Equity derivatives. Trading. Bond analytics. Even financing insurance premiums. Believe me, even for institutions with near real time systems and risk analysis that drives trading, it isn't easy to make good money. Suffice it to say, Wall Street is littered with failures in short term trading...never mind day traders that go broke pretty quickly. Maybe you have more guts and intelligence than I do. I make my money value investing. It's fundamentals that drive me to buy companies like IBM...averaging in at low prices, patiently waiting for evaluations to normalize. I wish it were like taking candy from a baby, but it takes discipline &amp; patience &amp; time...even a little guts. Smart money buys IBM when it is at a fair or cheap value. That's the guts part. Warren Buffett did this with IBM. Most investors will be best served to do similarly...as opposed to speculating on the basis of short term sentiment analysis, which is what you basically you seem to espouse. Best of luck.

No argument there. However, when it comes to specifics-- like an individual's years of mastering the technical and R/R analysis of a particular equity and its other co-relating variables, some significant over-performance can ensue on a consistent basis, which can be more than what can be attributed to the random-walk theory or luck. That's where, one expert's resulting-opinion can be perceived as an extremely-complex modeling-calculation by some one else, who is not exactly tuned-in to the particular dynamic and not operating "in the zone" at the time. Plus, you can't make an assumption that, some one is not backed by the processing-ability to solve gt. than 70 simultaneous differential equations on the variables of the pps-dynamic and years of tuning-in to the "art of interpretation" pre-earnings. Having said that, there are definite-times when one's systems are in such a state that they simply can not generate any signal, because of the opposing factors, that cancel each other out. For example, more than 80% of the time, you have to patiently sit on your hands as a trader and can't make any move. So, one's psychology should be harmonized perfectly with the vicissitudes of the combinations of the fundamental and technical factors of the issue at hand. And when someone's 4-trillion neurons are focused-in on a particular movement, constantly analyzing it, and co-relating with various incoming-signals, the soul, knowingly or unknowingly, become a defacto-expert, whose prediction-power can then come pretty-close to billion-dollar systems (for a very small-subset of the domain of course). Hence, to such a soul, it may feel something like a child's play, while on the other hand, it may be overwhelming amount of info. to manage for someone else.</Msg><Username>n59218</Username><Timestamp>1367273839861</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 18:17:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367275590851-24</Id><Title>MESSAGE TO SHORTS</Title><Msg>Why would anyone ever short IBM?

Chess is a good example. A human can learn and implement pattern recognition quickly without computing and weighing moves like a computer program might. I just find that this doesn't apply effectively to short term trading...even for a small subset of the domain. Just like with chess, you don't actually consciously engage in computing some subset of computations within a model...you imply some heuristic, unconscious calculation allegedly encapsulating such computation...that is, assuming what you wrote is serious and not plain old parody. :) Value investing is much easier to quantitatively correlate to outcomes. Maybe it is a weak correlation at best? But it seems consistent, and, therefore, safe enough, across a significant sampling of practitioners. Short term technical trading just doesn't offer the same consistency...or reassurance. Lastly, I've programmed risk models governing short term trading, even so called micro-trading. They definitely are too complex for me to emulate in my brain...not to mention that won't attempt to compete with the computing power, incoming real time data flow, gaming, and institutional money behind their short term market making capabilities. If you can prosper in the same ecosystem, God bless you...and if you do...apparently he has. :)</Msg><Username>banmate7</Username><Timestamp>1367281209061</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 20:20:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367283590882-27</Id><Topic><Title>Shorting IBM at 215 in March and covering at 197 AH was like taking a candy...</Title><Username>n59218</Username><Timestamp>1366332209326</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 20:43:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>By the way, a quick example of some simple trading analysis is real time bid-ask spread analysis on a stock...involving mathematical regressions on a set of independent variables...this producing but 1 set of coefficients in fairly elaborate models forecasting stock pricing across a short time horizon.
