IBM is not one of those companies that shows fake and useless revenue. IBM is always ahead of curve. IBM also sold its PC Hardware a few years ago since it knew that PC will be history as it is today. All PC makers are struggling. Dell, HPQ and Intel and others are struggling. Apple will struggle in near future. IBM is pushing ahead with new technology but not toys that will be out-dated in one year or so.</Msg><Username>zapmaster_the_kinq</Username><Timestamp>1351453999360</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 15:53:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351472041695-3</Id><Title>IBM inside</Title><Msg>New chip design by IBM makes many chip makers run for cover.
