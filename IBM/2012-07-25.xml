Looks like since then people have got back to their senses.. At 7:06 A.M.. Showing Dow futures up 65 pts.. Looks like the fact the Fed's are getting ready to add stimulas, is going to win out over Apple!! Big deal, Apple missed this qtr, while getting ready to hit mkt with new products... Personally, I think that speaks well for IBM.. They beat earnings est, but missed revenue target, due to turmoil in Europe, and the dollar being strong and losing on currency conversions... But as they up guidance for rest of yr... Makes me believe, it won't be long before IBM is back over $200.</Msg><Username>jrmills0014</Username><Timestamp>1343215130000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 07:18:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343216554000-3</Id><Topic><Title>You should have sold before the close</Title><Username>blackcombgrouse</Username><Timestamp>1343173010000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 19:36:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What a bunch of idiots do in after hours..

I don't agree with the conclusions but you may find it informative. It seems to me the question comes down to, is the price of your own stock based on it's earnings outlook too cheap. If it is, it's no different than if you used the money to buy another company's stock. I think IBM's stock purchases have proved to have been a good investment in their own company. Any company's management has a far better understanding of their own company than a different one. If the puprose of a buy back is simply to prop up the stock price, then it's a negative, and that sometimes is the case, but not with IBM regardless of the bashers comments.

IBM is a juggernaut and will be around long after many other companies will flame out (AAPL ? that heyday is a about done , in my book) .. remember when MSFT was going to take over the world ??? pretty tight 10 yr range on that one , eh ??? i would posit that by the time earning are at 20/sh , the dive will be around 6 bucks ... buy and IBM CD today and rates will rise while you hold it .. lol ... i wonder what happens when IBM unveils the air recharged battery .. should be in another 3 years .... i will posit that over the next 5 years , we are going to see IBM in businesses never considered for the company in the past .... later ... garce</Msg><Username>garceman1</Username><Timestamp>1343256060000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 18:41:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343258767000-13</Id><Topic><Title>Imperative Momentum Stepping In</Title><Username>gwennqim012</Username><Timestamp>1343223458000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 09:37:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>brilliant analysis</Msg><Username>beckala425</Username><Timestamp>1343258767000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 19:26:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
