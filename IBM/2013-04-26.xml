The stock appreciation is driven by stock buybacks, which is funded by cuts in operating expenses and strong cashflows from their golden goose financing arm.

People are crazy!!!</Title><Msg>Here is how crazy people have got.. Seems all they look at is earnings growth or a promise of it.. Which in a lot of cases, ends up to be BS!!! When you look at the figures, IBM project... You can bet they will come in with what they project or very close... IBM's mainframes are the reason, IBM will be here when,"" maybe"" even MSFT has come and gone!!! But here is what people will pay for earnings growth!!! Right now AMZN (even with that big hit today) is still selling for about $70. a shr. more than IBM... Oh they are going to have a big earnings growth in next couple of yrs, if they meet projection??? They are going to go from losing .07 ttm to earning $1.47 this yr and then $3.55 in 2014!!!! All the BS they talk about IBM.. Is just that!! TTM, IBM earned $14.50per shr vs AMZN losing $.07 !!!!!! In the next 2 yrs.. Oh that $3.55 is big earnings growth.. What would they be paying for IBM if they had lost $.07 ttm.. And was projecting $16.74 in earnings this yr and $18.43 next yr... BTW:: Amzn has never payed a divy.. You better figure out where IBM would be if they had never payed a divy... If you haven't figured out the point!!! If AMZN projections are correct, Thier earnings will have gone up by $3.62, in 2013 and 2014..Big FD.!! Per shr, IBM' earning will have gone up $3.93 per shr.... Oh Amzn is reflecting big earnings increase!! BFD!!!!</Msg><Username>jrmills0014</Username><Timestamp>1366993056787</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 12:17:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367002292622-6</Id><Topic><Title>IBM CEO</Title><Username>cindy_henning</Username><Timestamp>1366891477525</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-25 08:04:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I ggogled cindy and i was impressed.

As far as IBM goes it`s been one of the all time Greats among American Large Cap Companies. That being said the only reason they are still around and doing well is because they have cornered the market in an obsolete area that most companies moved away from decades ago. Again I appreciate the reply.</Msg><Username>cindy_henning</Username><Timestamp>1367009875411</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 16:57:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
