People were paying much higher taxes during Clinton and making more money. Rich should love their country more than they love their money. A poor country make them poor eventually. When middle class do better then the rich people will do better. When middle class do better then the stock market will do better.</Msg><Username>help4all1332</Username><Timestamp>1353516002931</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 11:40:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353516855626-5</Id><Topic><Title>Everyone is waiting for a solution to the cliff.

Fact is, he does. ANY delay or disagreement getting it done will be viewed more as a negative towards the GOP now. Furthermore, he is one obstinate guy. So, I don't think he will accept kicking the can down the road. I think this will come down to the wire and maybe even go into overtime. Therefore, my read, from an investor standpoint is we will likely see this range we're in until the fear gets out there again. Then, at any time, we'll see drops and pops. Ultimately, the day before the announcement of the agreement, we'll see a huge rally. IBM will likely be in this range of $185 - $192 until that agreement. Then, onto new highs, quickly. That's ONE likely scenario, IMO.</Msg><Username>cmegladon</Username><Timestamp>1353516855626</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 11:54:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353527378759-6</Id><Topic><Title>Tax increase will not affect 98% of people and investors</Title><Username>cash_is_king_now</Username><Timestamp>1353469812333</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 22:50:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Unless they extend the payroll tax cut, EVERYONE who gets a paycheck will have a lower check. Today, ANYONE who is employed and has a FSA will have the max reduced from $6k to $2500. EVERYONE who is employed and had medical insurance, already (in the majority of cases) contributes, and has a % deducted. That amount has gone up and will go up even more. We didn't even get to the new TBD tax increases. 98% not affected? Nope. Almost all are and will be affected. Just varying degrees. Oh, and for the women's right activists out there, pretty soon birth control pills will be over the counter, thus no longer covered by insurance. So they'll be payin $12 per month out of their pockets.......So be careful what you wish for.</Msg><Username>cmegladon</Username><Timestamp>1353527378759</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 14:49:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353533959600-7</Id><Title>IBM Commentary Thanksgiving</Title><Msg>I'm snowed in at Timberline Lodge in Oregon, having blast, here is our menu for Thanksgiving dinner.
