"BM raises 2015 business analytics revenue target 25 pct BY Reuters — 11:51 AM ET 02/28/2013 Feb 28 (Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp (IBM Loading... ) raised its 2015 revenue target for business analytics by 25 percent amid strong demand for products that help customers sift through increasing amounts of data. IBM (IBM Loading... ), the world's largest technology services company, now expects business analytics to generate revenue of $20 billion by 2015, Chief Executive Virginia Rometty said at the company's investor day on Thursday at its research center in San Jose, California. Business analytics is part of IBM's (IBM) five-year plan to reach earnings per share of at least $20 by 2015. Customers use analytics to identify patterns or predict behavior in structured data found inside databases and unstructured data found in anything from social networks and mobile devices to meters and sensors."</Msg><Username>kudlowsflooziegirl</Username><Timestamp>1362074666998</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 13:04:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362075473006-6</Id><Title>Obnama - Hysteria Personified</Title><Msg>Worst president ever and that includes Carter.

Speaking at IBM's Almaden Research Center in San Jose, Calif., CEO Ginni Rometty said that the firm will focus R&amp;D on growth initiatives such as big data and analytics. The CEO also noted that, since 2010, IBM has announced or closed 35 acquisitions of around $35 billion, as well as divesting of non-strategic assets. Over the past decade, she said, IBM divested almost $15 billion of revenue as it ramps up its high-margin strategy. The tech bellwether's most notable divestiture during that period was the $1.25 billion sale of its PC business to Lenovo, which was completed in 2005. Rometty also noted that IBM recently unveiled the first commercial technologies based on its Watson supercomputer, targeting the lucrative health care sector. As expected, IBM reiterated its roadmap of delivering operating earnings of at least $20 per share to investors in 2015. ------------------------------------ $35 billion for 35 buyouts averages $1 billion per buyout. IBM will not spend $5 billion on SPLK.</Msg><Username>qofaslave69</Username><Timestamp>1362077011617</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 13:43:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362079014549-9</Id><Title>IBM Knows When to Acquire...</Title><Msg>It always pays to know when and what to buy. It also pays to know when and what to sell. That was a point that IBM CEO Ginni Rometty made today in remarks at the company’s investors day in San Jose, Calif. IBM is known for making numerous acquisitions over the years, a recent example being StoredIQ. What does IBM look for in acquisition? Rometty boiled it down to three questions the company asks before every deal: “Does it extend a capability we have? Does it have scalable intellectual property? Can we extend it to 173 countries around the world?” In a perhaps not-so-veiled shot at rival Hewlett-Packard, given its combined $16 billion in write-downs on the acquisitions of EDS and Autonomy last year, Rometty said IBM feels strongly that “companies get in trouble when they acquire something that takes them into a new space.” But just as important to Big Blue’s success in recent years has been Big Blue’s decisions to get out of certain businesses. Examples include the PC business, which it sold to Lenovo in 2004, and, more recently, its retail point-of-sale business, which it sold to Japan’s Toshiba last year. “Over the last decade, we have divested $15 billion worth of revenue,” Rometty said. “If we had not, we would be a larger company, but we would also be a lesser-margin company, and we would have capabilities that our clients would be less interested in.” Rometty also said that IBM expects to continue its big bets on technologies like Big Data and analytics. “Data will be the basis of competitive advantage for every company, for every industry in the coming decade.” To that end, she said that IBM now expects revenue from business analytics to account for as much as $20 billion in annual revenue by fiscal 2015. The prior target was $16 billion. And if Big Blue hits that goal it would amount to a doubling of analytics revenue from 2010.</Msg><Username>qofaslave69</Username><Timestamp>1362079014549</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 14:16:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362087239836-10</Id><Title>SPLK EPS Report</Title><Msg>SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Splunk Inc.
