In 1977 I went to work for a VC firm that had a big investment in Amdahl. So I followed IBM in 77 &amp; 78. But I didn't buy until 1997 after IBM nosed up under Gerstner. I bought at $102 a before the last split so I had $51 shares. But I didn't add more until 2004 at $84. My mistake with IBM was ever selling a share. Those $51 shares would be yielding 6.7% and I would have never paid a dime of tax. My net worth would be higher by at least $250k. And I would feel a lot smarter.</Msg><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1364751740776</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 13:42:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364777498365-4</Id><Topic><Title>OLD WALL STREET SAYINGS</Title><Username>p1sorell</Username><Timestamp>1364501456159</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 16:10:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I have to say I do worry, just my nature, but with IBM I worry a lot less than any other stock I have ever owned. Let's hope we never worry as much as p1sorell. Could be wrong, just seems that way from the redundant multiple negative posts daily.</Msg><Username>dino2hootie</Username><Timestamp>1364777498365</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 20:51:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message></Date>
