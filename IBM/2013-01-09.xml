IBM is expected to earn $5.25, and I am sure they will meet/beat that number. However, if the revenue numbers continue to trend in reverse the stock will sell off. I would say the CFO has some integrity at stake with this report based on his statements on the last conference call. Are some of the smaller firms taking market share from IBM? Is the "big data pie" not as big as first thought? ORCL, SAP, and ACN seem to be doing well. I expect the same from IBM.</Msg><Username>qofaslave69</Username><Timestamp>1357739740989</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 08:55:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357745910367-2</Id><Topic><Title>Fiscal Cliff</Title><Username>bob787m</Username><Timestamp>1357570252419</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 09:50:52 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>With todays downturn in IBM during an up market one wonders what is the current driving force.

If they report over $30 billion in revenues the stock will quickly trade over $200. I believe most expect a drop in revenues and decelerating revenues going forward. That is why an upside surprise will propel the stock price. A roadmap to $20 per share will be viewed as a meaningless achievement if done so with decelerating revenues. The multiple will compress and we may see sideways action for years?

"who thinks this is going to happen"? Nobody -- none of the 22 analysts who follow IBM as the highest Q4 estimate is currently $29.9 bil -- the average is $29.16 bil. I don't know how you were wronged by Big Blue but you have a fetish.

That's not low, "bub". If you invest $10,000 in a stock and it rises to $10,300 in one year during which the inflation rate is 3%, what is the capital gains tax rate on that $300 gain in "real" terms? Answer: 100%. That's not low, "bub". A proposal to "index" capital gains for inflation after Obama took office was floated out of Washington in an ocean of entitlements... we index earned income for inflation... but we certainly don't want to do anything to help people who invest in jobs-producing industry, now do we.
