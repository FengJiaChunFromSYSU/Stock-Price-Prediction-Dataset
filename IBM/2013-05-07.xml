However the problem for IBM long term stockholders is that a significant part of IBM income is used to buy back shares that are constantly being issued to executives. Source of IBM income growth is cost cutting and change in revenue mix. In absence of revenue growth this process can not go on forever.In the interest of stockholders, the income must be directed to shrinking the number of shares without monkey business or for creating new source of revenue. For %30 of income to be used for executive options, this can be only justified in cases that executives have such impact on business that they are creating unique innovative products or services that is rapidly increasing company's market capitalization. (for example aapl, google, Vmware,..) Just milking the existing business can hardly justify such a hefty executive stock option program. IBM stok option is like emerging high tech company but business operates like a utility company.</Msg><Username>think2ski</Username><Timestamp>1367953048210</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 14:57:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367976603732-4</Id><Topic><Title>I am sorry I have to bother you with Lotus Notes sucking again LOTS</Title><Username>bwng_cash_flow_positive</Username><Timestamp>1367942378445</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 11:59:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yawn.
