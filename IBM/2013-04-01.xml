The reason is because Obama seeks to cover all American's equally, whether or not they do anything individually to help with the cost. It's all about "equal outcomes" with socialism... rather than "equal opportunity".

An article that appeared the other day suggested that 3/4 of all motorized wheelchairs that are paid for by medicare are for people who are NOT qualified to have their cost covered by medicare. The whole reason why America's entitlements and social welfare systems are so massively out of control is because everybody piles on when they can find ways to qualify to get free stuff. Obamacare will fast become the same way... if it's free, everybody will go in to the doctor for every danm hangnail they get... and eventually, rationing will result.

This market is running on fumes do to the irresponsible policies of the Fed. A catalyst is all that is needed to burst this ballon. IBM has been a very poor investment since I recommended selling it between 209 - 210 on March 28, 2012 That said, it should hold up better than most stocks during a sharp correction. Right now I prefer cash. With that advice I leave the board.
