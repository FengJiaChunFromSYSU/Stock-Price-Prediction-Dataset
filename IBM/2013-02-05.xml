An announcement of the company's new server product line was not as well received as IBM may have hoped. Most manufacturers of high-end servers have been feeling pressure as many customers turn to commodity x86 hardware instead. The servers from IBM, Oracle, and others have been steadily losing market share. With this morning's announcement, IBM introduced eight new servers with its new Power 7+ processor. The low-end products start around $6,000, which matches the x86 price range. And while pricing may prove to be a good move against the competition, announcing that the low-end servers are priced 50% lower than previous generations may cause investors to hesitate.</Msg><Username>kudlowsflooziegirl</Username><Timestamp>1360084921455</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 12:22:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360086982446-10</Id><Topic><Title>Why Is Big Government, Big Deficit, Socialism So Popular In America</Title><Username>bjspokanimal</Username><Timestamp>1359220102692</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 12:08:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>bjspokanimal you need to leave this message board permanently.

When you have 2 terrible choices, you pick the one you think will do the least damage. So the question becomes, why do they think Obama is less damaging...perhaps he is not killing off as many of their family members at war, perhaps they are unemployed and need money today, not in the form of jobs years from now. Not saying that Obama is improving their situations, but he gives that impression. Its the independant voters that make the difference in an election and Obama was better at convincing them he would not be as extreme(left or right) as the Republican alternative.</Msg><Username>victag_2000</Username><Timestamp>1360104471338</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 17:47:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360105070176-18</Id><Topic><Title>Why Is Big Government, Big Deficit, Socialism So Popular In America</Title><Username>bjspokanimal</Username><Timestamp>1359220102692</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 12:08:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>TheBlaze .. isn't that Glen Beck empire renamed.... you are kidding I hope.</Msg><Username>victag_2000</Username><Timestamp>1360105070176</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 17:57:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360112466675-19</Id><Topic><Title>Why Is Big Government, Big Deficit, Socialism So Popular In America</Title><Username>bjspokanimal</Username><Timestamp>1359220102692</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 12:08:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>America's race toward bankrupcy under Mr Obama is an issue that impacts every investor... every American. The magnitude of our emulation of Greece needs to be front and center for every American every day in order for us to have any chance at all of curbing Obama's power and stopping our march toward insolvency. You only need to look at what Obama's Trillion dollar deficits and out of control entitlements will result in 4 to 10 years from now to know, without a doubt, that Obama's re-election triggered the beginning of a national emergency. Alreadyhaveauser, there needs to be a counter-balance to the multitudes of 20-something americans who voted for Obama because they saw him on TV with Justin Bieber and thought he was hip. Those with in-depth knowledge of the economy need to help those kinds of people to see what's behind Obama's hip exterior and the massive damage that it's doing to the futures of those 20-somethings... ... because THEY will be far more negatively impacted by Obama than you or I will be. s</Msg><Username>bjspokanimal</Username><Timestamp>1360112466675</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 20:01:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360112640928-20</Id><Topic><Title>Why Is Big Government, Big Deficit, Socialism So Popular In America</Title><Username>bjspokanimal</Username><Timestamp>1359220102692</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 12:08:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>... all during the election campaign, the "news ticker" at the bottom of the bloomberg TV screen consistently placed headlines that were detrimental to Romney and beneficial to Obama.
