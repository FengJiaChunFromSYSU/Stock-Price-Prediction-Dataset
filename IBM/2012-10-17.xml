The Good: 1. IBM beats the street EPS estimates by a penny ( stock price is based on earnings) 2. They announced $3.1 billion in free cash flow for the quarter and over $17 billion for the year 3. IBM is still seeing margin exoansion in their high growth services 4. Contracts not signed this quarter will be announced next quarter (upside surprise?) The Bad: 1. IBM continues to fall short of Wall Street revenue estimates (WSJ hints at job cuts) 2. The strong US dollar hurt when converting forex 3. The last month of the quarter saw a big slowdown (election/fiscal cliff?) see #4 good 4. IBM did not raise fiscal 2012 guidance I am a long term shareholder who was not disappointed with IBM as much as concerned with a slowdown in the global economy affecting spending. IBM will be fine for a long time. Technically, the stock should see support at $202 (10 week line) and if it slices that technical mark in heavy volume in is likely the stock will slide back to the low $190's. A stock growing earnings at a minimum of a 10% clip is typically afforded a PE one and one half times its growth rate (15 P/E). When IBM earns the $15.10 with the P/E of 15 it will be trading at $227. A P/E of 14 is $211. A P/E of 13 is $196. I expect the stock to trade somewhere in this range for the next few months. I am not disappointed! Are you?</Msg><Username>qofaslave69</Username><Timestamp>1350448632258</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 00:37:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350456145104-2</Id><Title>IBM stock as an investment</Title><Msg>I see a lot of negative comments on the board for IBM.

Now, within that, third month phenomena, I would point to look at it from a brand perspective that was really a fall-off that we saw in our GBS business, number one, and our software business, number two, and from a geographic perspective, it was really a fall-off that we saw in North America and our growth markets unit which we refer to as GMU. Now, elementally, as you walk down those, the software content, I would attribute to a handful of deals that fell out of the quarter. Frankly, we thought we had those, right through the end of the quarter. They rolled to the fourth quarter. They would have accounted for about 2 points improved performance, which would have been more consistent with what we saw in the first two months of the quarter and those software deals were also part of the GMU performance.</Msg><Username>qofaslave69</Username><Timestamp>1350487230818</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 11:20:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350488089667-21</Id><Topic><Title>Just this minute loaded the boat with April 200 Puts,plus Jan 200s</Title><Username>cmegladon</Username><Timestamp>1350417334795</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 15:55:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ahem.

I read the CC transcript and it sounds tuff out there. The CFO said the drop off was in September. We could see further weakness in the stock price this week. I'll be worried if it dips to the low $190's. The Americas and outsourcing going weak in September may be due to the impending fiscal cliff. The CFO did say that a handful of deals slipped into Q4 and currency cost $1 bil of revenue loss. I was in Europe in Sept and the Euro had sunk to $1.23 -- so it's up to $1.30 now so Q4 won't hurt revenue like Q3 unless the Euro slips back.</Msg><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1350493906684</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 13:11:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350494312820-51</Id><Topic><Title>Intc has PE of 9</Title><Username>tshih_90630</Username><Timestamp>1350493029245</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 12:57:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>INTC is also in a failing business which is why it's lost 20% of it's value just in the past few months.
