That means the surgery could be delayed until the gap is filled somehow. So he was thinking: what about if he buys Feb 195 IBM calls now, and sell it off after earnings.. and possibly, he can provide the entire amount then by himself. Question -- do you think it will work? Is IBM that oversold presently? Or any other pick?</Msg><Username>ramsnehiparamdham</Username><Timestamp>1358829339587</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 23:35:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
