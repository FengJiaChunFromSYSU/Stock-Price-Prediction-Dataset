IBM is in a free fall and there is no telling where the bottom might be. This might be just a 10% correction, or the start of a bear market. The 2013 numbers are being reduced by most multinational firms, and it looks like a lean year for business. IBM is a blue chip stock, and will be on sale at a lower price.

While the middle class has been getting poorer and poorer ever since Reagan's times, corporations (IBM's customers) have been making more and more profits. Thus IBM's outlook is still great whatever happens in the election. Moreover, since IBM is international, the American tax situation is only mildly relevant and the exchange rate is much more important. What's more, since IBM is buying back shares, it is not being hampered by a shortage of cash to finance its operations, so even higher tax rates would not slow down its business.</Msg><Username>haraldgreen</Username><Timestamp>1351009127953</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 12:18:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351009295865-12</Id><Topic><Title>Time to cut bait</Title><Username>froznicehole</Username><Timestamp>1350926014831</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 13:13:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>@ froznicehole... he was contrasting you to Buffet.</Msg><Username>haraldgreen</Username><Timestamp>1351009295865</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 12:21:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351009699347-13</Id><Title>I told you before IBM dropped to protect your 401k' s and now they are going to turn them into 201k's again</Title><Msg>I told you before IBM dropped to protect your 401k' s and now they are going to turn them into 201k's again lower highs in the S &amp; P= lower lows to come</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1351009699347</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 12:28:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351014271519-14</Id><Topic><Title>I told you before IBM dropped to protect your 401k' s and now they are going to turn them into 201k's again</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1351009699347</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 12:28:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Boredom has arrived.</Msg><Username>yield_of_my_dreams</Username><Timestamp>1351014271519</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 13:44:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351015234491-15</Id><Topic><Title>I told you before IBM dropped to protect your 401k' s and now they are going to turn them into 201k's again</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1351009699347</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 12:28:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>BORED??

Mitt Romney's Stunning turnaround in these past 3 debates Obama has lost support among Jewish women voters. Most Jews are Turn Against Obama across the 50 states, A Jewish Women Focus Group of 7,890 on October 22, 2012 President Obama Was arrogant, angry, disrespectfully, condescending and much to aggressive, did not look very presidential at all. Governor Mitt Romney looked much more presidential, ready to be commander-in-chief. America he said, needs a strong economy in order to have a strong military for our National Security now and in the future. We came away from this debate with a very good impression of Mitt Romney, in that he would be a “ a safe pair of hands.” We feel he’s tough enough to do what’s necessary, but laid-back enough not to do too much and get us into another war. Romney did not attack President Obama's policies, he simply pointed out a few improvements in a respectable way. During the debate Governor Mitt Romney seemed more like the president and Barack Obama more like the candidate and challenger. Governor Mitt Romney was calm, thoughtful, relaxed, steady and looked very presidential. He looked and acted ready to take the job as commander-in-chief. Expressed his views on Iran's Nuclear threat and the USA support of Israel, our good friend and ally. He impressed us tonight, in that a vote for him is a vote for American security, peace and safety, a strong economy, a strong military, millions of higher paying jobs, prosperity and quiet peaceful life for us and our families. The world is much to scary these days; Americans aren’t looking for a scary weak president. Tonight we came away with the feeling that President Obama is more the scary one, in America's weaken relationship with Israel, a closer to Nuclear Iran, our weak economy and the huge 16 Trillion Dollars in Debt, that in itself Threatens our National Security. We can not afford four more years of president Obama's spending and borrowing another 5 or 6 trillion dollars from countries like China. Our jewish women's focus group therefore endorse Governor Mitt Romney for the next president of the United States of America. Obama's Re-Election is very questionable. Vote for Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan</Msg><Username>ohio_romney_ryan</Username><Timestamp>1351027809034</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 17:30:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351036218938-28</Id><Topic><Title>Huge Fiscal Stimulus...
