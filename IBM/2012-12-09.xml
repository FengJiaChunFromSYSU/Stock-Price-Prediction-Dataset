Retiree's will get their match just delayed. What is lost is the potential gain or loss on the delayed payment. If IBM only matches 6% and perhaps these long term people might be making $150k per year we are talking about a match of up to $9k if they wait till the end of the year to retire. What is lost is the gain that might be made against $9k. Considering interest/gains is variable throughout the year depending on how much has been accrued for the year we are only talking about potential loss of 100's of dollars. Cheap to do to employees, yes. Major loss for their last year, no. Only loss is for the younger people who lose the compounding affect over many years.</Msg><Username>dctrfith</Username><Timestamp>1355067163513</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-09 10:32:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355071222977-3</Id><Title>Thank Obama for the 401K shafting</Title><Msg>It's his dismal economy that forced IBM's hand, and the lack of a backbone to reign in spending as proposed by his Simpson-Bowles commission, yet again.

Bashing the company you work for doesn't bode well for you. Personally if you were my employee with your attitude, you would be long gone. I'm sure there are dozens of qualified job seekers ready to fill your position. By some IBM stock and quit crying.</Msg><Username>dino2hootie</Username><Timestamp>1355072943090</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-09 12:09:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355087023358-5</Id><Topic><Title>Obama: The Dark Side of Special Dividends</Title><Username>bjspokanimal</Username><Timestamp>1354733723302</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 13:55:23 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In 2007, the top 1% provided just under 40% of total federal income tax paid by individuals. Currently, they pay 38% of them. approval_myass talks about the past as a time when rates were higher than they are today. Those were also times when there were FAR more deductions and exemptions. Reagan could only get rates down by making them "revenue neutral" using "static" modeling when he negotiated with democrats in congress. I remember being able to deduct about anything before THAT legislation passed... including interest on credit card balances. For decades, it's been the same old thing as our country has moved toward socialism. The democrats raise the rates... especially on the wealthy... and the republicans lower them and cede to fewer deductions and more lowering for the low and middle classes than the wealthy. The result is the magnitude of capital flight that we see today. The current reality is that the top 1% pay 38% of all federal, individual income taxes and the top 5% pay 64% of them. The bottom 47% of americans pay NO federal income taxes and now their FICA tax has been lowered to 4.2% while employers continue to pay 6.2%. All we've been DOING in America for the past 60 years is expanding our social welfare system, raising taxes... mostly on the wealthy... and running up the national debt. Anyone who suggests otherwise is simply spewing a socialist agenda... because for the past 60 years, socialism has been winning and capitalism has been losing in the U.S... ... in spite of the fact that throughout the economic history of our planet, socialism has damaged the living standards of societies and capitalism has improved them. The demise of the U.S. economy is simply being delayed by masive, $Trillion dollar deficits and an overheating printing press at the federal reserve.

What planet are you on? The vast majority of these people are making 60-85k per. These are not big money sales or corporate jobs. These are hourly rated technicians and lower level exempt employees. This is a big part of their retirement. This was also part of the change that pulled the defined pension plan out from under them 4 years ago, 401k enhancements to build up some cash. How is any employee suppose to plan if they keep moving the target? They just keep taking from the US employees and expect them to sit by and take it. When older IBMer's left in the past, they took the time to train new people, teach them the inside tricks of the trade and help them transition. Not anymore, especially with the off shored jobs. Once this generation of IBMers is gone they will be forced out of the hardware business because there will be no one there who knows how to design, manufacture, test and release new products.</Msg><Username>teddyballgameshead</Username><Timestamp>1355106082025</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-09 21:21:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
