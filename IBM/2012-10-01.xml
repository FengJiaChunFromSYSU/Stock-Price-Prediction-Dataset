Obama's very first act as president was: To unequivocally SEAL EVERY RECORD ABOUT HIS PAST, from his birth, to schools he attended, to residences addresses he lived at, to colleges he attended, to grades he received, to degrees he received, to jobs he held, to affiliations in the Chicago area, to his political affiliations, yes Obama SEALED his entire past, as his very first act as president! Along with sealing his total past, Obama made it a 100% Firing Offense, for any government employee to dig into any record from his past! And the cover-ups continue, with Obama's administration being the most secret administration ever, dam shame that his perpetual lies &amp; #$%$. convince many of the folks out there to give him a second chance for another four years... to destroy the Good Old U.S.A! One of Obama's latest is to give the new Muslim Brotherhood, that took over the Egyptian Government, $1 Billion In Aid That Obama Pledged to them, shortly after they gained control of the Egyptian Government! A short list of Obama Pledges, Prior to his election as President: 1) I will cut the Budget deficit in half in four years... ~ Result ~ Obama has added nearly $ 4 Trillion in New Debt, Yes, More Debt added in 4 Years than the First 41 Presidents Of the U.S.A. added, &amp; yes, all piled on future generations... 2) I will make it easier to grow jobs... ~ Result ~ The Obama administration has implemented 2,000 NEW REGULATIONS that U.S. Industry must deal with, while world wide businesses coast onward, without such massive constraints on their operations, significantly reducing their ability to compete worldwide! 3) I will protect the environment... ~ Result ~ In the past 4 years, the Obama Administration has Closed or converted to natural gas 83 U.S. Coal Fired Power Plants, cutting thousands of jobs, raising the cost of Electricity &amp; placing Millions of U.S. citizens in danger of electricity shortages in the near future... ~ Meanwhile, China Continues its relentless march onward, Opening ONE NEW COAL FIRED Power PLANT Each &amp; EVERY WEEK, For the past two years, Yes in China alone... ~ Ask, how can U.S. Industry Compete, answer they ABSOLUTELY CANNOT, resulting in strangulation on U.S. growth &amp; employment! 4) I will work to make the U.S. Energy Independent... ~ Vetoed the Keystone Pipeline From Canada, which would bring in Millions of Barrels of cheap Canadian Oil... ~ Refused to open &amp; issue permits for U.S. Coastal Oil drilling, while Foreign Oil Companies encroach the U.S. Coastline, drilling away... ~ Placed massive restrictions on Mining &amp; Use of Coal in the U.S.A., directing the Closure or conversion to natural gas of 83 U.S. Coal Fired Power Plants, cutting thousands of jobs, raising the cost of Electricity &amp; placing Millions of U.S. citizens in danger of electricity shortages in the near future... ~ Funded a Billion $ for Renewable Energy, much of which has gone Bankrupt in the past several years... 5) I will implement stimulus programs, that will control unemployment to 8%... ~ Reported unemployment continues way above 8%, with unreported unemployment reported to be as high as 19%... 6) Added Two Million Federal Employees to the U.S. payroll, to over regulate U.S. Businesses &amp; Citizens, all these NEW JOBS contributing ZERO Productivity to the U.S. economy, but adding to the mounting $ deficit... 6) Forced Obama Care Through, consisting of some 2,000 pages of which No Democrat that Voted for it, ever read it in it's entirety... Obama Care if not repealed, will Bankrupt The U.S.A. within several years of it's full enactment... 7) 45 Million U.S. Citizens on Food Stamps, documents the failure of the Obama administration to help the poor in the U.S.A., despite the massive Billions of $$$ being spent on social programs. Only significant job growth can resolve the U.S.'s economic problems &amp; Obama cannot comprehend! 8) Look at Obama's background... Look at Obama's past &amp; current associates... Look at Obama's accomplishments to date??? Now, you decide just what Obama has accomplished in his 4 year term &amp; just was he attempting to hide with his very First ACT As President? Then Get Out &amp; Vote Obama OUT!!!</Msg><Username>mos_dfi</Username><Timestamp>1349119475368</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 15:24:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349121878669-16</Id><Topic><Title>It is about time for IBM to announce a 3 for 1 STOCK SPLIT !</Title><Username>fstephens</Username><Timestamp>1349105213837</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 11:26:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Because I said so.</Msg><Username>fstephens</Username><Timestamp>1349121878669</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 16:04:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349121906760-17</Id><Topic><Title>It is about time for IBM to announce a 3 for 1 STOCK SPLIT !</Title><Username>fstephens</Username><Timestamp>1349105213837</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 11:26:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Watch and SEE !</Msg><Username>fstephens</Username><Timestamp>1349121906760</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 16:05:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349122984797-18</Id><Topic><Title>Ninty Six Year High Today</Title><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1349101317593</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 10:21:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>IBM will not split the stock.
