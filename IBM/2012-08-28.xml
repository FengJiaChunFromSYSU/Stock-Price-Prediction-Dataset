IBM will EARN over $15 in 2012 and $20 by 2015. Currently, the stock is trading 13 times 2012 earnings, and growing earnings at a 15% clip YOY. Therefore, IBM is cheap right here. The stock is 8% off its 52 week high and will make new highs this year.</Msg><Username>qofaslave69</Username><Timestamp>1346171737458</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 12:35:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346171743673-6</Id><Topic><Title>IBM Watson making progress ...</Title><Username>alreadyhaveauser</Username><Timestamp>1345747084000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 14:38:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I do have a fetish with IBM, but I think the firm can do MUCH BETTER THAN IT IS DOING right now. The lost contracts are horrible. I would much prefer to see it retain AstraZeneca, AmGen and actually build a working data center in Texas. These are positive moves so I guess you are happy that they failed - so you can fire staff and increase shareholder value. One thing about medical work and computers - if you are doing robotic surgery,a dentist told me that you lose one very important factor and that is HUMAN TOUCH. The fingers of a surgeon can individually "feel" more inside a body than a damn robotic arm ever could, and that can be important, LIFE IMPORTANT, if you are on the table. But if you are happy with that, please be my guest to go under the knife with Watson and those good odds.</Msg><Username>retiredexaon</Username><Timestamp>1346171743673</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 12:35:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346173562958-7</Id><Topic><Title>IBM Watson making progress ...</Title><Username>alreadyhaveauser</Username><Timestamp>1345747084000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 14:38:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hey retread, Watson don't have no knife.</Msg><Username>alreadyhaveauser</Username><Timestamp>1346173562958</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 13:06:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346177590607-8</Id><Topic><Title>completely bloated up here near 190s</Title><Username>cwtripps</Username><Timestamp>1346162815686</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 10:06:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>its not cheap at all. we have known for 3 years about their 15 dollar plan. the stock was at 100 when they cam out with it. its now 200 dont be greedy the world is changing</Msg><Username>cwtripps</Username><Timestamp>1346177590607</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 14:13:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346179359436-9</Id><Topic><Title>completely bloated up here near 190s</Title><Username>cwtripps</Username><Timestamp>1346162815686</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 10:06:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I am a long term shareholder and not greedy at all. IBM revealed a $20 plan which was revealed in 2010 and they are well on their way to achieving their stated goal. Yes, the world changes every day, and IBM is leading that change. IT spending will increase five fold by 2017, and IBM will get their fair share. A stock trading at less than 1 times earnings growth is cheap. A stock trading at 2 times earnings growth is expensive. IBM is growing earnings at less than 1% earnings growth, and that is excellent. If you think IBM is a dog, then you you need to check a chart!</Msg><Username>qofaslave69</Username><Timestamp>1346179359436</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 14:42:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346192099966-10</Id><Topic><Title>completely bloated up here near 190s</Title><Username>cwtripps</Username><Timestamp>1346162815686</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 10:06:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I guess you never heard of mission critical computing.
