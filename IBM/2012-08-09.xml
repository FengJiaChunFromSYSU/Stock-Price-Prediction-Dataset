Carly and Hurd had no vision. They were caretakers. Buying Compaq and Palm displays the clueless leadershipm at HPQ. The layoffs and the writeoffs are a bad sign for the floundering firm. IBM is big but mobile enough to make the necessary changes for a global economy.</Msg><Username>qofaslave69</Username><Timestamp>1344485630000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-09 00:13:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344524530000-2</Id><Topic><Title>IBM is a MOTR client</Title><Username>facts_are_facts_are</Username><Timestamp>1344385955000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 20:32:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Santa is watching you.</Msg><Username>facts_are_facts_are</Username><Timestamp>1344524530000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-09 11:02:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344528304000-3</Id><Title>GET OUT BEFORE OLYMPIC IS OVER!!</Title><Msg>protect your 401kkk, retirement, saving now.</Msg><Username>rddr4044</Username><Timestamp>1344528304000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-09 12:05:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344528834000-4</Id><Topic><Title>GET OUT BEFORE OLYMPIC IS OVER!!</Title><Username>rddr4044</Username><Timestamp>1344528304000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-09 12:05:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Kind of a dumb reference. They thought the Olympics were over for hundreds of years. But both the Olympics and paternal, stubborn, gritty Grease is still around too. If you want to really scare people you'll have to try and sound intelligent. Put together something that snaps people to attention. Maybe a catchy phrase that stand up comedians try and find. Are you spreading yourself too thin? Quality is so important in every endeavor.

Well, it sounds like two birds of a feather, you and he. The long established IBM board file of prerogatives mandates a defines set of actions anytime confusing language blows the multi-ID alarm horn. Challenged under this rule, a skid mark DNA test is required from authors of both suspicious posts. Is this something you bargained for? Or might you reconsider flaming Watson's home board? Your other alternative is to explain why he doesn't know he's right, and then explain why he's right. So will it be the risk of exposure and reputation ruin for duplicitous acts, or an explanation? if you can sir</Msg><Username>yield_of_my_dreams</Username><Timestamp>1344542862000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-09 16:07:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344562597000-10</Id><Topic><Title>Have to Say It - HPQ's Woes</Title><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1344434979000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 10:09:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>4 idiots with out a clue.The lazy garbage at hp all hate hurd because he made them work.HURD was about to start getting rid of all the garbage on the hp bod when they fired him for nothing.MEG needs to be fired NOW!!!!</Msg><Username>nk499</Username><Timestamp>1344562597000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-09 21:36:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344562696000-11</Id><Topic><Title>Have to Say It - HPQ's Woes</Title><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1344434979000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 10:09:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Scott mcneady couldn't take care of his own house.</Msg><Username>nk499</Username><Timestamp>1344562696000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-09 21:38:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344569010000-12</Id><Topic><Title>Have to Say It - HPQ's Woes</Title><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1344434979000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 10:09:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Do you really need to resort to name calling?
