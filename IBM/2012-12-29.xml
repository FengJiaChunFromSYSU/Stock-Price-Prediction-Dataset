Most companies pay it with each paycheck during year. (like IBM was doing). Does someone know the percent of companies that do it the way IBM has chosen to go. I think this is very bad because it is unusual and makes the employees who actually create success for the company very unhappy. You would think IBM would be looking for ways to increase employee satisfaction. This move seems dumb.</Msg><Username>margin321</Username><Timestamp>1356806123078</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-29 13:35:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356806397558-3</Id><Topic><Title>Is Mitch McConnell a fascist?</Title><Username>montana_canta</Username><Timestamp>1356659146947</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 20:45:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>McConnell already has failed badly. Right after the last election he said that his number one priority was to make sure Obama was a one term president. And that he would do anything to make sure that it did not happen. Well Mitch, how did that plan go? Less reason to sabotage Obama now since he won't have a 3rd term. Only reason to play badly now is to be vindictive - is that worth hurting the entire country?</Msg><Username>margin321</Username><Timestamp>1356806397558</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-29 13:39:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356806997312-4</Id><Topic><Title>Is Mitch McConnell a fascist?</Title><Username>montana_canta</Username><Timestamp>1356659146947</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 20:45:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Na - just a Republican. . .close enough.</Msg><Username>rgc99</Username><Timestamp>1356806997312</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-29 13:49:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356807109070-5</Id><Topic><Title>What per cent of companies pay all of annual 401 contibution at year end?</Title><Username>margin321</Username><Timestamp>1356806123078</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-29 13:35:23 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>NO companies are out to increase employee satisfaction.

Another change will be a savings to IBM from the use of cash during the year until 12/15 -- that's a step back for employees as the yield to them will go down. It doesn't look dumb to me. If I were an IBM'er I would not like it. You have to assume that the IBM BOD would not have approved it unless the supporting research made sense to them. I'm sure if I were an IBM'er that the change per se would not be enough to make me jump ship.</Msg><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1356817584555</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-29 16:46:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
