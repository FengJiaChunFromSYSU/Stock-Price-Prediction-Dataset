The results at DuPont and Dow Chemical point to reductions in world industrial production and inventory levels to adjust to reduced demand. Europe may not fall apart but it looks like a global slowdown lead by Europe. Buffett says Asia is also slowing. 2. Without any other catalyst to match on the horizon, I'd rather buy IBM into a Romney rally than hold into an Obama sell-off. Regardless of the election, world demand is dropping. That's what really counts in the next year.</Msg><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1351179573212</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 11:39:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351182725720-8</Id><Topic><Title>AAPL alert</Title><Username>jgiled</Username><Timestamp>1351172494862</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 09:41:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>LOL!!!!!LOL!!!!!!!

Does it pay a decent dividend? Who cares what the price is or what any particular quarterly report is? Chasing short term price is a losers quest.

Many multinational firms have confirmed a global economic slowdown. I hope it is just a correction, and not a full-blown recession. If it is a recession, our markets will take a hit. This bull market is more than three and a half years old. Maybe, this correction will turn into a bear market? I am not banking on politics to provide any short term rally. I will continue to hold IBM shares long, and expect 2013 to be rather difficult. It is wise to continue to monitor the conference calls and earnings reports from the companies you own. I once held Eastman-Kodak until is was clear they were a failed business model.
