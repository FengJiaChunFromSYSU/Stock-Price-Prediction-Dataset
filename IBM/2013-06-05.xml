Gini Rometty is an idiot who served on the AIG board from 2006-2009, who oversaw the biggest insurance debacle in history." Amazon is going to have to spend big R&amp;D dollars to keep up with IBM. If the technology is right and IBM's price is competitive then IBM will get its share of deals. Next to ORCL, because Larry loves a fight, AMZN could not have a more formidable competitor than IBM. IBM is acquiring 13 new data centers with the deal and probably most of the staff. While IBM pays cash for acquisitions, there are going to be new employment contracts with IBM stock awards and options. IBM's steady share price growth since the lows of 2009 makes IBM the acquirer of choice for those wanting to stay with the technology and sell into IBM's base.</Msg><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1370434819125</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-05 08:20:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370435749776-2</Id><Title>Looks like I have found another winner.

We are going back down to $205-that it appears. This up and down slide has been for several times this year.. As a benefit to the shareholders ..split the stock...IBM will be more affordable for the smaller investor to own a share or two..IT has strength to go back up from there.</Msg><Username>dvdbckagn</Username><Timestamp>1370437028673</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-05 08:57:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370440039117-4</Id><Topic><Title>IBM splitter.</Title><Username>dvdbckagn</Username><Timestamp>1370437028673</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-05 08:57:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nay, it will not be.

Real Estate crashed when they said buy, Nasdaq 2000 dropped, Apple at 700 was a buy according to the hype guys, and gold at $1900 was a buy then but a sell when it was a few hundred. LEARN from this. Sell and take profits when you have them, FORGET ALL THE B+ S from Wall Street crew. Upside to markets SMALL if any at all, DOWNSIDE HUGE.IMO Its that simple.

Fact of life. But when jobs are dismissed for overseas workers at $2 an hour or so, in India where the cost of LIVING is FAR below what we have here (and minimum wage too BTW) and JUST because it is CHEAPER for expenses to do - as the ONLY reason, then that is why you get .... AstraZeneca, Texas, AmGen, etc. Boy is all that cheap support helping the bottom line, right?

Whats the difference!! If you got 1B shrs trading at $200. Or 2B shrs trading at $100.???? But as it seems all the geniuses that play the mkt anymore.. Don't have the sense.. To realize shrs outstanding.. Dictate what each shr earns!!! They rather look at BS earnings growth!!! Check out what they are paying for Amzn.. Which should have huge earnings growth.. Earnings growth can be astrinomical for a stk that ain't earning anything at present... In the mean time.. IBM, whose earnings " per shr" are projected to go up more in the next 2 yrs than Amzn... But as IBM is already earning about $15. per shr... It don't show earnings growth of like 150%... And keep in mind.. The value of a shr, should be based on what it earns per shr!!! You tell me why AMZN should be selling for more than IBM??? The best safe play on this mkt, if you got coins... And regardless of what you get into IBM at!! Its a good investment!!! In the mean time, If you had of bought 1K shrs when it dipped to (I think) $185. And now turn around and sell Jan calls... You should be up $30K to $40K.. With no tax implications for this yr!!! Actually, a nephew told me he was getting ready to get $4.5M?? I got to studying where he should put part of that money??

Specific distribution between Geos is completely confidential. So nobody can say whether the US full time employee count is below 100,000 or not. And who cares? The concept is the same. So it's 90K. Or 80K. Maybe it will go to 0 and everyone will work as contract labor. I just don't understand this concept of working somewhere and whining everyday about what a bad place it is to work. And if you think India is unfair competition then upgrade to a skill set that can't be sourced at a fraction of the price overseas. The problem is not that Indian labor is too cheap it's that American labor is way too expensive. There's a worldwide price for technical phone support and it is way lower than traditional US salaries. American workers just don't want to hear that. They want their precious standard of living to be protected at any cost and they want the investors who own the company to pick up the tab.</Msg><Username>jand2357</Username><Timestamp>1370469272826</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-05 17:54:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370486305883-18</Id><Topic><Title>IBM and layoffs.. and US corporations</Title><Username>fraudhasnofriends</Username><Timestamp>1370374936998</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 15:42:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"...I know a lot of the old timers who started the company."
