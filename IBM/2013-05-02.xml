IBM does 3 billion in revenue ever QUARTER, what other business is going to take over, or outcompete with them? Hewlett Packard? Oracle? (that bought Sun). They have the top engineers, produce the most patents, they're not afraid to change with the times, they're leaders, not followers. There's a reason this stock recently hit an ALL TIME HIGH, and will again, its because the analysts and money managers have to make decisions in the real world, and IBM is a DINOSAUR TO BE RECKONED WITH AND RESPECTED</Msg><Username>ibji</Username><Timestamp>1367495403174</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 07:50:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367495982736-5</Id><Title>BELOW $190.00 On The Way.

Your observation is unpopular in today's challenging employment environment in the US, but it is nevertheless true. The way I see it, IBM did what it had to do to retain a significant US presence. As you stated, otherwise it would have really diminished as a company. As to the contract employees, this won't hurt customers. Line employees are fully capable of making up any gap. Look, I've been in consulting and know that line employees can find an extra few hours a week...as opposed to being letter of the law obstinate about getting somebody else to do it. Lastly, I am betting on IBM being strong and robust in the future, especially once wages and pricing becomes more normalized in the globalized economy. North America will benefit, while simultaneously so will emerging market employees for IBM. It isn't a zero sum game forever, like many people believe.</Msg><Username>banmate7</Username><Timestamp>1367510875293</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 12:07:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367517283341-9</Id><Topic><Title>IBM donw over 5% this morning</Title><Username>nt2668</Username><Timestamp>1366376238542</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-19 08:57:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Skipped second round.
