The 47% of americans who don't pay income taxes were voting overwhelmingly for Obama... just like Venezuelan non-taxpayers voted overwhelmingly for Venezuela's socialist leader, Hugo Chavez. A lot of 20-somethings surveyed were talking about voting for Obama because they saw him on TV with Justin Bieber and thought he was "hip". Older Americans, who've been around awile, were more supportive of Romney. I can't believe you asked that question. You've got to be the only person on this board who doesn't know how intelligent people and those who contribute tax revenues generally vote.

So by stating: "Intelligent Americans and those who pay taxes" you're saying the "47%" are the "Intelligent Americans" and the people who pay taxes are non-intelligent? Simply clueless you are. By the way here is a little snippet for ya: "It is true that 46 percent of households did not pay federal income tax in 2011. It is not true that they pay no taxes. Federal income taxes account barely account for half of federal taxes, and much less of total taxes, if you count the state and local level. Many of those other taxes can be regressive. If you take all taxes into account, our system is barely progressive at all. But why do almost half of all households pay no federal income tax? Because they don't have much money to tax. Here's the breakdown from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. Half of these households are simply too poor -- they make under $20,000 -- to have any liability. Another quarter are retirees on tax-exempt Social Security benefits. The remaining households have no liability because of tax expenditures like the earned-income tax credit or the child credit. In other words, the poor, the old, and children. Not exactly the "50-50 nation" of makers and takers..." Listen, you need to do something on your PC other than be some kind of right-wing blowhard. Why don't you use it to LEARN SOMETHING instead of spouting off half truths like some kind of politician? (BTW who give a frak about Bieber?) I give up. Over and OUT, I'll ignore you like most of the wise people on this board do.</Msg><Username>alreadyhaveauser</Username><Timestamp>1357934300393</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 14:58:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357935034801-7</Id><Title>CNBC - out of control with comments !</Title><Msg>they bring the bears and make stamens that are just very unprofesional</Msg><Username>jgiled</Username><Timestamp>1357935034801</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 15:10:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357935292058-8</Id><Topic><Title>CNBC - out of control with comments !</Title><Username>jgiled</Username><Timestamp>1357935034801</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 15:10:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Those angry bears are so angry at the market moving higher that they don't think before they speak on cable TV !!!
