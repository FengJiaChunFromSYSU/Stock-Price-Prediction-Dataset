By newbies I mean investor/speculators that have been in stocks for 10 years or less. One Mantra you keep hearing from today's analysts is how cheap stocks ar historically from a PE level . From every other measuire they are priced for not only perfection but priced as if the average consumer was in the best shape in history . What absolute nonsens , here are some examples of how expensive many stocks are . In the Dow transportation index which has led this 2013 rally by its most rocket like advance in history , there a stocks like UPS selling at 18 times its book value (or break up value) How does that comparte to last years Tech darling AAPL ? AAPL's price to book is 3.26 but it has an opraatinmargin of 25% UPS which after competes in a low profit margin business and has a 1.49% profit margin has a price to book of 17,25 or FIVE times as high as AAPL . How can Cramer tout UPS ? Either he is absolutely clueless at evaluating stock or there is something fishy going on . I left IBM t\ill last because it is even worse than UPS in some ways , since its TBV is minus $12.72 per share it is priced at $229 above its TGB , you work it out what the PB really is but is astronimcal .</Msg><Username>blackcombgrouse</Username><Timestamp>1364879537943</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 01:12:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364906244180-2</Id><Topic><Title>Trusting analyst - a fatal mistake</Title><Username>blackcombgrouse</Username><Timestamp>1364879537943</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 01:12:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>no comment</Msg><Username>yield_of_my_dreams</Username><Timestamp>1364906244180</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 08:37:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364914863654-3</Id><Title>MONSTER NEWS ON -BCCI-COFFEE- YAHOO NEWS HEADLINES</Title><Msg>FACTS</Msg><Username>tra.peaces</Username><Timestamp>1364914863654</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 11:01:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364914945436-4</Id><Topic><Title>Santelli - you can say Happy Easter its OK ! - Why say happy holidays ??</Title><Username>jgiled</Username><Timestamp>1364482458450</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 10:54:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Because Easter is all about candy, eggs, a ham dinner and the Easter bunny.

MCD trading at 19 times earnings, IBM at 14 times earnings? Because these stocks pay dividends which are greater than what you can get in the bond market. Also, it is a safe have for international investors. Would you rather invest in Europe? Yes, this market is trading above normal valuations. But, it can stay this way for a long time. Do not fight the fed. The trend is your friend. Look at the stocks making all-time highs... 1. General Mills 2. Kimberly-Clark 3. Smuckers 4. McCormick 5. McDonald's 6. Proctor &amp; Gamble These are all defensive plays, and safe havens. You may not like it.

As an "investor", it behooves you to take advantage of this once in a lifetime opportunity. You don't have to go crazy and invest every dollar you have but get your feet wet and put a little into some blue chips. If it turns on you, you won't lose much. Meantime at least, you can collect a dividend.</Msg><Username>zer0t0l</Username><Timestamp>1364955052243</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 22:10:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364955246306-17</Id><Topic><Title>The Catalyst</Title><Username>p1sorell</Username><Timestamp>1364848109059</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 16:28:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>and BTW, Merrill has done wonderful since you retired!</Msg><Username>zer0t0l</Username><Timestamp>1364955246306</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 22:14:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
