He learned that you speak to the American people EVERY DAY... and that if you say something over and over enough times that it will be viewed as correct and truthful regardless of the facts that underlie what you're saying. It's a brilliant tactic, and it's working well for Obama. For example, Obama always terms his desire for budget negotiations as being "balanced"... yet he has only proposed tax increases and almost no spending cuts. In fact, the January 1st agreement INCREASED spending. But Americans still view Obama as fair and balanced because even though it's hugely UN-balanced in favor of more spending and more taxes, he drills the idea that it IS balanced into Americans' heads every single day with a constant barrage of speeches... ... just like Louis Farakkan taught him to do. It's working. The deficits remain huge and out of control, unemployment remains high, and the fed is printing oceans of money. Obama is winning, and America is going bankrupt.
