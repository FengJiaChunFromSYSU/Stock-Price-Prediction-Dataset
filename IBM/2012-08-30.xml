I think Yahoo is delibrately trying to discourage use of their finance message boards. They don't make money from the boards and it is a PITA for them to deal with all the spammer complaints, etc. Less board traffic means fewer headaches for them.</Msg><Username>codebuddy</Username><Timestamp>1346349105371</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 13:51:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346349213714-3</Id><Title>IBM CAN MAKE BLACK BEERY A BLUE BERRY, IBM WILL FLY.</Title><Msg>Aapl will soon eat ibm lunch if ibm does not acquire rimm.</Msg><Username>casbah45</Username><Timestamp>1346349213714</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 13:53:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346368475058-4</Id><Topic><Title>Summer Rally Ends Friday</Title><Username>dopytrader</Username><Timestamp>1345157768000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 18:56:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>like I said.

BUFFETT = THE TECHNOLOGY LEADER !!! (drops intc)</Title><Msg>Yes, Buffett dropped the monopolist strong-arming intc and he sold all 7.745 million intc shares. Also, Buffett fired the CEO of a Berkshire Hathaway subsidiary for "strong-arm tactics, links (urls won't post) : "Berkshire eliminated its 7.745 million share stake in Intel (INTC), worth over $204 million." # # # Buffet fired Abrahms - read on, "But it also reported company morale has been bad after Abrams fired sales executives and antagonized retailers by trying to "strong-arm them into exclusive distribution deals." Continuing... "Even so, it's extremely unusual for Buffett to drop his usual "hands-off" policy and fire the CEO of a subsidiary."</Msg><Username>kit3taylor</Username><Timestamp>1346372732359</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 20:25:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
