Actually, the U.S. founding fathers were capitalist slave owners who set up a system where only wealthy male landowners could vote and black people were treated as property. mistake #2: "Most of the institutional knowledge resides in the US and Europe." I have no idea what that means and I'm sure you don't either. It's just a meaningless string of words. mistake #3: "I do have a problem with the blind cost cutting to reach the utopian $20 per share in 2015 at the US, European and Canadian employees expense." If the company can cut cost and still be profitable then that is exactly what they owe their shareholders. And if they succeed in reaching $20 per share then they have done their job. Explain to me why they should reduce the profitably of the company and shareholder value so that they can pay the employees more. mistake #4: Even today as you complain about the way they treat employees, the company is recruiting top talent for executive level positions. Compensation is more than competitive. An experienced executive with the right background and education remains a valuable commodity. It's the average Joe Sixpack that has no value. I say fire all of them, hire the best executive talent, give some hard working, well educated Indian and Chinese workers a chance to raise their standard of living, and keep driving up the value of the stock. mistake #5: Cannot is one word not two.</Msg><Username>jand2357</Username><Timestamp>1371098829431</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 00:47:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>13</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371126233362-2</Id><Topic><Title>IBM and layoffs</Title><Username>jand2357</Username><Timestamp>1370366399824</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 13:19:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I really feel sorry for people like you jan2357.

Ginny wanted everyone to work harder and she going to achieve that goal very well. But this does not seem to be FAT, and Ginny missed her numbers so the only she knows how to do now is fire people to reduce costs. Wall Street loves that kind of thing and hence the shareholders will be happy, because after all IBM EXISTS FOR THE SHAREHOLDERS ONLY, DOESN'T IT? Good customer support, work, happy clients all be damned in lieu of the almighty stock price.

In the 80s, over 70% of IBMers were employed in the U.S.. Today that number is less than 20%, and certainly is a number under 100K. The transition that guts American jobs, American compensation, and American benefits started back in the mid 90s and has not stopped since. IBM stock is near all-time highs, but that is based on financial hocus pocus that has taken nearly $100B of profits over the past 2 decades and repurchased stock propping up EPS every step of the way. Organic growth is anemic even with the $10s of Billions used to buy up other businesses. And with all this, IBM has a market cap of around $225B. Does anyone believe that if IBM didn't spend that $125B-150B on stock and new businesses that the company would be worth less than $100B. Think about it.</Msg><Username>stocksage49</Username><Timestamp>1371142914714</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 13:01:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371146092956-12</Id><Title>Happy Father's Day, enjoy some extra time off.</Title><Msg>Love, Ginny.</Msg><Username>hot_shorting_babe</Username><Timestamp>1371146092956</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 13:54:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371147617694-13</Id><Topic><Title>IBM and layoffs</Title><Username>jand2357</Username><Timestamp>1370366399824</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 13:19:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The math is very easy.
