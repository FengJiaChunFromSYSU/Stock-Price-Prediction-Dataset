This is where the big hurt will come from. Medicare? Ya will have to be older to get it and obama's death panelists will limit what ya get. Social security? Ya will have to be older to get it and ya won't get as much as ya now think ya will get. As for IBM's 401lk plan, be thankful ya have it, be thankful IBM contributes to it, be thankful ya have a job, be thankful this is obama's last term and pray that we survive it.</Msg><Username>hacker_boob</Username><Timestamp>1356876082006</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-30 09:01:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356905188160-2</Id><Topic><Title>Regarding the change in the 401 k plan . . .</Title><Username>hacker_boob</Username><Timestamp>1356876082006</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-30 09:01:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Things will look a little different when you get out of 4th grade - right now the death panels are from insurance companies and they get paid to turn down your claims........Please find another message board to haunt.</Msg><Username>randy111149</Username><Timestamp>1356905188160</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-30 17:06:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356905784002-3</Id><Topic><Title>Bill Clinton Balanced the Budget...
