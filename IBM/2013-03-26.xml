It seems like IBM is still getting punished for oracle's screw up and that's ridiculous. Oracle is a universally hated company who expanded their hardware sales force. They all missed their quotas and probably sold nothing and now oracle has to fire most of them.</Msg><Username>foo_fighter007</Username><Timestamp>1364302297409</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 08:51:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364304530022-2</Id><Title>Next month will be critical for IBM</Title><Msg>The stock might fall after hitting a new high as $217 Becareful with a mad cow.</Msg><Username>bigk95133</Username><Timestamp>1364304530022</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 09:28:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364306769360-3</Id><Title>End of Quarter Pump Job</Title><Msg>Good selling opporunity</Msg><Username>p1sorell</Username><Timestamp>1364306769360</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 10:06:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364308070581-4</Id><Topic><Title>Q1 2013 versus Q1 2012</Title><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1364250674969</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 18:31:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'd stick with global sentiment, the DJIA, and technicals.</Msg><Username>cs917047</Username><Timestamp>1364308070581</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 10:27:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364313675082-5</Id><Title>2012 Annual Report for IBM</Title><Msg>Why is much of the financial data in the annual report only showing 2011 and 2010 data, eg geo revenue pg 50...

Many, since I bought at the split adjusted price of $6 in the mid eighties. Lost half, briefly, in the early nineties, but my heirs will inherit it after I've lived off the dividends for another 30 years. I don't buy companies just to sell them when he markets move up or down. That would incur short/long term capital gains taxes and trading fees; who needs that?</Msg><Username>chance_pocketwatch</Username><Timestamp>1364322217882</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 14:23:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364324549801-7</Id><Title>Investors could also consider other technology stocks that are doing well right now.

Consumer sentiment weak. Housing sales below concensus. Richmond Manufacting down sharply from Feb. Stocks rally because instiutional money managers are window dressing. Did you see the last 2 moinuttes of trading? That is when the buy programs hit to close stocks strong.
