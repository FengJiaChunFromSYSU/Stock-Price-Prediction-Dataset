Foot traffic may be good, but profits? Also remember, 17 out of the last 20 Black Fridays had a upward move for the day on the DOW. We'll see what Monday brings when we're back to real numbers again. 2- The cease fire in Gazalalaland is likely temporary. Bambam didn't broker any deal, he financed it. 3-Cliff is still hanging over the markets and if you think the Dems will kiss the repukes on the cheek and make nice, you're living in lalaland also. The new bills that say "In Ben we trust" will start at $50. That'll buy you a honey crisp apple. And the folks over in Asia would rather buy knock offs than ItyyBittyMachines from the USA. But hey, gobble gobble........</Msg><Username>cmegladon</Username><Timestamp>1353695067805</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 13:24:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
