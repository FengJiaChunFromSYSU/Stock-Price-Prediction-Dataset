AAPL can't seem to make them fast enough because everywhere they are sold the inventories are lean -- you hear that on hold if you call a Best Buy, and T &amp; VZ concluded that demand was so strong at full price that they were leaving money on the table with iPad subsidies. After the iPhone 5 they may also adjust subsidies down. You can LOL all you want. You don't get it.</Msg><Username>yield_of_my_dreams</Username><Timestamp>1345503901000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-20 19:05:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345520667000-3</Id><Topic><Title>Buffett Likes IBM More Than INTC</Title><Username>qofaslave69</Username><Timestamp>1345332650000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 19:30:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>IBM has pricing power...INTC does not</Msg><Username>oa92000</Username><Timestamp>1345520667000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-20 23:44:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
