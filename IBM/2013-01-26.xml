I also get that the top 1 percent of american earners supplied 38 percent of income tax revenues before the recent Obama tax hike and that that will rise to an all-time record 42 percent this year because of the tax hike. I get how government beneficiaries completely outnumber government contributors at the ballot box in socialist countries and that that is happening in the U.S. now. What I DON'T get is that Americans USED to be able to SEE the horrors of incremental socialism in countless countries that adopted socialism before us and they flatly rejected it. Cuba, Venezuela, etc. have all suffered economic decline over the years and decades as a result of Obama-style policy implementation. Why can't America SEE what huge deficits and rampant money printing lead to. Why can't they see that our current 50 year low in capital spending is destroying our industrial base. Who ARE you people who love Obama but articulate well enough on this board to illustrate that you should know better than to see him as anything more than an economic disease in human form. What would our grandfathers say if they could See Obama's deficits and see how Obama's friend Bernanke is debasing our currency with all this debt-monetization... ... they would roll over in their graves for sure.

But, IBM continued to climb higher. Man, those shorts got their nuts roasted this past week. On the CC IBM said they have a positive outlook for the first half of 2013 especially with their new hardware. I would imagine the $16.70 the CFO guided to is a low ball number and they will deliver around $17 for 2013!</Msg><Username>qofaslave69</Username><Timestamp>1359241361500</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 18:02:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359241901848-5</Id><Title>13%YOY EPS Growth Rate</Title><Msg>On the CC Mark Loughridge announced that IBM enjoyed a 13% YOY EPS growth rate in 2012! He then proceeded to guide to $16.70 for the year 2013, and that is only a 9% growth rate. Will business slow down that much or is he sandbagging? I suggest the ladder, as they want to continue to play the Wall Street game of beat and raise. IBM will grow EPS at the same double digit rate it has for the past few years, and I expect about $17 per share in 2013! With its current multiple IBM is a $238 stock. I expect it to trade between $195 and $225 in $2013! IBM can pretty much control the EPS growth with their massive share buyback plan. I know many long term investors would rather see the money plowed into dividends. But, as long as IBM has their "roadmap to $20" the firm will be buying back shares heavily while gradually increasing the dividend. IBM is a long term hold in the portfolio. Good luck to all...</Msg><Username>qofaslave69</Username><Timestamp>1359241901848</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 18:11:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359246458350-6</Id><Topic><Title>13%YOY EPS Growth Rate</Title><Username>qofaslave69</Username><Timestamp>1359241901848</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 18:11:41 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"IBM can pretty much control the EPS growth with their massive share buyback plan" Well said. Now what is IBM doing about revenue? THAT is the m ost important stat that demonstrates the company's income. EPS is simple to doctor. Just have IBM buy more shares. Simple.</Msg><Username>zer0t0l</Username><Timestamp>1359246458350</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 19:27:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359247560877-7</Id><Title>VALV UP 200% this Monday</Title><Msg>See the news over there!</Msg><Username>vooodooodoc</Username><Timestamp>1359247560877</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 19:46:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359250011728-8</Id><Topic><Title>Why Is Big Government, Big Deficit, Socialism So Popular In America</Title><Username>bjspokanimal</Username><Timestamp>1359220102692</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 12:08:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>why do you care?
