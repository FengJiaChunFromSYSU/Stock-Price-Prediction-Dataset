First, I'm way under 70, but you needed a pat insult, so you chose ageism. That shows a weakness you will never outgrow. Second, your attempts to parse my diction expose your own failures at it. Third, nothing I say is ever stupid. Ever. Get used to that. Fourth, I've actually read the rules about decimal places, which are there to prevent this sort of behavior. Have you? Or are you the punk who keeps asking for a millionth of a dollar extra for his trades? Now, do you have a last word, or would you like to give me another good reason to have several?</Msg><Username>yourbestfriendintheworld</Username><Timestamp>1368680477263</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 01:01:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368680791384-2</Id><Topic><Title>Goldman Sachs's Kostin and his team say the index looks fully valued for now</Title><Username>buffetmunger</Username><Timestamp>1368456285286</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 10:44:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>They'll keep saying that. It will, eventually, turn, and then they'll say "see? told you so". It's near impossible to pick the top in a stock even when you work for the company. Forget trying to handicap the whole market. Crashes are always caused by panicked evacuation of leveraged positions. Nothing else causes that sort of rush for the exits. You'll never be allowed to know how much real leverage is in play, and you'll never be the first to see the trigger that starts the unwinding. Hedge or bail if you're fearful. But pretending you know, or forwarding what someone else pretends, doesn't inform good decisions by others.</Msg><Username>yourbestfriendintheworld</Username><Timestamp>1368680791384</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 01:06:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368713515633-3</Id><Title>Go Cisco!</Title><Msg>Looks like CSCO has some coat tails. I hope CSCO's success shows up in IBM's Q2 revenue. My guess is that after citing rollover deals in connection with the Q1 results that Q2 will have to look good for IBM to keep face. IBM does try to manage its image in anything they do. My guess at this point is they will exceed the estimate av for Q2. But we'll see about the outlook.</Msg><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1368713515633</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 10:11:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368714114368-4</Id><Title>9999999999999999</Title><Msg>999999999999999</Msg><Username>union.american123</Username><Timestamp>1368714114368</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 10:21:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368714155539-5</Id><Title>OBAMA,HOLDER,HILLARY !!!!!!!!!!!
