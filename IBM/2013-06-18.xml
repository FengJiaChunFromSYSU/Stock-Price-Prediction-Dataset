It is a myopic, short sighted management policy, aimed at providing shareholders only short term gains, but does not necessarily bode well for the company's long-term future There have been substantial job cuts in the R&amp;D centers, semiconductor development and software development sectors at IBM; those impacted by the "resource action" are the very folks who were developing tomorrow's great technologies at IBM. These researchers will now be snapped up by the competition, and develop innovative products and services at their new corporations which could have been IBM's future, and now won't be. These folks have been cut rather than the dead weight middle and upper management who through crony-ism seem to hold on to their jobs at Armonk, and elsewhere within IBM, at each job cut cycle. It is the staff under these people who do all the work for these multi-layers of VPs and SVPs; they themselves just delegate, and may not be cognizant of the inner workings of all the cogwheels in their organization. It is the general staff who holds the client lists, interact with clients and determine the clients' needs and wants, and when these worker bees' jobs are eliminated, the knowledge base and history is all lost, and senior management now left holding the empty bag is all discombobulated in the organizational wilderness. Cutting off your own legs from under you is not the best business model. Once the corporation's baby floats away with the tossed bath water it is lost forever, and with it quite possibly the future potential products and services- the very genetic code for the company's survival and evolution is lost forever. All in the name of the next quarter's financials to be presented to Wall Street.</Msg><Username>medchemlead</Username><Timestamp>1371561061031</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-18 09:11:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>11</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371564592639-2</Id><Title>Must be selling now...</Title><Msg>Next month it will post another loss for its 2Q's result.

I worked at IBM for 26 yrs.. Half of it in development lab!! If what you are saying is true.. Getting rid of worker bees and keeping Middle mngt!! That's a shame... My take on that situation.. Over the yrs, the worker bees who actually earn thier salary!! Don't have to be yes men!!! The ones in middle mngt, won't nothing but yes men and reality, never contributed much!!! Hey make no mistake there are some worthless worker bees, who need to be got rid of!!! Sad part, Part of them end up in middle mgmt, because, they will kiss thier bosses old rusty!! Bottom line.. If I had my 26 yrs to go over again.. I would have just said yes, instead of telling them they were crazy, about a lot of thier decisions!! I may could be running IBM by now!!! I have no idea where the country or IBM is headed from here??? All I know, is the people who fought the wars, to get us here!! Don't have a thing to do with what is going on right now... Majority rules!!! As witnessed by last 2 presidential elections... Seems the female population, just loves the black males.. Obama was voted in by the black vote and the female vote?? Don't say much for generations who got us here?? But those plantation owners did breed thier biggest and strongest bucks to thier biggest females, to make them superior atheletes... Now do you ever hear one word of thanks to all those plantation owners, out of the likes of Maject Johnson, Woods, Ali, Abdul and so on!! Hell no!! They all got attitudes, cause thier ancestry was brought over in slave ships.. Reality, if it weren't for cotton...They could have been born in Africa and starved to death!!!! Now they are like kings in the greatest nation, that ever existed!!! Woods, who keeps a hierom of blonds.. And married one to produce some milatas.. Denies he is an African American.. Guess he don't like the N word!!!! I personally think the N word shoud be comical to everyone by now!!! Black person says it.. It's comical??</Msg><Username>jrmills0014</Username><Timestamp>1371575148591</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-18 13:05:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371576547669-5</Id><Topic><Title>Throwing the baby out with the bath water- the IBM way</Title><Username>medchemlead</Username><Timestamp>1371561061031</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-18 09:11:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good example of a bitter, half-crazed, racist. jrmillsoo14 is going to be very unhappy with reality until he dies.</Msg><Username>canner01</Username><Timestamp>1371576547669</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-18 13:29:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371580937913-6</Id><Topic><Title>Throwing the baby out with the bath water- the IBM way</Title><Username>medchemlead</Username><Timestamp>1371561061031</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-18 09:11:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>3s don't innovate....dump em.

And ultimatly they were... I was running the photo lab at RTP!! As we were under site services... We had all these zerox telecopiers, that secretaries just never worried about where they were!!! They dumped them on me.. Trying to locate them after all those yrs, was about impossible.. In the mean time.. I basically had to sign off to pay for them... In the mean time Eastman Kodak come out with one that was supposed to be superior!!! I had some secretaries try them!! Bottom line they liked thier zerox's better... While everybody else was all excited about the new EKs.. The purchasing mng for all of IBM come in.. He had like 3 levels of mngt following his every move.. If he would hve stopped abrutly.. They would have ended up with thier noses up the others rectum!!! But ultimatly, he come to me.. I told him.. The Zerox were just as good if not better than EKs, and they were a lot cheaper... He said to me... I better be right!!! I thought to myself... Who the hell do you think you are talking to!! I ain't much above entry level.. But if they had of gone with the EKs!!! As they learnt over the yrs.. I would have raised teetotal hell!!!! Along the same time frame.. They had a group from Corp.. That come in.. I told them a printer they had developed, won't worth nothing!!! Bottom line:: Black lettering on silver paper, had a photo coping range of like 5% compared to 100% of black on white.. Very hard to photograph!!!! While all they wanted to hear was praise for the new technology, they had invested all that money in.. I told them it was a joke... Now I wish I would have told them it was great.. And joined thier little dumb $$$es!!! In the mean time.. IBMs backbone is mainframes!!! And IBM, has the only ones that can process all the data and store, and keep it secure!!! IBM is the U.S.s crown juwell!!</Msg><Username>jrmills0014</Username><Timestamp>1371582809422</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-18 15:13:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371585778866-8</Id><Topic><Title>IBM and layoffs</Title><Username>jand2357</Username><Timestamp>1370366399824</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 13:19:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Jand2357 - where did you learn grammar?? if you diagram that sentence, it will become apparent that "people who don't have a clue" is the core sentence. When you removed the extra words, you changed the sentence structure significantly, making "doesn't" correct. Unfortunately, that is not the sentence that wiwi constructed. Also, speaking of casting stones... "should be grateful that they employee hundreds". Perhaps you meant to say "they employ hundreds". To wiwi credit, she did not rub your nose in your spelling error. Perhaps you can learn a lesson from her/him since you obviously skipped humility class somewhere along the line.</Msg><Username>copywrites</Username><Timestamp>1371585778866</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-18 16:02:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371587586468-9</Id><Topic><Title>IBM and layoffs</Title><Username>jand2357</Username><Timestamp>1370366399824</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 13:19:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>When are foreigners going to stop questioning Americans?</Msg><Username>lou_took_my_pension</Username><Timestamp>1371587586468</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-18 16:33:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371593700626-10</Id><Topic><Title>IBM and layoffs</Title><Username>jand2357</Username><Timestamp>1370366399824</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 13:19:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>jand2357 broke my record for thumbs down.
