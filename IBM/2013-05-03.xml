"I didn't buy more. I didn't sell any ... I won't be a seller of IBM. I may be a buyer from time to time." He revealed, "I think we may have added a little bit this year in the first quarter. I'm pretty sure we have." ( See Berkshire Hathaway's 15 biggest stock holdings. ) Meanwhile, the self-proclaimed, tech-phobic Buffett also made big news this week when he joined Twitter. His first tweet from @WarrenBuffett read, "Warren is in the house." (Read More: @WarrenBuffett Joins Twitter-He's 'in the House' ) Not surprisingly, he quickly attracted a big following. And as of Friday morning with only two tweets sent, he had over a quarter million followers. Buffett sent his inaugural tweet during a live streaming video interview with Fortune to promote his editorial in the magazine.</Msg><Username>buffetmunger</Username><Timestamp>1367593943686</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 11:12:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367594432649-7</Id><Topic><Title>Buffet just said i will add....buy cheaper later......</Title><Username>buffetmunger</Username><Timestamp>1367593943686</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 11:12:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I believe that Buffett has added on average 1 mil more IBM shares per Q. He finished 2012 with about 64 mil shares and had about 68 mil at the end of 2012. It appears so far that Buffett is adding to mirror IBM's buyback since he increased his shares by about 6% in 2012.</Msg><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1367594432649</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 11:20:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367595973723-8</Id><Title>Berkshire Hathaway</Title><Msg>Berkshire Hathaway BRK.A +1.02% BRK.B +1.00% Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett, who joined the Twittersphere Thursday and already has a quarter million followers, is on a full-court media press ahead of the company’s annual meeting in Omaha.
