The anger is real and is showing up here. A few shills like to say that the shareholder value has never been better, which is true but at what COST? The employees are clearly angry about this one. IBM made a mistake and had better correct it.</Msg><Username>retiredexaon</Username><Timestamp>1354974988160</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-08 08:56:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354978920328-3</Id><Topic><Title>On the 401K debate</Title><Username>retiredexaon</Username><Timestamp>1354974988160</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-08 08:56:28 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You betcha it is. We can handle changes in OT rules, medical benefits, downsizing, re-leveling performance criteria and even the elimination of the defined pension plan. But when they start messing with potential gains of the plan that they hyped in replacing the pension plan, they have crossed the line. The "enhanced" 401K is barely in force and they are making drastic changes to it. IBM is still a good company but the penny pinching policies at employee expense is wearing on morale.</Msg><Username>c00leys</Username><Timestamp>1354978920328</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-08 10:02:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
