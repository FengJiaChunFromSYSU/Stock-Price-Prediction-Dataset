Same with monetary stimulus... a 0% fed-funds rate and printing $80 billion of new money to buy LONG-dated securities as well (QE3)... again... totally un-precedented in American history. Yet, the economy is barely growing at 1.3% GDP... with this kind of stimulus, it should be growing at 7%! It's like having a muscle car with 400 Horsepower under the hood and floor-boarding it... and ending up chugging down the road at barely 30 MPH! 6 years ago, the democrats took over congress and declared George Bush "dead on arrival". For the 1st year of his term, Obama enjoyed "absolute power"... including a filibuster-proof senate. Now he wants MORE time to try to grow the economy with big government and high taxes... say what? Meanwhile, investment capital is stampeding out of the country as Obama threatens the owners of that capital daily with class-warfare rhetoric. Apple billionaire and co-founder, Steve Wozniak, announced he was fleeing to Australia a couple of weeks ago.... not that long after Facebook co-founder, Eduardo Saverin, announced that he was taking his $3 billion of IPO money and fleeing to Singapore. Capitalism has SEIZED UP, people... nobody will invest and hundreds of $billions of capital is trapped off-shore. The only money being committed to the economy is Obama's rampant social spending... and the recipients of THAT money spend it all at Walmart on chinese stuff. My Grandfather would be disgusted if he saw who we've elected for President... and that national debt that we're leaving for our Kids is immoral. By the end of the next presidential term, the U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio will exceed that of Greece... maybe our economic policy shoud stop EMULATING that of Greece. 4 more years like the last 4, and Greece we will be.</Msg><Username>bjspokanimal</Username><Timestamp>1349717489586</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 13:31:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349720915072-3</Id><Title>correction to markets has a long way to go</Title><Msg>at least 5-10%</Msg><Username>counter_insurgency_buff</Username><Timestamp>1349720915072</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 14:28:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349723762265-4</Id><Topic><Title>Technicians looking for 1510 ? short term ?? before correction starts ???

Romney looks like he has Obama's number. I'll wager Obama only looked at the debate video once because he couldn't lay a glove on Romney. He looked like he was psyched-out. We could see Obama freeze and stammer and as he has done numerous times when ad-libbing in front of very friendly crowds at his own rallies. Those video's on youtube are funny but if he does it while strolling around at the next town hall format debate he will be in big trouble. Since no one knows this better than Mr. Obama, Romney can be expected to continue to ridicule his record on the economy even though it's a foreign policy debate. I expect that Romney is going to explain why our military has to remain strong and why we need adequate defenses. The decision to pull security in Libya by the Obama administration will be questioned. It does appear that Obama wanted appearances to point to a new day for US/Muslim relations wherein Muslims admire and adore Obama and all is well. Except the effort to have Americans appear safe in Libya -- that would be appear to be safe to the US media there to do a story -- that effort cost the life of four Americans. Obama will probably be asked to explain why those people had to die for his image. I'd like to hear his reply to that. Romney's debate advisor is Ted Olson who argued for Bush in Bush v Gore and after Roberts went on the Supreme Court he is the dean of Supreme Court lawyers. Romney is going to be equipped with the best coaching available. When Obama is speaking into the crowd at the town hall debate he may hear Romney's footsteps and screw up. The pressure is on Obama.</Msg><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1349725480596</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 15:44:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
