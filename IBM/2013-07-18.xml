It would seem that basically without the benefit of the tax rate, the operational increase is really $0.05 or so from what you thought previously. I just wanted to also be clear on that. What gives you confidence that you can hit those numbers? Perhaps the specifics around how the charge flows through in terms of cost saves and then what segments could possibly grow when you see some leverage. Mark Loughridge – SVP and CFO, Finance and Enterprise Transformation: Maybe the best way to really answer that is to take a look at the kind of the headwind-tailwind basis. So, if you look at the second half of the year, obviously we have a headwind on currency and more specifically within that the yen. We pointed out in the attachment that even though currency was an impact of 2% in the first half, we see about 3% in the second half. Our hardware business has been an impact to us in the first half of the year and we’re obviously dependent on the Asian GMU economy, which have been challenging in the first half. But I’ll tell you as we look at the second half, we have some very, very distinct tailwinds that we have driven to drive our performance. So, first of all, Software pipeline, we got a very good software pipeline going into the second half of the year, and if you look at that Software performance in the second quarter, boy, they really hit the bar. So, not only did Software grow the total by 5%, but that key branded middleware was up 10% and we gained share in every single one of the sub brands in that Software business. We see real momentum going from that second quarter into the second half of the year. Secondly very, very important, we ha</Msg><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1374144161395</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 06:42:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374144639614-5</Id><Topic><Title>IBM Confidence in Second Half</Title><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1374144161395</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 06:42:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>continued... ..... Secondly very, very important, we have services backlog growth on a constant currency basis of 7%. That is the best backlog growth positioning we’ve had in four years going into the second half, 3% at actual but that 7% at constant currency, the best we’ve seen in four years. Now against that in the second quarter, break it down by service lines, GBS returned to growth in the second quarter. They should further profit on that improvement in the entering backlog, and I would expect GBS to be firmly in that mid-single digit revenue growth in the third quarter. Likewise on our GTS business, GTS was down in the second quarter about 2%, but they had about 1.5 point impact from those restructured contracts last year that we spent a lot of time talking about in last year’s earnings call. So, if you adjust for that they came very close to a neutral performance in the second quarter, and with that I would expect GTS to return to low single-digit revenue growth in the third quarter as well. So now we’ve had good performance flow through to the second half from our Software business; better performance from our GTS and GBS business is driving performance; our workforce rebalancing yields, you know, we did a great job closing that right on the $1 billion that we had advised you of us we closed in the first quarter. That will begin to yield in the third quarter of the year and will get a full quarter’s benefit in the fourth quarter, and I think that is quite significant. I clearly alluded to the potential tax settlements that would see in a positive impact in our fourth quarter, but along with that we’ve had real strength in growth initiativ cloud through the first half of the year, up very, very strong...truncated</Msg><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1374144639614</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 06:50:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374145326474-6</Id><Topic><Title>IBM Confidence in Second Half</Title><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1374144161395</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 06:42:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hard to see IBM holding up here.</Msg><Username>sammsjohn99</Username><Timestamp>1374145326474</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 07:02:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374146118570-7</Id><Topic><Title>IBM Confidence in Second Half</Title><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1374144161395</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 06:42:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>SAP see weakness in Europe and Asia - not good for IBM?</Msg><Username>sammsjohn99</Username><Timestamp>1374146118570</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 07:15:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374147738822-8</Id><Topic><Title>Revenue missed by $450 million</Title><Username>etr8der</Username><Timestamp>1374094825088</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-17 17:00:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>But ain't that the question on everybodies mind??

Of the 47b of cloud revenue IBM is projecting for 2015, just $3 bil is new revenue. IBM announced this projection in 2010 for its 2011 - 2015 plan. That's close to 4% of IBM's existing revenue being shifted internally so it takes a lot of manpower and time to do that. But if IBM doesn't cannibalize they will lose customers. This internal shift as well as weak demand around the world is putting a lid on Revenue growth. But it won't last and soon IBM should have a big hybrid cloud and public cloud business.</Msg><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1374156571893</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 10:09:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374157432388-26</Id><Title>Buy Backs</Title><Msg>Are in full swing, who else would buy after that terrible quarter?</Msg><Username>monkfishale</Username><Timestamp>1374157432388</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 10:23:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374157779508-27</Id><Topic><Title>ibm celebrating today.....</Title><Username>txtrader77</Username><Timestamp>1374156268120</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 10:04:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"for show........it's worth no more then ~185......."

International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) has increased its annual forecast after beating income estimates for the quarter, despite missing revenue projections. Analysts had expected $25.3B in revenue but the company posted $24.9B revenue, a 3.3% decline from this quarter last year. After accounting for a $1B restructuring expense, the company reported earnings per share of $3.91, which beat analyst projections of $3.78 per share. The company has been focusing more on fast-growth areas such as data analysis and cloud computing as many technology companies are moving into or entering that market. IBM has also managed to cut costs by reducing its workforce, repurchasing stock, and shifting business from traditionally low-margin ventures. IBM has increased its annual earnings projections from $16.70 per share to $16.90 per share.</Msg><Username>adspatz</Username><Timestamp>1374158221027</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 10:37:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374159593305-29</Id><Topic><Title>Buy Backs</Title><Username>monkfishale</Username><Timestamp>1374157432388</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 10:23:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Are in full swing, who else would buy after that terrible quarter?"

You have to ask why IBM saw that steady strength to take it back -- was it the same set of funds or others that had been accumulating IBM or did that period bring in new buyers who ignored Goldman Sachs? They may be able to do this stuff with undetectable coordination. This Q2 reminds me of the same Goldman downgrade about a week before Q2 2009 results -- IBM held $100 going into earnings and then rose 15% in the next couple of weeks.

Its on one of the crooks downgrades?? They want it lower, while they buy!!! But I think, this time??? When it sinks in that revenues was 17% lower than a yr ago???? You can do some constructive things about profits... But, you can't change much about the revenues you are taking in!!! If revenues are down 17% in last yr??? Could they drop anouther 17% in next yr??? For yrs, I have thought IBM, was best buy, in the mkt, because of thier mainframes!!!!
