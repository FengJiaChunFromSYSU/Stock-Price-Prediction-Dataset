Every brokerage house has a team that breaks down something like this: 44 analysts, divided into five sector teams 23 traders 23 quantitative analysts Once the traders have already made their trades, the analysts release their findings to the public, so you're always too late to make any profitable trades. You're only making #$%$ up about what's already known to the general public and already priced into the market and it seems you are the only one who doesn't know this. Thinking you can predict the future based on pure fantasy tells a lot about you, but nothing about IBM. Too bad you can't get on net54baseball, where the real multimillionaires hang out, maybe you could get laughed out by predicting the price of collectibles. Too funny.</Msg><Username>gamalataki</Username><Timestamp>1374340180935</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 13:09:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374347148604-6</Id><Topic><Title>Next week at $192 again...</Title><Username>shoathai</Username><Timestamp>1374246361454</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 11:06:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What do you know that supports that statement of "192 next week" ?</Msg><Username>hdumpty123</Username><Timestamp>1374347148604</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 15:05:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374347207921-7</Id><Topic><Title>YOU ALL IDIOT!!!!</Title><Username>magiv_hegyoni</Username><Timestamp>1374264680125</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 16:11:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In the mean time!!!

Usually when IBM moves that much in one day! Either up or down!!! A lot of times it will recoup and end day at about middle of trading range for the day!!! As it didn't do that yesterday!! I think its a sure bet, we will see it trading below $192. early on Monday, unless for some reason the mkt is up big time!!! Just hope if you are playing it to go up.. More are playing it to go down.. Cause I am convinced, the ones who controll everything, are just manipulators!!! And and they got trillions, to push any stk, anywhere they want it!!!!! If retail investors are playing a stk to go in either direction... The manipulators can sit there and trade it back and forth, with no fees attached to thier trading!!! And most likely get most of the fees you pay as they play against you!!!! I think since March 2009.. When the manipulators had busted the whole #$%$ world... They started back buying.. At nearly nothing!!! Now they are sitting there with all that stk, that they have already made a fortune on... Just wanting retail investors, to bet, either way???? It's thier sand box... And don't forget it!!!!! What a stk is really worth, don't mean nothing anymore... It may be a yr or two, for the manipulators to teach that fact to people, on any given stk!!!! Hey they ain't smart.. They just got the money!!!! I picture, everyday people working for hedge funds.. With mentality of a billygoat!!! Hi Fying each other at end of day and saying we burnt those geniuses again today!!!</Msg><Username>jrmills0014</Username><Timestamp>1374351049059</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 16:10:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
