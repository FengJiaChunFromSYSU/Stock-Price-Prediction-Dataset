Ryan proposed the tough measures we need to reduce the Trillion dollar deficits that are bankrupting our country... do we embrace that boldness, or do we respond from the upcoming surge of attacks that Obama is about to unleash... ... the "throwing grandma over the cliff" attacks and the "taking food from children" attacks we all know are coming.

The bottom 49% of Americans currently pay no federal income tax. Obama want's to jack up the taxes on the top 1% to between 43 and 48% of the individual tax revenues paid. Romney Ryan want to tax the wealthy and corporations at rates that are globally competitive for attracting investment capital and compelling them to deploy that investment capital into jobs-producing business investments... which they are not doing now due to fear of Obama's proposals (eg: the static 8.3% un-employment rate is the result of that fear). I don't think the bottom 49% of Americans should be exempted from contributing to us finding a way to not become another Greece. I also think that another 49% fact... 49% of american households receive some form of government assistance... is too much. We could go a long way toward avoiding the results of Greece if 38% of Americans paid no income tax and if just 40% of American households received some form of government assistance... ... that is what Ryan proposes... and I support that.</Msg><Username>bjspokanimal</Username><Timestamp>1344817461000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 20:24:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
