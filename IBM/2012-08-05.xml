That being said, IBM used to move into a market segment to dominate it and crush the competition asap, though that practice goes back a long time. So why have they NOT entered the hand-held market for, oh, 10 or more years? Maybe they see that it is NOT what IBM specializes in, which is big data and data centers (ooops, forgot about Texas there.) Besides, RIMM is a dead company anyway, Blackberry had it's day in the sun and it is now dead. Or soon to be. If you are a true believer in IBM, I would rather think that IBM can do better in hand-held than buy a comatose technology.</Msg><Username>retiredexaon</Username><Timestamp>1344177901000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 10:45:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344179794000-3</Id><Topic><Title>IBM must acquire both AKAM &amp; RIMM, big blue will fly</Title><Username>casbah45</Username><Timestamp>1343339537000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 17:52:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Yield, you have no idea who I am but I will grant that IBM has some nifty small tricks in it's bag." No thanks -- no form of "grant" is necessary as the facts speak for themselves. You're a bystander and irrelevant. Would it make a difference if I had some idea of who you are? What you write also speaks for itself. I've got your number buddy.</Msg><Username>yield_of_my_dreams</Username><Timestamp>1344179794000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 11:16:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344187169000-4</Id><Topic><Title>Knight Capital</Title><Username>mr_dinky_dot_bomb</Username><Timestamp>1343926478000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 12:54:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Are IBM computers and software being removed this week?</Msg><Username>flatsflyer</Username><Timestamp>1344187169000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 13:19:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344191069000-5</Id><Title>What will IBM open at tomorrow??</Title><Msg>I figure about $197?? That comes from them showing the last trade in after hours on fri of $198.00 and that TDAMER. is showing bid at $196.73 ask $198.52.. Very unusual that ask ain't higher, than what it closed at on the previous day?? I would like to know what yall think it will trade at tomorrow... I know we got a small hit coming this week, as they will be paying the dividend, in the next couple of days!!! Now! should those dow futures be up 224 points, in pre mkt tomorrow, as bloomburg is showing right now.. Disregard this BS...IBM will open at over $200. What I can't figure out.. Is why bloomburg is showing Dow futures up 224???</Msg><Username>jrmills0014</Username><Timestamp>1344191069000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 14:24:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344203556000-6</Id><Topic><Title>What will IBM open at tomorrow??</Title><Username>jrmills0014</Username><Timestamp>1344191069000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 14:24:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>IBM will open down and continue lower if the program traders want to take the market down. You will know for sure by 10 AM EST. The computer driven trading controls the market for any short term period and they still are bent on moving the market down and selling into the rallies later in the week. It easy money for them but they can whipsaw you and change the pattern if too many are following their coat tails.
