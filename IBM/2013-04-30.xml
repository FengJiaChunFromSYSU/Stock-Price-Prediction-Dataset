IBM has spent well over 150 billion on buybacks since they 1st started back in 1996 .. however , the outstanding shares have only come down about 50% , should have been much lower .... one positive point , is that IBM has spent every penny authorized for buybacks , that's good .. many companies never use up their entire allocations for same. I understand that some amount the buybacks are for ESPP and also options for execs and other valued employees , also with the share price increasing nicely , the shares make for excellent currency to do deals , but the direct benefit to shareholders is somewhat diluted , large div increases can boost the stock even more ... i would have preferred about 75% of the allocated amount to buy back shares and rest doled out in divs , special divs if the company doesn't have a clear vision to sustain a higher div ... but , alas that's not IBM's way ... Just like when they sell off a unit .. shareholders get nothing and proceeds go into the till ... garce</Msg><Username>iamgarce</Username><Timestamp>1367356516494</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 17:15:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367357080134-16</Id><Title>IBM is a POS dinosaur</Title><Msg>buy backs my #$%$ dump the dino</Msg><Username>cavanyc</Username><Timestamp>1367357080134</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 17:24:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367359543377-17</Id><Title>macd curling up</Title><Msg>macd curling up</Msg><Username>triathlete_investor</Username><Timestamp>1367359543377</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 18:05:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367370842883-18</Id><Topic><Title>Shorting IBM at 215 in March and covering at 197 AH was like taking a candy...</Title><Username>n59218</Username><Timestamp>1366332209326</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 20:43:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>froznicehole: Chill out bud ... you'll be informed when the model generates the unmistakable signal. No system in the world is ready everyday and sufficient allowance in terms of time, must be given to "prime the pump and lubricate the parts" so to say, before the automata can predict with gt. than 93% accuracy. In the meanwhile, surfing the waves is recommended ... there are a zillion other fishes to look at in this wonderful market! Just salivating over one fish only, day-in and day-out, can make one loose perspective and miss out on other sure-shot opportunities, that are easy pickings ... just like, considering all the variables, going short in March at 215 here and covering at 197 was a relatively easy trade to make, after the system confirmations. No point in wasting time in an issue that is in a confirmed demil. zone.
