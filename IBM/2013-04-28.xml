Management came down hard and all of the sales staff were then mandated to fill out endless forms in the office justifying why 100% of their working day was really DEVOTED TO FIELD WORK. Crazy. The sales staff were #$%$ and if you start to get these fellows mad ..... Ginny has made the same mistake as John did. One Thomas Watson would NEVER ever make.</Msg><Username>retiredexaon</Username><Timestamp>1367149915754</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-28 07:51:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367171438411-2</Id><Title>IBM comment by Ginny</Title><Msg>The short of it is that she said IBM has to move faster, respond more quickly to customers. OK, not bad really but then again IBM should take CARE of it's customers. Gee, AstraZeneca was lost, the Texas Data Center project died, ServiceMaster, Hilton, others have all chucked IBM support for failing TO SUPPORT as per agreements. That has nothing to do with responding quickly. RESPONDING RIGHT is better, but then again when the answers come from India, what more can you expect.</Msg><Username>retiredexaon</Username><Timestamp>1367171438411</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-28 13:50:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367203672497-3</Id><Topic><Title>IBM comment by Ginny</Title><Username>retiredexaon</Username><Timestamp>1367171438411</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-28 13:50:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>First time I eve worried abourt IBM was when they made the decision to do the 401k paments at the end of the year insteed of paying it out with each paycheck.
