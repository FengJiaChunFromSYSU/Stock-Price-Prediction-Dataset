The USA generates a GDP of $15.61 trillion with a public debt 101% of GDP. Sorry was it the USA or Europe you said had the problem managing its economy? Singapore is not a viable economic model for an economy the size of a continent. That's like saying Europe should adopt the economic model of the Principality of Monaco - offer low taxes but raise property prices so only high rollers can afford to live there.</Msg><Username>chris_cork</Username><Timestamp>1348581710434</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-25 10:01:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348584322158-2</Id><Topic><Title>Election's Impact on Stocks</Title><Username>dopytrader</Username><Timestamp>1348495533905</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 10:05:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>47% is the best comment ever.

The volume is really drying up in this stock and it indicates that after the big move from $193 to $206 that investors are holding on and not willing to sell their shares. Typically, this pattern precedes a leg up in a stock. Even though INTC, ADBE, TXN, CAT and other multi-national firms have lowered guidance, the software and services space is holding up well. ORCL and TIBX reported solid quarters last week, and I suspect IBM will beat and raise at the October EPS report.

Asia has 2, financial centers... Hong Kong in North asia, and Singapore in south asia. To say that Singapore is an insufficient example of a sovereign national economy is the craziest thing I've heard this year. Keynsianism is popular in anti-capitalist, hate-the-rich societies... Supply-side economics is popular in countries that prefer to unleash the immense power of capitalism to foster growth and prosperity without regard for how rich the people are who are hiring all it's citizens. The Brazillian founder of Facebook fled the U.S. economy in favor of Singapore and now THEY are enjoying the fruits of his $3 billion in investments. Today, I heard that Apple's Steve Wozniack was fleeing american class-envy in favor of the more capital-friendly location of Australia. I'm sure HIS fortune will contribute to a lot of business development and jobs in THAT country.
