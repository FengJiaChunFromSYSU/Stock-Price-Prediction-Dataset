There are many saying IBM is steady and a buy at $193! I am not so sure about that. The market is in correction and nobody knows when it will turn around. Also, nobody knows when IBM has bottomed because it has pierced all key technical levels in heavy volume. If it trades down to $183 i would think that would be a good entry point? But, who knows? It can go much lower. Good luck!</Msg><Username>qofaslave69</Username><Timestamp>1350745515927</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-20 11:05:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350748012906-2</Id><Topic><Title>$183.60 is the critical bottom.</Title><Username>cmegladon</Username><Timestamp>1350587262557</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 15:07:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>After several hours of crunching the numbers my computer has just confirmed that there is no way the stock price will go below $204.6725. ,,, seriously, I think you'll see support at ~ 189.75 to 190.25 lot of variables with the current market, but I'll be starting to buy there. one of the variables is that if things really start to go south, IBM will benefit from a "rush to quality"</Msg><Username>evendaypumper</Username><Timestamp>1350748012906</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-20 11:46:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350748493647-3</Id><Topic><Title>IBD Buy Point $208.09</Title><Username>qofaslave69</Username><Timestamp>1349277906251</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 11:25:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"The EPS report looks like it may be the catalyst to move the IBM stock higher?

In 2011, income expectation was around $13.20, IBM reported $13.44. For 2012, income expectation (confirmed by IBM) is $15.13 For 2012, IBM earns about $1.70 more than 2011 which translates to $20 to 25 higher price than 2011. For 2012, IBM should trade at min of $195 and max of $220. Regardless of the market direction, IBM price at the end of 2012 should be above the mid range of 2012. We are almost close to the end of 2012 and IBM price should be above the mean or $208. S&amp;P has target of $227 for IBM. Current IBM price is below min range and big guys are crunching number.They know for sure that this is the best opportunity to buy the most stable and reliable stock at very low price.</Msg><Username>cash_is_king_now</Username><Timestamp>1350774638814</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-20 19:10:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message></Date>
