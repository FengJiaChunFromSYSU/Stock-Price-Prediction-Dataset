Jan $270 call (same distance out-of-the-money) is only 17%. $150 put is $1.30 but $270 call just $0.40. That's an incredibly steep impl. vol. skew. So either the options market is totally wrong or the stock is heading for a crash. Meanwhile June $200 is 4X as expensive as June $220 ($0.85 versus $0.20). So take a guess what is about to happen...</Msg><Username>jand2357</Username><Timestamp>1370286020360</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-03 15:00:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370295734322-4</Id><Topic><Title>Bought at $10.00</Title><Username>zer0t0l</Username><Timestamp>1369971489413</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 23:38:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If you sell in the US.</Msg><Username>jand2357</Username><Timestamp>1370295734322</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-03 17:42:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370297527315-5</Id><Topic><Title>IBM puts</Title><Username>jand2357</Username><Timestamp>1370286020360</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-03 15:00:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm panicking.

Its always more likely a stock will move quickly to the downside (thinking of EU crisis or some other event) than a stock moving up. Less chance of IBM moving up 50 points than moving down. What you might want to also look at is the open interest. Jan has about 40,000 calls above the current strike and about 34,000 puts. The Jan 230 strike alone has 11,472 open interest! Also these aren't huge numbers for a company IBM's market size. Look at JNJ or GM.</Msg><Username>findingbigtips</Username><Timestamp>1370298384008</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-03 18:26:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370307369056-7</Id><Topic><Title>Bought at $10.00</Title><Username>zer0t0l</Username><Timestamp>1369971489413</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 23:38:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If in fact what you say is true, can you please explain to the rest of us why you spend your time on this Message Board. I will say this my father-in-law was a stock broker in the era you are speaking of and he always held IBM and it made him a multimillionaire. And then he passed in '87 and the Executrix didn't know what they were doing and sold IBM. He did not accumulate what you have but he certainly did alright for himself. And I'll add the smartest man I have ever known, a retired Colonel, an engineer employed by Boeing and General Electric, at Nasa, and then retired and became a stock broker.</Msg><Username>dino2hootie</Username><Timestamp>1370307369056</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-03 20:56:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370307933461-8</Id><Topic><Title>Bought at $10.00</Title><Username>zer0t0l</Username><Timestamp>1369971489413</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 23:38:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I spend my time on this msg board because I'm bored and have nothing better to do except count my money.
