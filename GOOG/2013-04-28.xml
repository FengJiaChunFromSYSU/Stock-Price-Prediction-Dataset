Local Corp Is the Best Internet Bet!</Title><Msg>Which Is the Best Internet Bet? By Mohsin Saeed - April 27, 2013 Mohsin is a member of The Motley Fool Blog Network -- entries represent the personal opinion of the blogger and are not formally edited. The Internet-advertisement industry is one of the fastest growing markets in the technology sector. With earnings season in full swing, investors can get an update on which companies are making headway in this space. Yahoo! (NASDAQ: YHOO) reported its first-quarter results in recent days. The company experienced an increase in profits but a 7% decline in revenue due to weaker revenue performance in Yahoo!'s core business. The entire company is undergoing a massive overhaul led by its new CEO Marissa Mayer, which has been met with positive investor sentiment. At current valuations, I believe Yahoo! has an upside of 30% and is value play for the US advertisement industry. The industry The US advertisement industry is one of the fastest-growing entities in the entire stock market. This huge industry has been supported by the rise in handheld devices, which ensure that users are connected to the Internet at all times. As compared to PC consumers stuck with bulky devices, which are much more difficult to carry around, handheld users can go online at any time. This single fact has significantly increased the amount of time that users spend online and is the primary reason behind the high expectations surrounding this industry. According to data collected by Reuters, the US Internet-advertisement market grew by 15% last year and currently stands at approximately $36.6 billion. More data from PWC reveals that the key to growth in this space is handheld devices with revenue from smartphones doubling last year.</Msg><Username>flankenking</Username><Timestamp>1367142625537</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-28 05:50:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367154698829-2</Id><Title>NFLX up 31.68%, BBRY up 8.53% last week</Title><Msg>ggggggggggggggggggggggggggg</Msg><Username>aea_fyi2</Username><Timestamp>1367154698829</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-28 09:11:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367160353603-3</Id><Title>Gmail is Evil</Title><Msg>Gmail has become an important part of many people's lives and businesses. Beware that google can disable your gmail account. Was the account hacked? Did I violate some policy? Is there another reason? I don't know because they never provided any explanation and can't even be bothered to reply to multiple requests. Fortunately this was a gmail account I was in the process of phasing out. Unfortunately I've read many similar horror stories of other gmail users that have the same problem and never get a reply. I hate to say it but gmail is evil. I'd rather pay for a product than put up with BS like this. P.S. If any techs at google read this board and want to fix the problem before I continue to spread the truth about your company online, please free to email me in yahoo at mrpanick.</Msg><Username>don_t_panick</Username><Timestamp>1367160353603</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-28 10:45:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367160983717-4</Id><Topic><Title>Which Is the Best Internet Bet?

Google currently holds the number-one position in the US advertisement industry with a market share of approximately 50%, followed by Facebook. Google has reported total US advertisement revenue of approximately $17 billion. The display-ads market is a different story, and is being led by Facebook, which has total revenue of $2.6 billion. Google is quickly catching up with Facebook in the display segment, as well, and some analysts expect that Google's market share will exceed that of Facebook by the end of 2014. Yahoo! is currently at the third position in the display segment and saw negative growth during the quarter. During the quarter, there was an 11% decline and 'ads sold' fell approximately 7% year-over-year. One of the major reasons for this performance was the redesign of the Yahoo! homepage and email, which meant that multiple engagement trends were redefined. The search revenue saw a slightly better quarter, with y-o-y growth of 6.5% (10% of the closure of Korean operations are excluded). There was a significant increase of 16% in paid clicks, but it was somewhat offset by a 7% decline in CPC. Facebook is currently my top pick in the Internet advertisement industry due to its mobile-monetization strength. Although Google has the Android OS on its side, the company has still not fully monetized its potential. Yahoo! will have to further improve its display segment growth if it wants to avoid revenue erosion by Facebook and Google.</Msg><Username>flankenking</Username><Timestamp>1367160983717</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-28 10:56:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367167171237-5</Id><Topic><Title>Novel Johnny Dirtbag "Movie Star" vs. "Lean In"; Gwyneth Samberg's literary masterpiece------</Title><Username>disgracedpublicist757</Username><Timestamp>1364264288733</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 22:18:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Lean In", the masterpiece from newcomer Gwyneth Sanberg is a very nice book; people that read it will probably like it like it a whole lot.

This is not because earnings will not grow (they will), but the multiple you are paying right now is still a little stretched.
