Personally, I cannot think of a reason to use the old "evil" Google if the new "good" version existed. My guess is that a majority of people would feel the same. The only problem is that the CIA and/or NSA would not sponsor it to get it started and it would not be nearly as profitable. So, who would invest in it?</Msg><Username>mondomario</Username><Timestamp>1351683080914</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 07:31:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351683227493-3</Id><Topic><Title>I thought new yorkers were tough!</Title><Username>kingcuffs</Username><Timestamp>1351648639783</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 21:57:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It was not your typical New Yorker who closed the exchanges.

And all these comparisons to Bush is ludacrious. The stock market collapsed shortly after Bush took office because of Clinton's #$%$ policies and we had one of the worst terrorist attacks in history under Bush. Why not compare Romney to Reagan, same policies. Or maybe i should compare the similar democratic policies of Obama to Clinton.. Wow, that's right, they're just not working..He's an amateur. 5. His policies are supposed to help the lower and middle classes but are actually destroying them with higher gas and food prices. 6. He had his chance at tax reform so that people like Buffett and the hollywood idiots would actually pay more taxes but he did nothing. Why? Because he needed the campaign money.... 7. Cash for clunkers 8. Bailout for auto industry that could have been acheived through the normal bankrupcy proceedings just like other industries like airlines. 9. He never accepts blame for anything. 10. If the democratic policies were so great then Obama would have achieved something other than miserable failure. 11.
