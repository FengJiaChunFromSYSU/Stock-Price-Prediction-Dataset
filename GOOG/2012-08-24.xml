(BCOV), a leading provider of cloud-based solutions for publishing and distributing professional digital media, today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire privately-held Zencoder, a leading cloud-based video encoding service used by more than 1,000 organizations worldwide. Zencoder also provides Video.js, an open source HTML5 video player used on more than 24,000 websites*. "The Zencoder team is excited to join Brightcove," said Jon Dahl, chief executive officer and co-founder of Zencoder. "Our founding mission was to build the best suite of media processing services in the cloud, with a focus on powerful, API-based tools for developers. Brightcove shares this vision, and by joining forces, we believe that we will be well positioned to accelerate Zencoder’s growth."</Msg><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1345827174814</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 12:52:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345827815399-21</Id><Topic><Title>ON2 case: With an opt-out class</Title><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1302635817000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2011-04-12 15:16:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Re: ON2 case: With an opt-out class By casp321.1 year 3 months ago.Permalink .

July 26, 2012 9:30 PM Jolie O'Dell In a $30 million deal, online video publishing company Brightcove has acquired Zencoder, a startup specializing in video encoding. Like the union between Kanye West and Kim Kardashian, we universally acknowledge the correctness of the match and wonder what took ‘em so long. Zencoder’s services make video encoding two to 10 times faster than similar offerings. Zencoder also holds the keys to Video.js, an open-source HTML5 video player. Zencoder was founded in 2007 but got its sea legs in the Y Combinator winter class of 2010. It took a modest $2 million round of funding in April 2011. The company’s 10-person team is headquartered in San Francisco, Calif. Brightcove, on the other hand, went public in February with a $60 million IPO. The company reported very nearly $20 million in revenue during its first earnings call, and it’s been particularly targeting dual-screen apps — that is, applications for using a tablet as a peripheral device for a television.</Msg><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1345827815399</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 13:03:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345827946347-22</Id><Topic><Title>ON2/Google: Remember ON2 shareholders will CHASE and uncover what you've COVRED!!</Title><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1321539455000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2011-11-17 09:17:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>6) Brightcoe; Brightcove CEO once said who would not like "free" ... related to VP8</Msg><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1345827946347</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 13:05:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345828087820-23</Id><Topic><Title>ON2, Hantro, Verisilicon, Google: Was it spin-in or reverse-merger?</Title><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1335274336000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-04-24 09:32:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Re: Zencoder, Heroku ,Salesforce, ON2 FlixEngine/FlixCloud...

These Google ad products allow publishers to deliver DoubleClick In-Stream as well as Google AdSense for Video (AFV) ads and allows users to dynamically allocate the best ad from either system. The Video Cloud integration is built based upon the Google IMA SDK version 2. The Video Cloud ad translator for DFP IMA supports video ads (In-Stream, Google video, or VAST video), Google text/overlay/graphic/InVideo ads, HTML companions, custom ad formats (via the Video Cloud external ad API) and Video Cloud ad format XML. It does not support Flash in Flash ads. For more information on trafficking ads in DFP, see DoubleClick's DFP Specific Information. The Google IMA SDK is not only the newest product from DoubleClick but the recommended product version. Video Cloud has integrated with the Rich Media product since 2007 and highly recommends that all customers currently using a form of the DART Rich Media product integration upgrade to this new version. The dynamic allocation capabilities from Google ensure that ads will always be available for monetization, provide easy and full support for multiple HTML companions and, since the product is written in the latest Flash technology (ActionScript 3.0), it is faster and more reliable than ever. Brightcove has also made several enhancements with this new integration, including support for availability forecasting. As in previous integration versions, both Video Cloud ad formats (trafficked through DoubleClick) and Video Cloud external ads API are fully supported.</Msg><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1345828983079</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 13:23:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345829221217-25</Id><Topic><Title>Why did ON2's customers/Clients/Partners DELAY their products with VP8?</Title><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1291080628000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2010-11-29 20:30:28 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>New Brightcove Video Cloud Express Integration with DoubleClick's DFP Small Business Chris Johnston on October 19, 2011 Business got a whole lot more interesting this week for burgeoning media companies who are just starting to make money from their nascent online video efforts.

Video Cloud Express has been around for some time, enabling even the smallest of businesses to use video efficiently. And advertising capabilities have always been available for Express 499 through Brightcove's partnership with Tremor Video. But until now, there weren't any options for Express $199 customers, and there was no ability for Express customers to sell their own ads. Today's announcement changes all that. First, users of Express $499 will notice right away that there are two additional ad sources available in the Video Cloud Advertising Module: OpenX and DFP. OpenX is a free, open source ad serving system that anyone can download and install to run their own ad server.

Other online video player enhancments include support for the VAST 2.0 advertising standard and turnkey integration with Google DoubleClick ad serving solutions for HTML5 video. In a new whitepaper released today on HTML5 video tag behavior, we describe a number of common video player problems encountered in the industry based on operating system version and browser compatibility on popular smartphones and tablets. These issues can prevent smooth video playback and block reliable ad delivery and analytics, resulting in poor user experiences and ineffective content monetization. We are also very pleased to announce Smart Player support for the VAST 2.0 advertising standard, as well as turnkey integration with Google DoubleClick ad serving solutions for HTML5 video. In a Brightove press release announcing the new Video Cloud Smart Player, Google Group Product Manager Rany Ng, comments: "Google believes in the growing importance and evolution of HTML5 to enable distribution across multiple devices and browsers.

Here's What President Obama Said At Marissa Mayer's House Last Night Henry Blodget, provided by Published 4:00 a.m., Friday, October 22, 2010 President Obama dropped by Marissa Mayer's house in Palo Alto last night for a $30,000-a-plate Silicon Valley fund raiser. Afterwards, on Twitter, Marissa was understandably excited: "The President came to our house for dinner tonight. It was absolutely surreal!" The president started by noting the giant Halloween decorations. Then he talked about the success of Silicon Valley and the depressing state of much of the rest of the nation, before walking outside and meeting some Palo Alto-ers gathered on the sidewalk. Here's the press pool report on the event, provided by SF Gate: Setting: Big brown shingled home was decorated with huge blow up Halloween decorations on the roof (pumpkins, black cats, etc.). Inside about 50 diners inside small wood beamed dining room....with Giants-Phillies game updates at the ready throughout the President's fundraiser. Obama entered through the kitchen to be greeted with warm applause and standing ovation from the crowd in the adjoining dining room; they included Democratic fundraiser and Silicon Valley insider Wade Randlett. Before he spoke, Mayer's husband Zachary Bogue delivered the news: "First, an important announcement, Giants game is 3-2 Phillies." "Despite the game, we want to thank you all for being here," said Bogue, standing next to Mayer. Mayer reminded the crowd that the garage where Silicon Valley giant Hewlett Packard was founded "is just a few blocks away." Obama told the diners to sit down and said "I'm not going to bore you with a long speech." "My main message is to say thank you to Zachary and Marissa for opening up this wonderful home...I was especially thrilled to see the pumpkins and the Halloween stuff out there." That's because "I will be home on Sunday night when the girls get dressed up and do some trick or treating," he said.</Msg><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1345846813019</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 18:20:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345846985753-44</Id><Topic><Title>This is why yahoo and google getting away with ...</Title><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1345846813019</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 18:20:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Is this enough to rob American people from their investments in small companies?

Samsung wasn't able to prove any of Apple's patents invalid, which is the major point that could affect other smartphone industry titans. Armed with loads of significant patents now deemed valid in court, Apple could go on to sue other companies -- namely, Android maker Google (GOOG, Fortune 500) and its hardware partners. Samsung is the largest manufacturer of Android devices, and while the software does vary a bit across manufacturers, it's largely similar. So smartphone makers could be sued for similar software infringements, and Google may have to tweak Android's user interface.

And it's not hard to imagine this easily doubling to $5 billion over the next 12 months. How is Google bringing in this cash?

By doing what Google does best ... ads (and you thought I was going to say search, didn't you!). But Google can push ads all over the web without needing a device to do it. Where does Android, and specifically tablets and smartphones running Android, fit into this picture?</Msg><Username>pramood21</Username><Timestamp>1345866949003</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 23:55:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
