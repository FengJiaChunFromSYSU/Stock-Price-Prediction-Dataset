The company is probably one of the most well-known royalty revenue companies. Its portfolio consists of approximately 18,000 patents ranging from 2G and 3G to 4G LTE and 802.11 technologies. In June, InterDigital sold 1,700 of its 3G and 4G LTE wireless patents to Intel for $375 million. According to company estimates, it should be able to replace these 1,700 patents with new discoveries within 18 months. Based on the rough price of $221,000 per patent, InterDigital's patent portfolio alone could be worth around $4 billion if it were sold (compared to its current market cap of $1.58 billion). Although royalty revenue is only guaranteed if InterDigital's wireless solutions are utilized, the company managed to produce $302 million in royalty revenue in 2011 and appears to be destined for more patent sales in the future. Addinionally, one more catalyst in place is IDCC's share repurchase programs. The company's $200 million share repurchase program announced on June 18 is the second share repurchase program announced this year. The first was a $100 million program announced on May 4. These share repurchases are extremely accretive to shareholder value at current prices. The valuations for InterDigital are extremely attractive. InterDigital has two publicly traded comps, Rambus (RMBS) and Tessera Technologies (TSRA). On an EV/patent basis, InterDigital is trading at a significant discount to its publicly traded comps. At the end of 2011, InterDigital had 19,500 patents. After the Intel transaction, IDCC has about 17,800 patents. IDCC had $421 net cash at the end of Q1 plus $250 million for Intel transaction gives it a net cash position of $671 million. With 45.9 million shares outstanding times a share price of $28.63 leads to a market cap of $1.31 billion and an EV of $643 million. The market is currently valuing InterDigital at about $36.1k a patent. Rambus has an EV of $526 million with 1,386 patents and 1,059 patent applications pending. RMBS is trading on an EV/patent basis of $215.1k. Tessera has 1,736 patents with an EV of $288 million for an EV/patent price of $165.9k a patent. Taking Tessera's low multiple of $165.9k/patent leads to an EV of $2.95 billion for IDCC. Adding back net cash of $671 million leads to a market cap of $3.62 billion or a price of about $79/share. There have been a number of notable transactions done on the private market that have received a lot of press including IDCC's own transaction with Intel. Other transactions have included Tessera's purchase of 73 patents for $35 million from MoSys for a price of $479k/patent. The Microsoft (MSFT)/Facebook (FB) transaction led to a price per patent of $846k/patent. The Microsoft/AOL (AOL) deal was done at $1.19 million/patent. A microcap, Tegal (TGAL), did a 35 patent transaction for about $114k/patent. With transactions per patent ranging between $114k/patent and $1.19 million/patent, finding a good estimate for IDCC's patents may be a fruitless exercise. However, assuming they are worth at the lower end of private market transactions provides significant upside. For example, taking Tegal's $114k/patent transaction an applying it to IDCC suggests an EV of $2.0 billion. Adding back net cash of $671 million suggests an equity price of about $58/share. On an absolute basis, there is significant upside as well. IDCC is expected to record revenues of $277 million this year. With about $25 million in depreciation and amortization expenses and $65 million in patent development costs, leaving costs of $70 million consisting of SG&amp;A and patent administration and licensing. If the company stopped development of new patents and simply worked on licensing its current portfolio, the company would generate about $207 million in EBITDA this year. With a tax rate of 30%, that would leave $145 million for shareholders. A 10% discount rate suggests an EV of about $1.45 billion. With cash, this suggests a market cap of $2.12 billion and a per share price of about $46/share. Notably, this is a very rough and inexact estimate, but this does provide a data point. Industry growth is expected to be strong as worldwide handset shipments should continue to rise and the 4G/LTE trends. THIS COMPANY IS EXTREMELLY UNDERVALUED !!!!

Where are all the peace freaks that voted Obama in as the POTUS to end all wars?? If this were Bush they'd be out in force. This is the same Obama that stood up Netanyahu for appearacnes on The View, Letterman, meetings with Beounce and her criminal dude, and endless more to come Hollywood IMAGE show venues. The world is abosultely closer to exploding than ever before (war like as well as economic collapse) and Obama keeps chiming in with more redistribution plans and more spending. Our military is weakened already with other nations building up and openly supporting Iran and Syria (i.e. China/Russia) and Obama (indeed the Black Muslim as Madonna recently bragged) seems to also stand with Iran/Syria and the Brotherhood. 2012 must first and foremost be about anyone but Obama. Then we can hold the new guys feet to the fire with eyes already on 2016 with serious change in mind such that we can fix this mess for our kids and grandkids. Obama is still out there blaming Bush without any reassertion of his own cliams that if he can't fix it in 4 years then he should be a one term POTUS. Now it's all Bush, Bush, Bush when in reality this whole mess belongs to dems as they have laid the most horrific seeds of destruction over the last 100 years and as Greenspan indeed alluded to in 2009 'we are ending a 100 year business cycle.' All the failures of today were signed into law by the democrats: 1913 Fed Reserve Bank that has destroyed our currency, 1933 FDR SS, 1964 LBJ Medicare/Great Society, and now Obama under Pelosi democrate Congress more debt increase in 3.75 years than all prior Presidents combined. Folks have to be so naive to not see these facts. We are suffering today from all this democrat party philosophy cradle to grave government and we owe our kids better. Obama blames everything on Bush (i.e. the cost of two wars that he also is ramping up in Afganistan because that's what the military command says must be and Obama like Bush follows the military command) but then Obama says nothing about the most huge evert "TAX" to hit our nation kicking in 2014 Obamacare. Citizens today are too image oriented only seeing the cleverness and not heeding the actual devestaing situation of our nation about to fall under the massive debt load and Obama says spend spend spend.</Msg><Username>omni1tsd</Username><Timestamp>1348827660306</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 06:21:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348828346542-3</Id><Title>Special Forces</Title><Msg>Special Forces Major David King on TV now chastising Obama and Clinton for taking credit for Bin Laden kill stating 'they take no credit for the economy yet acclaim they killed Bin Laden when if fact we the Special Forces of the US Military did.

Along with the patent portfolio, VRNG hired David Cohen. Guess who he is? He used to be Nokia's chief litigator in the United States. "Was he any good," is the next question. Yeah, he sure was. He beat Apple (AAPL), a notoriously hard company to beat in litigation over patents (see below). Telcom companies are used to paying license fees on patents related to standards. Computer companies like to fight a bit more. Apple had to pay Nokia $750 million. So I like having David Cohen on my side. He knows intimately the NOK patent portfolio. He knows how to prosecute it. He knows where the skeletons are that are infringing. He knows, he knows, he knows. I can go on. Again, the low-hanging fruit gets you to $5 by itself. Then we litigate and get higher. How much higher? I have no idea. But I own the stock and look forward to it. ---------------------------- By National Post By National Post December 8, 2005 Certainly, 10 years earlier when Messrs. Stout and Campana started filing patents on the Chicago-area inventor's behalf so they could one day capitalize on his work, they had no idea they might one day hit their biggest payday against a company whose product has generated worldwide sales of more than US$3-billion in the short time it has been on the market. Mr. Stout prefers to see NTP's court victories against RIM as vindication of his partner's work. "Tom's patents were filed in 1991 and RIM wasn't doing it at the time," says Mr. Stout, raising his voice to emphasize the point. "[RIM] developed a very successful product beginning in 1999. The patent laws say if you infringe, that's your problem. There's nothing that requires us to make a product." Two companies, apparently, agree with Mr. Stout. NTP has signed licensing deals for undisclosed sums with Good Technology Inc., a Santa Clara, Calif.-based mobile data software supplier, and Finnish cellphone giant Nokia Oyj that let the wireless e-mail newcomers use the company's patents in the U.S. "People are willing to deal with us," he said. ---------------------- 2005: Research In Motion Judge Rules Against Settlement Research In Motion Judge Rules Against Settlement (Update8) By Susan Decker - November 30, 2005 Stout said Research In Motion could have ended the case for about $50 million early on. Research In Motion has been ``defiant,'' he said. The suit was filed in 2001. ``It's not like we want to shut down RIM down,'' Stout said. The $450 million agreement broke down because ``the conditions that were attached to the payment of the money were totally unacceptable to us,'' he said.</Msg><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1348833397359</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 07:56:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348833874318-8</Id><Topic><Title>EXPECTING Short-Long Hedge on GOOG PPS</Title><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1348832832267</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 07:47:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>By National Post December 8, 2005 Mr. Stout prefers to see NTP's court victories against RIM as vindication of his partner's work.

Citing a lengthy pattern of deception and the potential to flee, U.S. Central District Chief Magistrate Judge Suzanne Segal ordered Nakoula to remain in prison without bond until another judge can hold a hearing to determine if he broke the terms of his probation. "The court has a lack of trust in this defendant at this time," Segal said. Prosecutors noted Nakoula had eight probation violations, including lying to his probation officers and using aliases. He could face new charges that carry a maximum two-year prison term. After his 2010 conviction, Nakoula was sentenced to 21 months in prison and was barred from using computers or the Internet for five years without approval from his probation officer, though prosecutors said none of the violations involved the Internet. He also wasn't supposed to use any name other than his true legal name without the prior written approval of his probation officer.</Msg><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1348845600439</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 11:20:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348845648380-38</Id><Title>Market Crash next week,get out now</Title><Msg>It's coming folks.

I'll summarize first to show how google originators and their friends might be operating and making money by stealing from small companies' shareholders, like ON2, from bribing a few technical staffs to having "friendly" relations to ... One example is how Google is using Verisilicon service to license ON2's Hantro chipset with VPx and H.264, and CVS, which is chinese "standard, ... in one chipset, instead of google licensing Hantro directly to different ODM/OEM. Pete Wendell, as they say he is "originator" and director of Sierra Venture. There're some relation between Wendell and Eric Schmidt, from Google. Sierra Venture's invested in Verisilicon, at least since 2007, and would make money from any device using ON2's Hantro chipset. Now, video is every where and imagine how many billion "smart" devices will be able to use ON2's Hantro chipset to streaming or running video live, ..., What is the role of Dai dynesty in all of these: Google license Hantro to Verisilicon; then Verisilicon can/could license Hantro with its chipset to Vivante which produces something called GPU related to video technology. Then Vivante can license its GPU with ON2's Hantro plus Verisilicon HW to Marvell for its CPU chipset; or Verisilicon can/could directly deal with Marvell using Hantro chipset again. Imagine for how many years they can DELAY releasing the end products by involment of a few technical staffs, from these different companies, in the "dar-room" to DESIGN, DEVELOP, Validate, Verify under the name "testing" without the company's, like ON2, shareholders knowing anything about it. And if the company's,like ON2, Interim or CTOs are expecting a little payback from another company like google, building its Video-empire within that company for years, how could shareholders find out that what they've invested are wort it and Short would not be able, at the end, force the company to BK. But what if the Interim threaten the shareholders should they have not voted for Google fraudulent "merger", which ON2 shareholders voted down three times while Short was covering and Google clients were ACCUMULATING for the prices some of them already might have had inside information about it. May be I start with this: Imagine one has a cow and instead of raising and killing it to sell the meat, s/he wants to milk the cow, make yogurt out of milk and butter out of yogurt and sell either one or two or all product in the fresh market. Or One can give his/her calves to farmers and provide them with feeds and ask them to raise the calves to the cows for milking, making yogurt/kefir, and/or butter from the milk. Now, ON2 bought Hantro to HAVE ALL video codecs, including ON2's own video codecs called TrueMotion: VP6, VP7, VP8, or VPx, in general, in one Hardeware or chipset, so every smartphone or devices with video or videostreaming capabilities can implement/integrate/incorporate this chipset in another hardware, device ---------- You can find possible answer to "what's that to do with Vring" here, it's the "handshake" and those involved that might be important. These are more useful for those might be looking to the issue from different angles that google is trying to use to confuse or divert attention to those might sound unrelated but actually are. To understand some of those "handshake" under the table, you can check: Tim Armstrong as Google EXEC Tim Armstrong &amp; United Football League (UFL): this was done when Armstrong was Google exec. Tim Armstrong &amp; AOL: I believe he was moved there as a "safe house" as they did move Marrisa Mayer to Yahoo to safe her from procecution or investigation and possibly later on Google can use it as leverage to distort Yahoo against MS deals?

They were only down today because they feared the results of the Spain Banks Stress Test, which was released after the European markets close. Anyhow, it turns out that Spain’s banks have a capital deficit of 59.3 billion euros ($76.3 billion), less than previously estimated, according to a test designed to lift doubts about the financial industry’s ability to absorb losses. So, based on that news expect the European market to recover next week, as well as ours.
