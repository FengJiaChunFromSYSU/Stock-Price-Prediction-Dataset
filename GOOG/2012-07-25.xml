China is Apple's second-largest market, and its rabid fans have been known to seek out smugglers just to get their hands on the latest gadgets before they officially go on sale in Beijing and Shanghai stores.</Msg><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1343222223130</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 09:17:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343228395000-9</Id><Title>buy VRNG.. huge patent win against goog very soon..</Title><Msg>check VRNG out..</Msg><Username>scalpelxpert45</Username><Timestamp>1343228395000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 10:59:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343228450675-10</Id><Title>buy VRNG.. huge patent win against goog likely..</Title><Msg>check out VRNG</Msg><Username>scalpelxpert45</Username><Timestamp>1343228450675</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 11:00:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343231872308-11</Id><Title>Thoughts?

There's a good chance Microsoft (MSFT), Yahoo (YHOO), and many other tech giants will be facing Vringo lawsuits also. To keep things simple, this article focuses on the Google lawsuit. Based on the outcome of the recent Markman hearing as well as other factors that I will elaborate on below, I believe that Google will either settle pretrial, or Vringo will prevail in court on October 16th, 2012. I began my Vringo journey earlier this year when I received a call from an investment banker who recommended I buy shares in the company. Since this was the same banker who suggested I buy VirnetX (VHC) when it was trading at $2 a share, I took his call seriously. (VirnetX is now trading between $35 to $40 a share.) Before I could finish my due diligence, however, the now famous Tech Crunch article came out and Vringo's stock price tripled. I was frustrated that I couldn't get in at $1, so I kept waiting for the share price to fall back. It never did.</Msg><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1343267345251</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 21:49:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343267725784-18</Id><Topic><Title>Hambrecht: Bornie Here is Why ON2 ACQUIRED Hantro in 2007</Title><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1313412971000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2011-08-15 08:56:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Re: MGM &amp; LionsGate AND YouTube Dominance in 2010 2-Nov-10 10:47 pm Mark Cuban He was aided by Mark Cuban, who sold his 5.4 percent stake in the company to Icahn in June for $7 a share, after Lions Gate told Cuban another buyer was willing to pay more, according to the complaint.

Keep reading, and I will explain why I think Vringo will prevail. First off, I see five possible outcomes as a result of this lawsuit: Number one: Vringo wins in court and receives damages and future royalties. Number two: Google wins, and Vringo shares immediately lose most of their value. Number three: Google buys Vringo before the trial. Number four: Google settles with Vringo before the trial. Number five: Microsoft, Yahoo, or any number of big players buy Vringo.</Msg><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1343268614608</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 22:10:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343268972266-21</Id><Topic><Title>All you need to do is ASSIGNING the right Judge to ON2 case</Title><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1320793691000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2011-11-08 18:08:11 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Winners and losers in the Microsoft-Skype deal WINNER: Facebook kept Skype off Google's hands without having to shell a penny Winners and losers in the Microsoft-Skype deal Many of the big players in technology have either won or lost as a result of the tie-up With the news that Microsoft will acquire Skype for over $8 billion including debt, the question becomes: Who are the winners and losers?
