You would have 120 shares. No diff. Just because you are chicken to buy more or don't have the money its not the company's fault. You guys don't understand the wisdom of a high share price. It creates a lot less volatility. More sophisticated investors don't freak out with a $100 price move.

The big companies with multinational presence can always make the earnings appear "offshore" somewhere and avoid taxes. The US should have a 15% corporate tax , close all the loopholes and they would ultimately bring in a lot more corporate tax even though the rate was substantially lower.

The group, led by U.S. Rep. Joe Barton, seeks answers by June 14. Glass, at this point, has a fairly limited range of abilities such as taking pictures, getting directions and performing a search. Developers can build simple apps using a programming interface called Mirror. However, Google announced on Thursday that it is readying a broader Glass Development Kit giving developers deeper access to the Glass hardware. A Google representative was not immediately available for comment. Update: At a fireside chat with developers, Google Glass product director Steve Lee said that the Glass team takes privacy seriously. “From the beginning, the social implications … of Glass, of people wearing Glass, has been at the top of our mind,” Lee said, adding that the team extended its concern not just to those wearing Glass but those around them. He noted that to take a picture requires pressing a button or issuing a voice command. Also, the Glass screen lights up when the device is active. Lee said that Glass is operating by Google’s existing privacy policy in terms of what data it collects. “We’re not really deviating from that,” Lee said. As for face recognition, Lee said that “we’ve definitely experimented with it but it is not in the product today,” Lee said. “I can imagine that existing.” Letter to Google From Congress re: Glass Privacy</Msg><Username>tracy_vuong</Username><Timestamp>1368924018665</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 20:40:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368926954936-18</Id><Title>Holy #$%$ could be a 50-100 buck drop onmonday and tuesday- massive tax fraud by google</Title><Msg>Drudge and london newspapers reporting the fraud by whistleblowers</Msg><Username>cwtripps</Username><Timestamp>1368926954936</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 21:29:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368927308731-19</Id><Topic><Title>Wow, GOOG a massive tax scheme!</Title><Username>againscammed</Username><Timestamp>1368920932792</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 19:48:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Huge news of fraud Whistleblower says this is beyond the double dutch irish thing but willful fraud and lies Has 100000 emails to prive it Massive 150 buck , which actually isnt much, coming this week</Msg><Username>cwtripps</Username><Timestamp>1368927308731</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 21:35:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368927417211-20</Id><Topic><Title>Wow, GOOG a massive tax scheme!</Title><Username>againscammed</Username><Timestamp>1368920932792</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 19:48:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>20% haircut by Monday close.
