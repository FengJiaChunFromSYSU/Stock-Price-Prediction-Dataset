Like one of the Dexter episodes, "just take it" Listen anywhere Amazon decides to enter and go take market share, they are successful, they step on googles toes and then have a better product and more customers in the cloud, goog has repeatedly dropped prices yet Amazon with a better product has stopped dropping prices for the cloud yet more and more people continue to sign up for Amazons cloud which has gotten larger and better for 6 years straight. Now Amazon apps are up a whopping 500% and market share rumors are that they now have 11-17% of tablet market share after selling a chitload as so many stayed home and bought online and Amazon had the best price on the kindle fire and the parents loved the controls to block bad stuff from kids. Now Amazon is going to list private sellers and auction people listing into 2 categories and take many loyal ebay customers with simpler and better pricing, less hassle listings, and AMZN is going to offer the good sellers loans so they can get bigger and AMZN makes more when they sell more, AMZN is just too smart, its not fair for people not as smart to compete. Watch as ebay stock goes nowhere or down while AMZN runs right by its 52 week high and approaches its target of 314, should be around that by JAN 15-19th and after Jan 31st (record earnings) will gap to 240-350! If your going to stay in Goog at this level at least grab some AMZN calls before it slices right thru its 52 week high. I'm going to help you noobies, the AMZN market maker is sleeping when it comes to the Jan 310 calls, they were 55 by 60 cents just a few weeks ago before the analysts started raising Amazon targets from 314- 322-330 The Jan 310's will be a dollar A PIECE SOON YET THEY SIT AT JUST .27 CENTS LOL, THE ASK WAS 35 CENTS A COUPLE DAYS AGO, I WILL GRAB 200 TOMORROW AFTER MY WIRE GOES THROUGH, i MIGHT SPREAD THEM OUT 310 315 320 325</Msg><Username>classactionlawsuitsonnakedshrts</Username><Timestamp>1354893630173</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 10:20:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354894282967-8</Id><Title>TMMI Announces TRUDEF(TM) .FVF ('Fractal Video File') and .FIF ('Fractal Intra Frame') File Extensions</Title><Msg>WILMINGTON, DELAWARE--(Marketwire - Dec 7, 2012) - TMM, Inc. (TMMI) ("TMMI" or "the Company") is pleased to announce the reconstruction of the TRUDEF™ .FVF (''Fractal Video File'') and the .FIF (''Fractal Intra Frame'') file extensions. These file extensions are modernized versions of the original 1990''s fractal file extensions used in the initial development and the shipped commercial video products. TRUDEF™ ".FVF" now supports video compressed with the TRUDEF™ Fractal compression system and a wide variety of commonly used audio formats. It can be made up of either Fractal Intra Frames (''Key Frames'') or a combination of Key Frames and P-frames (''Predicted picture''). Intra Frames are self-contained video frames which do not share any data with other frames. TRUDEF™ Fractal Intra Frame encoded video is intended to be used in the Production/Post Production, Archiving and Digital Cinema environments that require a high level of image quality. P-Frames are used in broadcasting and streaming environments that require higher compression with lower level of image quality. TMMI''s recently announced completion of Microsoft Media Foundation (''MMF'') TRUDEF™ Fractal Codec library supports direct playback of .FVF fractal video files in MMF compatible media players such as Microsoft''s Windows Media Player. It also displays single .FIF fractal Intra Frames</Msg><Username>jasonwebber272</Username><Timestamp>1354894282967</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 10:31:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354894382256-9</Id><Title>amzn just decides we are going to take 30% of ebays listings then they make it happen easily</Title><Msg>They are going to list auctions and private sellers on amazons site, wow and the pricing plan is smarter and easier for the two types of sellers, under 50 a month and over 50 items a month!

The mm is sleeping the Jan 310 calls that were 55 by 60 cents a few weeks back are now just 27 cents, AMZN target price was raised to 314, record earnings, the largest ever for sales and revs will take place on Jan 31st, I wired money today and will grab 200 of those 310's tomorrow but anybody will make money in the 300 305 310 315 320 325 because the market maker has not moved them up hardly at all in weeks. If you decide to stay in goog at this level at least grab some amzn shares and calls before it goes right through its 52 week high and basically straight to 300, you can safely buy amzn on margin, you can't say the same for goog or aapl, if amzn goes down 3 it makes that up and another 2 by the end of day or next morning. It is by far the most loved stock on wall street with not only the most dip buyers but hedge funds and mutual funds fight over shares daily, they will fight more then ever after we slice that 52 week high with serious momentum traders coming in as we get closer to breaking it. I would sell goog here or at least grab some puts for insurance.</Msg><Username>classactionlawsuitsonnakedshrts</Username><Timestamp>1354894382256</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 10:33:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354897149920-10</Id><Title>680 close</Title><Msg>PIN it boss</Msg><Username>cwtripps</Username><Timestamp>1354897149920</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 11:19:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354898001792-11</Id><Title>Google and Herborium stocks for winners</Title><Msg>HBRM seems to be a stock for winner such as Google $$$$$$$$$ STRONG BUY but for loosers as well DRINK its products such as KAMASUTRA VODKA or other products......
