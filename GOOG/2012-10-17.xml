People enderestimate monetization of utube, people underestimate their phone platform, people also underestimate how they are better at monetizing mobile. They normally miss in the quarter that they release May-July earnings. The fact that they beat in that quarter is forshadowing that the rest of the year should be great. The pull-back that tood the stock from $768 into the $730's is actually a healthy thing heading into earnings (as far as chartists are concerned). Their company market cap is under $250B for a company that is still showing upside for growth and for a company that can sock away several billion dollars per quarter.

The lawyer takes a pass both times. The judge rules against the lawyer’s client. It’s hard to argue on appeal that the judge’s bias requires reversal. Not only did the lawyer lose the appeal in a fight over an Internet domain name, he was hit with a $10,000 sanction for his “suspicious timing.” When a lawyer in Newport News Holdings Corp. v. Virtual City Vision Inc. belatedly saw the light about Magistrate Judge F. Bradford Stillman, the 4th Circuit sniffed suspiciously. Yesterday the appellate panel said the lawyer waited too long to ask the judge to hand off the file to a colleague. NNHC sued VCV in Newport News federal court for copyright infringement. The magistrate judge told VCV’s lawyer that the lawyer for NNHC sat on a panel to consider Stillman’s reappointment. Not a problem, according to VCV. A little later, counsel for NNHC told VCV he and the magistrate judge previously practiced at the same firm and collaborated on cases. VCV did not request recusal. But it saw things differently after Stillman ruled against VCV on NNHC’s claim under the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act. After briefing and a hearing, Stillman denied the motion that he recuse himself from trying the remaining claims. “Elucidation of the relevant facts took time,” VCV said. But 4th Circuit Judge Allyson K. Duncan said, “We are not persuaded…. “The timing of VCV’s motion smacks of gamesmanship,” she said, and denying the recusal motion was “justified on timeliness grounds alone.” The motion was a loser on the merits, as well. The Code of Conduct for federal judges explicitly says recusal is not necessary when a reappointment panel member appears before a magistrate judge. The law firm relationship between Stillman and NNHC’s lawyer ended 10 years earlier and they had little contact during the intervening time.</Msg><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1350490467520</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 12:14:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350490535130-27</Id><Topic><Title>Re: 3 different Judges, 3 different Ccases, 3 different Decisons?</Title><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1347006469046</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 04:27:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>VRNG: Yahoo blocking bringing up the why four judges involved in Vringo vs Google By casp321.20 minutes ago.Permalink .

Me I'm out but curious to watch GOOG trade.</Msg><Username>learnedlesson</Username><Timestamp>1350492691425</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 12:51:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350493619633-39</Id><Title>GOOG Going down, After earning....</Title><Msg>Google Inc.

You are going to want to read this. (((((MARKET ALERT))))) (FB) Facebook &amp; (ZNGA) Zynga, Inc (((((MARKET ALERT))))) MUST READ -----------------URGENT MARKET ALERT------------------------------- (FB) Facebook &amp; (ZNGA) Zynga Pincus collected around $220 Million from The IPO and he still owns over 51% of all ZNGA Shares. Pincus can easily sell the company for $5 per share at this time if he were to choose to....... This is a FACT. Pincus also has the option of keeping Zynga under his control going forward as the company develops as the Business Deals put in place mature and pay out in 2013 as to the disclosed "Relationships" cash in on the Projects in play at this time and those about to launch...............FACT. Pincus is disgusted at the market manipulation that has been done to ZNGA and just may take the $5 on the table and pay out some cash from a class action that would come if in fact ZNGA was sold for $5 per share. However, he could still easily retire extremely wealthy after the payout to those that bought in the $10 to $15 range and not have to deal with the manipulation on the market side of the business anymore........FACT The market makers have manipulated the PPS of ZNGA to the extreme as the company now has a brighter future in the $2's then it did in the $15's with ALL of the updated developments since The IPO........FACT Pincus just may possibly take the $5 on the table and not have to deal with a twisted and unethical PRICE FIXING from "CERTAIN" Market Participants with the ability to do so anymore and no one could blame him under the circumstances that have gone on with the "CODE STEALING" from Former Employees and taking that CODE to Rival Companies that have already admitted to doing so as reported on in this mornings News. Pincus could start at the $5 price and allow counteroffers to come in.............FACT WHAT'S THE VIEW OF OTHER HERE ON WHAT DIRECTION Pincus will take? I would not blame him one bit if he sells out under the crap that this market has dished him. However, there is the other side of the coin with his Relationship with FB and Mark Zuckerberg in particular where if FB ends up with Zynga Pincus could come on board with FB and see the "DEVELOPED PROJECTS" generate significant revenues and come out a winner............FACT THIS ISSUE WILL BE RESOLVED IN HOURS RATHER THEN QUARTERS AS PINCUS HAS HAD ENOUGH OF THE MANIPULATION ACROSS THE BOARD.........THAT IS THE FACTUAL INFORMATION THAT IS UP TO DATE AS FAR AS THE STREET KNOW IT AT THIS TIME ((((( FACT ))))) -----------------URGENT MARKET ALERT------------------------------- ZNGA has $1.5 BILLION CASH &amp; ASSETS and has a Market Cap ABOUT THE SAME...... FACT!!!! ZNGA contributes 14% to Facebook's entire revenue and is projected to contribute 80% or MORE to Facebook's 2013 REVENUES.......FACT ZNGA has the WORLDS LARGEST ONLINE POKER SITE AND IS GOING GLOBAL FOR CASH BETTING with Facebook in 2013 with a Facebook Online Casino &amp; Sports Book in Legal areas around THE GLOBE.......FACT</Msg><Username>robbie_berger</Username><Timestamp>1350494079109</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 13:14:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350495366857-41</Id><Title>Remember Google is worth $778.00 a share!</Title><Msg>So your safe if you buy today.

President Obama was much more negative and the negatives that turns most of us off. 1049 ladies voted online, the results where 802 to vote for Romney and 247 to votes for Obama for president. We feel that Mitt Romney is more like President Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama more like President Jimmy Carter.. We wished Barack Obama was more like Clinton or Reagan, he is neither. The Democrat Ladies Criticism from last 2 debates on go to meeting conference connection late last night. What we liked about Mitt Romney and our Hope to Change going Forward that he becomes the next President of USA. 1. Mitt Romney looked much more Presidential and more of a Gentlemen, then Barack Obama. 2. He had a solid debate performance, connect with us Democrat Ladies much more than Obama. 3. Governor Mitt Romney showed us a 5 part plans where he wants to take us, Obama had zero. 4. Words that fit Governor Romney. he looked and acted very presidential in both debates, knowledgeable - gentlemen - decent - strong - respectable - kind - religious - well spoken - smart - great leadership skills - thoughtful - considerate - well groomed - better looking - comfortable - safe - - passionate - more trustful President Obama Negatives that turns us most of us off. The numbers where 802 vote for Romney and 247 votes for Obama for president. 1. President Obama was often Rude, Loud and Forceable Took Charge Without Any Answers asked. 2. Obama Seemed Angry at Times and played Much More Defensive and Less Offensive. 3. President Obama Had No Where to Go But Speak About His Past and Not Future Specific Plans. 4. Words that Fit President Obama He Was Scary - Lame - Rude - Arrogant - Passive-Aggressive - Repetitive - a Liar - misinformed - lacy - not a very hard worker - Did not Look or Act Very Presidential.</Msg><Username>democrat_ladies</Username><Timestamp>1350505463513</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 16:24:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>50</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350505684121-60</Id><Topic><Title>1049 Democrat Ladies 802 Changed Sides Voting For Romney, 247 for Obama - A Focus Group</Title><Username>democrat_ladies</Username><Timestamp>1350505463513</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 16:24:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I can not say I blame you for switching sides and going to Mitt Romney's side.

"First, they said it was not planned, it was part of this tape," Crowley said when Axelrod tried to spin her. This was Crowley the journalist, unlike the pro-Obama advocate who moderated Tuesday's debate between Obama and Mitt Romney and interjected herself into an argument between Obama and Romney on the exact same issue -- and took Obama's side. During the debate, Crowley affirmed Obama's assertion that he referred to the Benghazi attacks as acts of terror on the day after. After Romney correctly said it took Obama 14 days before Obama said the the Benghazi attacks were acts of terror, Crowley took Obama's side -- to an ovation from the town hall audience -- and she proclaimed Obama had indeed claimed the Benghazi attacks were acts of terror the day after the attacks in the White House Rose Garden. On September 12, the day after the attacks, Obama did say the words "acts of terror" but he was not referring to the attacks that killed U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens. Crowley knew that on September 30 and she conceded it again hours after the debate when she went on CNN and said while Romney "was right in the main, but he just chose the wrong word." But the damage had already been done. With Obama's reelection on the line, Crowley seemed to have conveniently forgotten the facts she knew two weeks before when she grilled Axelrod in a way she should have Obama. Here is how Crowley questioned Axelrod then: CROWLEY: ... There's a back and forth now about why didn't this administration -- why did it take them until Friday after a September 11th attack in Libya to come to the conclusion that it was premeditated and that there was terrorists involved. John McCain said it doesn't pass the smell test, or it's willful ignorance to think that they didn't know before this what was going on. Your reaction? AXELROD: Well, first of all, Candy, as you know, the president called it an act of terror the day after it happened. But when you're the responsible party, when you're the administration, then you have a responsibility to act on what you know and what the intelligence community believes. This was -- this is being thoroughly investigated. ... When Axelrod tried to tell Crowley that the "president called it an act of terror the day after it happened," Crowley rejected the spin and corrected Axelrod, telling him that Obama said the the attacks were not "planned" and was "part of this tape," in reference to the obscure anti-Muhammad Internet video the Obama administration blamed: CROWLEY: First, they said it was not planned, it was part of this tape. All that stuff. AXELROD: As the director of national intelligence said on Friday, that was the original information that that was given to us. What we don't need is a president or an administration that shoots first and asks questions later. Crowley then accused the Obama administration of shooting first (not telling Americans terrorists were behind the Benghazi attacks) and asking questions later, which is what Obama accused Romney of doing when Romney released a statement CROWLEY: But isn't that what happened? AXELROD: And, you know, Governor Romney leaped out on this Libya issue on the first day, and was terribly mistaken about what he said. That is not what you want in a president of the United States. And as for Senator McCain, for whom I have great respect, he has disapproved of our approach to Libya from the beginning, including the strategy that brought Gadhafi to justice. Crowley then called out Axelrod's spin again, saying the administration initially insisted the terrorist attacks were not preplanned: CROWLEY: But this has to do not with the approach to Libya but with the murder of four Americans in Libya. And didn't the administration shoot first? Didn't they come out and say, listen, as far as we can tell, this wasn't preplanned, this was just a part of -- AXELROD: At this point, this is what we know, and we are thoroughly investigating. And that's exactly what you should do. That's what the responsible thing to do is. I was kind of shocked to see Representative King attack Ambassador Rice for what she said last Sunday here and elsewhere, because she was acting on the intelligence that was given to her by the intelligence community. To say she should resign -- she is one of the most remarkable, splendid public servants we have. That's thoroughly irresponsible.</Msg><Username>omni1tsd</Username><Timestamp>1350519295555</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 20:14:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350519698461-101</Id><Title>ON2: UFL, Hambrecht for those who are still interested</Title><Msg>------- ------- related to UFL: from NYTimes: June 3, 2007 June 3, 2007 The Business First and Long — Very Long By JOE NOCERA By October [2006, casp321], the two men [Bill Hambrecht &amp; Tim Armstrong] had committed their $2 million, hired their first three executives (Bill Daugherty, the C.E.O.; Jon Brod, the C.O.O.; and Andrew Goldberg, a senior analyst) and begun an extensive study to see if the idea was really feasible. ---------- from Page 40 of Hantro/ON2 proxy: Opinion of On2’s Board’s Financial Advisor Overview On December 20, 2006, On2’s board of directors engaged WR Hambrecht &amp; Co. (“Hambrecht”) to act as its financial advisor in connection with a proposed transaction with Hantro. ------ Opinion of On2’s Board’s Financial Advisor Overview On December 20, 2006, On2’s board of directors engaged WR Hambrecht &amp; Co. (“Hambrecht”) to act as its financial advisor in connection with a proposed transaction with Hantro. Hambrecht is a recognized investment banking firm that regularly engages in the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions. The board selected Hambrecht on the basis of, among other things: • Hambrecht’s experience and expertise in business combinations between companies with revenues of less than $250 million; and • Hambrecht’s knowledge in the software industry, in which Hantro is an active participant; and • Hambrecht’s experience in valuing privately owned businesses. -----On April 3, 2007 certain representatives of Hambrecht accepted investment banking positions at Oppenheimer &amp; Co.
