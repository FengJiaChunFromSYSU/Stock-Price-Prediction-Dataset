I actually had a spread. Bought 20 $905 calls at the same time. The margin requirement is a whole lot less.

I was calling for a very bearish move in GOOG ahead of its earnings should it have stayed below those resistance levels. However, GOOG now looks refreshed and ready to do one of two things: channel higher amidst low volatility, or explode to the upside. Holding $883-$891 now becomes critically important in confirming the recent bottom and putting a move to new all time highs ahead of earnings on the table. Above $900 and I'm chasing. Until then I'm watching and waiting.</Msg><Username>watchhimtradedotcom</Username><Timestamp>1373251083341</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-07 22:38:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message></Date>
