How can brands stay abreast of new ways to target and advertise without breaking the bank? by Kristina Knight Kristina: What are some recommendations you can provide for publishers in terms of additional options for revenue and managing cost? Lori Chavez, Vice President of Marketing, Local Corporation: Online publishers are constantly seeking ways to manage cost, efficiency and performance of their digital sales and operations. Ideally, they should embrace a strategy focused on both driving top-level revenue and adding new tools to grow ROI. Fusion by Local helps regional media publishers optimize their online properties to drive additional incremental advertising revenue. With millions of searches conducted online every day, publishers should tap into these searches by implementing local business and local shopping directories as additional revenue streams. Kristina: How do solutions like business directories or syndicated multimedia content fit into the mix, for publishers? Lori: Local business and shopping directories help publishers to be found in more local searches by consumers. Local Corp.'s local business directory is integrated under the publisher's domain. Implementing the solution is virtually seamless as the directory requires no investment and can be deployed in less than a week. Kristina: What's ahead this year for Local Corporation? Lori: We saw record mobile, organic and total search traffic for the first quarter 2013. For the rest of the year, we will be focused on growing revenue and driving our overall performance. We're looking forward to continued success following the launch of Fusion by Local and look forward to helping our advertising partners and publishers better engage with local consumers.</Msg><Username>flankenking</Username><Timestamp>1367395392584</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 04:03:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367399442008-7</Id><Title>Apple vs. Google - APRIL 2010-2013</Title><Msg>looks like apple bounced off Google support yesterday and GOOG is overdue for a pop on this chart http://www.google.com/finance?chdnp=0&amp;chdd=1&amp;chds=1&amp;chdv=1&amp;chvs=Linear&amp;chdeh=1&amp;chfdeh=0&amp;chdet=1367398095613&amp;chddm=291758&amp;chls=IntervalBasedLine&amp;cmpto=NASDAQ:AAPL&amp;cmptdms=0&amp;q=NASDAQ:GOOG&amp;ntsp=0&amp;ei=bdaAUbiOA4TtrAG9Zw</Msg><Username>goodeyecharting</Username><Timestamp>1367399442008</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 05:10:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367406096683-8</Id><Topic><Title>lololol House Democrats claim global warming will drive women to prostitution</Title><Username>demsarewhack</Username><Timestamp>1367372940267</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 21:49:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What does age have to do with posting Democrats claim global warming will drive women to prostitution?

The company, in collaboration with Geeksphone, sold $119 Keon models and $194 high-end versions called Peak for developers to test in real-world situations and on mobile networks. Unlike the other mobile tech companies, Mozilla's OS is built on HTML5. Because its apps will run off the new web standard, the Mozilla OS phones require less internal storage than traditional smartphones. This difference is expected to keep the cost of phones much lower than even low-end phones running Android. OEMs could benefit from the OS because it will help them keep costs down and still sell products with similar capabilities of more expensive phones. For carriers, of which Mozilla already has 17 signed up, the benefit lies in being able to sell comparable phones for less money. Additionally, since the apps are built on HTML 5, developers can create apps that work across multiple devices and have less restrictions than app stores. Samsung launching a full-scale mobile approach with its own mobile OS, Tizen. The company will sell a few Tizen phones in small markets later this year, but the company's still extremely dependent on Google. If Samsung does move away from Android, it could also team up with Mozilla and use the company's OS instead of its own version. Mozilla and Samsung are already working on a new mobile browser in an effort to cut out Google's Android and Chrome browsers. A mobile OS agreement between the two could be mutually beneficial for both companies. Samsung could move away from Android, while Mozilla would gain significant OS share because of Samsung's current reach."</Msg><Username>europe_and_usa</Username><Timestamp>1367426088065</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 12:34:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367426448920-33</Id><Title>My take on Google Glass</Title><Msg>Native American tribes had it right when they threatened to kill photographers who tried to take their photos without permission, as they thought it would steal their souls.

CCUR's enterprise value is below $40mm and the company has been around since 1967! CCUR pays a huge cash dividend and is rapidly ramping up EPS and growing revenues at an extremely fast pace! CCUR signed Time Warner Cable (TWC) to a major multi-screen CDN deal last quarter and also announced the signing of the same type of deal with Virgin Media (VMED). TWC is the #2 cable TV operator in the US, while VMED is the #1 cable TV operator in the UK! CCUR's market leading technology is allows leading cable TV operators worldwide to substantially grow their video on demand (VOD) title capacity by deploying a centralized CDN that uses CCUR's MediaHawk multi-screen VOD software! CCUR also allows its clients to begin delivery of VOD and live TV to any IP connected mobile device at any location! CCUR reported stunning earnings last night that almost nobody has seen yet! CCUR's 3Q revenues of $16.9 million were their highest in 2 years and beat estimates of $16.3 million. CCUR's 3Q GAAP EPS of $0.11 beat EPS estimates of $0.09 by 22.2%. CCUR rapidly grew GAAP EPS in its most recent quarters from $0.02 to $0.04 to $0.08 and now $0.11 in its most recent quarter! Excluding amortization and share-based compensation, CCUR's latest trailing 12 month non-GAAP EPS is now $0.43, up from $0.35 at the end of 2Q 2013. CCUR's trailing non-GAAP EPS is expected to reach $0.50 for the full fiscal year of 2013 ending June 30th of this year! CCUR's closest multi-screen VOD/live TV delivery software rivals are SEAC and HLIT, which currently have P/Es of 25 that would value CCUR today at $10.75 based on its latest non-GAAP EPS of $0.43 and $12.50 based on its estimated year-end 2013 non-GAAP EPS of $0.50! CCUR's EPS is rising while SEAC and HLIT continue to report declining EPS. This means CCUR most likely deserves a P/E of 30, which will value CCUR at $15 based on full year non-GAAP EPS of $0.50!

Here it does not even display Google's own finance page correctly. The charts are incomplete. The companies that compare to others do not display all of the rows in their description. Not to worry, there is a ad for "XYZ" that did not get cut off. Really sad for their developers.</Msg><Username>rockerme4u</Username><Timestamp>1367460186377</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 22:03:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
