She lowered her altitude and spotted a man in a boat below. She shouted to him, "Excuse me, can you help me? I promised a friend I would meet him an hour ago, but I don't know where I am." The man consulted his portable GPS and replied, "You're in a hot air balloon, approximately 30 feet above ground elevation of 2,346 feet above sea level. You are at 31 degrees, 14.97 minutes north latitude and 100 degrees, 49.09 minutes west longitude. She rolled her eyes and said, "You must be a Republican. "I am," replied the man. "How did you know?" "Well," answered the balloonist, "everything you told me is technically correct. But I have no idea what to do with your information, and I'm still lost. Frankly, you've not been much help to me." The man smiled and responded, "You must be an Obama-Democrat." "I am," replied the balloonist. "How did you know?" "Well," said the man, "you don't know where you are -- or where you are going. You've risen to where you are, due to a large quantity of hot air. You made a promise you have no idea how to keep, and you expect me to solve your problem. You're in exactly the same position you were in before we met, but somehow, now it's my fault."</Msg><Username>rldcis</Username><Timestamp>1346750884895</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 05:28:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346752034234-3</Id><Title>Romney is Mormon and Obama is Christian,,,, you choose - a Christian that KILLS BABIES!!</Title><Msg>Only fools will be mocked as today with Obamadungdufus out accllaiming his Christianity being an avowed abortionist including the most horrific partial birth abortion where the so called doc sticks a tube in the unborn childs brain at the stem of the spinal cord then sucks out the brains!

Yahoo. My back of the envelope math (I don't work very hard and I have a lot of envelopes lying around) shows that the stock Google gave Yahoo would be worth $1.8 billion now. So that's the playbook. I think Google should give Vringo $1.8 billion in stock combined with a guarantee from Vringo that they can't sue any more of Google's customers. I would be terrified of someone suing all of my customers. It seems like that's a great way to lose a lot of customers. ----------- Yahoo Licenses Technology to Google Patent license dispute between search giants is settled by licensing arrangement. By Stephen Lawson, IDG News Aug 10, 2004 3:00 am Internet search giants Google and Yahoo have put their patent disputes behind them. Google will license technology patented by Yahoo subsidiary Overture Services, according to one of two newly announced dispute settlements. The other settlement covers an outstanding dispute over a stock warrant connected to a services agreement back in 2000. Google issued about 1.2 million shares to Yahoo in June 2003, but per a Google filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday, Yahoo had said it was entitled to more shares Also part of the settlement of the warrant dispute and patent suit and in payment for the license, Google issued 2.7 million shares of its Class A stock to Yahoo. Analysts say the settlement is good news for Google, which should be looking to resolve any lingering legal issues before its proposed initial public offering (IPO). The settlement also bodes well for Yahoo, as it could strengthen the company's hand if it pursues patent infringement claims against other companies, says Nate Elliott, an analyst at Jupiter Research in New York.</Msg><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1346764259405</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 09:10:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346764586621-11</Id><Title>Citron Research</Title><Msg>Who are those guys ??</Msg><Username>jgiled</Username><Timestamp>1346764586621</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 09:16:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346764889118-12</Id><Title>(Reuters) Investors are Buying up Shares on a Potential Share Buyback</Title><Msg>Liberty Media currently holds 3,156,130,633 shares of SiriusXM ( SIRI ).

Why would MS pay $8.5 BILLION for Skype with VP8, even though they say they are not using VP8 in their IE?? After Google STEALING ON2+Hantro from its shareholders, all those bigger THIEVES are FIGHTING it to get their "fair" share from he "head" master, Google. ...Why they are trying to divide STOLEN gods among the THIEVEs in silence?

Atherton police are waiting for results of an autopsy before investigating what appears to be an accidental death, a police spokesman said Tuesday.

Just as dems NEVER acknowledge the glaring FACTS surrounding 100 years of failed dem party primary control handing us EVERY failed system and entitlement of today.

So far the Charlotte Show is living up to it's expectations with endless talk of FREEBIES for all with one Black Congressional candidate woman bemoaning single mom's need daycare services provided of course by Uncle Sammy (i.e. us the taxpayers.) These folks are truly this DUMB as the National Debt (just as repubs said would happen) went over $16 TRILLIONS today. Great timing because just minimal study of the past 100 years clearly reveals dems signed all these entitlement programs into law and just seem to believe they can print money to infinity. Wow I thought only a small percentage of the populace was so severely mentallly challenged but watching the Charlotte Show it seems to be epidemic to the dem party.

It's been reported that the hall the Charlotte Show is being held at is not as big as the Tampa venue where the repub convention was held and that the dems have the sound system ramped up to the highest volume such that many have complained. With that said though they sure are a peculiar odd lot of people. At any rate we shall see who gets the biggest bounce and I think it will be repubs. Obamadungdufus absolutely cannot run on his record and that will be hammered home daily from this point on. Now they havesome truly wierd looking dude talkin Julian Castro. Wow what a weird looking group of humans. I guess FREE RUBBERS FOR ALL is the FLUCKING Message they want to drive home. As the Roberts ruling continues to be analyzed I believe his words say it all: 1. It is a tax just as we all surmised from the beginning and 2; most importantly the court cannot protect the citizens from the consequences of an election. So you see, just as I and many said, Obama has indeed changed the country forever in a very bad way. We indeed will now have the UK failed system of socialized medicine, to replace our very outstanding previously profit driven capitalistic form of medicine that being the very factor that made it so great. What this is truly about is 100 years of primary democrat party failed control for which their chickens indeed have come home to roost and they spent all our money (SS/Medicare, income taxes etc..) on welfare to lock in democrat votes moving forward. 1913 dem Wilson Federal Reserve Bank CREATURE that has debt leveraged our currency to zero intrinsic value, 1933 dem FDR failed SS Ponzi that was only to cost $.03 per pay, 1964 dem LBJ failed Medicare Ponzi now completely broke necessitating socialized medicine with the death panels to preclude costly care for the boomers now retiring in mass and being told all the money taken from them was squandered on welfare, and now Obama under dem Pelosi Congress more debt increase than all prior Presidents combined in less than 3.6 years. Yes Justice Roberts is correct that the court cannot be responsible for the consequences of an election, indeed Obama Care is a huge cost and most importantly this decision will cost many more jobs and the USA as once known is now finished. Hopefully Romney can stand on the 10th Amendment which is correct asserting that healthcare in MA was a states issue and this Federal mandate is not but repealing it now will be tough and impossible without Repubs taking House, Senate and POTUS. Without Harry Reid gone nothing will ever be accomplished.</Msg><Username>obamadungdufus</Username><Timestamp>1346811120544</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 22:12:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346812373214-61</Id><Topic><Title>ON2: Is it a "goldmine" or is it a "landmine"???</Title><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1276979012000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2010-06-19 16:23:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Re: ON2: Is it a "goldmine" or is it a "landmine"???

But he may have been best known for mentoring numerous Stanford graduate students, including Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin.</Msg><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1346813080182</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 22:44:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346813496468-65</Id><Topic><Title>2009: Stanford professor mentored Google founders apparently drowned in his pool</Title><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1346793412063</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 17:16:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>---In 1 99 9, Kleiner [...] and Sequoia [...] paid $25 million for 20% of Google Rajeev Motwani From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia He [Rajeev Motwani] was an early advisor and supporter of companies including Google and PayPal, and a special advisor to Sequoia Capital.

Agree 100% !!!! I am now listening to Michelle Obama say all the wonders of EXPANDING GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS..... but, she failed to mention the $16 TRILLION DEBT PROBLEM. She did, however, mention her college tuition debt problem. Michelle Obama is a Radical $ocialist -- who is a firm believer in REDISTRIBUTION (taking from the Earners and punishing success.....and redistributing to others). PUNISHING SUCCESS with HIGH TAXES to REDISTRIBUTE ------------ goes totally AGAINST the Founding Fathers of the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Owebama = Entitlement Society - Dependent on Government handouts; Success and hard work is PUNISHED with high taxes; Government limits YOUR FREEDOM with intrusive regulations throughout society, disjointing the financial markets, etc. etc. Romney = Capitalism - Self-reliance and incentives for "Capital-Creation" such as a low tax burden, few government regulations, USA Energy Independence (using OUR resources, not importing/sending OUR money overseas), etc. The choice is clear. If you hate America and want to see America changed into a European-style Socialist Society, then vote Owebama. If you appreciate the fact that FREEDOM unleashed in America has changed the world for the better through innovation, investment and job creation, then vote Romney. Ronald Reagan gave America hope again after the miserable Carter years. I truly believe that Romney's business experience may SAVE AMERICA from the miserable, stalled-growth economic recovery we are now experiencing. If you use your brain in the voting booth in November, then the choice is clear. American did not become an economic superpower on the back of a big, bloated debt-spending Federal Government. America became great because of Entrepreneurs like Steve Jobs &amp; Woz forming a business in a garage....taking a risk to do something great!
