Arrangements were apparently made to pay Iran $40 million to delay the release of hostages in order to thwart President Jimmy Carter's re-election bid. The $40 million was the beginning of terms that created the Iran-Contra scandal that is now being reopened by Congress." According to the account furnished by Richard Brenneke, there was a meeting at the Hotel Raphael in Paris at about noon on October 19, attended by George Bush, William Casey, Don Gregg, Manucher Gorbanifar and two unnamed Iranian officials..... According to Bani-Sadr, his reports show that the meetings took polace, and were attended by Reagan-Bush representatives, Iranians loyal to Behesthi and Rafsanjani, and arms merchants like Cyrus Hashemi, Manucher Ghorbanifar, and Albert Hakim.</Msg><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1348400082833</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-23 07:34:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348400606140-4</Id><Topic><Title>ON2: And COMPROMISING Iranian Yahoo &amp; Google Account</Title><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1331259440000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-03-08 21:17:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What Google is doing outside of Iran to help Democrat win USA presidency in the USA, NOW is on going POWER-STRUGGLE in Iran to MAKE SURE they also help those with Google to make Democrat win USA presidency in the USA: Re: ON2: And COMPROMISING Iranian Yahoo &amp; Google Account By casp321.6 months ago.PermalinkGo to topic .

Apr 17, 2009, Blizzard Vivend &amp; NetEase Partner for China WoW Apr 10, 2009, YouTube and Vivendi's Universal to launch premium music site March 6, 2009, Google’s intentions for a future relationship with On2 -----after extensive testing of On2’s products,... ---------------- Google to end music service in China 09/21/2012 this is how Dr Boon-Lock Yeo, Senior Engineering Director at Google China broke the news on the Google China blog, with no comment available elsewhere (Our translation as follows. The first English language coverage of this): We are committed to building excellent products that help to improve people’s lives. In this process, focus and priorities are the keys to success – which means that you should not only carefully plan for entering new territories, but also carefully consider when to stop – both are equally important. That is why in the past year we have decided to close some services, and integrated some others, making them features of existing products. As a continuation of this process, we decided to close the music search service in China, turning our focus towards more influential products. In March 2009, we launched Google music search service in China, in cooperation with Top100 (Top100.cn), to provide Chinese users with free and legal high quality music. However, this product never became as influential as we expected, so we decided to redirect the resources to other products. Users can login and download their playlists before October 19, 2012. All staff will be relocated to other product teams. $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ Google and Music Labels Bet on Downloads in China By DAVID BARBOZA Published: April 5, 2009 They certainly hope so. Last Monday, the world’s biggest record labels, including EMI, the Warner Music Group and Vivendi’s Universal Music, said they would seek to profit here by working with Google and offering free downloads of music to anyone inside China. The partnership, analysts say, could help determine the future of how valuable content is distributed in China, which has already overtaken the United States as the world’s biggest Internet market. $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$</Msg><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1348425189779</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-23 14:33:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348428033395-8</Id><Topic><Title>GOOG, Biggest Price Decliner!
