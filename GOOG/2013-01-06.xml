Companies need to be first to market and have patents protecting their products to ensure sales and profit longevity. "Before a company can book a single penny in profit it needs a product to sell. Yet in today’s fiercely competitive global economy, before a company can produce something to sell, it needs to patent the idea. Otherwise, it’s too easy for competitors to knock off the product and steal market share. In other words, being first to market is no longer enough of a competitive advantage. Companies need to be first to market and have patents protecting their products to ensure sales and profit longevity. Groupon (Nasdaq: GRPN) and Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) serve as good examples of this new paradigm at work. As you’re well aware, Groupon invented the daily deals market in 2008. All it took was a novel idea to connect consumers and businesses in a new way – via coupons over email. But guess what? Groupon didn’t have even one patent protecting its novel business model. And within four years, over 300 competitors emerged. Now, Groupon doesn’t stand a chance to keep booking higher profits, let alone survive. Contrast Groupon’s experience with the details behind the meteoric rise of Apple and you’ll definitely get the connection between patent filings and stock price performance. We can all agree that Apple took the world by storm with its iPhone launch in June 2007. Before it sold a single one, though, it secured as many patents as possible. And it continued to do the same thing on every next generation device."

An important pay-per-call patent and a strategy to launch a series of popular industry-specific websites will drive high-value ad revenues, boosting Local's already healthy revenue growth rate of 40% per year. December 6, 2012 Irvine-based Local Corporation has launched a new, local lead generation site today, called Insurancelow.net, which it says is the first in a series of lead generation websites being launched by the company. The new site offers a car insurance guide and details on choosing car insurance carriers. Local Corporation said it expects the lead generation sites to offer educational articles and opportunity to receive quotes from industry professionals. The firm said it believes the launch of the lead gen sites would help it monetize the 30M consumers it reaches each month. Dec. 12, 2012 Local Corporation Granted U.S. Web Domain Name Patent - This is the eleventh patent issued to the company and was part of the original OCTANE360 platform and asset acquisition in July 2010. Covers Bulk Acquisition and Development of Domain Names IRVINE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 12, 2012-- Local Corporation (NASDAQ:LOCM), a leading online local media company, today announced that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has granted the company patent number 8,312,125, which covers a method and system for the bulk acquisition and development of multiple web domain names. Issued on Nov. 13, 2012, the patent describes a system and method for enabling the bulk acquisition and management of multiple web domains. The patent covers the technology related to the fulfillment of web domains. Local Corp. is currently using this technology for its small and medium-sized business (SMBs) customer as well as for the development of its recently announced vertically oriented lead generation sites. The method includes collecting a set of domain names for bulk content development, some of which are derived from user-provided keywords; filtering the set of domain names based on matching the domains to most-often used search terms by consumers; automatically submitting domain names for purchase; applying a template to the web domain related pages; and inserting content in those pages. “The domain name industry continues to grow, with the number of domain names registered worldwide expected to top 305 million by 20181,” said Heath Clarke, Local Corporation chairman and chief executive officer. “This method is already being used as part of our Launch by Local SMB fulfillment platform and forms the basis for our site expansion into lead generation verticals. We’ve spent years developing our intellectual property portfolio, and we’re pleased that this key patent has issued.”</Msg><Username>flankenking</Username><Timestamp>1357481305029</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-06 09:08:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357481615613-2</Id><Topic><Title>GOOG WILL TOUCH NEW HIGH NEXT WEEK</Title><Username>willoftexas</Username><Timestamp>1357337693901</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 17:14:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>GOOG will hit around $750 this week!</Msg><Username>mzzlite</Username><Timestamp>1357481615613</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-06 09:13:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357491532933-3</Id><Topic><Title>Every and each trader it is an apt time to tow up your GOOG profits</Title><Username>valenzuelafannie84</Username><Timestamp>1354198527691</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 09:15:27 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Important information</Msg><Username>davidwilliam186</Username><Timestamp>1357491532933</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-06 11:58:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357494686884-4</Id><Title>ANDROID being stripped out of smartphones worldwide...strong SELL before earnings</Title><Msg>Stock quotes in this article: AAPL, GOOG, BIDU, AMZN, ORCL, SNE As the new year dawns, everyone seems to be talking about the risks facing Apple (AAPL). But why is no one discussing the risks facing Android, the platform that is Apple's biggest competitor? Google (GOOG) is constantly trumpeting how its Android operating system is taking the world by storm. To a point, the company is correct, as the system has a huge lead in the market for mobile devices. Most journalists accept this advantage in market share as irrefutable and don't seem to question Android's continued dominance. Scratch beneath the surface, however, and you will see there are many problems facing the platform. ● Android is doing well in China from a market-share perspective. But can you really call the product there "Android?" Chinese manufacturers have stripped out all the Google functionality from the operating system. Search is done by Baidu (BIDU), for the most part. Mapping data come from local providers. No geolocation data or other search information is shared with Google. Further, Google is not making any money from the product. So what has Google gained from this particular market-share dominance? ● Amazon (AMZN) is using a stripped-down version of Android for its Kindle. But, like the Chinese handset makers, it has managed to completely remove any ties to Google. Again, this is great for Android's market share and activation numbers, but where's the beef? ● Google isn't making any money from Android -- at least not yet. In the Oracle (ORCL) trial last year, Google disclosed that it had generated $500 million in revenue from Android since inception. That's nothing. Google has given away a lot of software to people to allow those partners to make money, yet only a precious few have been able to do so. There's a big difference between Samsung and 78 dwarves, as Roger McNamee calls them. ● The big dog in the Android community is Samsung, which just announced a bunch of new handsets for 2013 based on the Linux-based Tizen mobile operating system. Is Samsung hedging its bets against Android? Obviously, yes. For a long time now, Samsung has emphasized its own set of features over those of the so-called Android community. ● Google has decided to come out with its own "X Phone" this year. This will be the first Motorola phone built soup-to-nuts by Google people, thus fulfilling the desire of co-CEO Larry Page to get in to the hardware and software business. But why won't the company antagonize others in the Android handset community and push them away? ● I was surprised to learn that the No. 3 and No. 4 players globally in the smartphone space are, respectively, Sony (SNE) and Taiwan-based HTC. Both are Android partners. But why should they stick with it through this year? They're both losing money, and now Google is coming after their market share. Yes, there are challenges facing all handset makers -- but we not to be blind to the issues facing the Android folks.</Msg><Username>cwtripps</Username><Timestamp>1357494686884</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-06 12:51:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357500761549-5</Id><Topic><Title>ANDROID being stripped out of smartphones worldwide...strong SELL before earnings</Title><Username>cwtripps</Username><Timestamp>1357494686884</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-06 12:51:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Where do you get your information?????

This quarter things are only getting worse because mobile has gained on the desktop for another quarter and smartphone screens are still to small to display goog's sponsored ads profitably. Plus, the financial boondoggles known as android and Motorola continue to be the endless money pits they've been from inception. You can even say that the more android succeeds, the more it kills goog's cash cow sponsored ads on traditional desktop PCs. Goog's spent around $30 billion on developing Android so far and all it's gotten for it is a rival called Samsung that now threatens to fork Android like Amazon did. Google's given Samsung everything including its $220 billion market cap soon to exceed goog's own $230 billion market cap--and Samsung's given goog nothing in return except the middle finger. Goog makes far more from even iOS than it does from Android and Samsung. And you call Larry Page a genius?
