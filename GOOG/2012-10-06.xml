HUH??? Is 7.8% something Usama Obama wants us to write home about? That still STKINKS! Romney a real capitalist 2012!!! Lame Stream MSM co-arm of dem party never accentuates the FACTS just post the fictitious numbers which now Jack Welch, Mario Cuomo and many others find quite deceptive. But hurry now and get you one of those good Obama 'seasoned' jobs so readily available these days. Just think of the future you can build on that $7.25 to $9.5 per hour (and that's just to start out.) If you can train yourself to wrap pretty presents and become a pro you may go to $13 per hour in the next 10 years (and have OBAMACARE that MASSIVE TAX still coming out of your checks for all those FREEBEES!! ) (Reuters) - Toys R Us Inc said it will hire 45,000 seasonal employees across the United States to cope with the upcoming holiday season. Toys R Us, which hired about 40,000 seasonal workers last year, said it retained about 15 percent of the holiday workforce after the season ended. The retailer said the hiring at its stores will begin this week and would continue through December. Positions offered include managerial roles and sales associates.

This alone will cost many more jobs yet the class warfare continues to work with ole Robin Hood Obama and Robin Hood Joe Biden out there to get those evil rich guys. It's hard to believe the USA is now this dumbed down as any grade school student once knew business operates for one reason only PROFIT. As Romney correctly corrected Obama in the debate when Obama tried to hang on Romney a $3 billion tax credit to oil companies that has been in effect for 100 years with Romney pointing out the FACT that Obama GAVE $90 billion of our hard earned tax dollars to 3 'green companies including Soyndra' that are already now BANKRUPT. SEE THE HYPOCRISY OF OBAMA THE REGIME AND THE CO-ARM DEM PARTY LAME STREAM MEDIA???? If Obama and Biden continue the class warfare more businesses will simply leave our shores (the big ones) and the small ones will simply take their profits and shut the door waiting for a more favorable business climate. Already many doctors are leaving as Obamacare basically kills their business. On the other hand Obama and all the dumbed down lawyers in this now dumbed down USA are allowed to continue their absolute pilferage while very decent medical doctors/scientists are forced out by the government (Robin Hood) controlling their pricing. I say control the pricing of the thieving lawyers and allow our great medical profession to continue as is.</Msg><Username>omni1tsd</Username><Timestamp>1349529792362</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 09:23:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349536518513-3</Id><Title>MIMV: Mobile apps search engine about to get bought out by MSFT.....10 bagger on tap...Link to SeekingAlpha</Title><Msg>http://seekingalpha.com/article/906481-microsoft-partners-in-search-and-the-mobile-strategy-for-growth</Msg><Username>cashflow599</Username><Timestamp>1349536518513</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 11:15:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349543590430-4</Id><Topic><Title>_ GOOGLE SPLIT TO BE ANNOUNCED ON EARNINGS RELEASE DATE _</Title><Username>yexemew</Username><Timestamp>1349487215831</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 21:33:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think that's why goog has been running wild for weeks now.

MANY mutual fund managers and individual investors have been buying GOOG in the last 3 months. And MANY are STILL buying which is maintaining GOOG's upward price movement. 2. GOOG has gained a WHOPPING 35% in the last 3 months. Potential investors see this and want to "get onboard" the bandwagon as well. People want to "go with WINNERS". 3. Do a chart comparison of GOOG to other top large cap stocks. GOOG has SOUNDLY outperformed most/all of them! On approximately Sept. 17, AAPL &amp; AMZN began leveling off and heading downward, but GOOG kept heading UPWARD. 4. The DJIA will most likely have a strong and steady upward movement--like Q4 of 2011 and into 2013. Why? (1) It's a presidential election year and (2) the economic and job reports this past week were good (e.g. 7.8% unemployment) and indicates that the U. S. economy continues to improve. 5. People put their money on the best performing stock. This is the reason for GOOG's stellar 3-month's performance. 6. Continuing HUGE revenues from GOOG's businesses including (1) Google search engine: Google is by far the No. 1 internet search engine. Every time someone clicks on a business in Google, Google makes money. (2) YouTube advertising income. (3) Google smartphone revenues. 7. GOOG will be splitting their stock 2-for-1 very SOON. Each investor will then have TWICE as many GOOG shares. This is VERY attractive to investors.</Msg><Username>stk_analyzt</Username><Timestamp>1349558610182</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 17:23:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>11</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349575593525-9</Id><Title>VRNG SUING GOOG FOR 1 BILLION DOLLARS SETTLEMENT EXPECTED TUESDAY</Title><Msg>IN YOUR FACE EAT THAT LMFAO</Msg><Username>pkraus12</Username><Timestamp>1349575593525</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 22:06:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349575694916-10</Id><Topic><Title>* ~ PREDICTION: GOOG STOCK WILL REACH $1,000 BY DEC. 31 ~ *</Title><Username>stk_analyzt</Username><Timestamp>1349558610182</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 17:23:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>u dont know jack soon this stofck will tank by by little piggie OINK OINK</Msg><Username>pkraus12</Username><Timestamp>1349575694916</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 22:08:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349575792944-11</Id><Topic><Title>UNEMPLOYMENT DOWN, STOCK MARKET UP, AUTO INDUSTRY STRONG!SOUNDS GOOD TO ME!

The stock has been hitting record highs. In morning trading on October 1, Bloomberg reported that Google’s market cap had passed that of tech giant and rival Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). This success builds in part on some failures by its competitors. Microsoft has been largely unsuccessful at entering the mobile market. The company’s Windows Phone 8 platform is trying to find a home in Nokia’s (NYSE:NOK) new flagship phone the Lumia 920, but many investors are unsure that the combination will prosper. Meanwhile Google’s Android platform has been met with resounding success in the marketplace, with 52.2 percent of the platform market as of July 2012. The company’s acquisition of Motorola puts Google front and center in mobile, while Microsoft is still trying to get into the game. Google competes with many of Microsoft’s business solutions, as small companies turn to free web services like Google Drive instead of the Office Suite. Martin Pyykkonen, an analyst at Wedge Partners, told Bloomberg, “The PC hardware business is obviously struggling. The transition here is pretty straightforward in terms of where things have moved to and certainly that’s cloud, that’s Web.” Google may also be benefiting from Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) recent iOS 6 and maps fiasco. Apple remains the most valuable company in the world, but the proven quality of Google’s technology is attracting investor confidence and driving shares higher. A leader in web services, the company is entering the cloud to take on leaders like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). With Europe announcing a massive cloud initiative and the IDC expecting the market to reach $16.9 billion in 2015, Google stands to grow enormously. Though the company’s heart is in search and advertising, its ability to competently outperform in new and related markets is the core of its success. Google demonstrated this recently when eMarketer reported that the company will beat out Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and climb to the top slot in display ad revenue in 2012. However, a Facebook that figures out monetization and search could seriously compete with Google. The end of Microsoft is nowhere in sight, but with many proclaiming the “death of the PC,” companies with innovative, decentralized services like Google could define the future of software giants.</Msg><Username>stk_analyzt</Username><Timestamp>1349578522794</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 22:55:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349580098486-17</Id><Title>Like any of you boiler room joo spammers have any money in this stock.
