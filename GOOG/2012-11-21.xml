George Miller of Martinez are just a few of the insiders who make up House Speaker-to-be Pelosi's circle of advisers and confidants. Not surprisingly, the list includes many of the Bay Area's best-known power brokers, from former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown to California Sen. Barbara Boxer to Rep. Anna Eshoo of Palo Alto, who is one of Pelosi's closest friends in Congress. "We've known each other for 30 years," said Eshoo, who met Pelosi at a party fundraiser at the Atherton home of Madeleine Haas Russell. "It was long before either of us were elected to Congress. ... We were mothers; we were both involved in the community and in the Democratic Party. We had many commonalities." Pelosi's circle is filled with Silicon Valley heavyweights. She has long-standing ties to investment banker Sandy Robertson and venture capitalists Tom Perkins and John Doerr. More recently, she befriended Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, ???????????????

Google should not be accused of "unfair" acts: lawmakers Reuters – Mon, Nov 19, 2012 WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two lawmakers urged the Federal Trade Commission on Monday to steer clear of expanding its authority as it investigates allegations search engine company Google violated antitrust law. The two California Democrats in the House of Representatives, who count Google as a major campaign contributor, asked the FTC not to accuse the company of "unfair" acts if it believes it broke antitrust law.
