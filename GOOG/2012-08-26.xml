The basically purchased a technology for $5,000 and claimed that it would be groundbreaking. They said they have a contract with PEMEX. But yet in the video I made it shows another link to a recording of the head of IR of PEMEX saying they have no contract. So basically this company is a lie. I hope you can help us tell Google about this scam and make it stop. In the video I show how. To find the video type in on YouTube "How to Stop the scam CHMR" Please note that we own shares in GOOG too and love the company and we are not against Google. We just want to make sure they are aware of this scam as we know they would stop it.</Msg><Username>A Yahoo!
