By Emily Knapp | More Articles August 01, 2012 Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) will pay a civil penalty of $22.5 million to settle charges that it bypassed the privacy settings of customers using Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) Safari browser. Google will not have to admit any liability, according to an anonymous source, as per the terms of the Federal Trade Commission’s decision. Google was accused of using computer code known as “cookies” to trick Safari, allowing Google to monitor users who had blocked such tracking. Google has said the tracking was inadvertent, and that it collected to personal information like names, addresses, or credit card data, but the tracking was done despite assurances that Safari could be set to protect users’ privacy. Google is also the subject an a wide-ranging antitrust investigation being conducted by the FTC and European regulators over allegations that it manipulated its search results to favor its own products.</Msg><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1343829920558</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-01 10:05:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343834183950-5</Id><Topic><Title>GOOG/AAPL correlation</Title><Username>tomsongarry</Username><Timestamp>1343280708626</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 01:31:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>But those MMI/GOOG employees love Chikfila, where they gonna get their chik fix?</Msg><Username>robynrokn</Username><Timestamp>1343834183950</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-01 11:16:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343838430745-6</Id><Topic><Title>MSFT to Buy VRNG Patents and Ruin Google?</Title><Username>vrnger</Username><Timestamp>1343592802826</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-29 16:13:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Vringo in NY today to ring the closing bell on NYSE.

You need to check those involved to see when/how they were/are getting rid of their VRNG shares after announcement of "reverse-merger"? Is it a SHAM or real lawsuit? Source: Converted Organics Inc. Date: March 15, 2012 Innovate/Protect announced yesterday that it has entered into a merger agreement with Vringo, Inc. (NYSE Amex:VRNG), a provider of software platforms for mobile social and video applications. If the merger is consummated, subject to the terms of the merger agreement, the shares of Innovate/Protect owned by Converted Organics Inc. will be converted into 452,640 shares of common stock of Vringo, as well as approximately 181,000 warrants to purchase shares of Vringo common stock at an exercise price of $1.76 per share (subject to adjustment). ------------- 9/15/2011 @ 3:06PM |1,413 views Google, AOL, Others Sued For Infringing Old Lycos Patents And the great patent wars roll on. This morning, a brand new patent troll “intellectual property firm” called Innovate/Protect Inc. filed a patent infringement suit against AOL, Google, IAC/Interactive, Gannett and Target. The case, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, and filed by an Innovate/Protect unit called I/P Engine Inc., alleges the defendants violated features of two patents related to relevance filtering technology. “This technology is used in the search engine industry to produce better search results, and has also become the dominant technology used in search advertising to position high quality advertisements,” I/P Engine said in a statement. I/P Engine earlier this year acquired a portfolio of patents from Lycos, which had obtained them via the acquisition of WiseWire in May 1998 for $39.75 million. WiseWire was founded by Andrew Lang and Donald Kosak, both of whom joined Lycos after the acquisition – and both of whom now are part of the I/P Engine management team. Lycos is currently owned by Ybrant Digital, a company based in Hyderbad, India. “These patents, which we own, apply to relevance filtering techniques that are fundamental to the technology employed by the defendants in their highly profitable search business,” Lang, CEO of I/P Engine, said in a statement. “The defendants have infringed on our patents. We are committed to upholding our rights with respect to these patents. We have the resources and focus to assert our intellectual property.” Note that according to a filing with the SEC, Innovate/Protect just raised $1.25 million in a private stock offering. U.S. Patent and Trademark Office data shows that a group of eight patents this week were assigned to I/P Engine, and that the company was previously called Smart Search Labs.</Msg><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1343877368331</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-01 23:16:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343877714772-14</Id><Topic><Title>a creation known as a "spin in"</Title><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1335017638000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-04-21 10:13:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Building Google's Video IMPIRE within ON2 by a "few ON2 researcher" as they like to call?
