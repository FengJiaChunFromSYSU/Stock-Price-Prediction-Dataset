May 18, 2004 12:03 PM PDT Geico sues Google, Overture over trademarks By Stefanie Olsen Staff Writer, CNET News Auto insurance company Geico has sued Google and Overture Services for allegedly violating its trademarks in search-related advertisements, in the latest legal salvo against the Internet companies. Geico, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway, the investment company owned by Warren Buffett, filed suit against Google and Yahoo-owned Overture on May 4, in federal court in Alexandria, Va. The insurer charged the two companies with infringing on its trademarks when they sold them as keywords to Geico's rivals, so that the protected terms could appear in sponsored search results. According to the suit, that practice causes consumer confusion, in violation of the Lanham Act, the primary federal law covering trademark registration and protection.</Msg><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1345715970307</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 05:59:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345716109494-2</Id><Topic><Title>2008: HANTRO trademarked by Google?</Title><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1334756789000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-04-18 09:46:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The following case in 2004 is another INDICATION that Google was CLEARLY AWARE of IMPORTNCE of the TRADEMARK when filed for trademarking ON2's HANTRO on April 2, 2008, about a month prior to ON2 and Sun-Microsystem announcement of their strategic partnership on May 7, 2008.

Once a forgotten penny stock stuck in application development operations, Vringo has emerged as a $200 million company largely due to its lawsuit threats against Google and other search engines like AOL (NYSE: AOL). On October 16, 2012, Vringo will finally reach a long-anticipated legal hearing when it will try to convince the court that Google has infringed upon its patented search technology worth "billions of dollars." The trial will take place in the Eastern District Court of Norfolk, Virginia. Many Vringo invesors are hoping for a quick, out-of-court settlement, including James Altucher, managing director of Formula Capital. Altucher famously penned his first article on the Vringo-Google lawsuit on March 31, sparking a 200% rally in shares of the otherwise forgotten patent troll. Since his article, Vringo has oscillated between $3-4 per share, with Altucher explaining that he continues to hold his shares in anticipation of a large settlement from Google. On August 6, AOL settled with Vringo's I/P Engine in the same court. The settlement noted, "On this day, I/P Engine, Inc. and AOL Inc. announced to the Court that they have settled I/P Engine's claims against AOL relating to AOL's Advertising.com Sponsored Listings." The final dollar amount of this AOL settlement has not been disclosed.
