Local Corporation Launching of New Vertical Sites with Focus on Lead Generation Revenues bases on own patents Local Corporation (LOCM), a leading online local media company, today announced that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has granted the company patent number 8,312,125, which covers a method and system for the bulk acquisition and development of multiple web domain names. Issued on Nov. 13, 2012, the patent describes a system and method for enabling the bulk acquisition and management of multiple web domains. The patent covers the technology related to the fulfillment of web domains. Local Corp. is currently using this technology for its small and medium-sized business (SMBs) customer as well as for the development of its recently announced vertically oriented lead generation sites. The method includes collecting a set of domain names for bulk content development, some of which are derived from user-provided keywords; filtering the set of domain names based on matching the domains to most-often used search terms by consumers; automatically submitting domain names for purchase; applying a template to the web domain related pages; and inserting content in those pages.</Msg><Username>flankenking</Username><Timestamp>1356420287401</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-25 02:24:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356427131859-2</Id><Title>Android's 72% market share still mostly 3-year old Gingerbread and no support</Title><Msg>Android's 72% market share is still today mostly 3-year old Gingerbread phones bought mostly by extremely price-sensitive food stamp recipients who naturally never buy anything online anyway, let alone perform Google searches and click on any of Google's cash-cow sponsored ads. Gingerbread owners are too poor to buy apps as well, so Android is turning out to be a "profitless splendor" in the mobile world for Google. The welfare-receiving Android buyer is the consumer least likely to click on sponsored ads or buy apps. They just wanted a cheap phone, so they bought Android. Surfing the web, clicking ads, buying apps, etc. are foreign concepts to the typical ultra price-sensitive Android consumer. And even if there's a new app, the Gingerbread owner can't run it because it's only for Jelly Bean or the Android fragmentation issue or Verizon hasn't updated his Android OS yet or he's not even aware or interested in updating because he's a welfare recipient and he's got other things to think about. There's no support in the Android world at all, because Samsung's goal and game is always and forever to make you just buy another high-margin Galaxy handset. Now, Google looks at Samsung, whose market cap in the past 10 years has risen 6-fold and will likely surpass Google's market cap in 2013, and says, "There are only 2 massively successful Internet businesses: hardware (Apple and Samsung) and search (Google). The Internet hardware/handset business like Apple's and Samsung's ($700 billion market cap combined) is the only Internet business more profitable than our Internet search, so we ought to become a player there too with the X-phone and X-tablet. Why let Apple and Samsung have all the fun? We'll become the new Samsung, let's screw Samsung. Let's move into hardware like Microsoft with its Surface. Hardware is where the really huge Internet profits truly are."</Msg><Username>adonis9000</Username><Timestamp>1356427131859</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-25 04:18:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356442985359-3</Id><Topic><Title>CEDC, the Russian/Polish Vodka powerhouse is under new aggressive (smarter) management</Title><Username>thebigpitcher17</Username><Timestamp>1356386940075</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-24 17:09:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>their position now up to about 22% and increasing....</Msg><Username>thebigpitcher17</Username><Timestamp>1356442985359</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-25 08:43:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356443693667-4</Id><Topic><Title>GOOG is certainly not looking very good.

They know Samsung's been growing rich off of Google's Android for the past several years, and now Samsung's market cap is on track to overtake Google's own market cap in 2013 (Samsung's market cap is up 6-fold in the past 10 years, far outpacing Google). So with the X-Phone and X-Tablet, make no mistake, GOOG is gunning for Samsung and aims to castrate and displace both Samsung and Apple and and become the king of BOTH Internet Search and Internet mobile devices. This is a very ambitious strategy and it would work, except for the fact that Android is inherently flawed with Dalvik, buggy, and fragmented. Moreover, the people who do buy Android phones these days--price-sensitive welfare recipients--who are responsible for Android's so-called 72% market share never actually do many Internet searches, let alone click on Google's sponsored ads in the search results. Remember, Android's purpose was to spread Google's desktop search engine to the mobile world so that mobile users could click on Google's sponsored ads in the search results, but it's not turned out this way at all as Android users only bought their phones because they were poor to begin with and, thus, were the least likely to click on any of Google's sponsored ads. When Android is targeted to the poor masses who never click on Google's sponsored ads, how was that ever supposed to further Google's search cash-cow in the mobile world? In the end, Google's not profited from all these cheap Android phones, while Samsung has. Google's only hope is to make its own premium Android phones on a mass scale, but Samsung won't cooperate and Android is an inherently flawed OS dependent on Dalvik. In the end, both Google and Samsung falter, and AAPL goes to $1,500+.</Msg><Username>adonis9000</Username><Timestamp>1356490326845</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-25 21:52:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message></Date>
