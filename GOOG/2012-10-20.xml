Sure Ad-Rates in Mobile are lower, as they should be given tiny screens, given one can not focus on the ad as much, but look at the huge growth in Mobile Ads and Apps Revenues... which will only continue with 500,000,000 new Android Users being added every year.

Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey on Tuesday told Fox News he was "disappointed" by the political use of the military uniform. "If someone uses the uniform, whatever uniform, for partisan politics, I am disappointed because I think it does erode that bond of trust we have with the American people,” Dempsey said in an interview with Fox News while flying back from a trip to Afghanistan and Iraq. But Scott Taylor, a former Navy SEAL and the president of OPSEC, argues that Dempsey's criticisms can be applied equally to the Obama campaign's "One Chance" ad, which features images of Black Hawk helicopters in flight and military pilots. The video, which is still available online, suggests Gov. Mitt Romney would not have made the same decision to call for the raid that killed Usama bin Laden. “The Obama campaign continues to promote a highly partisan attack ad that used military footage and photographs from the White House Situation Room to support sharp criticism of the president’s political opponent,” Taylor said. “The use of those in uniform and the work they do for partisan political purposes is not only unhelpful, as General Dempsey said, but is dishonorable, and the campaign should immediately remove the ad for good.” Taylor also claimed that unlike the Obama campaign's ad, all of the men featured in the OPSEC video were former military and therefore have the right to speak freely. "Speaking openly about protecting those in uniform is far more helpful than speaking about classified intelligence or Special Operations missions, tactics and capabilities, which bipartisan leaders have said has reached alarming levels under this administration,” Taylor said. Dempsey had said that as the steward of his profession -- the military -- he thinks it imperative that the military remain “apolitical.” OPSEC unveiled its 22-minute video on its website last week and pledged to go on air with a TV ad sometime in September. In the video, an array of retired CIA agents and other intelligence personnel suggest the administration has been leaking security details for political gain, and specifically criticize the president over his public handling of the bin Laden raid. "Mr. President, you did not kill Usama bin Laden. America did," Navy SEAL Ben Smith said in the video. "The work that the American military has done killed Usama bin Laden. You did not." The Web video showed clips of Obama's press conference in early May on the Pakistan raid, highlighting his comments about directing the mission. The video left out the rest of the remarks in which Obama thanked the "countless intelligence and counterterrorism professionals" involved. The Obama campaign, though, dismissed the video as akin to the 2004 "Swift Boat" ads. "The Republicans are resorting to Swift Boat tactics because when it comes to foreign policy and national security, Mitt Romney has offered nothing but reckless rhetoric," Obama spokesman Ben LaBolt said. The group seems to be most focused on the controversy over security leaks. Those leaks are currently under investigation by Justice Department attorneys. The narrator in the video says former military and intelligence operatives who understand the importance of operational security "have had enough." "Their mission -- stop the politicians from politically capitalizing on U.S. national security operations and secrets," the narrator says, as a picture of Obama flashes on screen. Obama has condemned the leaks. He said in June that the issue is "a source of consistent frustration" for his and prior administrations. Meanwhile, publishing giant Penguin Group has confirmed it has plans to release a book that provides a detailed, first-person account of the raid that killed Usama bin Laden. According to the publisher, the book, "No Easy Day: The Firsthand Account of the Mission That Killed Osama Bin Laden," is written under a pseudonym by a Navy SEAL who participated in the mission. It's co-authored with Kevin Maurer and is set to be released on Sept. 11. A spokesman at Dutton, a group owned by Penguin, says proceeds from the book will be donated to charitable causes that benefit the families of fallen Navy SEALs.</Msg><Username>foretherun</Username><Timestamp>1350740175545</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-20 09:36:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350740560488-20</Id><Topic><Title>Here's Why Google Could Disappear in Five Years: Pro ---- CNBC full article...</Title><Username>sharerahs</Username><Timestamp>1350682421580</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 17:33:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>More mobile searches mean more ad opportunities. Even if lower price/ad, can make it up on volume. More immediacy means that once perfect ad placement, the Ad is more likely to affect the purchase decision and is therefore more valuable. e.g. while at mall, looking at product X, an ad from store at mall offering a good deal on product X is very likely to affect purchase decision. Biggest threat is Siri like voice searches. I do not see how voice search allows for ad placement. Not sure how to fund search without ad placement. Is Apple subsidizing their search or is there a revenue model there? Of course, apple can offer "free" services when they have high margin product sales and relatively short product life.</Msg><Username>anonymouswizard</Username><Timestamp>1350740560488</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-20 09:42:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350741186834-21</Id><Topic><Title>Here's Why Google Could Disappear in Five Years: Pro ---- CNBC full article...</Title><Username>sharerahs</Username><Timestamp>1350682421580</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 17:33:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That article is one guy's opinion, and its 'intellectually inconsistent Spin'. Here's why. His reason is because the Click Cost per Ad is down 15% year over year, because alot of the clicks are now Mobile. Duh. Mobile's growing like wildfire. GOOG also reported its activating 1.3 million new Android Phones per day -- that's 500,000,000 Android Users per year being added. Mobile ads naturally pay less per click because the Mobile Ad is smaller, and people have less time to read them 'on the go'. But GOOG reported its MOBILE REVS. were up 300% year-over-year to $8 billion. $8 billion of Mobile Ads and Mobile Apps. GOOG IS BECOMING DOMINANT IN MOBILE, ALONG WITH APPLE.

Most users HATE the way advertising is done on phones. As goog sells more phone ads, they sell less desktop ads (where they have a proven success with high margins). In a sense, mobile is bad for GOOG. it is sucking the profits right out of their bottom line. Until someone can figure out how to advertise on a phone without annoying the user corporations are not going to pay high rates for mobile advertising. And as web browsing continues to move from desktop to phone, GOOG's cash cow is going to take a hit. And users are not going to accept adverts taking up their whole screen.</Msg><Username>dont_delay_indict_now</Username><Timestamp>1350741305878</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-20 09:55:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350742229164-23</Id><Title>How about that 2 hour trading hault and the 680 Pin.

Terrible experience! And I gave "strong buy" sentiment to CALL not to GOOG. And I have several millions + already on the Google shorting account. I will have more, much more! As I said, being on Google Adsense as a publisher was a terrible experience. They suspect you in all sins possible that you are earning your clicks somehow cheating. They are simply idiots. They think that adds money are bringing to Google by advertisers! Wrong! Publishers are exactly who is making money for them! If publishers stop using Adsense then Google business will be "caput"! They are trying to solve conflict between advertisers and publishers and doing it unprofessionally clumsy! Banning publishers accounts permanently is insulting and using methods are similar to the Soviet Union Communist Party management. I am too old and to experienced to not notice idiotic management stile. I am who predicted fall of Bank Boston in 1996 presenting the reasons to the board of directors. They found reasons so negligible for their multi-billion 200 years old business that they were laughing out loud directly to my face - not for long! Two years after my presentation they were gone forever! If Google keeps Adsense management idiots working then I am giving 5 years maximum to complete company disintegration. Their attempts to compete on hardware bases with Apple, Samsung and others extremely experienced hardware companies is immature, wrong decision! It is a way down. I have seen it many time for many companies. Idiots are everywhere, they couldn't be killed even by pesticides!

Even stronger for AAPL yesterday; 620 PUT expiring yesterday off open and AAPL's high of near 632, the put was under 20 dollars each.........10 puts netted you the high of the day AT THE CLOSE, of 10,000 . Same for SanDisk...............go in against day hi on fine earnings and guidance report from Thursday nite, when near 47 for the day hi, buy the 45 put; day low was $4, printed last on the session $96. Now for all of you reading this, tell me that the power of options if properly timed, is lower than the power of the stock price, eh? Yes options are a gamble, market days like yesterday red or sharp green as other days, do come, this we can agree on..........but sitting in a stock totally long forever to me is just plain boring..........coz you longs think forever a company goes up and you shorts think forever u will get your run in paradise against the longs, yes both or correct but all these golaiths have their fall periods, they are not Gods of the earth even tho the Wall Street Manipulating Brotherhood thinks they control all..............

But what are the real effects of it? Yes, some low skill jobs leave. At the same time, lower labor costs lowers the prices of everyday living, which means companies can hire more high skilled employees and means more money in your paycheck. Not mention it means bring China out of the third world, which outsourcing has done. And the higher their standard of living, the more they can out products. For example, Apply iPads and American cars, etc. The fact is, in capitalism there are inequalities, but labor and capital goes were it is most effecianrly used. Government planning on the other hand, is always inefficient. Yes, social safety nets are needed. But we didn't become a first rate power through the wonders of government planning.</Msg><Username>demedici</Username><Timestamp>1350755230462</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-20 13:47:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350756780063-43</Id><Topic><Title>OUTSOURCING</Title><Username>demedici</Username><Timestamp>1350755230462</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-20 13:47:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>read Mike " Mish" Shedlock's blog today, interesting email from Mountaineering Co, saying they have to pay 24% tariffs on sophisticated backpacks they can't find anyone in the country to make.A good read on companies moving to part-time workers to avoid Obamacare by 2014 also. globaleconomicanalysis is his blog.</Msg><Username>cantgthrtondirt</Username><Timestamp>1350756780063</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-20 14:13:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350756834317-44</Id><Topic><Title>OUTSOURCING</Title><Username>demedici</Username><Timestamp>1350755230462</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-20 13:47:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks.
