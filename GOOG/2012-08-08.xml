Apple Store In Georgia Refuses To Sell iPad, iPhone To Farsi-Speaking Customer, Citing Company Policy The Huffington Post | By Craig Kanalley Posted: 06/19/2012 4:01 pm Updated: 06/20/2012 A 19-year-old woman in Alpharetta, Ga., claims that her local Apple store refused to sell her anything after she was heard speaking Farsi with her uncle while she was trying to buy an iPhone and iPad. "When we said 'Farsi, I'm from Iran,' he said, 'I just can't sell this to you. Our countries have bad relations,'" Sahar Sabet told WSB-TV. According to the report, the Apple store employee cited the company's official policy, which prohibits the sale of their products to countries with which trade is prohibited by U.S. embargo. -------- Sabet, though, didn’t buy that explanation. In her opinion, she was racially profiled. “He didn’t have any business asking me what country I was from,” Sabet said. “I actually walked out in tears.” ??????</Msg><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1344470427084</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 20:00:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344470779691-28</Id><Topic><Title>ON2: And COMPROMISING Iranian Yahoo &amp; Google Account</Title><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1331259440000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-03-08 21:17:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What a difference two from the same "origin/land" but landing on totally different sides as is reported one landing "a robot on another planet using a crane and rockets" to find new life in different planet,while another "secretly" directing the innocents to a point where the "rocket" of their friends, even though in the public they call it "enemy", is directed to eliminate.
