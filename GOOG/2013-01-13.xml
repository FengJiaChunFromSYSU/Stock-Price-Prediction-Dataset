(because it's based on Java)</Title><Msg>Oracle's new fix (Java 7 Update 11) doesn't really fix Java's vulnerabilities, of which new ones are being discovered daily and which hackers are focusing on like a laser beam. Java security expert Adam Gowdiak, the guy who informed Oracle of the latest Java vulnerabilities, says Java is still vulnerable even after Update 11 and says according to Reuters, "We don't dare to tell users that it's safe to enable Java again." Android's Dalvik Virtual Machine which runs all the Android apps on Android phones is actually based on and powered by Java, and it's only a matter of time before hackers start using vulnerabilities found in Java to exploit and undermine Android's Dalvik Machine. This is the nightmare scenario and flaw that have haunted Java and Android since inception and the reason nobody should ever trust either of them. More than 99% of mobile malware targets Android over iOS because Java was already hackers' #1 target and Android is actually based on Java. Samsung Galaxy S3's and Note II's are already dying all over the world due to Sudden Death Syndrome (do a search on "Ultimate GS3 Sudden Death Thread), and now Android itself increasingly finds itself vulnerable to hackers because it's based on Java.</Msg><Username>adonis9000</Username><Timestamp>1358137367688</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-13 23:22:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message></Date>
