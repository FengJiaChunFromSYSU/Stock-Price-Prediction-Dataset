Goog moves $5 to $20 on normal days. The potential post earnings move is incredible. Past two ER's saw the stock move $50.00 overnight. I wouldn't be surprised to see this move $50 to $80 this time. Deep out of the money strangles, and a near the money strangle combo makes sense. Good luck to all who roll the dice for the report.</Msg><Username>silversplode</Username><Timestamp>1365856839698</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-13 08:40:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365862949157-4</Id><Topic><Title>ER on the 18th</Title><Username>silversplode</Username><Timestamp>1365856839698</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-13 08:40:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I"ve seen it move up and down $50 on two separate occasions...however, MONTHLY OPTION EXPIRATION will be a big factor the following day.

Here's what I'm looking at. I'm thinking in terms of percentage change, and that is what matters. We're now dealing with a stock that is almost $800.oo and it has big potential at earnings. I'll be honest, I never know which way a stock will move after the news. Anyone who claims they can predict that regularly needs to be scrutinized heavily. I think you take a small strangle, long and close to the money (long meaning buy the call and put, not sell).....and if you don't get a huge move, just a "little" move, say $20.00.....that should produce enough profit to offset the deep out of the money long call/put strangle. Or at least most of it. It is definitely a gamble but one worth taking. Last time Goog reported it moved about $50.00, and it was a $650.00 stock. What's that, somewhere between 7 and 9 percent? Ok, current price is around 790.......9% move is plus or minus 71 dollars. A lousy 5% move is 39.5. Good luck to everyone.</Msg><Username>silversplode</Username><Timestamp>1365864132761</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-13 10:42:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365868394113-6</Id><Topic><Title>Please don't be swayed by my posts from last quarter.</Title><Username>biglefthook_00</Username><Timestamp>1365855860673</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-13 08:24:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I did not post this ....My option "suggestions" were 100% profitable last quarter with AAPL.
