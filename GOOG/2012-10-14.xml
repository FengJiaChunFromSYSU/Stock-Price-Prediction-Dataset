Within one hours of the 9-11-2012 anniversary attack on the United States consulate in Benghazi, U.S. intelligence agencies and President Barack Obama had strong indications that al Qaeda–affiliated operatives were behind the attack, and had even pinpointed the location of one of those attackers. The White House was immediately informed of the situation within 2 hours of the attack. President Obama ordered Ambassador Susan Rice: Spin that The Libya Attack Was Not Premeditated ( this was a lie and she knew it) Made the media rounds on- ABC- CBS- CNN -FOX News and others. Susan Rice mission was to spin that the attack was due to a video on YouTube. It is a known fact that soon after the attack President Obama and U.S. intelligence had a pretty good bead on some three or four individuals involved in the attack.” A strike force was put off because of the political consequences it would have on Obama's reelection Campaign. Three separate U.S. intelligence officials who spoke to a very reliable sources, said the early information was enough to show that the attack was planned and the work of al Qaeda affiliates operating in Eastern Libya. This was indeed an Obama Team Coverup and Joe Biden knew it and is part of the Benghazi Coverup. Attacks in Libya become unexpected weak spot for Obama campaign ... Therefore a Coverup was in place. It took weeks for the White House and the administration to formally acknowledge that the Benghazi assault was a terrorist attack. On Sunday, Obama adviser Robert Gibbs explained the evolving narrative as a function of new information coming in quickly on the attacks. "We learned more information every single day about what happened,” Gibbs said on Fox News. “Nobody wants to get to the bottom of this faster than we do.” Please be advised that advisors David Axelrod and Robert Gibbs were part of this Libya Benghazi Coverup The intelligence officials who spoke to White House Insiders did so anonymously because they weren’t authorized to speak to the press. They said U.S. intelligence agencies developed leads on four of the participants of the attacks within 4 hours of the fire fight that took place mainly at an annex near the Benghazi consulate. For one of those individuals, the U.S. agencies were able to find his location after his use of social media. “We had two kinds of intelligence on one guy,” this official said. “We believe we had enough to target him.” President Obama felt that this was very damaging for his reelection campaign since he had stated that Al Qaeda was much less powerful and easier to control. Vice President Joe Biden quote was also important to employ the Coverup because he said "Osama bin Laden is dead, and General Motors is alive!" Obama coverup was truly political in nature. The president of the United states of america Lied to the American people and so diid Susan Rice and Hillary Clinton. They spent less than $100,000 in the Middle East to ap Libya Obama Cover-Up &amp; Scandal: Team Obama Has Misled Americans on 9/11 Benghazi Attack, Hillary Clinton May Testify soon. Americans remember this In a speech that had Democrats on the edge of their seats, wondering if the gaffe-prone vice president would make another embarrassing blunder, Biden stayed relatively close to his prepared remarks. "Osama bin Laden is dead, and General Motors is alive!" Vice President Joe Biden passionately pushed out his now-famous, bumper-sticker catch phrase at the Democratic National Convention Thursday night -- "Osama bin Laden is dead, and General Motors is alive!" The Coverup was necessary because of this and that in the Obama Campaign forces in all 50 states. One of the strong concerns was that the Libya attack of 9 -11 would of been extremely damaging to President Obama reputation and his second term election and in the history books as he would go down as another Richard Nixon in the Watergate Coverup.</Msg><Username>reliable_sources</Username><Timestamp>1350238960975</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 14:22:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>58</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350240179373-13</Id><Topic><Title>GOOG ready to crash</Title><Username>tech_six_sense</Username><Timestamp>1350149103838</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-13 13:25:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Google will be around $800 on Oct 19th ... as for your VRNG, it will drop back to 68 cents !</Msg><Username>biotechh</Username><Timestamp>1350240179373</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 14:42:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350242892327-14</Id><Topic><Title>The Right Way To Trade GOOG</Title><Username>sandovalgibbs107</Username><Timestamp>1350131240500</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-13 08:27:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>For every times i buy my shares, i depend on your such contributions online because it give me full strength to invest more safely.thank you.</Msg><Username>v.roman61</Username><Timestamp>1350242892327</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 15:28:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350244525244-15</Id><Title>From a Programming standpoiint, How do you begin removing Layers of Code from the Lang Patented Framework, using J2EE standards. 3 years of testing</Title><Msg>What will results be</Msg><Username>marketneutral1001</Username><Timestamp>1350244525244</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 15:55:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350250146347-16</Id><Title>ON2 &amp; Google merger SCAM!!!</Title><Msg>How will a judge rule in ON2 shareholders favour when: ON2 &amp; Google merger SCAM!!!

"How on Earth was such a man elected president?" "Obama was given a pass - held to a lower standard - because of the color of his skin."...... end result of affirmative action- a "racist policy". Better late than never (I guess- Better NEVER than late, but nobody cared in 2008) Finally, Matt Patterson and Newsweek speak out about Obama. This is timely and tough. As many of you know, Newsweek has a reputation for being extremely liberal. The fact that their editor saw fit to print the following article about Obama and the one that appears in the latest Newsweek, makes this a truly amazing event, and a news story in and of itself. At last, the truth about our President and his agenda are starting to trickle through the �protective wall� built around him by the liberal media. ___________________________ I Too Have Become Disillusioned. By Matt Patterson (columnist/opinion writer) Years from now, historians may regard the 2008 election of Barack Obama as an inscrutable and disturbing phenomenon, the result of a baffling breed of mass hysteria akin perhaps to the witch craze of the Middle Ages. How, they will wonder, did a man so devoid of professional accomplishment beguile so many into thinking he could manage the world's largest economy, direct the world's most powerful military, execute the world's most consequential job? Imagine a future historian examining Obama's pre-presidential life: ushered into and through the Ivy League, despite unremarkable grades and test scores along the way; a cushy non-job as a "community organizer;" a brief career as a state legislator devoid of legislative achievement (and in fact nearly devoid of his attention, so often did he vote "present"); and finally an unaccomplished single term in the United States Senate, the entirety of which was devoted to his presidential ambitions. He left no academic legacy in academia, authored no signature legislation as a legislator. And then there is the matter of his troubling associations: the white-hating, America-loathing preacher who for decades served as Obama's "spiritual mentor"; a real-life, actual terrorist who served as Obama's colleague and political sponsor. It is easy to imagine a future historian looking at it all and asking: how on Earth was such a man elected president? Not content to wait for history, the incomparable Norman Podhoretz addressed the question recently in the Wall Street Journal: To be sure, no white candidate who had close associations with an outspoken hater of America like Jeremiah Wright and an unrepentant terrorist like Bill Ayers, would have lasted a single day. But because Mr. Obama was black, and therefore entitled in the eyes of liberal Dom to have hung out with protesters against various American injustices, even if they were a bit extreme, he was given a pass. Let that sink in: Obama was given a pass - held to a lower standard - because of the color of his skin. Podhoretz continues: And in any case, what did such ancient history matter when he was also so articulate and elegant and (as he himself had said) "non-threatening," all of which gave him a fighting chance to become the first black president and thereby to lay the curse of racism to rest? Podhoretz puts his finger, I think, on the animating pulse of the Obama phenomenon - affirmative action. Not in the legal sense, of course. But certainly in the motivating sentiment behind all affirmative action laws and regulations, which are designed primarily to make white people, and especially white liberals, feel good about themselves. Unfortunately, minorities often suffer so that whites can pat themselves on the back. Liberals routinely admit minorities to schools for which they are not qualified, yet take no responsibility for the inevitable poor performance and high drop-out rates which follow. Liberals don't care if these minority students fail; liberals aren't around to witness the emotional devastation and deflated self-esteem resulting from the racist policy that is affirmative action. Yes, racist. Holding someone to a separate standard merely because of the color of his skin - that's affirmative action in a nutshell, and if that isn't racism, then nothing is. And that is what America did to Obama. True, Obama himself was never troubled by his lack of achievements, but why would he be? As many have noted, Obama was told he was good enough for Columbia despite undistinguished grades at Occidental; he was told he was good enough for the US Senate despite a mediocre record in Illinois; he was told he was good enough to be president despite no record at all in the Senate. All his life, every step of the way, Obama was told he was good enough for the next step, in spite of ample evidence to the contrary. What could this breed if not the sort of empty narcissism on display every time Obama speaks? In 2008, many who agreed that he lacked executive qualifications nonetheless raved about Obama's oratory skills, intellect, and cool character. Those people � conservatives included - ought now to be deeply embarrassed. The man thinks and speaks in the hoariest of clich�s, and that's when he has his Teleprompters in front of him; when the prompter is absent he can barely think or speak at all. Not one original idea has ever issued from his mouth - it's all warmed-over Marxism of the kind that has failed over and over again for 100 years. (An example is his 2012 campaign speeches which are almost word for word his 2008 speeches) And what about his character? Obama is constantly blaming anything and everything else for his troubles. Bush did it; it was bad luck; I inherited this mess. Remember, he wanted the job, campaigned for the task. It is embarrassing to see a president so willing to advertise his own powerlessness, so comfortable with his own incompetence. (The other day he actually came out and said no one could have done anything to get our economy and country back on track.) But really, what were we to expect? The man has never been responsible for anything, so how do we expect him to act responsibly? In short: our president is a small-minded man, with neither the temperament nor the intellect to handle his job. When you understand that, and only when you understand that, will the current erosion of liberty and prosperity make sense. It could not have gone otherwise with such a man in the Oval Office.</Msg><Username>foretherun</Username><Timestamp>1350254114023</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 18:35:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350254252579-19</Id><Topic><Title>Short GOOG Make Money</Title><Username>beancounter_2003</Username><Timestamp>1100207610000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2004-11-11 16:13:30 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>advice from 2004 - by gm short goog!</Msg><Username>perfect_market</Username><Timestamp>1350254252579</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 18:37:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350255147286-20</Id><Title>_ VRNG is NOTHING BUT A LITTLE BULLY _</Title><Msg>VRNG purchased Nokia stock only to be able to sue all the big boys to "attempt" to make money.

At the heart of the ranking process is 'clicks'; more clicks means that website is more relevant than others. [It seems like a trivial detail right now, but we'll get back to that. It'll matter in a moment] It's a technology that Lycos (yes, the nearly-dead search engine organization) bought and employed. Between then and, oh, 2002 or so, the search engine industry basically died. Why? There was no money in it. One of the few remaining players in the business was Yahoo! (NASDAQ:YHOO), which dominated at the time, and a cute little project named Google, which wasn't expected to last much longer.... at the time. (And yes, this all does have to do with Vringo right now - hang on a sec.) In fact, Yahoo! (via Overture, which it bought through an acquisition) went on to file more patents for a method to place ads on a search engine's results page. Not all of Yahoo!'s requested patents were approved though, because - wait for it - Ken Lang had already filed (and won) for the other patents Yahoo! was looking to win approval for. If it seems vaguely familiar, it may be because Google ended up settling with Yahoo! in 2004, out of court, for a license to use Yahoo!'s patented ad-bidding system. [Keep that detail in your back pocket too.] This was right around the time Google was going public, but more important, this was also around the time Google's business started to explode. Revenues soared from $3.2 billion in 2004 to last year's $37.9 billion, shortly after its search engine market share soared from 2002's 29% to today's 70% or so. Great, but what does any of this have to do with Vringo now? Vringo contends that the reason - and we can infer Vringo is contending it's the only reason - Google has become a smashing success is because Google used Vringo's patented process for creating the search engine's clearly valuable relevance ranking system (i.e. that's how Google became the top name in search) and ad-display process, and as a result, Vringo's patent is the reason Google has grown so rapidly. See, Vringo now owns the patents that Ken Lang filed... the same patents that Lycos bought from Ken Lang, the same patents that Lycos sold to a company called Innovate/Protect a few months ago, and the same patents that Vringo owns now through its recent merger with Innovate/Protect. More important, if Google really did use a Vringo-owned patented process the whole time it was becoming a search engine giant, then it owes Vringo a truckload of money, for lost royalties. Moreover, if Google knowingly used a process patented by someone else, it also owes damages.... to the tune of billions of dollars.
