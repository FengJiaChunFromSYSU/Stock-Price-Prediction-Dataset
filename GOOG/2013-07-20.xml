The prisons at $ 35,000 a year per and lawyers making money and judges working and defendants clogging the courts and a mafia getting rich while our cities and states go bankrupt. DETROITm If they could get the taxes would have money instead of spending it on law enforcements and courts and in their jail. True all over the country. No reason for organized criminal making the money instead of cities, and states. all law enforcements treading water at huge costs to a losing battle. Anybody can get pot if they want it anyway. Just to give the private prisons, clog city jails at 250 dollars a day and waste policeman's time day in day out instead of protecting us. BENEFIT!!! To lawyers, judges, politicians buddies and their future work, private prisons, and the few that mak the profit instead of us. Expands and gives resources for all other ILLEGAL , including border security. Illegal mules already in illegal activities from the get go... All criminal as is not approving. Losing battle, waste of resources and law enforcement time, and cost of 35,000 per prison inmate and city costs of 250 per day!!! COMEON!!! We just finance the crimials to expand other areas like cyber theft.. ID theft and so on...

So to start don't buy options or make sure you can put the trade on as economically as possible. Statistically selling options is your the best option. Hitting singles and doubles wins the game in the long run. But also have the patience to wait it out until the odds are in your favor on the trades. For most people you make a million dollars in the options game by starting with 2M.</Msg><Username>pricewowens</Username><Timestamp>1374344583662</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 14:23:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374345057257-13</Id><Topic><Title>Lost 5k today, one saving grace.

I just hope the correction doesn't come Monday. Is it true that when a momentum stock pops Friday at the close that it'll open up down on Monday? Or is there an increased probability that it will do so?

I close my calls. Back to 6,000 dollars. Meanwhile TSLA doesn't do much Monday, and I get 3 of the AUG 17 125 calls. That'd be about $2,500. Then on earnings, it pops to 150. That'd give me TR = 7,500. TC = 2,500. Pi= 5000 approximately. Meanwhile I take the other 3,500 and get my dad and myself out of my ex girlfriends place and into a house. Get two big tvs and another cable to plug my ipads into them. Even better would be if ISRG could stumble down below 360 this week, where my dumbass bought a put that expires this Friday. I almost bought calls. I wish I had. I could have bought 4 of them for 800 (they were 2 dollars each at open on Friday) and it rose 30 points. That'd have been TR = 12,000 and a great Friday close instead of a dismal one.</Msg><Username>pdpp59</Username><Timestamp>1374360700262</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 18:51:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374360840337-16</Id><Title>How much stock do you put in charts?</Title><Msg>Seeing as the true pattern of a chart can only be viewed with certainty in hindsight, are charts useful metrics?

Ugh I wish I'd bought those calls anticipating the rebound. I'm going to pretend to buy calls in addition to my real options. I'll simply mark what i would have spent, and the other data, then check it back later. in the meantime I'll follow the news on those stocks and try to get a good grasp of what effects them. For example: i know an earnings report that doesn't meet expectations should hurt longs. However, I did not know that GOOG was such a big company, and that, in the context of the report, though the missed expectations, they were still growing....that the earnings report really didn't matter much in the context of what is GOOGle. So the retail customers and hedge funds alike, I assume, saw that drop after the earnings as an opportunity to get in cheap.</Msg><Username>pdpp59</Username><Timestamp>1374365563676</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-20 20:12:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374365605621-23</Id><Topic><Title>Lost 5k today, one saving grace.
