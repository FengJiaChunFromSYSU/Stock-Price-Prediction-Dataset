Just as the wafer-foundry business model freed many IC companies from manufacturing internally designed chips using their own fabs, Dai promotes a “design foundry” business model. The model aims to free chip vendors from designing all elements of a customer’s SoC from scratch. In essence, VeriSilicon offers an antidote to the costly custom consumer SoC business. The nature of the high risk, low margin custom SoC business has brought companies like Renesas Electronics to its knees. Renesas has little choice but to leave the audio visual/multimedia sector of the SoC business. Noting the tremendous pressure from competitors in Taiwan and Korea, VeriSilicon’s Dai said: “It’s time for Japan to work with the Chinese.” While its design foundry approach mirrors eSilicon and OpenSilicon, VeriSilicon is counting on an army of talented, young Chinese engineers to flesh out the model. In a recent interview, Dai claimed that VeriSilicon has already become “the most geographically diversified design foundry.” Top China magazine features Weili Dai, Marvell Technology’s co-founder, Wayne Dai’s sister. The headline reads: "China Genius". Wayne Dai's (right) high-achiever siblings featured on the Top China cover story.

Dai, who knows China and Silicon Valley inside out, strives to build his company by combining the best of the both worlds. Hence, VeriSilicon is by no means your typical China fabless vendor, nor is it a "one trick pony" but rather a business built to “be scalable with its flexible turnkey business model,” Dai said. While building a large IP portfolio, the company also hopes to make its business “repeatable” based on application-centric SoC platforms, he added. VeriSilicon has already gone through five rounds of funding and could go public in 2013. Nowhere near as big as Marvell Semiconductor, co-founded by Dai’s sister, Weili, Wayne Dai’s ambitions remain big. For example, VeriSilicon’s Shanghai office recreates the huge aquarium in Marvell’s spacious Santa Clara lobby. The difference is that VeriSilicon’s aquarium consists of four large LCD panels, and all the tropical fish are virtual. Comparing this to his sister’s aquarium, Dai chuckled and said, “Obviously, this isn’t as big as the fish tank at Marvell. But then, we don’t have to feed the fish.”</Msg><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1348754055775</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 09:54:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348754097976-34</Id><Title>GOOGLE TO DROP LIKE A ROCK !!!</Title><Msg>SELL!!!</Msg><Username>keyisvol</Username><Timestamp>1348754097976</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 09:54:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348754175815-35</Id><Topic><Title>Buyers step in every time goog drops.

The Google Map issue on the iPhone was a hint at what will be ahead in the hardware space as it relates to the consumer experience. Google dominates in the consumer eyeball department. If you can produce a hardware solution around your dominant search business, your dominant application business and your IP in video and hardware optimization - you win.

Hambrecht is a recognized investment banking firm that regularly engages in the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions. The board selected Hambrecht on the basis of, among other things: • Hambrecht’s experience and expertise in business combinations between companies with revenues of less than $250 million; and • Hambrecht’s knowledge in the software industry, in which Hantro is an active participant; and • Hambrecht’s experience in valuing privately owned businesses. -----On April 3, 2007 certain representatives of Hambrecht accepted investment banking positions at Oppenheimer &amp; Co.

Oppenheimer and Hambrecht entered into an agreement to split fees regarding the proposed transaction with Hantro.

How could this be possible? --------- To make it clear, ON2 was nOT a mosque, Senegauge, Church or place for any "religious" practice to ISOLATE those that did NOT "believe" the same as those who MIRROR-IMAGEd channels for ON2 and Google to create PATH from bunddling those channels between goole and on2. ON2 was a public company invested by too many different investors with different believes. Why they turne a CORNER of ON2 to their "praying" ground to PREY on ON2 shareholders will be hard to investigate but it will NOT be hard to see where was that coner: New York in the USA. I'll intend to identify FOCUSE ATTENTION point in ON2 criminal case so whenever any investigator get lost, or discouraged in his/her investigating of those billionairs or the HIGHER "echelone" core in ON2 "beleiving" the same as the few Google's top EXECs to echange ON2 technical information what was through "mirror-chanels" reflected from the "blief" coming out of the few involved, to get back to that point to CONCENTRATE a few moment, like getting back to breathing slowly to "relax" to concentrate again. Later on I'll add more to the spikes of "fishBone" or rims of "Wheel-hub" to bring different pieces of the puzle in one "wheel" or "fishbone". But how to build the WHOLE image from those peices of the puzzles depends on how one will keep his/her mind ACTIVE and FOCUSED without getting distracted in paying too much attentions to different rim or spike instead of sitting at the "hub" to connect the peices one-by-one without getting lost. Here is the FOCUSE ATTENTION POINT that no one, I mean NO one, with right mind can ignore to pay attention no matter how his/her mind wander around to loose him/her wrap the case without any "logical" or meaningful results. ON2 Short Interests was more than 18 million in 2007, also in 2007 ON2 PPS was around $4 at some point. At the last months of 2008 ON2 Short Interest was around 4 million in September while the PPS was under $0.40. From October 2008 to August 5, 2009, ON2's SI dropped to under 500,000, yeas that's 500K, but still its PPS was under $0.40. How could this be possible is the question NO one in right mind and "clean" record in the legal system can miss to notice or RAISE the red flag to be INVESTIGATED. So, in "barebone" the FOCUSE ATTENTION POINT for not losing the TRACK of INVESTIGATION by DOJ, FBI, or any legal system in the USA, or for that matter in China or finland, wil be: From October 2008 to August 5, 2009, ON2's SI, around 2 million in October 2008, dropped to under 500,000, yes that's 500K, but still its PPS was kept under $0.40 on August 5, 2009.

(NYSE MKT: VRNG), a company engaged in the innovation, development and monetization of mobile technologies and intellectual property, today released the following statement: This afternoon, Vringo's wholly-owned subsidiary, I/P Engine, Inc. received notice of an initial Office Action at the U.S. Patent Office ("USPTO") with respect to Google, Inc.'s Ex Parte request for Reexamination of U.S. Patent No. 6,314,420 (the "420 Patent"). I/P Engine acquired the 420 Patent from Lycos, Inc., and it is one of the two patents-in-suit in I/P Engine vs. AOL, Google et al. Since the inception of the lawsuit, I/P Engine expected Google to seek reexamination because it is a standard and typical tactic used by defendants in patent litigation cases. Today's action is an initial step in a process that ordinarily takes several years. It is not the USPTO's final action. At this point, the USPTO has only heard from Google. I/P Engine looks forward to sharing its input with the USPTO by November 25, 2012. I/P Engine believes that it will be successful in obtaining re-confirmation of the 420 Patent. I/P Engine does not believe this will result in any delay of the trial, which remains scheduled to commence on October 16, 2012.</Msg><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1348776570300</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 16:09:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348777279007-143</Id><Title>Chia Obama vs. Chia Romney: May Best Greenfro Win by Page, Brin, Schmidt and Googler Gang.</Title><Msg>Let's decide this once and for all.

The opening paragraph of Vringo's opposition summarizes its argument, stating: All of Defendants' arguments for non-infringement or invalidity in their Motion for Summary Judgment ("Motion") are premised on facts that are disputed and, in many cases, simply incorrect. Defendants' non-infringement arguments rest on a straw man that mischaracterizes a portion of I/P Engine's infringement evidence, and ignores the rest of that evidence on the same limitation. Defendants' invalidity arguments are premised on facts that are in fundamental dispute, and on which the parties' experts have joined issue, such as whether the cited references disclose "filtering" or "content-based" analysis. Here is a breakdown of the arguments that Vringo raises in its opposition to summary judgment. 1. Vringo has substantial and sufficient evidence to prove that the accused systems infringe the asserted claims of the '420 and '664 patents; 2. Genuine issues of material fact exists because the evidence demonstrates that indirect infringement of the '420 and '664 patents exists; and 3. There are genuine issues of material fact as to whether Bowman and Culliss anticipate all of the asserted claims of the '420 and '664 patents. As much has been made of the prior art arguments, a closer look at Vringo's arguments on these two issues is warranted. In its brief, Vringo relies on its expert Dr. Carbonell, to conclude that Bowman does not disclose either filtering the informons on the basis of applicable content profile data for relevance to the query or combining pertaining feedback data and therefore, because the parties dispute the underlying factual matter of whether Bowman discloses each and every claim element in the asserted claims, summary judgment invalidating the '420 patent is improper. In addition Vringo argues that Bowman fails to disclose searching for information relevant to a query associated with a first user in a plurality of users and as such, Bowman does not disclose each and every limitation of the asserted claims of the '664 patent. Similarly, Vringo argues that Culliss does not anticipate the asserted claims of the '420 and '664 patents. For the '420 patent, Vringo asserts that Culliss does not disclose filtering each informon on the basis of applicable content profile data for relevance to the query, because Culliss does not filter items. Moreover, Culliss does not anticipate the asserted claims of the '664 patent because Culliss does not disclose searching for information relevant to a query associated with a first user in a plurality of users and Culliss does not disclose a content based filter because Culliss does not disclose a filter and Culliss does not consider the content of an item. In addition to its brief, Vringo submitted 56 Exhibits total; 438 pages in unsealed pages. I am sure the sealed documents make up fairly large sum as well. Throughout its summary judgment opposition, Vringo effectively cites the testimony of Google witnesses that supports Vringo's case and when combined with the compelling testimony of its expert Dr. Carbonell, Vringo looks to have not only put forth a compelling case to defeat summary judgment, but also has started to disclose what will be a persuasive case for the jury. In addition to the summary judgment response, the docket has been littered with recent motions in limine, which are motions that are pre-trial motions requesting that the judge rule that certain testimony regarding evidence or information may be included or excluded from the trial. With the start of trial two and a half weeks away and with the briefing on these motions not even complete, the court will certainly have its hands full between now and October 16. In one of the motions in limine, it was disclosed that Vringo is seeking past damages of $696 million, plus pre-judgment interest. Since my other articles on Vringo, nothing has caused me to change my position that its case against Google is headed to trial absent a settlement. With the trial now on the immediate horizon, for those investors that like to take risks based on stocks with binary events, I believe that Vringo presents a compelling risk v. reward opportunity, particularly with the recent pullback to the $3 level the stock has experienced.</Msg><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1348778412107</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 16:40:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348778500306-147</Id><Title>Why Yahoo ADMIN DELAYING TIMESTAMPPED Messages: Working for Short to COVER</Title><Msg>from SeekingAlpha Icarus Falling Vringo Responds To Google's Motion For Summary Judgment September 27, 2012 On September 27, 2012, Vringo ("VRNG") filed its opposition to Google's ("GOOG") motion for summary judgment in their patent infringement case slated to go to trial on October 16, 2012.

With the trial now on the immediate horizon, for those investors that like to take risks based on stocks with binary events, I believe that Vringo presents a compelling risk v. reward opportunity, particularly with the recent pullback to the $3 level the stock has experienced.</Msg><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1348778500306</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 16:41:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348778694828-148</Id><Topic><Title>VRNG vs GOOG on Oct 16, 2012, court date</Title><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1348755866628</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 10:24:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yahoo Admin DELAYING bringing up the TIMESTAMPED messages posted a few minutes ago.

Should Republican come to power in the USA, Iran's Green might be turned "on" by those involved in 1980's October urprise: October surprise 2009 Former Prime Minister Mir Hossein Mousavi, who claims he is the rightful winner of the June 12 [2009] presidential election, was part of the group (along with his current allies former President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and former House Speaker Mehdi Karoubi) that favored secret contacts with the United States and [sirael] to get the military supplies needed to fight the war with Iraq. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the country’s current spiritual leader and the key supporter of reelected President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, was more the ideological purist in the early 1980s, apparently opposing the unorthodox strategy that involved going behind President Carter’s back to gain promises of weapons from [sirael] and the future Reagan administration. Khamenei appears to have favored a more straightforward arrangement with the Carter administration for settling the dispute over 52 American hostages seized by Iranian radicals in 1979 --------- Re: Reneades "Out of Bush", but who'll be "In the Bush?" By casp321.Mar 6, 2012 10:49 AM.PermalinkGo to topic . Mousavi secrets 'put his life in danger' By Omid Memarian SAN FRANCISCO - Responding to pro-government critics, Iran's defiant opposition leader, Mir Hossein Mousavi, has said several times in recent months that he would reveal "untold secrets" from his tenure. Mousavi served as prime minister of Iran from 1981 to 1989, until constitutional changes abolished the post. He was a leading opposition candidate in Iran's contested presidential elections last year. Abolhassan Banisadr, Iran's first president after the Islamic Revolution of 1979, who now lives in France, told Inter Press Service (IPS) that he believes Mousavi's life is danger. "Many people who have had access to the regime's secrets or who have tried to reveal them have been murdered," he said. Last month, Banisadr published what he says is Mousavi's 1988 letter of resignation on his website, Enghelab-e Eslami. The letter was addressed to then-president Seyed Ali Khamenei, now Iran's Supreme Leader. Neither Mousavi nor any of the Iranian government authorities, including the Office of the Supreme Leader, has reacted to the letter's contents. In the letter, Mousavi explicitly speaks of terrorist activities carried out abroad and about which, he claims, his cabinet was not aware. In a part of the letter, Mousavi explains his reason for his resignation as his inability to carry out his responsibilities, saying: The operations abroad ... take place without the cabinet's knowledge or orders. You know better [than me] of their catastrophic and undesirable consequences for the country. We are informed only after an airplane is hijacked. We learn only after a machine gun opens fire on a Lebanon street and its sound can be heard all over. I am informed only after explosives are found on our pilgrims in Jeddah. Unfortunately, and against all the losses these actions have brought to the country, the likes of these operations could take place at any moment or any hour in the name of the cabinet. -------- Identification by former Iranian President Bani Sadr Former Iranian president Abolhassan Banisadr claimed that Ahmadinejad was among those inside the Embassy but was not a decision maker.[15] According to Banisadr, Ahmadinejad was not only present in the occupied compound, but served as liaison between the hostage-takers and Ali Khamenei, the Friday prayer leader of Tehran at that time. (He stated Khamenei himself, today Iran’s Supreme Leader, visited the hostage-takers repeatedly in the compound.)[16] Bani-Sadr also confirmed that Ahmadinejad was initially opposed to the hostage-taking but once Khomeini gave his agreement, he changed his mind.</Msg><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1348779850442</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 17:04:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348780211514-153</Id><Topic><Title>How big of a nosedive tomorrow?</Title><Username>margincalll</Username><Timestamp>1348778216157</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 16:36:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Down 6-7 at the open...

Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, 55, has been on probation for a 2010 federal check fraud conviction that brought a 21-month prison sentence. Under terms of his probation, he was not to use computers or the Internet for five years without approval from his probation officer. Nakoula was taken into custody Thursday, said U.S. Attorney's spokesman Thomas Mrozek. A U.S. District Court hearing was scheduled for Nakoula on Thursday afternoon.
