Although the search engine is strongest in China, deals with companies such as Apple (AAPL) could eventually cause it to become a major player in the US as well. Google's position is still strong at the moment, but Google, as well as its investors, need to be aware of the competition</Msg><Username>cris.chest</Username><Timestamp>1343537045850</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-29 00:44:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>16</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343566330124-2</Id><Topic><Title>USA "Plot" SCAMs and Saudi Involvement?</Title><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1318506584000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2011-10-13 07:49:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>They make it kosher and halat at the SAME "BakerHouse" by the SAME cooks/CROOKs and sell it to some as kosher and another as halal depending who they are dealing with: When ever USA wants to DIVERT attention from American People's Real issues, October 1980: Osama’s Oldest Brother Allegedly Involved in ‘October Surprise’</Msg><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1343566330124</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-29 08:52:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343575635152-3</Id><Title>HOW MUCH APPLE DOES GOOOGLE OWN?</Title><Msg>And Vice versa</Msg><Username>snugxyz</Username><Timestamp>1343575635152</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-29 11:27:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343578404756-4</Id><Title>Anyone buying selling calls/puts with this rally for growth - goog/sbux/cmg?</Title><Msg>The Ultimate warrior is better than triple h, the miz and chris jericho combined!</Msg><Username>chriscoff1</Username><Timestamp>1343578404756</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-29 12:13:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343589028117-5</Id><Title>VRNG and its patent win against GOOG will be huge.. may be 2012 stock of year</Title><Msg>glta...</Msg><Username>scalpelxpert45</Username><Timestamp>1343589028117</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-29 15:10:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343592802826-6</Id><Title>MSFT to Buy VRNG Patents and Ruin Google?</Title><Msg>IMHO there is a very good chance that Microsoft is going to buyout VRNG so they can own the foundational search patents that VRNG is suing Google over. Microsoft could make Bing the top search engine if they owned these patents and didn't let Google use collaborative feedback data from search engine users in their algorithms. Microsoft would be dumb not to. read up about the lawsuit and case. do a search for 'Why Google Might be Going to 0" by James Altucher...great article do a search for 'Mark Cuban Vringo' to see why he is VRNG investor If Google doesn't settle or buyout google soon microsoft might swoop in and steal VRNG and own these core search patents. Google's whole business is at risk. this stock goes to $400 if Microsoft buys out vrng</Msg><Username>vrnger</Username><Timestamp>1343592802826</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-29 16:13:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343613528272-7</Id><Title>Why...</Title><Msg>Is the configuration of this board different than any other Yahoo Message Board?</Msg><Username>gawdsmajudgel2</Username><Timestamp>1343613528272</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-29 21:58:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
