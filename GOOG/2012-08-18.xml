This Stanford Professor's Early Investment In Google Is Now Worth More Than $1 Billion Seth Fiegerman|Aug. 15, 2012 Back in 1998, David Cheriton cut Larry Page and Sergey Brin a check for $100,000 to help them get their new company Google off the ground. Now, that early investment in Google is worth more than $1 billion. Cheriton, who still works as a computer science professor at Stanford, opened up to Bloomberg West on Tuesday about why he decided to invest in Google early on and what impressed him most about the company's founders. "Actually, the first time they really impressed me as entrepreneurs was when I took them in to see John Doerr at Kleiner Perkins," Cheriton said in the interview. "To see two young guys fresh out of our PhD program go toe-to-toe with one of the most recognized venture capitalists in Silicon Valley, if not the entire world, really impressed me that they could handle the business side as well." Cheriton also explained why he thought Sergey Brin was more likely to be Google's CEO than Larry Page, at least as of a few years ago. "Sergey has always been a little more outspoken and aggressive about what they were going to," he said, "whereas I think Larry is a little more thoughtful and a little bit introverted and so, he seemed more like the scientist type than the CEO type to me." --------------------- August 03, 2012 Push to Put Your Money in Google’s CIA Cloud Wallet “Moreover, Googles’ connection with the CIA and its venture capital firm extends to sharing at least one key member of personnel.

I think the inflection point that we are at is actually stating what the government &amp; Fed has indicated since the bottom of March 2009, that CAPITAL will be more important than labor. I think AAPL &amp; GOOG lead us sharply higher in a very short term, maybe 75-100 points in each. The selloff afterwards in these will not be sharp, and money will rotate into weaker, but cheaper stocks at that time. In the meantime, while I agree the technicals on Google on daily &amp; weekly charts, the monthly &amp; quarterly charts are showing indications of sharp breaks to the upside. I think the talking heads on CNBC stating the bearish case have got it dramatically wrong. I'd love a discussion on this and GOOG analysis from you all. We don't seem to have much discussion on this board, compared to AAPL. And btw, the market cap is $221.45 billion. With the android market share, what if GOOG started charging just like $2 per phone? Surely, the Android cell phone manufactures wouldn't be making IOS phones? I'm thinking we are on the verge of learning something new from GOOG.

That's because most Android phone manufacturers customize the operating system and have to go back to the drawing board every time Google releases a new update. So we were happy to see the Android team's latest experiment, a way to bring a clean, unaltered version of Android to devices outside the company's Nexus line of phones. In a blog post, the head of the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), Jean-Baptiste Queru, said he's bringing the clean version of Android to the Sony Xperia S. That means users will be able install the latest version of Android, called Jelly Bean, to Sony's device. We first got wind of the project on NeoWin. Assuming this expermiment goes well and Queru decides to try it with other phones, it could mean Android owners will have a chance to get the latest software updates from Google within days of release. It's not a perfect solution to Android's update problem, but it could definitely help.</Msg><Username>bigghowie</Username><Timestamp>1345301527892</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 10:52:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345305314211-11</Id><Topic><Title>ON2: And COMPROMISING Iranian Yahoo &amp; Google Account</Title><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1331259440000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-03-08 21:17:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>March 20, 2012 Stratfor’s vice-president of counter-terrorism Fred Burton said “that the US State Department is the organization’s public sponsor.” The State Department partnered with several corporations and served as the main sponsor of the 2008 inaugural Alliance of Youth Movements summit in New York City that subsequently created Movements.org. Hillary Clinton endorsed the organization and presented a video message during the second summit held in Mexico City a year later, Yazan al-Saadi writes for al-Akhbar. In another email, Burton described how Google does the CIA’s bidding. “GOOGLE is getting WH [White House] and State Dept. support and air cover. In reality, they are doing things the CIA cannot do,” in other words overthrow governments and other dirty business devised by the global elite. Following negative revelations about the CIA in the mid-70s, the agency began farming out work to “democracy” and “humanitarian” front NGOs and organizations in the 1980s. The emails indicate that Google was concerned about the role Cohen played in fomenting unrest in the Middle East, but more likely the corporation seeded with #$%$ money and currently involved in surveillance technology projects with the CIA was more concerned that the flamboyant CFR operative would expose the technology corporation to criticism and a new round of negative public relations disasters.</Msg><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1345305314211</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 11:55:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345305607641-12</Id><Topic><Title>Wonder how much is a drone?</Title><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1325203699000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2011-12-29 19:08:19 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wikileaks: Google caught in spy games on execs and ‘regime change’ by Allison Deger on March 21, 2012 Following Wikileaks' first dump of emails from the global security firm Stratfor last month, another round was released Friday, showing that Google passed on information to Stratfor</Msg><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1345305607641</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 12:00:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345306216119-13</Id><Topic><Title>casp321 remember bill joll thought you like to know</Title><Username>wmhjr99</Username><Timestamp>1337952121000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-05-25 09:22:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This is why, possible, they moved BJ to "safe house" as CEO??? Stratfor emails reveal secret, widespread TrapWire surveillance system Published: 10 August, 2012, 11:23 Edited: 11 August, 2012 Former senior intelligence officials have created a detailed surveillance system more accurate than modern facial recognition technology — and have installed it across the US under the radar of most Americans, according to emails hacked by Anonymous. Every few seconds, data picked up at surveillance points in major cities and landmarks across the United States are recorded digitally on the spot, then encrypted and instantaneously delivered to a fortified central database center at an undisclosed location to be aggregated with other intelligence. It’s part of a program called TrapWire and it's the brainchild of the Abraxas, a Northern Virginia company staffed with elite from America’s intelligence community. The employee roster at Arbaxas reads like a who’s who of agents once with the Pentagon, CIA and other government entities according to their public LinkedIn profiles, and the corporation's ties are assumed to go deeper than even documented. ------------- Google, Salesforce were allegedly offered 'TrapWire' spy tool Summary: Stratfor emails placed in the wild by WikiLeaks have revealed that a video-surveillance program developed by ex-CIA members may be in place in US government organisations and multinational corporations. By Michael Lee | August 13, 2012 Now approaching its 10th day of a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, WikiLeaks has released information about a video-surveillance program that is possibly being used by the US government and large organisations, such as Salesforce and Google. The program, called TrapWire, was developed by US-based Abraxas Corporation, which is alleged to be staffed by many former US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) agents. TrapWire is meant to identify terrorists who approach a facility multiple times as they conduct their surveillance. According to Abraxas' documentation on TrapWire, it is able to correlate video surveillance with other data, such as watch lists. It can, for example, identify suspected terrorists using facial recognition or stolen vehicles by reading number plates, and then correlate this information with other event data that it already has.</Msg><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1345306216119</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 12:10:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345306459194-14</Id><Title>ON2 ACCOUNTING issue in 2007 that USA goverment seems had involvement in it???</Title><Msg>ON2 ACCOUNTING issue in 2007 that USA goverment seems had involvement in it???
