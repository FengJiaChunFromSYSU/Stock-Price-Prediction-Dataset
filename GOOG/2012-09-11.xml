FUNNY?, NOT REALLY. NTWK has been up every day after a minor post-record earnings profit taking. The stock is just starting to rally and with a 3 million share float $15 soon is just around the corner (see chart). That would make it a 12 forward PE which is conservative for a company expecting to deliver $1/share net income and grow revenues 40% in 2013.........still very cheap even at $15. In addition to legacy license-based products gaining strong momentum, the company's cloud divisions are starting to show significant growth as well. The company's Cloud division Vroozi is growing exponentially and they just announced another North America cloud business unit. Larger companies are swallowing fast growing enterprise cloud providers with SAP and ORCL certification and compatibility. The company has guided for up to 30 - 40% revenue growth in 2013 and $1/share net income. In last week's CC they also mentioned that they expect revenues to double/triple from $38 million to $75 - $100 million in revenues. This would equate to about $2/share net income.!! AAPL, GOOG, AMZN and other overpriced and boated stocks are more likely to go down while NTWK will continue to grow in an exponential manner</Msg><Username>nick.jr40</Username><Timestamp>1347341112808</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 01:25:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347344021759-2</Id><Title>Does anybody have an update on the split? Is that why this stock is running up?</Title><Msg>Hi: Do any of you folks have any links to news on the split. It was supposed to happen in September. And once the details are announced, all current options will become adjusted to handle the split. That will cause a drop in volume on the adjusted options. At that point MMs start increasing the spreads on adjusted options. Is this why the stock is running up - to trap option holders whose options become adjusted due to the split and harder to trade? Appreciate the inputs of the expert traders on this board. I personally think this stock is going down because the problems with their Motorola acquisition are just beginning. Just watch how their margins shrink over the next couple of quarters. I worked closely with Motorola at the highest levels and its worse and slower than a government agency.

First off, I believe that recent litigation surrounding the Apple (AAPL)/Samsung case will be a negative for Google and Android capability to gain market share. The positives for the company is that Chrome has a strong ability to gain more market share in the tablet/PC market as well as the mobile market, but again, we see that being more hindered now than before the Apple/Samsung case.</Msg><Username>lindontomson</Username><Timestamp>1347357671846</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 06:01:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347359551350-4</Id><Title>next year between the 800$ and 900$ +</Title><Msg>yes i think</Msg><Username>fonsvanhooff</Username><Timestamp>1347359551350</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 06:32:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347365562521-5</Id><Topic><Title>Goog Pullback To $650 This Week</Title><Username>frtgrdn21</Username><Timestamp>1347234637876</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 19:50:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Insiders sure have been busy selling in the last two weeks.

The new deposition machine just came on line this week. eman manufactures oled micro-displays. 75% of their business now is military but the consumer market is where the growth is. IMO BELLEVUE, Wash.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- eMagin Corporation (NYSE MKT: EMAN) (the “Company”), the leader in the development, design and manufacture of Active Matrix OLED microdisplays for high resolution imaging products, announced today that its new SNU OLED deposition machine has achieved automated operation, providing the Company with increased deposition capacity to better address its growing worldwide market demand with the most advanced OLED microdisplays available today. The installation of the new equipment needed for automatic mode operation was successful and the Company is now running production on the new tool in automatic mode. Samples of displays from the new machine were provided to customers and performed well based on their tests. eMagin is nearing completion of its own reliability testing (a long duration 1,000 hours testing) of the displays, which is showing positive results. The testing will conclude in mid-September, after which displays from the new machine, including those in inventory, can be shipped to fill customer orders. The new OLED deposition machine is replacing the Company’s current Satella machine for production purposes. The Satella will continue to be used primarily for research and development of next-generation microdisplays. The new machine provides significant advantages, including more up time, reduced maintenance, improved consistency, higher overall quality, greater speed of production and higher yield. Andrew Sculley, president and CEO of eMagin, commented, “Automated operation of our new state-of-the-art OLED deposition machine is a significant achievement by our team that will enable us to increase production and address the most demanding applications from the military, industrial, consumer and medical markets.” About eMagin Corporation A leader in OLED microdisplay technology, OLED microdisplay manufacturing know-how and mobile display systems, eMagin manufactures high-resolution OLED microdisplays and integrates them with magnifying optics to deliver virtual images comparable to large-screen computer and television displays in portable, low-power, lightweight personal displays. eMagin microdisplays provide near-eye imagery in a variety of products from military, industrial, medical and consumer OEMs. More information about eMagin is available</Msg><Username>zeroletdown</Username><Timestamp>1347376697325</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 11:18:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347377247269-29</Id><Topic><Title>Chart says 680 by Friday.</Title><Username>tc8848</Username><Timestamp>1347305570695</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-10 15:32:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>My crystal ball is telling me $700+ is in the books.

It becomes more and more the accepted belief that, if one wants to get things done, the responsible director of affairs must be freed from the fetters of democratic procedure." (end quote) It appears this is where we are with Obama now assuming that 'single individual' status. The author however also writes: "You assert that I contend that 'each step away from the market system and towards social reform of the welfare state is inevitably a journey that must end in a totalitarian state' and that government modification of market laissez faire must lead inevitably to political serfdom. How anyone who has read my book can in good faith say this when ever since the first edition I say right at the beginning..."Nor am I arguing that these developments are inevitable. If they were, there would be no point in writing this. They can be prevented if poeple realize in time where their efforts may lead..." (end quote) So now that's our job to vote Obama out 2012 and prevent his 'social democracy' plans for our nation.</Msg><Username>obamadungdufus</Username><Timestamp>1347408094497</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 20:01:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347409259228-53</Id><Title>Google go back to China, GOOG stock will be 1000 really soon</Title><Msg>Why don't?</Msg><Username>huge9988</Username><Timestamp>1347409259228</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 20:20:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347409299427-54</Id><Topic><Title>680 tomorrow?</Title><Username>tc8848</Username><Timestamp>1347394711099</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 16:18:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Can we wait until next week for GOOG to reach $680?</Msg><Username>servibar123</Username><Timestamp>1347409299427</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 20:21:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347409321210-55</Id><Topic><Title>Anyone know why GOOG is dn so much today?</Title><Username>hypocritrepublican</Username><Timestamp>1347375514466</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 10:58:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Facebook said they are working on search.</Msg><Username>huge9988</Username><Timestamp>1347409321210</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 20:22:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347409430666-56</Id><Title>So knowone heard the news on goog today is that what everyone is saying?</Title><Msg>goog sold everything to f/b.

CBS Scot Paulsen on "2016: The Movie" The Right Politics This past week, “2016: The Movie” about President Barack Obama opened in the Chicago area, and I chose to get more of an education about Obama by seeing the movie. After the inundation of canned hype for the movie on conservative talk shows across the Chicago radio dial that sounded more like commercials than honest endorsements of the movie, I was skeptical of what I was going to see. While some talk show hosts sounded like they were genuinely impressed with the documentary and honestly endorsing the film, there were those who were obviously reading a commercial script which was not coming across as sincere to the regular listener – at least not to this often-skeptical listener. Perhaps, in future promotions of the film, it would be wise to have pre-recorded commercials done by the professional commercial-makers rather than having the likes of Mark Levin and Sean Hannity doing script after script to promote the movie. After all, the listeners aren’t stupid and resent any attempt at being conned. After many reads by the talk show hosts, the readings of the commercial script were no more enthusiastic than another Life-Lock commercial read – another commercial that ought to be professionally done. Yet, I’m glad I saw the hyped-film because it was more informative than I had thought it would be and included less propaganda than I had predicted. If anything, it was nearly too informative as there was an enormous amount of information condensed into the nearly one-hour-and-a-half documentary. Fact after fact is put forth which shows that President Obama definitely has many skeletons in the closet that have not been released prior to the nation’s trust in him with the Oval Office. To watch this movie and realize – or simply be reminded of – all that is unknown about President Obama is of concern. Much of the information has been ignored by the American media totally. When appropriately reminded as to what is still unknown about Obama to date, one has to ask: How can any logical-thinking person give a damn about Romney’s taxes while not asking any questions regarding our current President’s past? The man influences the entire globe, but liberal Americans want to know how much Mitt Romney paid in taxes in the past rather than learn about the man who they have entrusted with the country. Unbelievable. The movie undeniably links Obama to persons of suspicious-interest due to their past actions and statements, such as former radical activist and Chicago educator Bill Ayers. While the media and blinded-liberals cast such facts aside, the movie does not. No, this portion of the movie is not propaganda – it is the display of factual information about relationships between people that cannot be denied. Yet, the “left” does deny the facts that are right in front of them. Quite disturbing is the talk of the United States economy in the film. The current national debt which has increased two-fold during Obama’s presidency and the horrendous economy is suggested to be part of the plan to strip the nation of democracy – reasonable cause to make citizens totally dependent on the government. The “left” is aghast at this suggestion of the current economy. They actually believe that Obama is unintelligent enough to let this economy just happen. Ironically, it’s many of the people on the “right” who know Obama’s not stupid, and much of what has happened to the United States in the past four years is part of Obama’s plan. How could one so-highly educated and intelligent as Obama not know what he was doing when he incurred such debt? I left the movie thinking more strongly than I had in the past that the current debt and this economy was part of Obama’s plan all along. Increasingly making Americans dependent on the government is the plan. What’s more, he knew his blind followers would believe it was not the plan and, of course, was all Bush’s fault. He must be laughing at his blind followers all the way to the “new America” they’re allowing him to create. My belief is that Obama continues to prey on his die-hard followers’ stupidity to accomplish his personal goals for America. The most disturbing part of the film to me was the interview with President Obama’s half-brother George Obama from Nairobi, Kenya. How can Obama claim to want to help people when he has done absolutely nothing for his own family? It makes me wonder if he really cares about anybody if he can’t find it in his heart to help his own family. As the closing credits started to role upward across the screen, the audience applauded. Me, I just walked out – reasonably upset. Those who have already decided to vote for Obama will probably not even see the movie. It’s sad but they probably don’t want to know the truth when it is laid out so clearly for them in this documentary. The independents who are still deciding who they are going to vote for ought to see this film. I’m quite confident that any undecided voter who sees this film will know who to vote for after viewing this documentary. If you know you’re not going to support the “left” in this coming election, see the film out of interest if you like. But, fair warning, it’s disturbing – and quite frightening – to say the least.</Msg><Username>omni1tsd</Username><Timestamp>1347418903511</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 23:01:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
