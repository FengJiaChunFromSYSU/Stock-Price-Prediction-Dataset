The stock is completely under the radar and a reason why its 0.2 X sales valuation giving it a $6.5 million market cap. The company is already almost break-even even before the upcoming AMD-related windfall. DRAM has a strong balance sheet with ZERO long term debt. Per the agreement, DRAM will develop a special edition RAMDisk utility, which will be called AMD Radeon RAMDisk. AMD Radeon RAMDisk loading times are expected to be 525% higher than those offered by conventional products, increasing performance, eliminating bottlenecks and improving the gaming experience on the PC as well as other applications requiring fast processing like complex engineering simulation models.

AMD Radeon RAMDisk utility will be available from October to December this year, and although AMD or Dataram gave more details on its operation, we assume that this utility to create a RAM disk to use by way of a fast disk cache, based on the Game and application profiles present in the Catalyst Control Center utility, which comes bundled with graphics cards, motherboards (chipset) and AMD APUs. On September 14, 2012, DRAM stated the following in its fiscal 1Q 2013 earnings report: During this quarter the Company entered into two agreements which we expect will generate growth and profits for Dataram in 2013 and beyond: - An agreement with AMD provides for Dataram to develop and sell AMD licensed and branded versions of its RAMDisk software. AMD’s Radeon RAMDisk will target the gaming enthusiast community. - An agreement with Shoreline Memory Inc. ("Shoreline") and the other with Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. ("AMD") for the purpose of expanding our customer base and product offerings. The Shoreline Agreement provides for Dataram to fulfill 50% of the orders Shoreline receives from its primary customers. Management believes these agreements will provide new revenue sources and expanded markets for the Company's products. Mr. Freeman concluded, “These recent agreements and other new opportunities we are currently pursuing should provide new sources of revenue, profit and growth for Dataram in 2013 and beyond. The experience, knowledge and assets we have gained from our current RAMDisk product, in the development of caching software and in solid state products are building a strong foundation for growth.” DRAM is also an unrecognized cloud play.

AOL, has already settled out of court with (VRNG)! Google has revised their numbers for damages for the settlement that has been reduced but reduced from what is the real question. That number was 1.5 billion settlement down to maybe 500 million, or a buyout of the company for $ $10.00 15.00 a share. (VRNG) has other cases on ZTE, Target, and more. (VRNG) has raised more capital to expand operations and patents. Dilution pretty much happened Tuesday, hence the large sales and the price drop. That is also a good thing, we were expecting it and now it is over. The float is around 90 million making this a low float and Google is down 2% today. Buy (VRNG) at the 15% discounted price because there are only 90 million shares and everyone wants to own shares of (VRNG) now! News will be coming shortly and even the shorts got squeezed out today on that late run up back to $5.55 on Tuesday:) New call options for strike price greater than $7.00 and $8.00 have been added, 10,870 new $8.00! If you can trade the swings go for it, but I am choosing to hold on to my 50k shares. I am not selling until the stock breaks $8.00, and it will. Anyone telling you different is shorting the stock, but most of them have been cleared out and now bullish trend coming. The bottom seems to be $4.50 ish and the top could go really high, breaking new 52 week highs next week! New short term price target is $15.00! Buyout deals coming! Huge settlements coming for VRNG from Google, ZTE and Target!

In addition, Glass Lewis stated, "We have little concern for the financial interests tied to the merger of current On2 executives. We also view the termination fee as a low barrier for another potential buyer to step forward…we believe the proposed transaction is in the best interest of shareholders."* PROXY Governance concluded its report by saying, "We support this transaction because it appears to make strategic sense and place a fair value [???] on the company based on the overall market reaction and the premium offered.

Surmise, conjecture, and suspicion about alleged misconduct by corporate principals, stock manipulation, and the board’s motivation for the merger do not suffice to derail the settlement of this class action. page 18/20 [where are the voting numbers in all those attempts??? Why the judge also did not include those numbers?] On2's shareholders thereafter overwhelmingly approved the acquisition. page 20/21 [Why the judge did not identify the number of "lead plaintiff" ON2/ONT shares, did she feel shame of including and ARGUING abut those numbers???] At the time of the final vote on the merger, shareholders held approximately 178,000,000 shares of On2 stock. The 239 objectors represented at the hearing claimed to hold only approximately 14,000,000 to 15,000,000 shares.</Msg><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1349874454009</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 09:07:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349874689561-21</Id><Topic><Title>DRAM $0.64 with $6.5M Market Cap is a Potential Multi-bagger......DRAM and AMD signed an agreement to launch an aggressive campaign to market all editions of AMD's AMD Memory modules for desktops......Per the agreement, DRAM will develop a special edition RAMDisk utility, which will be called AMD Radeon RAMDisk......

On the Tuesday broadcast of the nightly Nevada political program "Ralston Reports," Steve Wynn, CEO of Wynn Resorts sat down with host Jon Ralston to discuss the presidential election. Wynn, an outspoken critic of President Obama, didn't hold back in his latest criticism of the incumbent president seeking a second term. "I'll be damned if I want to have him lecture me about small business and jobs. I'm a job creator. Guys like me are job creators and we don't like having a bulls-eye painted on our back," Wynn said about Obama to Ralston. An excerpt of the interview is below. WYNN: I've created about 250,000 direct and indirect jobs according to the state of Nevada's measurement. If the number is 250,000, that's exactly 250,000 more than this president, who I'll be damned if I want to have him lecture me about small business and jobs. I'm a job creator. Guys like me are job creators and we don't like having a bulls-eye painted on our back. The president is trying to put himself between me and my employees. By class warfare, by deprecating and calling a group that makes money 'billionaires and millionaires who don't pay their share.' I gave 120% of my salary and bonus away last year to charities, as I do most years. I can't stand the idea of being demagogued, that is put down by a president who has never created any jobs and who doesn't even understand how the economy works. Wynn on a scrapped business plan: "I'm afraid of the president. I have no idea what goofy idea, what crazy, anti-business program this administration will come up. I have no idea. And I have to tell you Jon that every business guy I know in the country is frightened of Barack Obama and the way he thinks."

Google has lot EVERY single big motion in this case. His comments look like he is very scared of patent cases even though Google bought thousands of great patents from Motorola purchase. This share price of Google assumes VERY LITTLE damages to be paid by Google. What if they lost for 4 billion, plus lawyers fees, interest, royalties, and triple damages? If verdict was 2 billion and the judge finds this to be willful that would be 8 billion in profits of Google gone overnight.

Lycos people and overture people (which whom google settled a previous case with Yahoo) were the inventors of online ad patents.... The CTO of Vringo (you spelled it wrong), whom you may not be familiar with was former CTO of Lycos. Lycos existed BEFORE GOOGLE. Therefore Lycos patents are now owned by VRNG and Google is infringing a patent or series of them they DID NOT INVENT. VRNG are not trolls. Your opinion is to short VRNG? Will you short it tomorrow? Why not go long on VRNG to hedge your possible big risk of Google settling or losing VERY BIG at trial?</Msg><Username>vrngmsft</Username><Timestamp>1349920256085</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 21:50:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349920364734-108</Id><Topic><Title>APPLE MIGHT BUY VRNG AWAY FROM GOOGLE</Title><Username>muro3s3</Username><Timestamp>1349884245335</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 11:50:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Googles tanking.

VRNG stock can certainly go down before a 4$ billion verdict against Google. Before next Tuesday, Google has an opportunity to pay less than what a jury will reward. It is smart risk management if they do. If they do not and they lose big there will be little escape from such a big verdict. VRNG simply has better lawyers.

GOOG resubmitted lower and more accurate numbers later. Vringo's attorneys argue that it is not their fault the whiz kids at Google can't add and that the original numbers should stand. It appears the judge prefers the "correct" numbers, and that's probably why VRNG gave up close to a dollar on Tuesday. Let's rewind a bit. In our original VRNG story, iStock dusted off the dusty 10-key calculator and wrote: "Let's do some math together. The clock for the suit started on September 15, 2005. Since then, Google has done nearly $160 billion in revenue. That's roughly $153 billion using Google's 96% of revenue 10Q figures. The suit only covers US revenue, chopping the number in half, which means somewhere around $75 billion of Google's sales are subject to back dated royalty payments, should the tech monster be on the wrong side of the decision. Vringo seeks a reasonable royalty payment in the lawsuit. What's a reasonable royalty fee? That's the billion dollar question. But for our purposes, we will use 0.5% to a max of 5%; although, we don't feel the company will hit the 5% jackpot. The calculator says a positive outcome could range between $375 million and $3.75 billion." Our figure could be too hot, too cold, or just right, but we believe it is in the ballpark. Based on Vringo requested settlement of $696 million, it appears the company was shooting for a 1% backdated royalty fee, putting the revenue subject to judgment a $69 billion. For those of you following along for the past two months, you'll know that Google believes $696 million is about $200 million too high. Using our 1% royalty guesstimate, we come up with $49.6 billion subjected to a possible settlement – remember, neither figure includes future royalties through 2016. It's time for the calculator, again. For the first six months of 2012, Google generated $21.6 billion in revenue, of which $20.7 billion came from advertising, and $10.57 billion from the United States. To gauge what future royalties might look like, we see that 95.8% of revenues come from the technology in question. Ninety-five point eight percent of $10.57 billion equals $10.41 billion. If revenues and percentage remain constant in the next 3.5 years, that's another $36.43 billion in revenue that could be subjected to royalty fees. Of course, Google is likely to continue growing. At a 1% royalty fee, that adds another potential $360 million to the roughly $496 million figure the settlement judge appears to favor.</Msg><Username>vrngmsft</Username><Timestamp>1349921208525</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 22:06:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349921542683-113</Id><Topic><Title>APPLE MIGHT BUY VRNG AWAY FROM GOOGLE</Title><Username>muro3s3</Username><Timestamp>1349884245335</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 11:50:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Googles management selling their shares.
