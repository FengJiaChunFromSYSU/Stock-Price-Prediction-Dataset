China already disallows Google Search and other apps in China in favor of Baidu. In the end, both Google and the Chinese government are in the same business: covert surveillance. Google doesn't appreciate China's co-opting of Android for its own surveillance purpose.</Msg><Username>adonis9000</Username><Timestamp>1359782660239</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 00:24:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359791503104-2</Id><Title>Google's X-Phone (Android 5.0) vs. Samsung Galaxy S4 (Android 4.2)</Title><Msg>X-Phone was leaked today online.

I asked the guy at the party who knows everyone there who they were, and he said they were bigwigs at vanguard. I don't know anything else, hoping I can find out if Vanguard was selling Friday. I looked to see the holders of google, and I saw that Vanguard is a holder. I'm a goog holder, but I have only 70 shares ($54,000) I don't want to give any of these gains back. If vanguard is selling, i think I'm in trouble, they are big share holders. Is there a way to find out if they sold on Friday, and are continuing to sell? They can push the price down a good bit.</Msg><Username>earthinmind</Username><Timestamp>1359850315440</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 19:11:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359851607442-17</Id><Title>'Google it'...I dunno anymore ...I tried Bing and I am impressed, really imressed</Title><Msg>Microsoft taking advantage of the high ground as they integrate PC desktop, smart phone, and pad device technology. Bing works everywhere not just in the browser. I cannot see a bloated Google stock lasting at $775! I seen the same thing years ago when MSFT was over $200. Bloat. I am shorting Google and expect to get a hefty return on a stock that is overvalue by hundreds of percent. My valuation today is - $100, probably settle around $55. Go short it and make yourself a bag, But MSFT at $27 ... I expect it to be over $120 by Independence day.</Msg><Username>j0_77</Username><Timestamp>1359851607442</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 19:33:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359862087595-18</Id><Title>GOOG may be bigger than AAPL by June, 2013 buy BOOYAH sleep easy</Title><Msg>very cheap company.</Msg><Username>lekinsh01</Username><Timestamp>1359862087595</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 22:28:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359866529461-19</Id><Topic><Title>Cramer said time to take profit</Title><Username>cybercash28</Username><Timestamp>1359765145687</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 19:32:25 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Seems like Google insiders sold some too.
