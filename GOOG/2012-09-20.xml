YouTube has refused Garcia's requests to remove the film, according to the lawsuit. The complaint contends that keeping it online violates her right of publicity, invades her privacy rights and the post-filming dialogue changes cast her in a false light. "(Garcia) had a legally protected interest in her privacy and the right to be free from having hateful words put in her mouth or being depicted as a bigot," the lawsuit states.</Msg><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1348143237681</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 08:13:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348143548865-4</Id><Topic><Title>ON2 Video technologies changing the way they are taking HOSTAGEs remotely!!</Title><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1347727808586</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 12:50:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>On the one hand Google providing Iranian secret agents with Iranian Google account to put them under torture or even EXECUTION in Iran also possibly trying to wash some Ex-SAVAK hands in between and on the other hands: -------- ON2: And COMPROMISING Iranian Yahoo &amp; Google Account By casp321.6 months ago.Permalink .

Shams disappeared, never to be seen again. This disappearance caused in Rumi what may be called a spiritual implosion, an event in which, in the absence of the beloved, the lover falls “into himself” and disappears into his own emptiness. It is from this oceanic emptiness that the drop that was Rumi became the ocean – and his poetry a reflection within it. An excerpt from one of his poems perfectly expresses this state: “Why should I seek? I am the same as he. His essence speaks through me. I have been looking for myself.” The union became complete. Rumi fell into the ocean that was Shams. Out of that experience came a huge wave of poetry that Rumi called, The Works of Shams of Tabriz. Rumi and Shams had merged, and in time Rumi found another companion. The story goes like this… One day in Konya, after Sham's had disappeared, Rumi was walking down a merchant street through a market. Suddenly he heard a goldsmith tapping his jeweler's hammer upon an small anvil. The rhythmic sound of that tapping sent Rumi into an ecstasy, where he spontaneously began to whirl – the ecstatic whirling of the Sufi dervish. Legend says that he continued to whirl for forty-eight hours without stopping. From then onwards the goldsmith named Saladin Zarkub became Rumi's companion and the “Friend” to whom Rumi addressed his poems during that period. After Saladin’s death, Husan Chelebi, Rumi's longtime scribe, became the “Friend” and the one who wrote down The Mathnawi, Rumi's vast and mysterious masterwork. In the 12 years before his death, Rumi dictated the six volumes to Husam. He died on December 17, 1273. It is said that the leaders of all the religious groups attended and perticipated in Rumi's funeral. The Christians of the time compared Rumi Jesus. The Jews, to Moses. And to the followers of Islam, Rumi was revered almost as was Mohammed.</Msg><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1348149177100</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 09:52:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348149375383-18</Id><Title>BUYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY</Title><Msg>YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY</Msg><Username>riskreversal777</Username><Timestamp>1348149375383</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 09:56:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348150863384-19</Id><Title>Buy 1 730 call</Title><Msg>now.</Msg><Username>riskreversal777</Username><Timestamp>1348150863384</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 10:21:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348150979575-20</Id><Title>Fb directly taking on GOOG in new display add/ecommerce option</Title><Msg>facebook. you hedgies in this, you are out of control and desparate to not look at any bad news</Msg><Username>notoriousbono</Username><Timestamp>1348150979575</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 10:22:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348151154955-21</Id><Topic><Title>From Shams, who transformed Rumi from a learned religious teacher into the world’s greatest poet of mystical love</Title><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1348146529548</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 09:08:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>from poetseers site that I can not post the link: Rumi was born in 1207 on the Eastern shores of the Persian Empire. He was born in the city of Balkh (in what is now Afghanistan), and finally settled in the town of Konya, in what is now Turkey. It was a period of remarkable social and political turbulence. The 13th Century was the era of the crusades; also the area where Rumi lived was under constant threat of Mongol invasion. The great upheavals Rumi faced during his life is said to have influenced much of his poetry. Jalalud’din Rumi is one of the world’s most revered mystical poets. During his lifetime he produced a prolific range of inspiring and devotional poetry which encapsulates the Sufi’s experience of union with the divine. These timeless classics have enjoyed a renaissance in recent years, as Rumi has become one of our most popular poets. Although Rumi was a Sufi and a great scholar of the Qu’ran his appeal reaches across religious and social divisions. Even during his lifetime he was noted for his cosmopolitan outlook. His funeral, which lasted 40 days, was attended by Muslims, Jews, Persians, Christians and Greeks. However the most important turning point in Rumi’s life was when he met the wandering dervish Shams al- Din. Shams was eccentric and unorthodox, but was filled with heart – felt devotion, that sometimes he couldn’t contain. Shams appeared to be quite different to the respectable and prestigious scholar, (as Rumi was at that point.) However Rumi saw in Shams a divine presence. This meeting and their close mystical relationship was instrumental in awakening Rumi’s latent spirituality and intense devotion. It was at this point Rumi abandoned his academic career and began to write his mystical poetry. Rumi’s poetry is wide ranging and encompasses many different ideas but behind all the poetry the essential theme was the longing and searching for the union with the divine. Rumi was himself a great mystic. His outpourings of poetry were a reflection of his own inner consciousness. Ironically Rumi said that no words could adequately explain the experience of mystical union. Yet his words are inspiring signposts which point towards the divine. In his poetry Rumi frequently uses imagery which may be unexpected. For example although Islam forbids alcohol, he often describes the sensation of being ‘drunk and intoxicated with ecstasy for his beloved.” Here drunk implies the bliss of the divine consciousness. Love is a frequent subject of Rumi’s poems, descriptions of seeming romantic love is an illusion to the all encompassing pure, divine love.</Msg><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1348151154955</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 10:25:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348151315881-22</Id><Title>GOOG FB GRPN all moving back up this morning</Title><Msg>in my opinion.</Msg><Username>wworld933</Username><Timestamp>1348151315881</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 10:28:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348151609273-23</Id><Topic><Title>From Shams, who transformed Rumi from a learned religious teacher into the world’s greatest poet of mystical love</Title><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1348146529548</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 09:08:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Universe What if someone said to an embryo in the womb, ‘Outside of your world of black nothing is a miraculously ordered universe; a vast Earth covered with tasty food; mountains, oceans and plains, fragrant orchards and fields full of crops; a luminous sky beyond your reach, with a sun, moonbeams, and uncountable stars; and there are winds from south, north and west, and gardens replete with sweet flowers like a banquet at a wedding feast.

The 13th Century was the era of the crusades; also the area where Rumi lived was under constant threat of Mongol invasion.

Jalal al-Din who is also known as Rumi, was a philosopher and mystic of Islam. His doctrine advocates unlimited tolerance, positive reasoning, goodness, charity and awareness through love. To him and to his disciples all religions are more or less truth. Looking with the same eye on Muslim, Jew and Christian alike, his peaceful and tolerant teaching has appealed to people of all sects and creeds. According to Professor Majid M. Naini,[66] "Rumi's life and transformation provide true testimony and proof that people of all religions and backgrounds can live together in peace and harmony. Rumi’s visions, words, and life teach us how to reach inner peace and happiness so we can finally stop the continual stream of hostility and hatred and achieve true global peace and harmony.”</Msg><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1348166769388</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 14:46:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348166775048-52</Id><Title>New High</Title><Msg>New high for google</Msg><Username>ro28292003</Username><Timestamp>1348166775048</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 14:46:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348166955884-53</Id><Topic><Title>740</Title><Username>wingofeaglets</Username><Timestamp>1348165962815</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 14:32:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Correct!

This is a pure search sector play with serious legs, and fast. The Google of Mobile Apps Search. SeekingAlpha; 9/12/12 Mimvi (MIMV.OB) has been called the "Google of mobile search platforms." Its search engine has become a leading platform for providing search services for Mobile Apps, Mobile Content, and Mobile Products across all platforms including iPhone, Android, Blackberry, and Windows devices. Mimvi offers Amazon-like recommendations under each search result it presents. Mimvi's recent acquisition of Lone Wolf Inc. and its Smash Networks (which claims to have an online community of 79 million) are expected to extend the company's reach into social networks and change how mobile apps are marketed.
