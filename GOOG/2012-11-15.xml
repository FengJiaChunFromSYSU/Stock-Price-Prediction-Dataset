Just 5% From BEAR MARKET Territory</Title><Msg>Governments increasing requests for user data from Google By Ken Hanly Nov 13, 2012 in Technology Mountain View - Google has revealed that requests by governments for data on users is increasing. In the first six months of 2012, there were 20,938 requests for information on users. Google has published Transparency Reports since 2010. The most recent report shows that government surveillance is on the rise. Senior Google policy analyst Dorothy Chou writes: “In the first half of 2012, there were 20,938 inquiries from government entities around the world. Those requests were for information about 34,614 accounts.” In the first half of last year there were less than 16,000 requests. The United States made by far the most user data requests The U.S. government also had the highest rate of compliance with 90 per cent of its requests being carried out by Google. The U.S. government also requested that seven You Tube videos be removed for criticizing local and state government agencies, police or public officials. Google refused to comply with these requests. The number of requests for user data has risen continually from a low of 12,539 requests in 2009 July through December, to the present high of 20,938 in the first half of this year. However, the lowest number of requests for removal was just last year in January to June at 949, but the first half of this year, the requests almost doubled to 1791. There is a breakdown of requests for user data by country. The U.S. has by far the highest number of requests but also has by far the highest number of user accounts involved. It also has the highest success rate in getting Google to comply. The U.S. made 7,969 requests for user data in the first half of this year. Compliance was 90% and the requests involved 16,281 individual accounts. Total requests for this period were 20,938 well over one quarter of the requests were from the U.S. alone, and with respect to accounts, the U.S. requests were well over 40% of the total account requests. In comparison, Russia made 58 requests with 0 compliance by Google on 58 accounts. Turkey made 118 requests with 0 compliance on 120 accounts. Even Canada had poor compliance at just 24% on 50 requests on 50 accounts. Israel did a bit better with 60% compliance on 55 requests involving 55 accounts. There was an increase in requests for material to be removed as well. In the first half of 2012, there were 1791 requests for removal of material. Many of the requests had defamation as the reason for removal. The U.S. asked for many of the removals, 273 in total. The compliance rate was much lower than for requests for user data. Less than half 45% of the requests were acted upon. Canada had a better compliance rate of 58% on just 33 requests. The number of items removed cannot simply be correlated to the number of requests, as some requests are for removal of multiple items.</Msg><Username>ametrosixual</Username><Timestamp>1352985774140</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 08:22:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352987257737-2</Id><Title>Google Nexus 4 "NOT PROFITABLE" Says Analyst</Title><Msg>Google Nexus 4 maker LG identified by analyst as ‘not profitable’ An interesting report from Business Insider reveals that only three mobile phone manufactures have made profits from their third quarter sales. LG, Google’s partner of choice for their latest Android flagship smartphone, the Google Nexus 4, was unfortunately not one of them. According to the report, analyst Horace Dediu shared this interesting tweet: “Apple’s share of operating profits from global mobile phones dropped to 60% in Q3. Samsung now at 39%. HTC 1%. No other companies profitable.” The news is not really that surprising considering that it’s quite obvious that these are the three companies dominating the smartphone scene. Apple has just been killing it ever since they released the iPhone and with the recent launch of the iPhone 5 plus their excellent margins on phone and accessories sales, it was more or less expected that they would be on top. Samsung, currently at 39%, is quickly catching up thanks to well received products such as the Samsung Galaxy S3 and the Galaxy Note 2. HTC is still struggling with their footing and barely gets a piece of the profit pie at 1%. The biggest news, however, is that other well-known phone manufactures such as LG and Motorola are losing money on their smartphone efforts. Under this light, it makes perfect sense why Google decided to partner with LG this time for the Google Nexus 4. It might be their way of trying to stimulate sales and growth for their Android partners other than Samsung. The plan, if successful, could also help them even get more of the market share and completely overtake iOS. Maybe this also means that we’ll be seeing that long rumored Motorola-created Google flagship smartphone by next year as the successor to the Google Nexus 4. Do you think the Google Nexus 4 will be enough to pull LG out of the red? Does a Motorola-developed Google smartphone (Google Nexus Razr, perhaps?) appeal to you?

With Android representing 75% of all mobile shipments shipped last quarter, I would say that Google's bet in Android could generate much higher revenues in the future. 2) Another Fact people tend to forget about Google is its ownership in YouTube, which is another area where Google can monetize through ads. 3) With the U.S. market for internet search still going gung-ho as the search business grew by 11 per cent since last December, I believe that Google fever is here to stay.</Msg><Username>cris.chest</Username><Timestamp>1352989055302</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 09:17:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352992097255-5</Id><Title>3%+ Oversold Bounce Coming...</Title><Msg>Time to buy some ITM &amp; NTM calls.</Msg><Username>margincalll</Username><Timestamp>1352992097255</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 10:08:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352993285620-6</Id><Title>Watch CAT CMI DE JOY</Title><Msg>great long term investments</Msg><Username>jgiled</Username><Timestamp>1352993285620</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 10:28:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352993445902-7</Id><Topic><Title>@@@ GOOG Featured on SQUAWK BOX @@@</Title><Username>neckanderson</Username><Timestamp>1350579474131</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 12:57:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks</Msg><Username>jacobthompsons</Username><Timestamp>1352993445902</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 10:30:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352994419251-8</Id><Topic><Title>Quick Sell</Title><Username>cindyheutmaker316</Username><Timestamp>1307725924000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2011-06-10 13:12:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good job.</Msg><Username>sarahsmithm268</Username><Timestamp>1352994419251</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 10:46:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352996592296-9</Id><Title>GOOGLE</Title><Msg>G GLE G {} {} GLE G () () GLE is down another 1.3 BI$$ION TODAY.

Jobs #s were horrible today! What happened? I thought Obama said things were getting better, but instead he blames it on Sandy. Hmm, how does bad weather in NY and NJ translate into spiking jobless claims in OH and PA? Sounds like the media just providing cover for the continuation (post election) of the abysmal Obama economy. Anyhow, I guess Bush will be relieved to know this time it wasn't his fault.</Msg><Username>funnimone67</Username><Timestamp>1353018253374</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 17:24:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353031581763-20</Id><Topic><Title>legal problems?</Title><Username>davidwoo818</Username><Timestamp>1350594920075</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 17:15:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes, I agree.
