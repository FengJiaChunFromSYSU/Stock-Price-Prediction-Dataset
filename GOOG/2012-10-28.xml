I will admit that we have heard the political pundits make that same statement in the last half dozen election but the truth is each election is the most important of our day. We have seen the nation slip to the left little by little for so long believing that America would never fall that we have come to a point where it won't take much time or executive orders to render the American experience finished. I personally have seen this nation go from having the Ten Commandments hanging in our school classrooms to arresting our children who are 'caught' reading the Bible during study hall. But in Minnesota during teachers conferences the teachers will learn how to teach islam! Read about it here. We have ignored the principles that the Founders used to establish this great nation, Christian principles. We have actually made it illegal to teach those principles in our schools. Virtually any reference to our Christian heritage has been deemed illegal. They believed that raising up children on a Christian foundation wars paramount. Proverbs 22:6 “Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.” Our schools were designed to accomodate this. Until the late 1800's the Bible was the main cirriculim. We have seen America slip from number one in education to 26th. Our Founders believed that God's Word contained all wisdom. So do I and when we ignore that proven fact we no longer have wisdom. We only have knowledge and without wisdom we will not know how to use the knowledge. Hosea 4:6 “My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children.” This verse rings all too true today. Noah Webster stated: "In my view, the Christian religion is the most important and one of the first things in which all children, under a free government ought to be instructed...No truth is more evident to my mind than that the Christian religion must be the basis of any government intended to secure the rights and privileges of a free people." Why have we ignored this basic proven principle? Why have we seen this happen? I can only blame one group, pastors. In 1954 when the Johnson Amendment took the church out of the political arena the influence of the church in politics was so severely restricted that it was no longer a viable influence in our government. Some find this inappropriate, the church's involvement in politics, but that concept shows how ignorant so many people are concerning the church's role in the Revolutionary War. I cover this in detail in my book Defining America's Excetionalism. It was the pastors that built the fire in the hearts of the people for complete freedom from England and it was the pastors that helped develop the types of governments each colony had. They not only wrote most of the Charters but were the ones who enforced them. The church and pastors in particular were of the utmost importance during the Revolutionary war. Today’s so-called historians want us to think that the church had no influence at all on the people or the government, but that could not be farther from the truth. The pastors were effective from both sides of the pulpit. From the backside they would build the people up and provide Biblical guidance with topical sermons, election sermons and even artillery sermons, a discourse on the application of Biblical principles to the military. From the front side of the pulpit you usually found the pastor directing the troops as military leaders and officers. The church has side stepped its responsibility in the political arena. Most pastors value their 501 (c) 3 more than their duty to God and His people. When they had their rights taken away from them they did not fight for their rights that the Founders gave them and now America is the worse for their complacency. Our government today is the biggest violator of our rights and freedoms. We are the people who elected these so-called representatives. They no longer represent the American people but their own ideology. Is this election important? Do you want your children and grand children to have the same opportunities that that you had and that your parents had? Then we have to go back to what made us great. That is not the path that we are on now. The path that we are on now is one of complete dependence on government for everything. We have always been a free and resourceful people. Not a dependent people. We have led the world in innovations and have created massive wealth out of thin air. But we have to be free to be able to do that. Less government regulation. Less taxes for small businesses, the biggest creator of jobs. The only way to get that is to remove the present administration and replace it with men and women who believe in the American way, governing according to the American Constitution, and the American free market system. Remember this when you vote. Will this be our last free election or will it be the election that set America back on track to its greatness.

And the best part is no market makers to hold netflix down like always. It will go absolutely bonkers tomorrow like the dot.coms did in 1999, It is so undervalued down from 300 with 30 million streamers, they are the future that msft will only make better! 120-150 is the rumored offer by msft of course amzn, goog, aapl, will likely bid against them. 4 companies for sure have made it known to netflix that they do indeed plan on bidding in the bidding war! No market makers, while that will be awesome for netflix, could be bad for aapl because with aapl they are constantly caught holding apple up! So if you are long aapl, buy puts or sell half, set super tight stops, of course if it gaps down under your stop when it opens, that is very bad. No market makers bad for goog also as they tend to hold goog and aapl amzn pcln cmg isrg up</Msg><Username>gruen7</Username><Timestamp>1351477226417</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 22:20:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351482359004-12</Id><Title>Whatever happened to the proposed Google Split?</Title><Msg>Early this year Google announced splitting of their shares into Google A and Google B shares.
