"Before a company can book a single penny in profit it needs a product to sell. Yet in today’s fiercely competitive global economy, before a company can produce something to sell, it needs to patent the idea. Otherwise, it’s too easy for competitors to knock off the product and steal market share. In other words, being first to market is no longer enough of a competitive advantage. Companies need to be first to market and have patents protecting their products to ensure sales and profit longevity. Groupon (Nasdaq: GRPN) and Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) serve as good examples of this new paradigm at work. As you’re well aware, Groupon invented the daily deals market in 2008. All it took was a novel idea to connect consumers and businesses in a new way – via coupons over email. But guess what? Groupon didn’t have even one patent protecting its novel business model. And within four years, over 300 competitors emerged. Now, Groupon doesn’t stand a chance to keep booking higher profits, let alone survive. Contrast Groupon’s experience with the details behind the meteoric rise of Apple and you’ll definitely get the connection between patent filings and stock price performance. We can all agree that Apple took the world by storm with its iPhone launch in June 2007. Before it sold a single one, though, it secured as many patents as possible. And it continued to do the same thing on every next generation device."

In other words, being first to market is no longer enough of a competitive advantage. Companies need to be first to market and have patents protecting their products to ensure sales and profit longevity. An example is the last new product of Local Corp backed through a product of Local Corp: Local Corporation Debuts Lead Gen Effort December 6, 2012 Irvine-based Local Corporation has launched a new, local lead generation site today, called Insurancelow.net, which it says is the first in a series of lead generation websites being launched by the company. The new site offers a car insurance guide and details on choosing car insurance carriers. Local Corporation said it expects the lead generation sites to offer educational articles and opportunity to receive quotes from industry professionals. The firm said it believes the launch of the lead gen sites would help it monetize the 30M consumers it reaches each month.</Msg><Username>flankenking</Username><Timestamp>1357077714289</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-01 17:01:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357078306376-5</Id><Topic><Title>Targeting is the MAGIC WORD of Mobile Search</Title><Username>flankenking</Username><Timestamp>1355006725439</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-08 17:45:25 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>InsuranceLow.n.. is a car insurance site that has a nation-wide directory of providers ready to help you today!
