Did you follow the evidence in the case? It was as clear as day. And America shows no partiality to national companies (as Korea and most Asian countries do); quite the contrary. Samsung has done this to us, not Apple and not the courts. We'll be lucky if don't lose $50/share. Many of us have seen this coming for months, hoping it would just go away. But it won't now. Unfortunately, the Galaxy may. I think we're screwed.

Also note that in many other countries apple didnt win outright... they were found to have violated patents as well and have to stop selling products. This just pertains to the US ... globablly Samsung will flourish as will the operating system of android. Apple NEEDS samsung to provide so many important parts to create the iphone. And yes Apple is a major buyer of Samsung parts... Samsung can just screw apple and not sell them the parts or raise the prices of those parts to stick it to apple.... There are many parts to this story.... and a US patent victory is just a small part.... Google will be at a 1000 a share before apple.... because android doesnt make a cent on its android operating system... and when the adjustments are made and more android products will me sold.. and apple without steve jobs has already been having its issues.... Look at whats happening with their stores. and what NEW products have come out since his death? Just newer versions of older products. eventually Android will surpass apples operating system... since they dont have the leadership to innovate anymore... Apple is going on the defensive instead of doing what they do best and inovating ....</Msg><Username>chillen2307</Username><Timestamp>1345922418621</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 15:20:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345922924564-34</Id><Title>Oh by the way this is your attorney representing you against Vringo</Title><Msg>Quinn Emanuel Urquhart &amp; sullival LLP.</Msg><Username>ran.dog80</Username><Timestamp>1345922924564</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 15:28:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345925083921-35</Id><Title>Look him up and read the article displayed below...</Title><Msg>Apple win lawsuit against Samsung!</Msg><Username>ran.dog80</Username><Timestamp>1345925083921</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 16:04:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345928835486-36</Id><Title>i want to get in GOOGLE should I be worried about VRNG law suit?</Title><Msg>not soft bashing, serious quetion, id like to get my self in on google but should i be worried about the VRNG lawsuit?</Msg><Username>thewallstreetkid1985</Username><Timestamp>1345928835486</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 17:07:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345931250337-37</Id><Topic><Title>i want to get in GOOGLE should I be worried about VRNG law suit?</Title><Username>thewallstreetkid1985</Username><Timestamp>1345928835486</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 17:07:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes, you should be worried about this lawsuit.

Vringo claims Google and others are infringing on patents it acquired, which claim a legal monopoly over a wide range of ideas in search engine filtering and advertisements. The specifics of the lawsuit are not directly applicable to "Vringo v. Google". However, the experience of a non-expert jury handing out a lot of money for a debatable patent is a reminder to our collective consciousness of the vulnerability that companies like Google face. A jury can hear a story of an official-sounding patent, and take the conclusion of intellectual property as self-evident. A technically illiterate jury will be asked to make a decision about a technical issue, and will naturally fall back upon non-technical assumptions. The jury may immediately and intractably visualize Google as a squatter who set up a shop on Vringo's "property" and rented it out to a bunch of companies.</Msg><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1345948813354</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 22:40:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345948970490-65</Id><Topic><Title>Why Google Might Be Going To $0</Title><Username>whatdoiknow_2000</Username><Timestamp>1334252683000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-04-12 13:44:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This is actually what happened to ON2 and its shareholders: "The jury may immediately and intractably visualize Google as a squatter who set up a shop on Vringo's "property" and rented it out to a bunch of companies."</Msg><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1345948970490</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 22:42:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345951291984-66</Id><Topic><Title>Google made a fatal mistake: They betrayed Steve Jobs.</Title><Username>musichead2005</Username><Timestamp>1345944464428</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 21:27:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I have both GOOG and AAPL.
