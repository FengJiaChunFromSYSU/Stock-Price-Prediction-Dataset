Michael O'Hare and Chris Hieb were M&amp;A from Hambrecht to lead and handle this deal. -In April 2007, they moved O'Hare and Hieb to Oppenheimer to complete the deal and split the money received from ON2 between Hambrecht and Oppenheimer. -On May 21 and 22 2007 these happened: ---Hambreched tried to convince Tim Armstron to create a league, which was being created under the name of UFL with Hambrecht, Armstrong and Paul Pelosi became the owner and Mark Cuban became one of the major investors at some point. ---ON2 announced acquiring Hanreo from Finland ---Two repoters from Financial in UK reported RUMOR about "Adobe taking over ON2". This seem to be ploy to hide the real relations of major players. -In june 2007 ON2 CTO, Eric Ameres resigned and left the company after 13.5 years and then ON2 created two CTOs, Jim Bankoski for ON2 USA and Paul Wilkin for Finland Oy or "ON2 Finland Oy" as they called Hantro -In June 13, 2007, Google trademarked ON2 logo -While at Oppenheimer, O'Hare completed ON2 acquisition of Hantro on November 1, 2007 -In 2007 ON2 CEO, Bill Joll, FALSIFIED ON2 financial reports -On April 2, 2008 Google trademarked ON2's Hantro logo -On August 5, 2009, ON2 and Google announced "fraudulent "merger" -In Agust 2009, several ON2 shareholders lawsuits were filed against ON2 BOD and Google. - In September 2009, Youtube International Communication Exec and also few other Youtube Execs and Google China President left Google. I believe they might be able to help FBI, DOJ, FTC, SEC, or any USA, Chinese, Europe investigation agencies looking into ON2 case in the USA and China and Europe. - In Feb 2010, they completed ON2 and Google "merger" -In October 2012, UFL ceased all of its operation IMMEDIATELY and left its starting the operation to UNKNOW date in the future? -On november 12, 2012, Google TERMINATED Hantro Trademark -On November 21, 2012 Google subsidiery in Nethearland announced Google "funneling profits from overseas subsidiaries into Bermuda" --??? This is what Veringo councel need to INVESTIGATE to see how much of their money are nOT accounted for and "funneled" through Google subsidieris to different account. ==================== "Load the ship and set out.
