Look at RENN, a brilliant CEO who went to Yale and his company is 9 companies in 1, one is better then groupon, the other better then znga, the other has faster growth and a brighter future then facebook with 5 billion newbies coming online in China right in the agegroup RENN has locked up with its social network, 11-29 But even after doing every single thing right, CHEN made one mistake so huge it trumped everything positive he has done the last 2 years. It does not matter that he recently added the richest man in the entire country of China to his board of directors! Does not matter the Triad mafia is rumored to want to run renn to 50, 30 in Oct alone. Chen has had all his buddies hold off buying till he is done with the buyback. Well he is done but the huge mistake Master Chen made in all his brilliance, he listed or was talked into listing a China ADR on the NYSE, notwithstanding that no China stock has ever had a bright future or run way up on the NYSE, but many have on the Nasdaq! As smart as he is Master Chen if he left this decision up to an employee under him and that person was stupid enough to think they would get the same odds of the future of the stock price as they would get on the Nasdaq,nope. You see on the NYSE, a real short squeeze gets halted where the crooked specialist lets all his friends cover before the stock goes higher, thus cutting the tremendous force pushing up by 4/5ths or 80% Also the specialist does what Goldman wants on the NYSE, this is illegall but Goldman placed their own guy as the CEO of the crooked subpar exchange NYSE. This means if the stock can withstand trading at 25,with not many sellers or buyers, 25 is where RENN wants to trade. One big guy can say I want 5 million shares or 10 million at 4 dollars and the specialist can force it right to 4 in a week or two. He can also keep it at 4 for as long as he wants and the only way he will move it is a massive force because he wants all the retail traders to sell so he can buy and then sell those same shares at 100 a share 6 months or a year, year in a half down the road. Also citi has a giant position to cover, the Triads and the Billionaire who has openly said he will not be happy as a shareholder until RENN has a minimum of a 100 Billion dollar market cap, they will help Citi to cover that position but the specialist in RENN is so buddy buddy he will make it as easy as he can on CITI, even if it means dumping all the shares he has greedily accumulated the last 2 years straight, chart is straight down with severe manipulation! If the FED was to pop RENN and DANG to 50 or 100 that would seriously stimulate the economy because dang 35 to 5 and RENN 28 to 4 are so tight, both with crooked specialists!

By casp321 1 year 8 months ago ----Ms. Naimollah’s relationship with Covington would not preclude a finding that she is independent under the rules of the NYSE Amex, the SEC or the Audit Committee of the On2 board of directors, On April 2, 2009, the On2 board of directors met to discuss, among other things, Google’s oral indication of interest in a potential business combination. Early in the meeting, the On2 board of directors was made aware that one of its directors, Ms. Naimollah, had an arrangement with Covington under which Covington agreed to supervise the broker-dealer activities of Ms. Naimollah. Although it was concluded, after consultation with counsel, that Ms. Naimollah’s relationship with Covington should be viewed as that of an independent contractor and that Ms. Naimollah’s relationship with Covington would not preclude a finding that she is independent under the rules of the NYSE Amex, the SEC or the Audit Committee of the On2 board of directors, and that as such Ms. Naimollah’s recusal would not be necessary given the limited nature of the relationship, Ms. Naimollah volunteered to recuse herself from, among other things, Covington-related matters and to abstain from any voting regarding the engagement of Covington by On2 and any voting relating to a potential business combination transaction involving On2 and Google. Following discussion, the On2 board of directors accepted Ms. Naimollah’s abstention/recusal proposal. ------ The question I have is: Is there still a company named ON@ LLC, instead of ON2 Technologies Inc. as I was one of its investors in 2009???

Another article noted that while Apple’s iPhone 5 sales topped 5 million, it still missed some estimates. “The set-up is just too much for people and given the huge rally in the stock, it makes all the sense in the world for Apple to go down,” Cramer said. “Who can live up to either data point? It’s nuts!” Few seem to care about the expectations for Google, however, Cramer said. In turn, the Internet search giant has been able to enjoy a “stealth rally.” “Given that Apple’s up more than 60 percent this year while Google’s only up about the same amount as the S&amp;P 500, you can feel much more comfortable about owning GOOG knowing that you won’t be giving up big 2012 gains if the market turns down,” Cramer said. “It just doesn’t have much of them.” To Cramer, there are several factors that make Google easier to buy than Apple at current levels. “Apple’s still affiliated with a founder who is not alive," Cramer said, referring to Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, who died in October 2011 after a long battle with a form of pancreatic cancer. "Therefore, we know at a certain point the drawing board of a founder who isn’t with us will end. Has it already? We don’t know. “But Google’s different," Cramer continued. “Google is a machine — it isn’t a man — and it isn’t beholden to any one person.” Meanwhile, Cramer noted Apple seems to only be one step ahead of rival Samsung while Google is blowing its competition away. Whether it’s Facebook, Microsoft or Yahoo , Cramer said nobody can beat Google at internet search. Cramer had also worried that Google overpaid in its $12.5 billion acquisition of Motorola Mobility, but research from Mark Mahaney at Citigroup suggests Google got its money worth. Finally, Cramer had long thought Apple would engage in the cloud computing and social media space. It’s failed to do so, though, while Cramer noted Google has done a terrific job at social. So what’s the bottom line? While Cramer said he’s not backing away from Apple as an investment, he thinks Google is currently a better investment because it’s a cheaper and better stock to own overall. And judging from recent market reaction, it seems the Street agrees with Cramer as well.</Msg><Username>margincalll</Username><Timestamp>1348574751109</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-25 08:05:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348575013390-28</Id><Title>This BABY is.....</Title><Msg>climbing and climbing.....so so strong...it rep[orts shortly in a few weeks.....so even with a strong earning report will it still climb towards $800 or sell off????..any thoughts???</Msg><Username>h08859</Username><Timestamp>1348575013390</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-25 08:10:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348575706371-29</Id><Title>22% switching to IPhones</Title><Msg>Owners dropping Andriod for Iphones.

Not Quite Busy-Beaver Google Sees Stock Near Multi-Year High He cites diminished risks associated with the Motorola MSI -1.31% deal. Specifically, the Internet giant has streamlined Motorola’s operations by laying off about 4,000 employees and closed about 1/3 of the global offices. Google may also be looking to sell its Motorola Home segment, which Mahaney says would be a positive development. “With hindsight – and given all the recent focus on patent protection and smartphone innovation – this makes the Google/Motorola deal appear considerably less aggressive/risky than first perceived,” Mahaney says. He also cites less concerns about search competition. Mahaney says there was “heightened concern” one year ago that the integration of Bing and Facebook cou FB -9.96%ld create a major disruption to Google’s core search engine. One year later, it’s not much of a worry. “Our read is that Facebook has something in mind that would be quite different than the core search service Google currently offers,” Mahaney says. “Frankly, we believe that the possibility of someone generating a truly competitive search offering to Google has gotten remoter with each passing year.” Facebook shares recently fell 9.5% to $20.70 Microsoft MSFT -1.33% is off 1.4% to $30.74. There’s also some concern that Apple’s voice-search product — Siri — could dampen Google searches done on mobile phones. But at least in the short term, this isn’t much of a concern. “At the margin, we remain skeptical that Facebook and Apple’s initiatives dramatically raise the competitive risk to Google’s core and future businesses,” Mahaney says. “The amount of resources and skill required to really succeed in Search are very significant, as Yahoo YHOO +1.66% and Bing’s limited results to date demonstrate. But this will obviously be a key area to monitor.” Apple shares recently fell 1.9% to $686.80 after iPhone 5 sales over the weekend fell shy of Wall Street’s expectations.</Msg><Username>ametrosixual</Username><Timestamp>1348578950460</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-25 09:15:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348579306924-42</Id><Title>Google Inc. transient 753.30 BUY NOW ..</Title><Msg>Few economist and market analysts reports indicated to some hopeful news on the Google Inc. front.

Search ad spending will grow around 20 percent in the third quarter, Mahaney said. Product listing advertisements, which add price, images and other information, will host revenue as well, he said. And the company is making a new effort to monetize Google Maps, launching new features both for users and advertisers. Meanwhile, Google has streamlined operations at Motorola, eliminating 4,000 employees and closing a third of its 94 offices worldwide. It also is reportedly looking to sell Motorola Home, which makes set-top cable boxes, for as much as $3 billion -- which would make the net cost to Google of the purchase around $6 billion. Given that the move brought Google more than 17,000 patents in the middle of an intellectual property war with its rivals, the purchase is less risky than it first appeared, the report argues. As for competition? Mahaney says search is getting less competitive over time, not more. The integration of Bing and Facebook has yet to put a significant dent in Google's market share, and Facebook's own search ambitions are unlikely to compete with Google directly, he wrote. There are still threats looming on the horizon for Google -- regulatory issues, building ads for mobile products and integrating Motorola, to name three. But for now Google investors are sitting pretty -- and it looks their position still has plenty of room for improvement.</Msg><Username>ametrosixual</Username><Timestamp>1348580661976</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-25 09:44:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348580781639-47</Id><Title>Going to break 760+ on a pop today</Title><Msg>..........</Msg><Username>riskreversal777</Username><Timestamp>1348580781639</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-25 09:46:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348580892264-48</Id><Title>GOOG low $800 is in the books</Title><Msg>Going higher</Msg><Username>jgiled</Username><Timestamp>1348580892264</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-25 09:48:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348581123088-49</Id><Topic><Title>all wall st does is pump apple and google just like 4 horseman before the crash</Title><Username>notoriousbono</Username><Timestamp>1348580634389</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-25 09:43:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Eh...aren't they setting new ATH every day?

Check Secord, Hakim, Ghorbanifar, Buckley, Kangarlou, Mousai's records, them you'd NOTICE that all are getting order from the SAME "BakerHouse" producing kosher or halal, depending who will consume the product?? : Judge refuses to demand YouTube remove anti-Islam film in actress's lawsuit By Alex Dobuzinskis Posted: 09/20/2012 Last week, Google rejected a request by the White House to reconsider its decision to keep the clips on YouTube, but the company has blocked the trailer in certain Muslim countries such as Egypt and Libya. The White House had asked Google to evaluate whether the video violated YouTube's terms of service. On Thursday, Garcia sat in court wearing a red blouse and black skirt. At one point she raised her hand to speak when the judge pointed out the actress has appeared in the media since the film, despite making a claim to invasion of privacy. Garcia was not allowed to address the court. Her attorney, Cris Armenta, sought to persuade the judge that Garcia, who is from Bakersfield, California, suffered harm similar to a person whose privacy is violated in the unauthorized release of a sex tape. "This has to do with somebody who did not consent to a certain product, and yet it was put out there," Armenta said.</Msg><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1348583126498</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-25 10:25:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348583414281-57</Id><Title>out @ 760 .

I understand it this much at this time: I do NOT trust Vringo's previous or current CEO, but I do trust those two counsels working against Google on Vringo side. I'm not sure if those Vringo CEO intention was to "merge" with Lang's patent, bringing them to "slaugghterhouse" inside Vringo, to KILL for Google to throw the case out of court or that was for the benefit of shareholders. Having mole inside of a company does NOT mean that all are the same. I'll just summarize those, who were involved in ON2 case directly or indirectly, that are also involved with Vringo case, to bring their UNDERGROUND operations to you attention, or who ever in the legal system might be interested in searching for the truth to serve the JUTICE. Vringo's purchase of Mokia 500 hundreds patents and INTRODUCING about 10 million VRNG shares were supposedly to DILUTE Mark Cuban percentage of the shares and I assume he was NOT one of those three or so who purchased those ten million shares for obvious reasons. That would COMPLICATE any hostile takeover by Google or any of its clients.

Google faces Israeli lawsuit over controversial Prophet Muhammad video Analysts say Google is in a tight spot as YouTube video continues to prompt unrest, violence Sharon Gaudin (Computerworld (US)) 19 September, 2012 Arab-Israeli lawmakers and religious leaders Wednesday asked the Jerusalem District Court to force Google to take a controversial video off of YouTube. The petition also asks that all access to the video be blocked in Israel, according to a report in The Jerusalem Post. The video in question, a movie trailer that mocks the Prophet Muhammad, has prompted violent outbursts and protests at U.S. embassies and consulates Egypt, Yemen, Sudan, Libya, Indonesia, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, among other countries. The movie reportedly was filmed in the United States. It remains unclear who made it. Taleb a-Sana, an Israeli politician and member of the parliament, joined with religious leader to file the petition with the court, according to reports. The petition is said to contend that the video offends Muslims and incites racism.</Msg><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1348589277559</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-25 12:07:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348589301194-90</Id><Topic><Title>GOOG longs have made a great profit!

There were a lot between going on and too many companies, countries, institutionals had invo;lved to hide the scam from ON2 shareholders and their friends at hedge funds were able to Short and keep ON2 PPS under $0.40 based on inside information. But I do NOT think that is true in VRNG case, no matter who is who: I think Lang would've been happy to handle this on his own but it did not happen for 14+ years and it will not happen to just benefit him in the future either. He is part of the whole now, but in ON2 case ON2's two CTOs were part of the hole not whole, that make the difference: Re: WHY IS On2 Technologies BEGGING you to vote YES ?

These young twerps have no idea how fast things can turn. GOOG as well as AAPL are the best stocks out there. With AAPL the change in price for the last few trading days ARETHE NORM. Consoladation is the name of the game. Very healthy move for AAPL. GOOG may do the same like today. But the market was down big time and GOOG held it's own. This is also a very possitive ending for GOOG today.</Msg><Username>laylow1991</Username><Timestamp>1348620603828</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-25 20:50:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348620802429-207</Id><Topic><Title>Happy I sold at 763 today!</Title><Username>ja_artist</Username><Timestamp>1348611533166</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-25 18:18:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes a correction is due.
