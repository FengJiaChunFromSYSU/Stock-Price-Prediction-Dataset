Surely Romney cannot bring this out since he’s a politician running for office and must mind his P’s and Q’s to not appear offensive but facts and facts. Now all the union folks can go to Obamacare for their healthcare again off taxpayers backs. Romney openly stated such belongs with states under the 10th Amendment and not the Fed. Let’s let Jennifer Granholm and the other Michigan dem politicians fix the mess their policies created and let our taxpayer dollars go more toward the efforts of our own states.</Msg><Username>obamadungdufus</Username><Timestamp>1349346257550</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 06:24:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349348176960-12</Id><Topic><Title>mark cuban bought lots of VRNG: Hedge against Google losing big time - regular shareholders should buy as a hedge too.</Title><Username>contezta</Username><Timestamp>1349296887823</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 16:41:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He also bought a lot of Facebook at $32.

For the survey, 430 adult Americans were interviewed by telephone after the end of the debate. The poll does not and cannot reflect the views of all Americans. It only represents the views of people who watched the event. The poll has a sampling error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points. Many Democrats/Supporters like Bill Maher, Lawrence O'Donnell, and Kirsten Powers are all conceding the huge defeat. DENVER — Barack Obama without Teleprompter Wiped by Governor Mitt Romney Republican Mitt Romney delivered a strong performance in his first presidential debate, putting a more passive Barack Obama on the back foot as he reignited hope for his flagging campaign. Needing a good showing to turn around poor poll numbers, the former Massachusetts governor went on the offensive Wednesday, hammering the president for economic policies he said had “crushed” America’s middle class. Romney played the aggressor throughout the 90-minute encounter and appeared far more at ease in the cut-and-thrust of the debate format, which left Obama seeming at times nervous and irritated, at others under-prepared. Obama did jump on Romney’s lack of specifics as the rivals clashed on taxes and health care reform, but the president stuttered through several of his more detailed answers, while his Republican opponent was crisper and clearer. “The president has a view very similar to the view he had when he ran four years ago: that a bigger government, spending more, taxing more, regulating more—if you will trickle-down government—would work,” Romney said. “That’s not the right answer for America. I’ll restore the vitality that gets America working again,” he vowed. “Middle-income families are being crushed, and the question is, how to get them going again.” Obama hit back by suggesting Romney would bring $5.4 trillion in tax cuts geared toward the wealthy, and said his Republican foe hadn’t been clear on which tax loopholes he would close in order to maintain revenue. “Governor Romney has a perspective that says if we cut taxes skewed toward the wealthy and cut back regulations, we’ll be better off. I have a different view,” the Democratic incumbent said, calling for “economic patriotism.” Romney challenged Obama’s claims as the tax issue sparked what proved the fiercest clashes in a mainly low-key televised debate watched live by tens of millions of Americans.</Msg><Username>black_voting_4_romney</Username><Timestamp>1349389262573</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 18:21:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>38</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349391304153-78</Id><Topic><Title>Mitt Romney Wins Debate (67% Romney vs.Teleprompter Obama 27%) Wow!!!</Title><Username>black_voting_4_romney</Username><Timestamp>1349389262573</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 18:21:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>“Virtually everything he said about my tax plan is inaccurate,” Romney said. “If the tax plan he described were a tax plan I was asked to support, I would say absolutely not.” Obama clings to a narrow lead in his bid to defy the omens of a stubbornly sluggish economic recovery and to become only the second Democrat since World War II to win a second term. Romney, down in almost all the key battleground states that will decide who gets the 270 electoral votes needed to win on Nov 6, sought a sharp change of momentum. “I don’t think there’s any doubt that Romney won,” Terry Madonna, director of the Center for Politics and Public Affairs at Franklin and Marshall College, told AFP. “He was more aggressive without being pugnacious or provocative or combative. The president seemed a bit flat. He seemed, I wouldn’t say annoyed at times, but almost disconnected, almost not comfortable.” The Romney campaign hailed a clear win for their man. “If this was a boxing match, it would have been called an hour into the fight,” said top political adviser Eric Fehrnstrom. “Governor Romney is a very eager and willing candidate on the attack,” Obama strategist David Axelrod wryly conceded. Social networks lit up during the prime time debate, with Twitter declaring it “the most tweeted about event in U.S. political history.” Despite the unrest in the Middle East, this debate focused strictly on economic issues. Foreign policy gets its turn in the final of the three presidential debates at the end of the month. Romney, a multi-millionaire former venture capitalist, was expected to come under scrutiny over his complex offshore tax arrangements, which Democrats have highlighted to press the case that he is indifferent to middle class struggles. But Obama did not mention these, nor Bain Capital, the controversial Boston firm that Romney co-founded on his way to amassing his vast wealth, nor the most obvious of recent slip-ups by his gaffe-plagued opponent. The 65-year-old Romney badly needed to reset the election narrative after a video emerged of him branding 47% of Americans as people who pay no income taxes and see themselves as “victims” who depend on government handouts. The 51-year-old president was marking his 20th wedding anniversary on Wednesday and began the debate with a shout-out to First Lady Michelle Obama, apologizing for the unromantic setting.</Msg><Username>black_voting_4_romney</Username><Timestamp>1349391304153</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 18:55:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349391394434-79</Id><Topic><Title>Mitt Romney Wins Debate (67% Romney vs.Teleprompter Obama 27%) Wow!!!</Title><Username>black_voting_4_romney</Username><Timestamp>1349389262573</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 18:21:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>“Congratulations to you, Mr President, on your anniversary. I’m sure this is the most romantic place you could imagine, here with me,” Romney joked in a rare moment of levity as the duel began. Summing up, Romney said a re-elected Obama would usher in an era of falling household incomes and chronic joblessness. “If the president were to be re-elected, you’ll continue to see a middle class squeeze,” he said. “You’ll see chronic unemployment. We’ve had 43 straight months with unemployment above eight percent.” Obama, who attacked Romney for having no plans—except for the Republican policies that he said had got the country into trouble in the first place—said he had lived up to his promises and asked US voters for another term. “Four years ago, I said that I’m not a perfect man, and I wouldn’t be a perfect president, and that’s probably a promise Governor Romney probably thinks I’ve kept,” he said. “I also promised I would fight every single day on behalf of the American people, the middle class and all of those striving. I’ve kept that promise, and if you will vote for me, then I promise I’ll fight as hard in a second term.” Several national polls released before the debate showed a tight race, with Obama ahead by a few points. Polls of the key swing states that will decide the election give the president a clearer advantage.</Msg><Username>black_voting_4_romney</Username><Timestamp>1349391394434</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 18:56:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349392208666-80</Id><Topic><Title>googOlu Breaking News: Millions of Bombs Dumped in Gulf of Mexico Threaten Oil Rigs</Title><Username>erectionpiggy</Username><Timestamp>1349129921344</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 18:18:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>OBAMA IS ONE SCARY PRESIDENT, without his TelePrompTer Obama is a weak with nothing butt stupid talk talk talk.

Orders both parties to discuss out of court settlement before Judge on the 9th at 10:30am. Court trial date set for the 16th. My thoughts are the judge is basically telling Google you have a larger problem if we go to trial. VRINGO stock price and trading volumne seem to mirror the Judge's orders. Stock as high #$%$55 TODAY ON 35 MILLION PLUS TRADING SHARES. Sold half my position at $4.17 with a purchase price of $2.00 then saw it close at $5.30 LOL. Then bought into the Vringo warrants. I like the warrants because I can own (double my position) twice as many warrants as I could the common stock. Does everyone know about the Vringo Warrants, to exercise/purchase the common stock at $5.06 with a 2015 expiration date? Took a warrant position at $1.68 yesterday and they closed at $2.71 today with a intraday high of $3.25. Own the warrant at X price($2.75 for this example),exercise at $5.06 per share. Total cost is your per warrant price of $2.75 plus the $5.06 exercise price =$7.81 per share. If, if, if Vringo is purchased for $15 a share or trades to it...equates to almost a 100% return...or simply sell the warrants at whatever price they graduate up to as the common stock runs up....if if if... it runs up with a buy-out tender or significant cash settlement. Ex: if the stock is at $15 the warrants could be trading at $7.</Msg><Username>harpolerichard</Username><Timestamp>1349399691547</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 21:14:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349402736438-85</Id><Topic><Title>Looks Like GOOG Is On The Verge Of A Massive Up Trend</Title><Username>coxbernardo994</Username><Timestamp>1349368697390</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 12:38:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I was really looking for some great news.

It has nothing to do with pumping. Google is a juggernaut of a stock that goes up because it makes billions of dollars a year and the numbers are only looking better. Why do investors try to short great companies and when they get burned they dont understand what happned? Google is a stock that even at these numbers is CHEAP... so if you shorted back when it was in the 600's... i am hoping you took the loss and relaized that this stock is headed way north of 800 before it ever sees 600s again....
