For example, if you presently own one Oct. ‘12 GOOG $740 strike price call option valued at $19.50 per contract on the day of a 2-for-1 split, you will end up with two Oct. ’12 GOOG $370 strike price call options valued at $9.75 each.</Msg><Username>jothedrummer</Username><Timestamp>1348327038080</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 11:17:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348331968011-3</Id><Title>up every day??????</Title><Msg>A stock could be up every day?

In recently filed court paperwork, it estimates $696M in past damages--a figure that doesn't include past interest or any future royalties, and dwarfs the company's market cap of about $188M. Investment banking firm Maxim Group last month estimated the total potential windfall at around $924M. Shares up 1c at $3.25.

The pre-trial motions are intended to limit disruptions during the course of the trial. I googled up a definition for you, WHAT IS A MOTION IN LIMINE? A motion in limine is a motion “at the threshold” of trial to exclude evidence deemed inadmissible and unfairly prejudicial by the party bringing the motion. [FMC Corp. v. Plaisted &amp; Cos. (1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 1132.] The purpose of a motion in limine is to prevent the jury from hearing matters which are prejudicial, objectionable, irrelevant, or inadmissible. A motion in limine is brought to “avoid the obviously futile attempt to ‘unring the bell’” once highly prejudicial evidence is offered and then stricken at trial.</Msg><Username>stantheass</Username><Timestamp>1348341306716</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 15:15:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348342537705-10</Id><Title>FBI, DOJ should INVESTIGATE Yaho admin activities regarding pulling articles AGAINST VRNG shareholders???</Title><Msg>FBI, DOJ should INVESTIGATE Yaho admin activities regarding pulling articles AGAINST VRNG shareholders???

By casp321 10 days ago Possibly Short, both on VRNG and AOL, are playing mouse and cat with these two stock's shareholders: SCARING VRNG sharerholders by tagging/updating and making Yahoo pull the SAME article four time in few minutes interval while SCARING AOL shareholders of Vringo vs AOL and Google might hurt their investment should they do not "dump" NOW? What their INTENTION from all of these seem to be is pushing VRNG and AOL PPS using different tactics with different "analyists" report on VRNG and AOL Yahoo Financial Messages Board. Why Yahoo admin are NOT reporting those MF's four time repeat, at least once on AOL Board, and the one reported on AOL Board at VRNG board? Re: Re: Re: MF's four repeat on VRNG Yahoo Board and ANOTHER different at AOL?
