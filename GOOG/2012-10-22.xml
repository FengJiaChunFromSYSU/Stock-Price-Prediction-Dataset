Only 6 PE is 30% of sector average......Strong 2013 guidance calls for over 40 % revenue growth and $1/share net income .…..Two Cloud divisions are growing exponentially …Insiders have purchased 5% of company since 2010 and never sold a share. 4 million share float…. In 2010 NTWK went from $8 to $24 in 4 weeks with 50% lower revenue than today.</Title><Msg>Short-term Target: $16 per Upgrade……… Record 1Q 2013 earnings 2 weeks away…….radar this one In 2010 global software provider Netsol Technologies (NASDAQ: NTWK) went from $8 to $24 in a few weeks. Today NTWK is a much stronger company with far more revenue sources including 2 new high-growth high-margin Cloud Divisions. Unlike 2010, NTWK today has the flexibility to deliver products and services not only from Pakistan but also from excellence centers located in Bangkok, Beijing, the US, and the UK. During 2010 (and 2007) NTWK's market cap reached over $100 million on 50% lower revenues of what is projected for 2013. During the September 4Q 2012 CC NTWK officials stated that revenues are expected to reach $100 Million in 2015 up significantly from the $38 Million reported in 2012. They also expect margins to continue to go up as the high-margin Cloud divisions keep continuing exponentially to revenues. MUST READ ……This Week’s Analysts Comments on Upgrade: We project 13% annual growth to FY14 from FY10 reflecting 80 significant NFS legacy customers in FY14, up from 52, 37, and 28 in FY12, FY11, and FY10, respectively. The new Vroozi Cloud Division contributed $1.3 million in FY12. We expect at least $4 million in FY13 and $6 million to FY14 Our price target is based on the average forward 2013 P/E multiple of 13.2X (up from 12.8X in August 2012). NTWK is trading at 6.4X our FY13 projections. We are forecasting EPS of $0.85 per share. We applied an 11X multiple to our FY13 EPS forecast. We anticipate a richer multiple as earnings momentum builds in FY13. The company guidance calls for $1/share net income in 2013. NTWK is entering FY13 with a $25 million backlog and approximately $100 million in qualified leads. One quarter of the backlog is from four new NFS platform customer implementations that began in 4Q12. In August 2011, NetSol launched its Cloud Vroozi Division, an e-procurement search tool for SAP supplier relationship management (SRM) users. SAP AG is a global vendor of enterprise management systems that has the largest market share (24%) based on a worldwide Gartner survey. Vroozi should provide sales diversification and a higher margin recurring revenue stream. The Vroozi division contributed $1.3 million in FY12 sales and is expected to grow to $4 million in revenues in 2013 NTWK announced its 2nd Cloud Division last week offering an array of products and services to capture a greater % of the cloud applications in North America. The company is implementing this division using their significant software development capabilities and infrastructure. === MORE NTWWK HIGHLIGHTS: - Company projects Doubling/Tripling revenues and net income by 2015 - Significant Institutional investor ownership and growing - Insiders bought over 5% of the Outstanding shares the last 2 years and never sold a single share - Total share count is only 7.5 million shares.

At this price I would love to own more hence my assertation that I am buying more today. I would recommend that the rest of you do the same. The reason Google took a hit is because of the stupidity of the person who released the numbers during the height/midst of the stock market . And then there was the issue with the exchange rate.

The already unpopular 2010 health care reform law has been converted by the court into a $1.76 trillion tax increase funded by escalating taxes to be paid the vast majority of taxpayers. The high court’s ruling leaves in place 20 tax increases in the health-care law, of those, 12 tax hikes would affect families earning less than $250,000 per year, including a “Cadillac tax” on high-cost insurance plans, a tax on insurance providers, and an excise tax on medical device manufacturers. By formally converting ‘Obamacare’ into ‘Obamatax,’ the court allows Obama to raise taxes on the middle-class. The decision is a distressing blow to taxpayers and represents the single largest tax increase on young people in the nation’s history. When it takes full effect, the Internal Revenue Service will have immense new power and authority to persecute and prosecute a whole new group of taxpayers. If the law takes full effect, it will devastate small businesses and destroy any chance for a sustainable economic recovery. It will add trillions of dollars to the national debt and push the country toward bankruptcy even faster than current projections. Any individual who believes that this decision must be overturned must do everything possible to undo the damage that has been done, especially at the ballot box on November 6. –Obamacare law contains 20 new or higher taxes on American families and small businesses– WASHINGTON, DC – Obamacare contains 20 new or higher taxes on American families and small businesses. Arranged by their respective effective dates, below is the total list of all $500 billion-plus in tax hikes (over the next ten years) in Obamacare, where to find them in the bill, and how much your taxes are scheduled to go up as of today: Taxes that took effect in 2010: 1. Excise Tax on Charitable Hospitals (Min$/immediate): $50,000 per hospital if they fail to meet new “community health assessment needs,” “financial assistance,” and “billing and collection” rules set by HHS. Bill: PPACA; Page: 1,961-1,971 2. Codification of the “economic substance doctrine” (Tax hike of $4.5 billion). This provision allows the IRS to disallow completely-legal tax deductions and other legal tax-minimizing plans just because the IRS deems that the action lacks “substance” and is merely intended to reduce taxes owed. Bill: Reconciliation Act; Page: 108-113 3. “Black liquor” tax hike (Tax hike of $23.6 billion). This is a tax increase on a type of bio-fuel. Bill: Reconciliation Act; Page: 105 4. Tax on Innovator Drug Companies ($22.2 bil/Jan 2010): $2.3 billion annual tax on the industry imposed relative to share of sales made that year. Bill: PPACA; Page: 1,971-1,980 5. Blue Cross/Blue Shield Tax Hike ($0.4 bil/Jan 2010): The special tax deduction in current law for Blue Cross/Blue Shield companies would only be allowed if 85 percent or more of premium revenues are spent on clinical services. Bill: PPACA; Page: 2,004 6. Tax on Indoor Tanning Services ($2.7 billion/July 1, 2010): New 10 percent excise tax on Americans using indoor tanning salons. Bill: PPACA; Page: 2,397-2,399 7. Medicine Cabinet Tax ($5 bil/Jan 2011): Americans no longer able to use health savings account (HSA), flexible spending account (FSA), or health reimbursement (HRA) pre-tax dollars to purchase non- prescription, over-the-counter medicines (except insulin). Bill: PPACA; Page: 1,957-1,959 8. HSA Withdrawal Tax Hike ($1.4 bil/Jan 2011): Increases additional tax on non-medical early withdrawals from an HSA from 10 to 20 percent, disadvantaging them relative to IRAs and other tax- advantaged accounts, which remain at 10 percent.

Surtax on Investment Income ($123 billion/Jan. 2013): Creation of a new, 3.8 percent surtax on investment income earned in households making at least $250,000 ($200,000 single). This would result in the following top tax rates on investment income: Bill: Reconciliation Act; Page: 87-93 Capital Gains Dividends Other* 2012 15% 15% 35% 2013+ 23.8% 43.4% 43.4% *Other unearned income includes (for surtax purposes) gross income from interest, annuities, royalties, net rents, and passive income in partnerships and Subchapter-S corporations.

The already unpopular 2010 health care reform law has been converted by the court into a $1.76 trillion tax increase funded by escalating taxes to be paid the vast majority of taxpayers. The high court’s ruling leaves in place 20 tax increases in the health-care law, of those, 12 tax hikes would affect families earning less than $250,000 per year, including a “Cadillac tax” on high-cost insurance plans, a tax on insurance providers, and an excise tax on medical device manufacturers. By formally converting ‘Obamacare’ into ‘Obamatax,’ the court allows Obama to raise taxes on the middle-class. The decision is a distressing blow to taxpayers and represents the single largest tax increase on young people in the nation’s history. When it takes full effect, the Internal Revenue Service will have immense new power and authority to persecute and prosecute a whole new group of taxpayers. If the law takes full effect, it will devastate small businesses and destroy any chance for a sustainable economic recovery. It will add trillions of dollars to the national debt and push the country toward bankruptcy even faster than current projections.

The charge is due to a reduction in the value of the company’s deferred tax asset as a result of a change to the tax treatment of Medicare Part D reimbursements.” (“3M Anticipates New U.S. Healthcare Law to Result in One-Time Charge of $85 — $90 Million After Tax in First Quarter of 2010,” 3M, 3/26/10) “AK Steel Holding Corp., The Third Largest U.S. Steelmaker By Sales, Said It Will Record A Non-Cash Charge Of About $31 Million Resulting From The Health-Care Overhaul Signed Into Law By President Barack Obama.” (“AK Steel Sees $31 Million Charge From New Health Law,” Business Week, 3/23/10) It was also announced today that the democratic bill will cost Florida at least 700 jobs immediately. HotAir has more on the billions that Obamacare will cost US corporations. Caterpillar Inc. announced that Obamacare will cost the company $100 million in one quarter.</Msg><Username>obama_whisper_russia</Username><Timestamp>1350937462765</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22

Fact is.. USAMA was hunted long before he came into office, they found him while he was in there. Like finding a Quarter on the ground. Then, the people of those other countries took out their dictators, NOT OBAMA. He can say he put effort into the Car industry I will give him that. But Either way, GM would have gone thru BK and emerged without him. (happens all the time, a merger with another car company would of been ideal, but government got involved. I bet you didnt read Obamacare? Do U even realize its not JUST a healthcare plan? it will be killer of small business, a drain on your wealth, and a end to FULL TIME employees. Everyone will be part time or 1099 workers. I bet you think I owe you a flu shot, or birth control for your wife, or if you decide to have a baby then change your mind when its halfway out.. its ok to kill the halfborn baby under Obama. He will even pay for it with my earned income. Dont call someone a HERO who hasnt earned it. He didnt get there on his own. Somebody helped him along the way, He didnt build a HERO stature, you admonish him with it cause your smoking his lies. 4 More years of a LAwyer running this country and we will be wishing for the days of a Strong AMERICA.

Get your head out of your #$%$ or you will miss out on next 4 years after Obama gets re-elected.</Msg><Username>bdplayer</Username><Timestamp>1350953382185</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 20:49:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350956709660-176</Id><Title>BAG holders will see GAP down in Morning. 660ish</Title><Msg>yep its true.....</Msg><Username>kingvonage</Username><Timestamp>1350956709660</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 21:45:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350959112134-177</Id><Title>Obama shows his ignorance so simply!</Title><Msg>For over 60 years the attack aircraft carrier with her deck load of fighters and bombers has dominated the oceans, as well as the minds of naval strategists. According to this article, the world's major naval powers are gearing up for a new carrier race, unseen since World War 2, but it may be money and resources wasted. Here's why the modern flattop's dominance of the sea may be running out of steam: 1). The Shkval torpedo-This Russian weapon utilizes super-cavitation technology giving it an astounding underwater speed of 200 knots. The Navy has stated “Fitted with a nuclear warhead, Shkval could obliterate entire US naval battle groups and abruptly blow a hole in the USA’s carrier based air superiority doctrine”. Iran is said to possess a version called the "Hoot". 2). Wake Homing torpedoes-Last year, says the Washington Times, the Chinese discovered a weakness in the underwater structure of our modern carriers, which can be taken advantage of by using wake homing torpedoes designed by the Russians. 3). Air Independent Submarines-Modern diesel subs, of the kind built by Germany, France, and Russia are sold around the world and come equipped with new AIP technology allowing them to remain undetected for weeks. Such weapons can easily come into the possession of rogue states such as Iran, North Korea, and Venezuela, and perhaps already are. Diesel boats are also far quieter than nuclear subs, and there are more than 400 built or building in the world today. 4). Less vulnerable platforms duplicate the carrier's mission. Forward presence (showing the flag), close air support for ground troops, and anti-sub and anti-surface warfare is currently spread around the armed services. US destroyers currently make their presence known in all the worlds hot spots and can attack targets at long range using cruise missiles. Long-range bombers and vertol plans like the Harrier support the troops, the latter from light carriers. Submarines and helicopter-equipped destroyers and frigates take care of the submarine problem. 5) The cost. Modern super carriers generally price at about $6 billion each, but this is only the beginning. There is also an equally costly air wing to consider (about 90 planes at $50 million each for the US ships), plus 3-5 escorts ships and at least 1 attack submarine at $2 billion each for protection, plus 6000 crewmen, and $300 million per year on upkeep. And they wonder why our fleet has sunk from 600 ships to less than half since the last decade! As we have seen, the escort ships are currently duplicating the carriers' mission, which may make future strategists question why an expensive "mothership" is needed for today's warfare.</Msg><Username>omni1tsd</Username><Timestamp>1350959112134</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 22:25:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350959632991-178</Id><Title>Poor Obama so sad the economy keeps coming up</Title><Msg>Poor little Obama is so sad that the STINKING OBAMA DEM ECONOMY just keeps coming up. He seemed so proud of attacking Lybya without Congressional approval much unlike Bush who did get Congressional approval for the war in Iraq with most dems signing on including Hilary Bilary and John Kerry (the Vietnam vet) that was for it before he was against it. Little Obama was also proud of his acclaim that he got Bin Laden (not the Navy Seals but him.) But that dare economy just kept coming up and one thing is certain IT AIN'T BEEN GOOD FOR THE LAST 4 YEARS. As the Jokester says 'Obama's new line should be "are you better off this week than you were 4 days ago". HA! In 15 days it must be ANYONE BUT OBAMA (i.e. ROMNEY) THEN CONTINUED HOUSE CLEANING AND BACK SEATING DINGY HARRY THE BODY REID AND THE DO NOTHING SENATE!</Msg><Username>omni1tsd</Username><Timestamp>1350959632991</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 22:33:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350961825591-179</Id><Title>Romney, in another disiplined performance pulled it off.</Title><Msg>He has some agreements with Obama, but made a clear distinction that America should project strength militarily and economically while also making our ideals clearly known to all.
