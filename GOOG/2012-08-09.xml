(GOOG) and Polycom Inc. (PLCM) On cross-examination, Khan admitted she lied to federal agents, destroyed evidence and tried to warn some of her contacts that she had been questioned about illegal trades. She said she even acquired a cell phone in her gardener’s name to hide her actions.</Msg><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1344512318189</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-09 07:38:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344512731080-7</Id><Topic><Title>InsiderTrading: FBI Informant Khan Cries on Stand While Admitting Lies</Title><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1344512318189</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-09 07:38:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Litigation Release No. 22257 / February 10, 2012 SEC v. Douglas F. Whitman and Whitman Capital, LLC, Civil Action 12-CV-1055 (SDNY) SEC Charges California Hedge Fund Manager Connected to Galleon Insider Trading Case On February 10, 2012, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York charging a hedge fund manager and his Menlo Park, Calif.-based firm for their involvement in the insider trading ring connected to Raj Rajaratnam and hedge fund advisory firm Galleon Management. The SEC further alleges that Khan illegally tipped Whitman with inside information about Google’s quarterly financial results shortly before the company’s post market-close earnings announcement on July 19, 2007. At Whitman’s insistence, Khan identified her Google source as an employee of an investor relations firm used by Google. Whitman Capital funds then purchased 2,761 Google put option contracts based on the tip from Khan. On July 20, Whitman Capital closed the put option positions and generated ill-gotten profits of more than $620,000. Afterwards, Whitman sent Khan a large floral arrangement to thank her for the tip.</Msg><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1344512731080</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-09 07:45:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344513147651-8</Id><Topic><Title>ON2, Google "merger" from different "angle"?</Title><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1337797551000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-05-23 14:25:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why would google pay widevine 3 or 4 times more than it was worth but ON2 shareholders got screwed.
