Apple and Motorola Mobility are suing each other for patent infringements, but that's different, not based on the Android System.

Motorola has alot more patents on the cell-phone field than does Apple. So worst-case, Apple and Motorola will cross-license each other some patents. Meantime, read a NY Times article today on whether Apple can sue Google on Android. It notes Apple has NOT done such, rather goes after the hardware manufacturers if they copy Apple phones too much. Article notes GOOG doesn't even make money selling Android Op System software, so how can one sue for damages, even if could prove infringement? Samsung got sued because its designs did slavishly copy Apple, yet it refused to pay any licensing fees.</Msg><Username>aiwal1</Username><Timestamp>1346152280208</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 07:11:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346153120416-7</Id><Title>throw yo android phone away..OS patent violation</Title><Msg>sell goog ..going to $500..</Msg><Username>double_dogdare</Username><Timestamp>1346153120416</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 07:25:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346153282323-8</Id><Title>u won't be able to update android phones in few months..sell</Title><Msg>sell..sell..</Msg><Username>double_dogdare</Username><Timestamp>1346153282323</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 07:28:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346153578899-9</Id><Title>round 1 ..an apple knockout...sell</Title><Msg>sell...sell..</Msg><Username>double_dogdare</Username><Timestamp>1346153578899</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 07:32:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346154611623-10</Id><Title>GOOG/Android will beat out AAPL it is inevitable</Title><Msg>Tweaking a few things will not stop Android phones from continuing to outgrow AAPL.

The data reveals that although the majority of mobile ad impressions are still recorded on Apple's (AAPL) iOS handsets, Android (GOOG) took 4% of market share from Apple. Apple devices now claim 58% of in-app ad impressions; volumes for iPhone models dropped from 31% to 27% in July and also fell from 22% to 19% for the iPod Touch. The report adds, iOS still dominates tablets where mobile in-app advertising impressions rose from nine to 12% for iPads. The rise may be attributed to the new tablet's recent launch in China, where traffic increased by 150% during its first week. Globally, the new iPad is now closing the gap on its predecessor for ad impressions. In the five months post release, the new model has 20% of total impressions, while the iPad 2 had 24% of volumes at the same point in its lifecycle. Co's research highlights the Android tablet market is changing, although Samsung (SSNLF) is still the leading Android tablet manufacturer overall, Amazon's (AMZN) Kindle Fire is the most successful model with 38%.</Msg><Username>shavitmi</Username><Timestamp>1346170487534</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 12:14:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346170584013-26</Id><Topic><Title>GOOG should look at VELT:</Title><Username>shavitmi</Username><Timestamp>1346170487534</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 12:14:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>VELT market cap around 400 m ,should earn 1$ for 2012,dominating the smartphone/tablets ads</Msg><Username>shavitmi</Username><Timestamp>1346170584013</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 12:16:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346170656367-27</Id><Topic><Title>GOOG HYPERINFLATED PRICE BASED ON ANDROID DOMINANCE, FAR FROM IT</Title><Username>tamermou</Username><Timestamp>1346084327219</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-27 12:18:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>They get most of there earnings from advertising and youtube is growing like crazy. 500 mil to $1.7 billion in ad revenue in two years.

If your not confident about whether it's a good time to short, don't. There's plenty of opportunities in this market. Wait for an opportunity you feel good about.
