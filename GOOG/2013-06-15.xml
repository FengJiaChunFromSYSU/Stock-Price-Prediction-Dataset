This company absolutely is setting the grander stage of future tech revolution while at the forefront of all Internet Technologies. Faster, more affordable, and readily accessable to Everyone. The future of the Internet to come may not be obtained without them. To envision, the world needs a visionary. Ours may be Google. Many might contend but we have consistently failed. With that, a higher valuation may absolutely be necessary. Google is no longer tech as we have formerly applied tech in history, a pleasure and privilege, but rather it is and will permanently be a necessity. GOOG is probably the first tech utility the world has ever seen. It has become a permanent fixture evolving with our every advance and in many cases leading the way. No one can see the future, but I certainly can not see one without Google! I can't wait to see where they take us.</Msg><Username>goodeyecharting</Username><Timestamp>1371319566866</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 14:06:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371325907483-5</Id><Topic><Title>14k in 48 HOURs</Title><Username>tovy111</Username><Timestamp>1363577451326</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-17 23:30:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>CCRY exploded after they alerted it</Msg><Username>joefearra</Username><Timestamp>1371325907483</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 15:51:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371326702098-6</Id><Topic><Title>GOOG going down to the ground??</Title><Username>stockmr</Username><Timestamp>1366309347290</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 14:22:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>wow amazing thank you</Msg><Username>joefearra</Username><Timestamp>1371326702098</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 16:05:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371332019267-7</Id><Title>USAA INSURANCE RUNS THE PERFECT CON ON ITS MEMBERS.....</Title><Msg>If your house is destroyed, you get no up front cash payout--- USAA gets cheap bids and then nickels you to death.
