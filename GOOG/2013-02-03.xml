Whoa</Title><Msg>Joaquín Almunia, the European competition commissioner and the top European antitrust official, has been formally investigating Google since November 2010. He has insisted that Google make changes to the most sensitive area of its business, online search. If Mr. Almunia ultimately accepts Google’s offer, the company will avoid further investigation. Additional inquiry could lead to a fine of as much as 10 percent of Google’s annual global sales, which came to about $50 billion last year. Google would also avoid a guilty finding, which could restrict its activities in Europe.

But he gave me the personal email address to a woman who was at the party and works for one of the bigwigs at vanguard. I emailed her, and she quickly replied back with "no comment". So my guess when people say no comment that its probably true, and now I'm not taking any chances and I'm going to sell all 70 Shares. Hopefully I can get $775, but i'll even take as low as $760. I think I might of been too greedy, I should of sold Friday. But a profit is a profit. I know to follow the people with the money, If they sell I sell, if they buy, I buy. Right now it looks like I need to get out, and wait for the next cocktail party.</Msg><Username>earthinmind</Username><Timestamp>1359951380107</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-03 23:16:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359952086275-15</Id><Topic><Title>Trying to find out if Vanguard is dumping google stock</Title><Username>earthinmind</Username><Timestamp>1359850315440</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 19:11:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>OH #$%$ you putz. great story by the way. good luck with that.</Msg><Username>sheep_peppermint</Username><Timestamp>1359952086275</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-03 23:28:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
