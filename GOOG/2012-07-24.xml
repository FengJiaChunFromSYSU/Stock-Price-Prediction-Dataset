But how can you measure intelligence throughout history? To determine reasoning ability today, adults and children can be challenged by all manner of mental tasks. The hypothesis is that, albeit in entirely uncontrolled populations, intellectual and behavioural benefits follow from dietary intervention involving a fatty substance, docosahexaenoic acid, abbreviated to DHA. CHAPTER 7 THE BRAIN Do we have any evidence that dietary induced changes in infant brain composition have an effect on neurodevelopment? neurological assessments of premature infants at various ages, those fed formula milks devoid of DHA had consistently poorer neurodevelopment test scores than breast fed contemporaries. From outcomes it was evident that these infants were more susceptible to dietary deficiencies than others born at full term. Again the differences could not be attributed specifically to DHA intake since other components of the feeds may have been contributory. If not dietary DHA, another answer was needed for the nature of the neuro-protective agent which was apparently denied to preterm infants. Also, could it explain the often contradictory results of dietary trials in term infants? The human brain, for all its vast complexity, is still governed by the basic principles of electrochemistry, and evolution has decreed that DHA should play a prominent part in its function. It seems obvious that efforts should be made to ensure that sufficient dietary DHA is available to everyone. ... SUMMARY ... Warfare during the 20th century initially appeared to involve populations ingesting the greatest quantities of DHA. Immediately prior to both major world conflicts the main protagonist, Germany, remained an ardent consumer of fish rich in DHA. However it was the unique nature of warfare that was to prove particularly disruptive to fishing. Requisitioning of fishing boats and recruitment of fishermen for naval duties, and vulnerability to enemy attack in open seas, all conspired to limit activity. During both World Wars the only major European fishing fleet to remain largely unscathed was that of Norway. As a neutral country it could have continued to supply the German market with copious amounts of herring. ...</Msg><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1343152694443</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 13:58:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343154267641-16</Id><Topic><Title>Google to hit 650 by wednesday</Title><Username>chriscoff1</Username><Timestamp>1343073594886</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 15:59:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>does anyone know when Google would split ?</Msg><Username>jsfarrokhi50</Username><Timestamp>1343154267641</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 14:24:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343155215728-17</Id><Title>AAPL Is Going to Pop, Get Ready to Jump on the GOOG Ship to Follow....</Title><Msg>...eom.</Msg><Username>chaolopez</Username><Timestamp>1343155215728</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 14:40:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343162196877-18</Id><Title>With AAPL's Major Miss, GOOG Should Go Up Tomorrow Since We Are Competitors...</Title><Msg>...eom.</Msg><Username>chaolopez</Username><Timestamp>1343162196877</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 16:36:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343166783104-19</Id><Topic><Title>With AAPL's Major Miss, GOOG Should Go Up Tomorrow Since We Are Competitors...</Title><Username>chaolopez</Username><Timestamp>1343162196877</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 16:36:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>625 tomorrow</Msg><Username>bellevuecollision</Username><Timestamp>1343166783104</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 17:53:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343167529948-20</Id><Title>seems like this is showing sympathy with aapl in AH.</Title><Msg>tomorrow's another bloody day for longs across the board</Msg><Username>new_avatar_2007</Username><Timestamp>1343167529948</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 18:05:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343169388713-21</Id><Topic><Title>seems like this is showing sympathy with aapl in AH.</Title><Username>new_avatar_2007</Username><Timestamp>1343167529948</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 18:05:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Simply wrong...you need to be careful when your looking at the charts.
