Particularly revenue from per unit licensees continued to erode because handset vendors in Japan, along with RIM, and HTC continued to lose market share to Samsung and Apple. Samsung and Apple are both fixed-term licensees where revenue streams are unaffected by volumes. OUTLOOK SHOULD BE SOLID We believe that due to the timing of asset sales, as well as license renewals and outcomes of litigation, that quarterly results are difficult to forecast. However, we should continue to see an annualized trend towards growth through licensing, partnerships, and asset sales. This is reflected in our sum-of-the-parts analysis below. Our estimate of cash includes our estimate incremental cash that resulted from the sale of the patents to Intel. We reiterate our BUY recommendation and our 12-month share price target of $45.00. Our estimate excludes licensing revenue from Nokia, Huawei, ZTE, and LG, which are all involved in litigation with Interdigital currently.

You do not need me to decode it for you, just reread and compare. Mousavi was green's candidate for president, but the votes in no time changed direction, in millions, in favour of Mousavi's opponent. Mousavi is Romney or Republican's boy in Iran, now check it out: October 22, 2012 (Reuters) - President Barack Obama and Republican candidate Mitt Romney met on Monday in Boca Raton, Florida, for the third and last presidential debate, focused on foreign policy, ahead of the November 6 election. Below are some highlights of what the two candidates said. ON THE MIDDLE EAST Romney: "We can't kill our way out of this mess. We're going to have to put in place a very comprehensive and robust strategy to help the world of Islam and other parts of the world to reject this radical violent extremism." "The key that we're going to have to pursue as a pathway is to get the Muslim world to be able reject extremism on its own." Obama: "When it comes to our foreign policy, you seem to want to import the foreign policies of the 1980s, just like the social policies of the 1950s and the economic policies of the 1920s." "What we need to do with respect to the Middle East is strong and steady leadership, not wrong and reckless leadership that is all over the map, and unfortunately that's the kind of opinions that you've offered throughout the campaign and it is not a recipe for American strength."</Msg><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1351081504414</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 08:25:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351082042530-16</Id><Topic><Title>Attention: Israel &amp; Iran imminent War is Risky Nuke Business</Title><Username>israel_iran_war_risky</Username><Timestamp>1348671473024</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 10:57:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Is Yahoo a public company or an arm of USA intelligence agencies? google and yahoo helping Democrats in providing Iranian google and yahoo accounts to Iranian secret agents.

Most Jews are Turn Against Obama across the 50 states, A Jewish Women Focus Group of 7,890 on October 22, 2012 President Obama Was arrogant, angry, disrespectfully, condescending and much to aggressive, did not look very presidential at all. Governor Mitt Romney looked much more presidential, ready to be commander-in-chief. America he said, needs a strong economy in order to have a strong military for our National Security now and in the future. We came away from this debate with a very good impression of Mitt Romney, in that he would be a “ a safe pair of hands.” We feel he’s tough enough to do what’s necessary, but laid-back enough not to do too much and get us into another war. Romney did not attack President Obama's policies, he simply pointed out a few improvements in a respectable way. During the debate Governor Mitt Romney seemed more like the president and Barack Obama more like the candidate and challenger. Governor Mitt Romney was calm, thoughtful, relaxed, steady and looked very presidential. He looked and acted ready to take the job as commander-in-chief. Expressed his views on Iran's Nuclear threat and the USA support of Israel, our good friend and ally. He impressed us tonight, in that a vote for him is a vote for American security, peace and safety, a strong economy, a strong military, millions of higher paying jobs, prosperity and quiet peaceful life for us and our families. The world is much to scary these days; Americans aren’t looking for a scary weak president. Tonight we came away with the feeling that President Obama is more the scary one, in America's weaken relationship with Israel, a closer to Nuclear Iran, our weak economy and the huge 16 Trillion Dollars in Debt, that in itself Threatens our National Security. We can not afford four more years of president Obama's spending and borrowing another 5 or 6 trillion dollars from countries like China. Our jewish women's focus group therefore endorse Governor Mitt Romney for the next president of the United States of America. Obama's Re-Election is very questionable.

Instruction Regarding The Disney-Google Agreement Members of the jury, yesterday you heard counsel for Defendants ask Dr. Becker a number of questions during cross-examination regarding a patent license agreement between Disney and Google. Defendants were trying to establish that the technology of the DisneyGoogle Agreement is comparable to the technology of the patents-in-suit that I/P Engine is asserting against Google and the other defendants. The Court has ruled that the technology of the Disney-Google Agreement is not comparable to the technology of the patents-in-suit. As a result, the Court instructed you to disregard all testimony regarding the Disney-Google Agreement. You may not consider that agreement, or the amount of that agreement, for any purpose, including trying to determine what the appropriate royalty should be in this case. I want to emphasize that my instruction to you on this matter is in no way a reflection that Dr. Becker did anything improper. During his direct examination, Dr. Becker testified that he was not relying on the Disney-Google agreement because there is no evidence that the Disney technology is relevant to any issue in this case the questions of Defense counsel regarding the Case 2:11-cv-00512-RAJ-TEM Document 740-1 Filed 10/24/12 Page 1 of 2 PageID# 160891 Disney-Google agreement were improper. The Court has therefore ruled that any evidence regarding the Disney technology is improper and irrelevant. 2. Instruction Regarding Discovery of Google’s Financial Information You also heard counsel for Defendants ask Dr. Becker questions regarding whether he had asked counsel for I/P Engine for further documents or information to support his opinions regarding his apportionment, or whether there was a final version of PX 64, the Revenue Force document. After reviewing the record on this matter, the Court has found that counsel for I/P Engine had requested those documents and information from Google, but that Google did not produce to I/P Engine a final version of the Revenue Force document, PX 64, or any documents providing the numerical support for the slides on page 38 of that document. I instruct you that you may conclude, based upon the cross-examination questions asked of Dr. Becker by Defendants’ counsel, that Google had additional documents and information that, had they been produced, would have provided further support to Dr. Becker’s opinions regarding his apportionment.

Instruction Regarding The Disney-Google Agreement Members of the jury, yesterday you heard counsel for Defendants ask Dr. Becker a number of questions during cross-examination regarding a patent license agreement between Disney and Google. Defendants were trying to establish that the technology of the DisneyGoogle Agreement is comparable to the technology of the patents-in-suit that I/P Engine is asserting against Google and the other defendants. The Court has ruled that the technology of the Disney-Google Agreement is not comparable to the technology of the patents-in-suit. As a result, the Court instructed you to disregard all testimony regarding the Disney-Google Agreement. You may not consider that agreement, or the amount of that agreement, for any purpose, including trying to determine what the appropriate royalty should be in this case. I want to emphasize that my instruction to you on this matter is in no way a reflection that Dr. Becker did anything improper. During his direct examination, Dr. Becker testified that he was not relying on the Disney-Google agreement because there is no evidence that the Disney technology is relevant to any issue in this case the questions of Defense counsel regarding the Case 2:11-cv-00512-RAJ-TEM Document 740-1 Filed 10/24/12 Page 1 of 2 PageID# 160891 Disney-Google agreement were improper. The Court has therefore ruled that any evidence regarding the Disney technology is improper and irrelevant. 2. Instruction Regarding Discovery of Google’s Financial Information You also heard counsel for Defendants ask Dr. Becker questions regarding whether he had asked counsel for I/P Engine for further documents or information to support his opinions regarding his apportionment, or whether there was a final version of PX 64, the Revenue Force document. After reviewing the record on this matter, the Court has found that counsel for I/P Engine had requested those documents and information from Google, but that Google did not produce to I/P Engine a final version of the Revenue Force document, PX 64, or any documents providing the numerical support for the slides on page 38 of that document. I instruct you that you may conclude, based upon the cross-examination questions asked of Dr. Becker by Defendants’ counsel, that Google had additional documents and information that, had they been produced, would have provided further support to Dr. Becker’s opinions regarding his apportionment.

So the way I read this: The Judge rules that the Disney-Google technology agreement DOES NOT-IS NOT the same as the tech infringement Google is being sued for. Judge instructs Jury to disregard Becker testimony specific to this agreenet as it is not comparable specific to tech and settlement amount...this is nothing but a BIG POSITIVE for Vringo. Google was trying to 1. Say it was the same tech and 2. The damages should be similar if applicable....read between the lines...Goolgle is saying we are guilty but this is what we would like to pay. .0 users liked this posts 0 users disliked this posts ReplyIgnore User | Report Abuse ..Re: New PACER Doc - Interpretation anyone?

Yesterday the judge struck the cross examination of VRNG's expert. Striking testimony after it has already happened is not ideal. He really shouldn't have allowed it in the 1st place. So now the judge has to give a curative instruction, something to the effect of "you will disredard..."

The Reasons for Change is Obama has Lost the Support and Respect with Women Voters and Others.

The following reasons listed bellow. Note: This review is a agreement amongst a Group of almost 8000 Women watching debates. During the Debate 3, President Barack Obama was Arrogant, Disrespectfully, Angry, Rude and Condescending to Governor Mitt Romney. Obama did not Act or Look Presidential. We Feel Governor Mitt Romney Pasted the Presidential Test and is Ready to Lead USA We Support Mitt Romney, found him to be a Smart, Respectable and Decent Gentleman. Governor Mitt Romney Looked Much More Presidential, Ready to be Commander-in-Chief. Mitt Romney said America Needs a Strong Economy in order to have a Strong Military for our National Security right now and the Future. ...... We All Agree. Women came away from this Debate with a Very Good Impression of Governor Mitt Romney, in that he would be a “ A Safe Pair of Hands.” in Foreign Policy and a Strong Economy. We Trust Him More. Obama lied about Libya on 9 11 ( a 8 hour fire fight, Obama watched did nothing) In Foreign Policy We feel Mitt Romney is Tough Enough to do what’s necessary, but laid-back enough not to do too much and get us into another war. Miit Romney Did Not attack President Obama's Policies, he Simply Pointed Out a Few Needed Improvements in a Very Respectable Way. During the debate Governor Mitt Romney Seemed More Like a Leader, Smart, Respectable, Thoughtful and Considerate. He looked and Acted more Like the New American President that our Nation and the rest of the World Needs so Disparately in These Troubling Economic Times. Governor Mitt Romney was Calm, Thoughtful, Relaxed, Steady, Looked Like A Smart Gentleman and More Presidential. Romney Looked and Acted as if he was Ready to Take the Job as Commander-in-Chief ASAP. President Barack Obama Looked more like a Very Disparate Candidate and Challenger, very Negative, Acted like a Disrespectful Attack Dog Instead of the President of the United States. Mitt Romney Expressed his Concern about Iran's Nuclear Threat that is 4 Years Closer and the USA Support of Israel, our Good Friend and Middle East Ally. The strained relationship with the Obama Administration. Tonight Romney Impressed the Ladies Very much, in that a Vote for Him is a Vote for American Security, Peace and Safety, a Strong Economy, a Strong Military, Millions of Higher Paying Jobs, Prosperity for the Middle Class and Others. and a Quiet Peaceful Life for USA and all People. The World is Much to Scary these days, Americans Aren’t Looking For a Scary Arrogant, Angry. Rude, Disrespectfully and Weak President. Barack Obama is Not the One to Lead us Any Longer Tonight we Came Away with the Feeling that President Barack Obama is extremely a more Scary Candidate then the President of USA. We are Concerned about America's Weaken Relationship with Israel, a Nuclear Iran, our Weaken Economy and the Huge 16 Trillion Dollars Debt, that in itself Threatens our National Security. Americans, Black, White, Latinos, Wake Up, USA Debt is Bigger than our Gross National Product. We Can Not Afford Four More Years of President Obama's Spending, Borrowing and lies. We Can Not Afford Another 5 or 6 Trillion Dollars in More Debt From China or Other Countries. Our Jewish Women's Focus Group of almost 8000 Democrats Therefore Proudly Endorse Governor Mitt Romney as the Next President of the United States of America.

Women came away from this Debate with a Very Good Impression of Governor Mitt Romney, in that he would be a “ A Safe Pair of Hands.” in Foreign Policy and a Strong Economy. We Trust Him More. Obama lied about Libya on 9 11 ( a 8 hour fire fight, Obama watched did nothing) In Foreign Policy We feel Mitt Romney is Tough Enough to do what’s necessary, but laid-back enough not to do too much and get us into another war. Miit Romney Did Not attack President Obama's Policies, he Simply Pointed Out a Few Needed Improvements in a Very Respectable Way. During the debate Governor Mitt Romney Seemed More Like a Leader, Smart, Respectable, Thoughtful and Considerate. He looked and Acted more Like the New American President that our Nation and the rest of the World Needs so Disparately in These Troubling Economic Times. Governor Mitt Romney was Calm, Thoughtful, Relaxed, Steady, Looked Like A Smart Gentleman and More Presidential. Romney Looked and Acted as if he was Ready to Take the Job as Commander-in-Chief ASAP. President Barack Obama Looked more like a Very Disparate Candidate and Challenger, very Negative, Acted like a Disrespectful Attack Dog Instead of the President of the United States. Mitt Romney Expressed his Concern about Iran's Nuclear Threat that is 4 Years Closer and the USA Support of Israel, our Good Friend and Middle East Ally. The strained relationship with the Obama Administration. Tonight Romney Impressed the Ladies Very much, in that a Vote for Him is a Vote for American Security, Peace and Safety, a Strong Economy, a Strong Military, Millions of Higher Paying Jobs, Prosperity for the Middle Class and Others. and a Quiet Peaceful Life for USA and all People. The World is Much to Scary these days, Americans Aren’t Looking For a Scary Arrogant, Angry. Rude, Disrespectfully and Weak President. Barack Obama is Not the One to Lead us Any Longer Tonight we Came Away with the Feeling that President Barack Obama is extremely a more Scary Candidate then the President of USA. We are Concerned about America's Weaken Relationship with Israel, a Nuclear Iran, our Weaken Economy and the Huge 16 Trillion Dollars Debt, that in itself Threatens our National Security. Americans, Black, White, Latinos, Wake Up, USA Debt is Bigger than our Gross National Product. We Can Not Afford Four More Years of President Obama's Spending, Borrowing and lies. We Can Not Afford Another 5 or 6 Trillion Dollars in More Debt From China or Other Countries. Our Jewish Women's Focus Group of almost 8000 Democrats Therefore Proudly Endorse Governor Mitt Romney as the Next President of the United States of America.
