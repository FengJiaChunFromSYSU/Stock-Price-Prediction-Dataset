I believe ON2 shareholders should be proud of EXPOSING the scam court system in the way their lawsuit against Google is being dragged and "settled" and the way other judges acting/recting in different cases involving other companies against Google. I'm proud to be just one of them: Case 1) ON2 vs Google -- There were a few different ON2 shareholders lawsuit against Google in August 2009. Google asked for consolidating the lawsuits in a single one. After consolidation, the judge in this case let an ON2 "lead-plaintiff" with 100 ONT/ON2 shares or so to "settle" the case. I think FBI should investigate the judge's ruling and DOJ nullify ON2 shareholders case to let ON2 shareholders to takeover ON2 or start a new trial. Case 2) Oracle vs Google -- The judge dimissed Oracle claim against Google. Here is what happened sfterward: U.S. District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco had shocked the legal and blogging communities on August 7 by demanding names of "print or Internet authors, journalists, commentators or bloggers" on the companies' payrolls. The judge at the time expressed concern that payments might have influenced writings about the case. Legal experts questioned the breadth of the order, including whether it could violate the writers' First Amendment free speech rights. But in an order issued on Tuesday, after Oracle and Google had submitted lists of names, Alsup said he would "take no further action regarding the subject of payments by the litigants to commentators and journalists." He also said no commentaries had influenced his rulings in the case, other than "any treatise or article" he cited expressly. Alsup has not revealed what prompted his August 7 order. Case 3) Vringo vs Google -- I/P files lawsuit against Google in September 2011. Vringo acquires I/P in early 2012. The judge in Vringo against Google lawsuit in Jan 2012 announced that he will retite, at 65 or so year, at the end ot september 2012. Vringo vs Google case Court trial is supposed to start on October 16, 2012. By looking at these three cases with bizzar consequences or trials, I believe because of Vringo strong cases the judge honorably retires instead of ending up to rule other than what he saw the evidence might've pointed?</Msg><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1347006469046</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 04:27:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347013262480-2</Id><Title>Answer to Clinton/Obama/Biden-Reagan did pull it out</Title><Msg>Just as was surmised the show in Charlotte was filled with blame and excuses the primary one being (just as most thought) 'we haven't had enough time.' Reagan walked smack dab into the Carter mess (culminating in 22% interest rates, gas lines and rationing, and terrorists holding USA citizens for over 1 year in Iran. The USA election shows such strength to the foreign diplomacy crowd that the hostages were released immediately and the job building began with fabulous results. Now I know their will be the Reagan naysayers with all the talking points but one thing is certain we were better off than then we are now and Reagan presided over a tremendous turn around primed by (you guessed it) TAX CUTS. Obama right out of the gate has what Justice Roberts appropriately deemed a tax (Obaama Care) kicking in 2014 that will continue the massive job killing. So lets assume today's job report results in 250,000 jobs, it still will mean nothing as businesses will not grow extensively with so much certainty and uncertainty surrounding the business envioronment. Clinton/Obama/Biden all got it wrong in stating 'nobody' could pull us out of this mess. Reagan did!! I am sick of all the excuses. This is Obama and the Pelosi Congrss mess and yes 'they did build it.' With that said Obama (again just as surmised) is now spinning his comment 'you did not build that' by now telling us what he really meant without knowing that we heard it right out of his mouth and know what he meant. This is not the Dreams of His Father but quite contrarily the United States of America. With $16 trillion in debt there is no way we can continue the ongoing spending these democrats have in store. The party is over! We need to fix it just as any of us would our personal budgets 'cut the spending now.' The democrat convention was all about more handouts and that can only be accomplished by printing more worthless money that will sooner rather than later bring on the ultimate final crash. We must fix it and that will begin only with new leadership. We've seen Obama now and he did not live up to expectations.</Msg><Username>rldcis</Username><Timestamp>1347013262480</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 06:21:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347017383622-3</Id><Topic><Title>Answer to Clinton/Obama/Biden-Reagan did pull it out</Title><Username>rldcis</Username><Timestamp>1347013262480</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 06:21:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>absolutely!!, and well said, well articulated.

March 15, 2012 Super-Secret Google Builds Servers in the Dark By Cade MetzEmail Author 03.15.12 “Many [companies] try to keep things covered up. There’s a lot of valuable intellectual property in here,” says Chris Sharp, general manager of content and cloud at Equinix, as he walks through the company’s data center. “But we were always amazed by Google and the helmets.” Google is one of many big-name web outfits that lease data-center space from Equinix — a company whose massive computing facilities serve as hubs for the world’s biggest internet providers. All the big web names set up shop in these data centers, so that they too can plug into the hub. The irony is that they must also share space with their biggest rivals, and this may cause some unease with companies that see their hardware as a competitive advantage best hidden from others. --------- Why DOJ 'never" Investigated ON2/Google "merger" and ???

So secret, in fact, that it’s pulling the plug on the lights that illuminate its servers, casting the endless hallways of rack-mounted units into complete darkness. But is Google being paranoid or actually on to something? Our resident blogger weighs in … Don’t be surprised if night vision goggles (or Google goggles) become part of an IT admin’s arsenal. According to Wired magazine … [Google is] so paranoid about competitors catching a glimpse of its gear, it’s been known to keep its server cages in complete darkness, outfitting its technical staff like miners and sending them spelunking into the cages with lights on their heads. Apparently, in some of the world’s largest data centers run by Equinix, Google is sharing space with its competitors, and it’s not really comfortable about it. Google thinks its edge is in its special server technology, and quite frankly, The VAR Guy is inclined to believe that. Google, predictably, has no comment, but the story is certainly true since it comes straight form the source: one Chris Sharp, who happens to be the “general manager of content and cloud” over at Equinix. So why all the secrecy about hardware? It’s not too hard to figure out. In the data center space, your hardware is your competitive edge. Whatever fancy conglomeration of appliances and servers Google has set up clearly provides it with the robust swath of services it’s able to provide. If Google told the world what it uses and how it does it, who’s to stop the copycats? Yes, that seems a bit pessimistic, but it’s also capitalistic, and Google has every reason to protect its assets, especially amid the mobile holy wars that have pitted Google’s services against Apple’s ecosystem. Undoubtedly, servers are at the heart of all that.</Msg><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1347031691293</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 11:28:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347031749457-37</Id><Title>MIPS calls surging</Title><Msg>Over 4200 MIPS Technologies Sept 8 calls bought (87% at the ask) vs. open interest of 1042.

By gguybbycc.12 hours ago.Permalink . Private Equity: • What they don’t do - These Companies don’t go out and pay premium prices for Companies that are doing poorly and then strip the assets for cash. • What they do - They pay a discounted price for a Company that is doing poorly and try to fix them – sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t. But in almost every case, the Company would have been ‘history’ if it had not been for the Private Equity investment and the attempt to rescue the Company. Outsourcing: • Probably the single most important thing that has made America the most productive creator of goods in history. • For example, if Ford was not allowed to outsource, and had to make all its parts and supply all the services it needs – they could probably only make about 10 cars a year. • The question is not ‘whether to outsource or not’, it’s about who do you outsource to. • In almost every case where the outsourcing goes to a non–U.S. Company, you can pretty much point to a Union situation that has made the American Company not cost competitive. Tax Fairness: • The Top 1% pay 25% of the Tax bill. • The Top 2% pay 40% of the Tax bill. • The Top 20% pay 90% of the Tax bill. • The Bottom 50% pay 0% of the Tax bill. • Exactly what is ‘fair’? Classes: • The Democrats believe that there are two Classes: The Top 2% that are rich and evil, and the other 98% are all ‘Middle Class’. • Same kind of thinking we saw from Christopher Dodd and Maxine Waters when they decided that ‘everybody should own a home’. That one didn’t work out so well. • The Democrats don’t even mention the ‘Working Class’ (the PC version of Lower Class) anymore. When did a Factory Worker or a Walmart Retail Associate with a High School education become ‘middle class’. • The Democrats abandonment of the Working Class has led to outsourcing of these jobs.</Msg><Username>rldcis</Username><Timestamp>1347066281416</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 21:04:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347066860260-92</Id><Title>OCTOBER 29.1929....OCTOBER 29,2012 ....The BIG CRASH will happen soon !!</Title><Msg>VERY soon ...............</Msg><Username>zip_i_t_do_da</Username><Timestamp>1347066860260</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 21:14:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347067483763-93</Id><Title>MOVING CLOSE TO 747 ALL-TIME HIGH</Title><Msg>STICK WITH IT</Msg><Username>jeffreysauctions</Username><Timestamp>1347067483763</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 21:24:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347073143710-94</Id><Topic><Title>OCTOBER 29.1929....OCTOBER 29,2012 ....The BIG CRASH will happen soon !!</Title><Username>zip_i_t_do_da</Username><Timestamp>1347066860260</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 21:14:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How could this stock crash?
