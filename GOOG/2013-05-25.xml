GOOG trend line showing around $750 by your June 22nd OE day. There was a lot of CALL buyers that were suckered in at $910 level and now they are chasing. If GOOG should take another $40-50 dive next week, then I would recommend selling 1/2 of your position, which will go for $6-$7 a shot.</Msg><Username>frtgrdn21</Username><Timestamp>1369489739605</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-25 09:48:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369491325627-3</Id><Topic><Title>Early Pump To Sell The Near The Money Calls At A Premium</Title><Username>frtgrdn21</Username><Timestamp>1369057994167</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-20 09:53:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Now the CALL buyers are chasing and the MM are more then happy to oblige.

He's saying your winning trades should be returning 100 to 1000% percent. Far OTM options are like swinging for the fences. Most of the time you strike out. Money is made trading near-the-money options. Research trading spread to limit out of pocket costs and/or risk.</Msg><Username>diego004</Username><Timestamp>1369496183281</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-25 11:36:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369505550079-8</Id><Title>Chart looks like downhill skiing from 910 to 870 and cramer said</Title><Msg>Buy.buy buy ,,,you first cause i havent forgot about aapl..JMHO</Msg><Username>mcannaly</Username><Timestamp>1369505550079</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-25 14:12:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369507762575-9</Id><Topic><Title>New to Options. have a question...........</Title><Username>lobsterpot1989</Username><Timestamp>1369414933306</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-24 13:02:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'd hold here.

In the previous conferences GOOG was unveiling new products which caused very high volatility in the share price (like the premium before earnings). This years conference was lacking in the thrill factor, thereby the share price is slowly falling, but the premium is gone. If we get a similar week that we just went through, you will be up 200-300% on your purchase price.</Msg><Username>frtgrdn21</Username><Timestamp>1369517447054</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-25 17:30:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369517746303-12</Id><Topic><Title>New to Options. have a question...........</Title><Username>lobsterpot1989</Username><Timestamp>1369414933306</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-24 13:02:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>$775 is not that far out for GOOG.

Proportionately GOOG took a hit many times over the major indexes. The big drop in the market is still to come. Employment numbers will be good again and the FED will be forced to pull the rug right out of the markets feet. Also the Quarterly rebalancing coming up this Friday and we are going to see some major profit taking in GOOG.
