Vringo recently completed a merger with intellectual-property firm Innovate/Protect, a company that last year filed a patent suit against AOL Inc. (AOL), Google Inc. (GOOG), IAC/InterActiveCorp. (IACI), Gannett Co. (GCI) and Target Corp. (TGT). The company acquired eight patents from Lycos and claims two of those patents were infringed. A court decision known as a Markman ruling--which comes up with definitions of disputed technical terms in a lawsuit-- came out in June mostly in favor of Vringo, but the defendants then challenged two of those definitions. The judge Thursday maintained his position on one of the definitions and tweaked the second to include language that both Vringo and the defendants had agreed on but was excluded in error. Vringo said it was pleased the court agreed with it and didn't change the first term and that it also clarified the second term to make it consistent with what both sides of the suit proposed. Google, which is the primary target in the case, didn't respond to a request for comment. A trial date has been set for Oct. 16.</Msg><Username>mcuban2017</Username><Timestamp>1345207254633</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 08:40:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345211690339-10</Id><Topic><Title>One month chart looks very ugly</Title><Username>pharrisa</Username><Timestamp>1345182447537</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 01:47:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>are you serious? This chart looks pretty good to me. It has broken out. I think we could see $700 by the end of September or maybe even $720. Stock closed above its 200sma on July 20th on higher than average volume. That is when you should have bought. I was late and didnt buy until about $640 using options. The 50 sma is getting ready to cross the 200 sma giving you the perverbial golden cross. This will be another buy point if it breaks through on higher volume. One other bullish note is that it continues to go higher on above average volume and low days come on lower volume. This is not crashing I don't think.</Msg><Username>codplyr23</Username><Timestamp>1345211690339</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 09:54:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345212461088-11</Id><Title>We are at 52 week high. broke out... take out your asks.... we go much higher... don't short!!!!</Title><Msg>Head this warning....

It's simple and summed up in one word: Patents. Thank goodness for patents. Without patents the free market that we know of today would not exist. It's for this reason that Vringo (VRNG) bought Innovative Protect. Here it is, if you want a little backstory as to how Vringo, with a market cap of $189 million, could take on Google (GOOG), with a market cap of $218 billion. Recall the age of the dinosaurs when the Internet first came around. Search engines were popping up everywhere, and Internet companies were multiplying like rabbits.</Msg><Username>letitgrowknows</Username><Timestamp>1345216842311</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 11:20:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345216877317-18</Id><Topic><Title>Could Vringo Stock Jump 1,000%?

Sound familiar? Shortly after, Lycos bought the company that Ken Lang started, and he became its CTO. Then everyone knows what happened at the beginning of 2000. Almost every search engine died, and Lycos crumbled. Fast forward to today and somehow Lycos has managed to stay alive after being bought by Spanish telecom giant Telefónica (TEF) and then by a South Korean Telecommunications Company. With Lycos in shambles, Ken Lang bought back his patent for almost nothing and started another company I/P engine otherwise known as Innovative Protect. Here we are now today. Vringo merged with Innovative Protect and the cat is out of the box. A trial date of October 16 possibly ensues the most threatening case that Google has ever encountered. The patent trial targets Google's core search algorithm and how it displays ads described here. Now look at Vringo's suit here against Google. Vringo's suit is quite lengthy, but I agree with James Altucher, and I don't see a difference between the two. Here's something else you may or may not have known. Google generates 96-97% of its revenues from search ads. Forget about Chromebooks, Google+, or even Android. Google has yet to get away from search advertising and could be the death of it if they don't continue to screw over or buy off the little guys, like Ken Lang.</Msg><Username>letitgrowknows</Username><Timestamp>1345216877317</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 11:21:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345217039546-19</Id><Title>BLMN !!

GOOG stock has never had a run-up to reflect its huge Android Phone Success. Android now has 68% of worldwide SmartPhone market! 1 million new Android Phones activated worldwide every day. This is leading to HUGE growth in search Ad-Sales for GOOG, even as GOOG lowers its Ad-rates. And Apps Sales will soon be snowballing too. 2. GOOG got what it wanted from MOTOROLA (tons patents, far more than Apple or Microsoft has in mobile communications and smartphones), and now did Pruning of Motorola so it will even start adding to GOOG's cash-flow positive quarterly revenue stream. 3. GOOG has just introduced the fastest HI-CAPACITY INTERNET, direct-fiber connections for homeowners and business, in one test market: Kansas City MO. It is being well received. GOOG has its own nationwide FIBER BACKBONE CABLE SYSTEM FOR USA. Thus it can compete with the Cable Cos. offering far faster internet than copper-wire-coaxial-cable, at low price, making 10s Billions$ f or GOOG.</Msg><Username>aiwal1</Username><Timestamp>1345242576005</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 18:29:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345243907528-64</Id><Title>Lawsuites news AH</Title><Msg>Quite a few articles came out.

Can only be a positive for GOOG if any - see below</Title><Msg>Google's Motorola Files New Patent Complaint Against Apple 33 minutes ago - Dow Jones News By John Letzing Google Inc.'s (GOOG) Motorola Mobility unit said Friday it has filed a new claim with the U.S. International Trade Commission alleging that rival Apple Inc. (AAPL) has infringed seven of its patents. The patents relate to Apple devices including the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch, Motorola says. Motorola is seeking a ban on the import of those products made overseas. "We would like to settle these patent matters, but Apple's unwillingness to work out a license leaves us little choice but to defend ourselves and our engineers' innovations," a Motorola spokeswoman said in a statement. Motorola, which was acquired by Google in May, has a history of patent litigation with Apple--a battle that grew out of Apple's move further into Motorola's traditional market of wireless devices. Prior to its unveiling of the iPhone in 2007, Apple primarily had been a producer of desktop and notebook computers. Much of the squabbling between Motorola and Apple has involved so-called standards-essential patents, which are at the core of technology widely used in industries and are therefore expected to be licensed among firms on reasonable terms. However, none of the patents asserted by Motorola in its newest claim is a standards-essential patent.</Msg><Username>bigghowie</Username><Timestamp>1345244677362</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 19:04:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345245965462-67</Id><Title>Google NUTS...the HIGHER it goes ...the HARDER it will FALL...HEY, where's your $28 dividend anyway??... bwhahahahahaha!</Title><Msg>really!</Msg><Username>wallysworld18</Username><Timestamp>1345245965462</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 19:26:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345246534553-68</Id><Topic><Title>Google NUTS...the HIGHER it goes ...the HARDER it will FALL...HEY, where's your $28 dividend anyway??... bwhahahahahaha!</Title><Username>wallysworld18</Username><Timestamp>1345245965462</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 19:26:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I assume you're on the AAPL board spewing the same inane crap.

Face it, GOOG trades at 1/3 the PE Ratio it traded at in 2005, (meaning its earnings tripled) and the stocks only somewhat higher. Yet today, it has achieved so much more not yet reflected in the stock price: i. Past 3 years GOOG got majority of world-wide SmartPhone "eyeballs" doing search on it, as ANDROID has 68% of worldwide Smartphones! ii. GOOG is now starting to roll out high capacity Fiber Internet directly to homes, via its own Nationwide-Backbone High Capac. Fiber network. They will put the Cable Cos. out of business, who can't compete with low capacity copper cable.</Msg><Username>aiwal1</Username><Timestamp>1345252025325</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 21:07:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345252151803-74</Id><Title>Is this Start of GOOG Parabolic-Move, like AAPL had?</Title><Msg>The fundmentals support such.

Look at the chart. It jumped at fast at AAPL. RSI for GGOG is way overbought now. RSI for AAPL is also very high. Buy good stocks when they are oversold, not chasing when overbought because when they retrace they can retrace quickly too. Look at my messages, I said to buy MNST and FIRE when they were oversold and at them now. You could make tons more than GOOG or AAPL.</Msg><Username>cybercash28</Username><Timestamp>1345253546341</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 21:32:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345261195563-77</Id><Topic><Title>Is this Start of GOOG Parabolic-Move, like AAPL had?</Title><Username>aiwal1</Username><Timestamp>1345252151803</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 21:09:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I give GOOG another week or two before it fall like a rock.
