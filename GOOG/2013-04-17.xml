Ericsson (ERIC) just announced they are paying Microsoft (MSFT) almost $200mm to acquire their Mediaroom multi-screen video software in order to increase their multi-screen video reach by 11mm pay-TV households to 16mm for a 25% multi-screen market share. CCUR's MediaHawk multi-screen video delivery platform is superior to Mediaroom and CCUR multi-screen deals already signed with the #1 largest cable TV companies in Germany, Japan, and the UK. CCUR's huge multi-screen clients have a total of 14.8 million subscribers, which will make CCUR #2 in this space behind ERIC. CCUR only has 8.72mm o/s and is trading for only $6.94 with a market cap of $60.52 million. CCUR has $24.6 million in cash, giving CCUR an enterprise value of only $35.92 million, which is only 0.54X its annualized revenue of $66.4 million and only 4X its cash flow from operations over the last 3 quarters alone! CCUR's video business, which also has the #1 largest video-on-demand (VOD) market share with a global reach of 50mm households, is currently receiving zero value! CCUR spent $15 million to acquire their Media Data Intelligence (MDI) business, which tracks the viewing behavior of 35mm pay-TV subscribers for a 35% market share in its space. CCUR also owns a "real-time" high performance computer processor business that powers many simulator devices in the defense and aerospace industry. It has annualized revenue of $27.6 million with 4 of the top 5 defense contractors as clients. The value of these two businesses alone, most likely well exceed CCUR's current enterprise value! CCUR's multi-screen video delivery business with $33.8 million in annualized revenue is currently receiving no value, when it could potentially be worth anywhere from $50-$200 million based on what ERIC paid for Mediaroom!</Msg><Username>jowslir632</Username><Timestamp>1366203926449</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-17 09:05:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366204144162-17</Id><Topic><Title>Remember,,,be here on Thursday at 1530 hrs ...Option time to TEST new STRATEGY</Title><Username>biglefthook_00</Username><Timestamp>1366111072956</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 07:17:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ON Thursday at 1530, if you are a shareholder, you can sell the Jan 2014 market price covered call for $60 a share then buy the following week's market price call and put for $30 or MAY monthly options for $45+...pocketing the $15 differential. the May options give you action up and down using MARKET'S MONEY.

MSFT is settling with Vringo as we speak. MSFT might buy Vringo any day, which would spell trouble for Google ad revenues which is in 100's of billions of dollars. Google stole Vringo patents to gain the revenue, so why not pay back some to setlle or buy them out? It would be a very smart move, IMO.</Msg><Username>referee0e</Username><Timestamp>1366220624839</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-17 13:43:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366221275729-51</Id><Topic><Title>GOOGLE'S APPS ONLY WORK PROPERLY IF THEY ARE STOLEN!

If the results beat estimates, the 50 DMA of $807 may be taken out. However, if there is disappointment, the 200 DMA of $745 may be tested. The next few quarters will be even more interesting as the Glass will be out, and a good response will add significantly to confidence. On the flip side, if it turns out to be a damp squip (more of a funky eyewear rather than a useful gadget), the sentiment may be shaken. Google has been under fire for its privacy policy and its alleged arrogant attitude in handling some patent infringement lawsuits. The lawsuits are going on around the world and the company is in the process of settlement / litigation with the EU on its privacy policy and abuse of dominance. Its lawsuit against Vringo (VRNG) is also entering a decisive phase and there was some good news on this front for Google yesterday. Even companies like Facebook (FB) and LinkedIn (LNKD) are facing lawsuits by smaller companies like Bascom Research. The company is owned by Lexington Technology Group (LTG) which is in the process of a merger with Document Security System (NYSE:DSS). As per a report published by patent lawsuits researcher JP Moreno, “The next generation of the internet, referred to by many as “web 3.0”, involves many advanced concepts including open technologies and distributed databases. The Bascom patent portfolio is at the heart of this intelligent evolution.”. Similarly, with Glass, Google has to remain extra careful. There is a good probability that it will receive numerous applications requesting for licensing, with some threatening to file lawsuits for infringements. This is because patent monetization has become a business model in itself, and the bigger technology companies are the prime targets.</Msg><Username>investora2z</Username><Timestamp>1366223605779</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-17 14:33:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366223850905-58</Id><Title>BLUE CALYPSO INC. $.19 + $.04</Title><Msg>Penny stock up and moving fast towards a $.25 a share.cuffs</Msg><Username>kingcuffs</Username><Timestamp>1366223850905</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-17 14:37:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366225902035-59</Id><Topic><Title>Facebook "HOME".</Title><Username>europe_and_usa</Username><Timestamp>1366214752415</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-17 12:05:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hair cut tomorrow................</Msg><Username>europe_and_usa</Username><Timestamp>1366225902035</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-17 15:11:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366226090468-60</Id><Title>WAFR is the next big gainer</Title><Msg>The RSI on WAFR makes me think it is about to take off.
