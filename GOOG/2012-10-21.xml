The forecast, completed by BIA/Kelsey, pegs mobile search growth at an astounding 77.2 percent, followed by online video at 51.6 percent and social media growth at 26.3 percent. "We continue to see a dramatic increase in spending on online media and it is fundamentally changing the media planning and buying process for advertisers," said Mark Fratrik, vice president and chief economist, BIA/Kelsey. "As businesses examine their advertising opportunities, the trend is moving toward building a coordinated ad plan across different platforms, with different messages across different media. With traditional media getting more than three-quarters of the total local media ad budget, coordination between traditional and online media is the best way to explore how to effectively optimize new media, such as social networks and online video, to increase the chance of achieving business goals." Local Corp is the biggest winners from mobile of all Nasdaq-shares: Mobile traffic also continued to grow, representing over 24.5 million MUVs during the third quarter 2012, up over 274 percent from 6.6 million MUVs during the year ago period.</Msg><Username>flankenking</Username><Timestamp>1350811003843</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-21 05:16:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350812202002-11</Id><Topic><Title>Billionaires Love these 5 stocks</Title><Username>rightdon53</Username><Timestamp>1348905484509</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 03:58:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Time to by on deeps is coming.</Msg><Username>tomsaga25</Username><Timestamp>1350812202002</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-21 05:36:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350815442547-12</Id><Title>Goog Has been doing everything wrong lately.time for Jeff to go BYE BYE</Title><Msg>GET RID OF THAT CEO, REALLY SCREWING THINGS UP</Msg><Username>audsct97</Username><Timestamp>1350815442547</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-21 06:30:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350815715739-13</Id><Topic><Title>Goog Has been doing everything wrong lately.time for Jeff to go BYE BYE</Title><Username>audsct97</Username><Timestamp>1350815442547</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-21 06:30:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What a #$%$ a&amp;&amp;hole...Jeff, get a freeking job you piece of dog crab.</Msg><Username>whettpharts</Username><Timestamp>1350815715739</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-21 06:35:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350815846626-14</Id><Title>All Joos should be placed in woodchipers feet first.</Title><Msg>Lying manipulating deceiving pigs...especially on Options Fing Action..my god, no wonder the country in broke.</Msg><Username>whettpharts</Username><Timestamp>1350815846626</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-21 06:37:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350815991953-15</Id><Title>Google CEO just sold 150,000,000</Title><Msg>His time has passed..Its the truth we all know it,We need a new direction for goog,at that direction is vringoogle</Msg><Username>audsct97</Username><Timestamp>1350815991953</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-21 06:39:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350816102392-16</Id><Title>Vringo + Google += Vringoogle</Title><Msg>FTC FTC FTC should i keep going ?ok VRINGOOOOOOO</Msg><Username>audsct97</Username><Timestamp>1350816102392</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-21 06:41:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350816924957-17</Id><Title>good post whettpharts</Title><Msg>long and strong vringo</Msg><Username>audsct97</Username><Timestamp>1350816924957</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-21 06:55:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350818726946-18</Id><Topic><Title>Billionaires Love these 5 stocks</Title><Username>rightdon53</Username><Timestamp>1348905484509</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 03:58:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>According to S&amp;P's own web site, the Q3 scorecard, so far, is 68 beats, 31 misses and 16 ties</Msg><Username>lindontomson</Username><Timestamp>1350818726946</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-21 07:25:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350819303912-19</Id><Title>Meeting with Iran is how naive Obama truly is</Title><Msg>Just before the debate imagine that. Obama regime acclaiming Obama the community organizer offers to meet with Iran. Remember Chamberlain of WWII vintage as he met with Hitler signing a peace accord that resulted in England being bombed to the ground months later. Or Jammy Carter and the Camp David Peace Accords getting Anwar Saddat assassinated in a military coupe a month later. This IS TRULY HOW NAIVE THE COMMUNITY ORGANIZER AND HIS REGIME ARE. They truly believe this will throw Romney off his game Monday night and get this most failed empty suit Obama off the hook. All it will do is give Bob Shieffer (dem hack) more ammo to shift the argument and focus off Obama but Romney loves the USA too much to roll over to the SCAM OF LEFT WING LAME STREAM MSM CO-ARM OF DEM PARTY. Enemies of USA will always seek to sign fake peace accords under such weak Presidents as Obama then as they saying goes 'one day they will send us a 50 megaton peace bullet' and if you doubt it think again about Chamberlain and poor Anwar Saddat who bore the full burden of such failed, weak leaders as Obama. WASHINGTON (AP) — The White House says it is prepared to talk one-on-one with Iran to find a diplomatic settlement to the impasse over Tehran's reported pursuit of nuclear weapons, but there's no agreement now to meet. National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor said Saturday that President Barack Obama has made clear that he will prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon and will do whatever's necessary to block that from happening. Vietor said Iran must come in line with its obligations, or else faced increased pressure. "The onus is on the Iranians to do so, otherwise they will continue to face crippling sanctions and increased pressure," Vietor said in a statement. He noted that efforts to get Iran back to the table with the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council and Germany — the so-called "P5+1" — continue. Iran has been a recurring issue in the presidential election campaign and Vietor's statement was released shortly after The New York Times reported Saturday that the U.S. and Iran have agreed in principle for the first time to negotiations. The paper said Iran has insisted the talks wait until after the Nov. 6 election. Vietor, however, denied that any such agreement had been reached. "It's not true that the United States and Iran have agreed to one-on-one talks or any meeting after the American elections," he said. "We continue to work with the P5+1 on a diplomatic solution and have said from the outset that we that we would be prepared to meet bilaterally." Obama and Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney will meet Monday night in a debate focusing on foreign policy and Iran's nuclear ambitions will likely be a topic. Obama has said he'll prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. He hopes sanctions alongside negotiations can get Iran to halt uranium enrichment. But the strategy, which began during President George W. Bush's administration, hasn't worked yet. Obama holds out the threat of military action as a last resort. Romney has accused Obama of being weak on Iran and says the U.S. needs to present a greater military threat. Despite unprecedented global penalties, Iran's nuclear program is advancing as it continues to defy international pressure, including four rounds of sanctions from the U.N. Security Council, to prove that its atomic intentions are peaceful. Those sanctions, coupled with tough measures imposed by the United States and European nations are taking their toll, particularly on Iran's economy. Iranian authorities have in recent weeks been forced to quell protests over the plummeting value of the country's currency. The rial lost nearly 40 percent of its value against the U.S. dollar in a week in early October, but has since slightly rebounded. U.S. officials say they are hopeful that pressure from the sanctions may be pushing Iran's leaders toward concessions, including direct talks with the United States. But several said on Saturday that they did not believe such discussions would happen any time soon. If one-on-one talks are to occur, they would likely follow the model that the U.S. has used in six-nation nuclear disarmament talks with North Korea, the officials said. In those discussions, U.S. negotiators have met separately with their North Korean counterparts but only as part of the larger effort, which also involves China, Japan, South Korea and Russia. Direct U.S.-North Korean talks are preceded and followed by intense consultations with the other members of the group. However, the direct talks with North Korea have yet to bear fruit and U.S. officials warned that talks with Iran may not yield anything either. If U.S.-Iran talks do occur, they would likely be part of the P5+1 process, which groups the Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States and is overseen by the European Union. The group has met numerous times with Iranian officials but has yet to achieve any significant progress. In late September, the group instructed EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton to reach out to Iran's top nuclear negotiator, Saeed Jalili, to organize another meeting. No date had been set for the possible resumption of talks. Iran says its program is for peaceful energy and research purposes but Western nations fear the Islamic republic is determined to develop nuclear weapons and fundamentally reshape the balance of power in the Middle East. That would pose a grave threat to Israel. Israel has threatened to strike Iran's nuclear facilities if Tehran doesn't stop uranium enrichment a process that can be a pathway to nuclear arms. Israel could decide to strike Iran's nuclear sites on its own, and Israeli leaders say time to act is running out. They have also hinted they would like U.S. support for any such attack. An Israeli strike on Iran with or without Washington's involvement would likely draw retribution from Tehran including possible attacks on U.S. and Israeli interests overseas or disruptions to the transit of tankers through the Strait of Hormuz, which could send oil prices skyrocketing. Obama has counseled patience as public as American public support for another Mideast conflict is low with the Iraq war over and the conflict in Afghanistan winding down. ___ Associated Press writers Matthew Lee and Andrew Miga contributed to this report. ..</Msg><Username>omni1tsd</Username><Timestamp>1350819303912</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-21 07:35:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350821759227-20</Id><Title>Dems scrambling to cover Obama in Monday's debate</Title><Msg>Watching Chris Hayes on MSLSD as the 'panel' of dem hacks lay cover for Obama in the Monday Night Debate acclaiming citizens in Benghazi now say "it was the video."

Although I don’t usually use “Truth-Out” as a source, their article (though heavily nuanced) has a pretty good encapsulation of what we might see: Speaking from the White House, President Barack Obama announced today that all US troops in Iraq would be withdrawn by the end of the year. The final drawdown will leave behind thousands of private security contractors and State Department employees…. Between 4,500 and 5,000 private security contractors will remain in Iraq to protect two US consulates and the embassy in Baghdad, according to Denis McDonough, Obama's deputy national security adviser. The State Department will have 16,000 civilian employees on the ground in Iraq and is preparing for its largest overseas operation since the end of World War II, according to a Washington Post report. The Washington Post article talks more about the role that the State Department will be playing in a post-Military Iraq, comparing it charitably with the Marshall Plan: The State Department is racing against an end-of-year deadline to take over Iraq operations from the U.S. military, throwing together buildings and marshaling contractors in its biggest overseas operation since the effort to rebuild Europe after World War II. Attention in Washington and Baghdad has centered on the number of U.S. troops that could remain in Iraq. But those forces will be dwarfed by an estimated 16,000 civilians under the American ambassador — the size of an Army division. And what is the scope of what these folks will be doing? Well, pretty diverse: The list of responsibilities the State Department will pick up from the military is daunting. It will have to provide security for the roughly 1,750 traditional embassy personnel — diplomats, aid workers, Treasury employees and so on — in a country rocked by daily bombings and assassinations. To do so, the department is contracting about 5,000 security personnel. They will protect the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad plus two consulates, a pair of support sites at Iraqi airports and three police-training facilities. The department will also operate its own air service — the 46-aircraft Embassy Air Iraq — and its own hospitals, functions the U.S. military have been performing. About 4,600 contractors, mostly non-American, will provide cooking, cleaning, medical care and other services. Rounding out the civilian presence will be about 4,600 people scattered over 10 or 11 sites, where Iraqis will be instructed on how to use U.S. military equipment their country has purchased. So, are we just taking out military folks, and just replacing them with ex-military folks that have gone on to work for the Private Military Firms? Yeah, that’s about it. Remember that the stumbling block for the Obama plan to keep between 3-5,000 folks in Iraq was the immunity issue with the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA). Baldly stated, this meant that US Troops who committed an illegal act in the country was immune from being charged by the host country, and would rather be charged by the United States, back here. However, contractors come with their own set of problems. For instance, how might a civilian contractor employed by the State Department be eligible for diplomatic immunity? A great article at CNN lays out some of the intrinsic problems: For years, thousands of civilian contractors have worked in Iraq operating in a variety of military and support functions. But they have always lacked the same criminal immunity from Iraqi laws that the U.S. military enjoys under existing agreements between the two countries. And for the most part, they operated under the purview of the Defense Department. While contractors would be subject to the Iraqi criminal justice system as they always have, ambiguities will still exist as to how they would also be held accountable under U.S. law if a situation similar to the 2007 incident involving contractors working for Blackwater (now operating as Xe Services) were to occur. The issues surrounding their presence in Iraq are likely to become only more complex when U.S. troops do pull out and leave the oversight of the entire contracting force to the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. "What the State Department does is diplomacy, and you're going to have the State Department managing contractors that are going to be flying helicopters, driving MRAP's, medevac-ing wounded personnel," Richard Fontaine, and expert on contracting issues with the Center for a New American Security, told CNN. It will be interesting to see how all that shakes out. Essentially it is accepted that War in Iraq is over, but if you simply switch out contractors for the military, it begs the question if anything has changed. Despite the obvious up-front cost of contractors, in the long run, the costs are mitigated by the fact that a cook or trigger-puller for a private military firm doesn’t have the extensive train-up costs and retirement benefits that their military brethren have. Of course, when you pay a guy $200,000 a year (like the DynCorps guys on Karzai’s protective detail were getting) you don’t as much have to look forward to your retirement as you do when you are only making 50k.</Msg><Username>omni1tsd</Username><Timestamp>1350827863653</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-21 09:57:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350828407307-24</Id><Title>OBAMA ON MY MIND</Title><Msg>You have obama of the brain lol. 4 more years should do you good!!

If the law takes full effect, it will devastate small businesses and destroy any chance for a sustainable economic recovery. It will add trillions of dollars to the national debt and push the country toward bankruptcy even faster than current projections. Any individual who believes that this decision must be overturned must do everything possible to undo the damage that has been done, especially at the ballot box on November 6. –Obamacare law contains 20 new or higher taxes on American families and small businesses– WASHINGTON, DC – Obamacare contains 20 new or higher taxes on American families and small businesses. Arranged by their respective effective dates, below is the total list of all $500 billion-plus in tax hikes (over the next ten years) in Obamacare, where to find them in the bill, and how much your taxes are scheduled to go up as of today: Taxes that took effect in 2010: 1.

Bain didn't build that new factory -- the Chinese Government Did October 20, 2012 | Mitt romney has made Obama's out-of-context “you didn't build that” quote a central theme of his campaign. It's ironic, as Mitt Romney is going to profit just before the election when Bain-owned Sensata Technologies moves 170 high-tech jobs from Freeport, Illinois, to a plant in China built for the firm by the Chinese government. Sensata enjoyed record revenues last year – this isn't about making the “hard choices” necessary to save a failing enterprise. The workers in Freeport have been working 24 hours a day, in three shifts. They make $14-17 per hour, with benefits. According to a report by the Institute for Global Labour and Human Rights, one of Bain's first actions after buying Sensata was to set up “12 Sensata/Bain capital funds 'organized under the laws of the Cayman Islands' so as to avoid paying taxes.” They'll get a small tax break for relocating the plant – the one Mitt Romney insisted did not exist during the first debate – and then use those offshore funds to defer taxes on some of the income the company generates. American tax-payers, on the other hand, have paid $780,000 to retrain some of Sensata's laid off workers in Illinois, according to the New York Times . One would be hard pressed to come up with a clearer example of capturing private gains while socializing the costs. Mitt Romney is not directly involved in Bain Capital, but he did build its business model. In 1998, when he was actively running Bain, he personally visited the Global-Tech Appliances plant in Dongguan, China. He witnessed, personally, the horrific conditions the plant's workers were toiling in for .24 cents an hour, and didn't hesitate to invest millions in the firm." -Alternet dot org. "Romney's Bain Capital Is Sending a Bunch of High-Tech Jobs to China on the Day Before the Election. The story of Sensata Technologies is about the hollowing out of America's economy by a rapacious 1 percent. October 16, 2012 | On the day before an election that's supposed to hinge on jobs, taxes and the middle class, Bain Capital, the company Mitt Romney founded, will close the doors of a factory in Freeport, Illinois, and ship 170 good, high-tech jobs to China. The employees of Sensata Technologies were forced to train their Chinese replacements, and the American flag that long flew over the factory was reportedly removed while the Chinese engineers were visiting the site. A group of workers have set up camp across from the factory -- calling it “Bainport” -- and some supporters have tried to block the trucks hauling equipment out of the plant. According to Dave Johnson , there have been several arrests. Sensata workers have asked to meet with Mitt Romney and hoped to enlist his help keeping their jobs in the United States, but he has refused, instead remaining on the campaign trail where he speaks often about “getting tough” with China. The most important part of the story is that Sensata Technologies is profitable operating in Illinois. Net income last year was $355 million, up 16 percent from 2010. The company reported total revenues of $1.8 billion in 2011, up almost 19 percent from the year before. According to a company financial statement , “both 2011 net revenue and adjusted net income represent record levels for the company.” So this has nothing to do with “making hard choices” in the process of turning around a failing business, which is how the Romney campaign describes Bain's corporate raiding. Bain's partners are looking for a modest boost in profits by locating the plant closer to the booming Asian automotive market (Sensata makes high-tech automotive parts). They'll get a small tax break for relocating the plant – the one Mitt Romney insisted did not exist during the first debate – and possibly defer taxes on some of the income the company generates. It takes both capital and labor to make a successful business like Sensata Technologies. In order to make a few more bucks, 170 of the people who helped make the company thrive will be cast aside like so much trash. The layoffs will surely have a ripple-effect in Freeport – a town of 25,000 with a declining population and a poverty rate well above the national average. The move is the epitome of corporate America's lack of patriotism – it's capital unmoored from any sense of responsibility for the people that make the profits or the communities where they live. The city passed a resolution Monday asking Romney to intervene. But the Sensata story has, so far, had little impact on the presidential race, mostly because Mitt Romney has no direct involvement in the operations of the company he established (despite continuing to make millions as a “passive retired partner”). But this is reading the story of Bain Capital too narrowly. Mitt Romney is directly responsible for its business model. As Tom Gaulrapp -- a lifelong resident of Freeport and 33-year employee of Sensata – told the Huffington Post's Amanda Terkel, “They're still using his business model. He's the one who taught them how to do this. These guys were put there by him. So you can say he doesn't run the day-to-day operations, but he's still at blame for the way they do business." Mitt Romney started the firm, and built it up on a strategy of buying firms with little money down, loading them with debt, raiding their pension funds and breaking their unions and then “harvesting them” – in his words – for a profit. Romney is the only person to ever serve as Bain's CEO – since his departure, the firm has been run by a managing committee. The story is bigger than Sensata, and bigger than Bain. The issue is the turn America's corporate culture has taken, and what the consequences of its model are for our economy and, indeed, our society. And it is Mitt Romney's embrace of that model – ravage capitalism that is loyal to no nation-state and blind to every human virtue but profit – that should be disqualifying. In the New York Times , Chrystia Freeland, author of “Plutocrats: The Rise of the New Global Super-Rich and the Fall of Everyone Else,” wrote about the historical tendency of elites to self-destruct by extracting wealth from the broader community to such a degree that the society becomes dysfunctional and mired by social problems. She recalls how the Venetians became the most prosperous society in the world during the 14th century by opening their economy to a broad swath of the population. Then, at the height of its golden age, “the upper class acted to lock in its privileges, putting a formal stop to social mobility with the publication of the Libro d’Oro, or Book of Gold, an official register of the nobility. If you weren’t on it, you couldn’t join the ruling oligarchy.” She then notes parallels to the United States, which featured one of the most egalitarian economies through much of the last century, but is now plagued by rising inequality and decreasing economic mobility. She writes: The 1 percent cannot evade its share of responsibility for the growing gulf in American society. Economic forces may be behind the rising inequality, but as Peter R. Orszag, President Obama’s former budget chief, told me, public policy has exacerbated rather than mitigated these trends. Even as the winner-take-all economy has enriched those at the very top, their tax burden has lightened. Tolerance for high executive compensation has increased, even as the legal powers of unions have been weakened and an intellectual case against them has been relentlessly advanced by plutocrat-financed think tanks. In the 1950s, the marginal income tax rate for those at the top of the distribution soared above 90 percent, a figure that today makes even Democrats flinch. Meanwhile, of the 400 richest taxpayers in 2009, 6 paid no federal income tax at all, and 27 paid 10 percent or less. None paid more than 35 percent... Educational attainment, which created the American middle class, is no longer rising. The super-elite lavishes unlimited resources on its children, while public schools are starved of funding. This is the new [Venice]. An elite education is increasingly available only to those already at the top. Bill Clinton and Barack Obama enrolled their daughters in an exclusive private school; I’ve done the same with mine. Much of this is the result of the 30-year assault on organized labor. It's worth noting that Sensata Technologies is a non-union shop, which is a big reason the firm can move profitable operations abroad without much resistance. Employment, in raw jobs numbers, should not be the defining issue of this election viewed in isolation. We also need to consider what kinds of jobs are being created. A recent study conducted by the National Employment Law Project (NELP) found that while only 21 percent of the jobs lost during the recession were low-paying (with median hourly wages from $7.69 to $13.83), a majority of those created during the recovery – 58 percent – have come with such low wages. These trends are not Mitt Romney's doing, but he is the walking, talking personification of what's been happening in the American economy. Mitt Romney was an innovator in offshoring. He and his family will make a few more dollars as a result of shipping those jobs to China, at the expense of the workers who “built that” in the first place. That's why the story of Sensata Technologies should have an impact in this race. -Endquote. -Alternet dot org</Msg><Username>sunnsailor</Username><Timestamp>1350862605227</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-21 19:36:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350862947383-60</Id><Title>What is the difference between BUSH and ROMNEY ..?</Title><Msg>..
