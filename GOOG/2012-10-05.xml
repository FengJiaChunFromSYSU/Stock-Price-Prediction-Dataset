Oct 4, 2012 Google warns of more Motorola cuts, revises up third quarter bill By Alexei Oreskovic | Reuters (Reuters) - Google Inc raised its estimate of the cost of job cuts at its money-losing Motorola Mobility unit in the third quarter and warned of "significant" additional charges from further restructuring. Severance-related charges at its mobile phone unit will be 9 percent higher at $300 million, Google said, adding the bill may rise another $40 million in the quarter after the exit of facilities and markets. But many investors and analysts have questioned Google's need to be in the hardware business, where profit margins are lower and Google has little experience. "There's some lack of fully understanding beyond those patents what there is for Google to do with Motorola," said Needham &amp; Company analyst Kerry Rice. "Investors have been waiting to see if Google keeps it as is, or makes any drastic changes by selling off certain divisions or manufacturing operations," Rice said. ------------------------- Feb 2010: Google's involvement with MediaTek WERE unanticipated By casp321 .

Permalink Reuters REUTERS " VRNG POSITIVE MOVE TO SHOW GREATER STRENGTH TO GOOGLE" link Vringo Boosts Balance Sheet to $55 Million - Bolstering Its Position for Sizable Settlement * Reuters is not responsible for the content in this press release. Fri Oct 5, 2012 9:30am EDT Vringo, Inc. (VRNG) announced that they have raised $45 Million as part of a straight equity deal just two days after a U.S. court ordered defendants Google Inc. (GOOG), AOL, Inc. (AOL), IAC/InterActiveCorp. (IACI), Target Corporation (TGT), and Gannett Co., Inc. (GCI) to engage in Settlement Discussions with Vringo next Tuesday, October 9. The court denied the defense team's request for a Summary Judgment stating there were "genuine issues of material fact in dispute". A settlement may be reached at the Settlement Conference. If not, the trial is set to begin on October 16.The substantial money raise is seen mostly as a positive move by Vringo's management given that the firm is now armed with $55 million in cash, and can therefore show far greater strength in negotiating a larger settlement with Google. If the parties cannot reach a settlement next week, Vringo is scheduled to meet Google in court where they will seek a potential multi-billion award.</Msg><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1349451212767</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 11:33:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349451228788-49</Id><Title>Stifel Nicolaus moves price target!</Title><Msg>drop coming</Msg><Username>riskreversal777</Username><Timestamp>1349451228788</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 11:33:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349451596075-50</Id><Title>Some1 just bought a large Oct.

Well, that's handy for the media and the Obama campaign, but it's not just "conservatives" who are confused by a full 0.3% drop in unemployment when only 114k jobs were created. CNBC is as confused as the rest of us: Job growth remained tame in September, with the economy creating just 114,000 net new positions though the unemployment rate fell to 7.8 percent, the first time it has been below 8 percent in 43 months. The report presented a slew of contradictory data points, with the total employment level soaring despite the low net number. The falling jobless rate had been a function as much of the continued shrinking in the labor force as it was an increase in new positions. On the air, CNBC seemed equally perplexed by the biggest one-time drop in the unemployment rate in 29 years! ABC News' Chris Cuomo is also skeptical of the numbers: -- Chris Cuomo✔ @ChrisCuomo #unemployment is at 7.8% in September. Except it really wasn't. It is much higher, w/ underemplyd and those who stopped looking. #notfixed</Msg><Username>omni1tsd</Username><Timestamp>1349468453549</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 16:20:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349479986153-84</Id><Topic><Title>AAPL will destroy the market</Title><Username>jgiled</Username><Timestamp>1349466623272</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 15:50:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What does Fast Money know?

Google: Vringo Wins (By And Large) The MILs October 5, 2012 | 8 commentsby: SteveKimLaw | about: VRNG, includes: GOOG Disclosure: I am long VRNG. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. (More...) The Court's order on the very important MILs in Vringo (VRNG) vs. Google (GOOG) was issued today. Unfortunately, I am getting ready to hop on a plane, so I can't analyze these fully, but here is my quick take on some very interesting rulings on the important motions in limine. In brief, it appears to me as though order on the motions in limine generally favor Vringo. From my brief review, it looks as though the MILs were decided very significantly in Vringo's favor. The two items (MSJ and MILs) that were called out as "important things" in my first article have now been decided, either favorably to Vringo, or in a manner that creates significant leverage towards settlement. On balance, this was a very good day for Vringo. $45 million in their pockets to show their ability to fight this to the end, and some great rulings (and even great reserved rulings) on the MILs.</Msg><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1349482984107</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 20:23:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349487215831-87</Id><Title>_ GOOGLE SPLIT TO BE ANNOUNCED ON EARNINGS RELEASE DATE _</Title><Msg>???</Msg><Username>yexemew</Username><Timestamp>1349487215831</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 21:33:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349487295639-88</Id><Topic><Title>_ GOOGLE SPLIT TO BE ANNOUNCED ON EARNINGS RELEASE DATE _</Title><Username>yexemew</Username><Timestamp>1349487215831</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 21:33:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nothing better than having TWICE as many GOOG shares at HALF the pre-split stock price!!!</Msg><Username>yexemew</Username><Timestamp>1349487295639</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 21:34:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349493198280-89</Id><Title>New Galaxy problems arises at samsung</Title><Msg>Virus slows the system and it takes few mintutes to upload the screen.They have flaws also.
