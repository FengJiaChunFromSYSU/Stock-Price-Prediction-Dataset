Programmatic platforms and DIY advertising tools promise the opportunity to reach a target audience at scale, using technology that eliminates the untold hours advertisers would otherwise have to spend contacting sales teams from publisher sites around the country or the world. But not all of these large-scale programmatic offerings solve the problems advertisers have in reaching their target audiences in local markets. Facebook and many other platforms use geo-targeting and publicly available user data to serve ads to the intended audience, but they don’t offer the opportunity to specifically target the kinds of publisher sites and vertical category pages where those ads will appear. If consumers aren’t seeing your ads — if they’re not positioned above the fold or adjacent to relevant content — the money you’ve spent for that inventory is wasted. From a branding perspective, it’s valuable for your ads to appear alongside content in trusted media sources, and on sites that cater to markets and verticals valuable to the advertiser. Advertisers and brands are increasingly acknowledging the merits of advertising on the local level, with local online advertising predicted to rise from $23.7 billion to $25.7 billion by the end of 2013.</Msg><Username>flankenking</Username><Timestamp>1372586026223</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-30 05:53:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372588270945-7</Id><Topic><Title>Facebook and many other platforms don’t offer the opportunity to specifically target like offers of Local Corp with premium content</Title><Username>flankenking</Username><Timestamp>1372586026223</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-30 05:53:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Premium networks like Local Corp can guarantee placement adjacent to the content users most desire Premium content adjacency: Above-the-fold inventory adjacent to premium content — the content most relevant to and valued by users — will always be premium inventory. It’s increasingly important to make sure your ads appear alongside premium content, and simple branding backs that up, with more than 60 percent of agencies and marketers saying premium content assists branding objectives. When consumers notice your ads near the targeted content they value, they’re more inclined to feel an affinity to your brand, which has a halo effect that spreads wherever else they go. Premium networks can guarantee placement adjacent to the content users most desire.</Msg><Username>flankenking</Username><Timestamp>1372588270945</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-30 06:31:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372589121451-8</Id><Title>bank....rup..ty</Title><Msg>gouge..gouge....thiefs... pic....opti...cal....usion use..ry..... five..arat....soeast...hulet...an d....z...0 hahahaha</Msg><Username>boldchris</Username><Timestamp>1372589121451</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-30 06:45:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372595844514-9</Id><Topic><Title>bank....rup..ty</Title><Username>boldchris</Username><Timestamp>1372589121451</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-30 06:45:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Do you mean bankruptcy, idiot.?

What I find interesting is that GOOG's ~1% return for the month of June 2013 is the weakest 3rd month return in a 3-month winning streak ever recorded in its history? That is, if you simply measure GOOG's performance in the 3rd month of what was a 3-month winning streak (such as January 2013 or September 2013 as recent examples) you'll see that this past month of June is the weakest GOOG has ever performed. I interpret this as more confirmation that there is a pause in the uptrend here and the path of least resistance remains lower. I'm looking for $800-$825 ahead of its July earnings. Thursday's high of $884.69 is key resistance and above that is $891. Moves above both of those levels are required to reset the chart and have me targeting new all time highs during July.</Msg><Username>watchhimtradedotcom</Username><Timestamp>1372639514826</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-30 20:45:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message></Date>
