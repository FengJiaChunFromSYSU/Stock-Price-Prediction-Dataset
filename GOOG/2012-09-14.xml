I respect Romney's business expertise in being able to launch Bain Capital with several friends (all rich today like I want to be) and they went head on with the big boys (i.e. Chase Bank etc.) and beat them at their own games. For once the small guy won and he earned it all. In an LBO they indeed seize companies nearly about to go under as well as firms struggling but have a chance for great success (i.e. Bain's main success story Staples.) In an LBO they then utilize the assets of the obvious failing firms to strengthen the ones with chances to make it. It's a great business philosophy yet the internet is predominated with negative stories (all dem laden Lame Stream venues) trying to destroy Romney as they did Palin. Wow folks in this nation are so IMAGE ONLY driven. I sure wish I'd of had the expertise or leader like Romney in the 80's when LBO's were very popular. Notice how Lame Stream never mentions that fact but only attacks Romney. We need another rich guy at the helm but not a dem at heart like the Bush's. I say that because I lost all confidence in Bush when he and McCain approved the first Pelosi Congress request for the TARP auto bailout. I prayed then Bush would veto it but he caved because he's a Democratic Socialist type of guy(The Road to Serfdom.') Indeed we are well down that road and this is our LAST chance to turn off. The Lame Stream MSM and Obama make being successful a sin. To heck with them, I want to be Romney!!!! Rich people create jobs and deserve all the tax breaks they can be afforded (i.e. the top 20% already pay 94% of the taxes.) People in this nation are blinded by the Lame Stream MSM co-arm of the dem party hype.</Msg><Username>omni1tsd</Username><Timestamp>1347619676182</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 06:47:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347623023207-9</Id><Topic><Title>Uncle Ben Bernanke doing all he can to assist Obama</Title><Username>obamadungdufus</Username><Timestamp>1347576300635</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-13 18:45:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Correct. But let’s not also forget he was reappointed by Barack 'Hussein' Obama II... Besides, given what we now know, I highly doubt it that W would have ever reappointed him even during one of his more lucid moments. BTW, in case you’re wondering the 1st version (of NObama) escaped his ex-KGB and now Al-Qaida sponsored terrorist indoctrinated scientists shortly after being created by them in one of their underground labs somewhere in present day southern Turkmenistan and hasn’t been seen or heard from since, which probably helps explain some of the confusion surrounding “the teleprompter…” and now “APOLOGIZERS in chiefs” true nationality. And as far as that publicity hogging Keynesian lunatic goes, the only thing that can be said is that Helicopter Ben won’t be satisfied until the USD tanks to zero, loses its world reserve currency status thus causing rates to explode much higher and thereby creating a debt crisis here which will make those in present day Europe and especially in Greece look tame in comparison. So get your wheel barrels ready because we’re going to do one better than the 1930s Weimar Republic in German. After all, who wouldn’t want to pay $20 per gallon of gas if it would guarantee the creation of ‘one’ job (in) the this country—even one flipping burgers, because so far Bennie has borrowed &amp; wasted $4 trillion ($1.6 million worth on every adult in this country) and has utterly failed to do so! S#it we would be better off if the #$%$ just hand it over to those millions of Americans instead. But then again what do you expect from an ex-vampire squid alumnus?

Acer from launching a phone in China using an operating system that competes with Google’s Android. The item was buried beneath the massive coverage of Apple’s iPhone 5 launch and might have gone unnoticed. But it caught my attention. Acer, a Taiwanese hardware maker, is the number four PC maker worldwide and sells a lot of computers and a few Android phone on the Mainland. The company is looking for ways to get further involved in the high-mobility business (all day computing with a smartphone, tablet, or small notebook). One way to accomplish this goal is to work with Alibaba, the Chinese search, social networking, and eCommerce company, which has its own smartphone operating system, Aliyun.</Msg><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1347630619675</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 09:50:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347631027090-20</Id><Title>FB</Title><Msg>Facebook, Inc. operates as a social networking company worldwide.

PC maker Acer has announced it will begin shipping a netbook running Google's Android operating system in the third quarter of this year, opening another front in the battle for market share between the two tech giants. Historically, Microsoft owned a 90% share of the worldwide operating system market. But the introduction of Android, originally developed as an OS for smartphones, to the netbook market could present a major threat to Microsoft's bottom line in that sector. Microsoft charges about $20 per netbook for use of its Windows XP operating system. Google charges nothing, making Android an attractive option for netbook makers competing to offer the least expensive option. Acer's Netbook, the Aspire One, will run both Android and Windows XP and will allow users to switch between the two. (But this of course begs the question: What will become of Linux?) Microsoft will release Windows 7 around the same time Acer ships the new Aspire One, and a stripped down version of the new OS will be released for netbooks. But some analysts think Microsoft may have to lower the price of Windows 7 to make it competitive with the open-source Android, which device manufacturers can tweak to best suit their devices.</Msg><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1347631438622</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 10:03:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347631668326-22</Id><Topic><Title>Taiwan PC Maker mentions GOOG as viable alternative to Microsoft</Title><Username>chall12180</Username><Timestamp>1256900079000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2009-10-30 06:54:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sep 13, 2012 Google to Acer: Use another OS on your phones and you'll regret it Tyler Holman Google isn’t feeling very comfortable with the thought of its OEM partners trying out other OSes behind its back.

The U.S. search giant, Alibaba alleges, was not pleased about Acer’s decision to work with a company pushing its own operating system rather than the Google-backed Android.</Msg><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1347632538189</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 10:22:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347632588677-27</Id><Topic><Title>ARM blames Adobe Flash for smartbook delays</Title><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1273330698000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2010-05-08 10:58:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ARM blames Adobe Flash for smartbook delays By casp321.2 years 4 months ago</Msg><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1347632588677</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 10:23:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347632611001-28</Id><Topic><Title>Is it Love, or HATE: Delaying Flash with VP8 in 2009???</Title><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1273830483000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2010-05-14 05:48:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Is it Love, or HATE: Delaying Flash with VP8 in 2009???</Msg><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1347632611001</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 10:23:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347632630206-29</Id><Topic><Title>How much Adobe's 3+ million developers LOST because of DELAYING Flash 10.1 for Mobile????</Title><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1277212999000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2010-06-22 09:23:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Re: How much Adobe's 3+ million developers LOST because of DELAYING Flash 10.1 for Mobile????</Msg><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1347632630206</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 10:23:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347632671181-30</Id><Topic><Title>Another twist for you casp...</Title><Username>gawdsmajudgel2</Username><Timestamp>1299636510000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2011-03-08 21:08:30 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So, Adobe was DELAYING Flash because of Google Android and Chrome and Google's "friends" on the other side of the isle doing Adobe a FAVOUR.

(AAPL) Wins German Injunction vs. Motorola Mobility</Title><Msg>Apple Inc. (AAPL) Wins German Injunction vs. Motorola Mobility Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is continuing its “thermonuclear war” against Google Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and its Android operating system, and won a battle against Google subsidiary Motorola Mobility this week when a German court ruled that Motorola Mobility infringes upon an Apple “rubbed band” patent, and a preliminary injunction was posted, rejecting sales of Motorola Mobility handsets that use that patent. The “rubber band” patent is a feature where a user can scroll past the end of a file, and the screen seems to “bounce back” once the user removes his or her finger from the touchscreen. Motorola devices that the Munich court ruled were infringing the patent are the Motorola Milestone XT720, the DEFY, the Atrix and XOOM, which all run the Android operating system by Google Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). A spokeswoman for the Munch court, Stefanie Ruhwinkel, said that the official ruling is that Motorola cannot use the patent in Germany, “so you could call it a sales ban.” In addition to the ban, the court granted Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) requests to recall all infringing devices that were in distribution (not sold) and have them destroyed. The company also requested that Motorola Mobility disclose its sales figures in Germany so a proper level of damages can be computed. The injunction can be made permanent if Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) posts a $32 million bond, if Motorola Mobility decides not to appeal the ruling or if an appeals court upholds the lower court’s ruling. Motorola Mobility can work around the injunction once it removes the software that infringes on the patent – a similar move to what Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. did a year ago. Whether this is the first step to another U.S. battle against a Google Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) partner – like last month’s Samsung duel – will remain to be seen, or if this will be a topic of discussion if Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) CEO Tim Cook and Google Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) chief Larry Page have another phone conversation in the near future. This win is a small step but perhaps important for investors in Apple stock, like hedge-fund manager David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital.</Msg><Username>kens60</Username><Timestamp>1347640000930</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 12:26:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347640017958-38</Id><Title>720 today..

Bain Capital, Private Equity Firms Accused of Price Fixing in Lawsuit By Christopher Matthews | @crobmatthews | September 13, 2012 Stephen Schwarzman, co-founder of the Blackstone Group, arrives at the company's office in New York, June 18, 2012. Blackstone is one of several firms facing a shareholder lawsuit that alleges collusion in the private equity industry. Mitt Romney’s presidential run has had the ancillary effect of increasing scrutiny of the private equity industry. After all, Romney founded the private equity outfit Bain Capital, and has built his case for the presidency in part on his record at Bain, which he claims reflects an ability to rehabilitate floundering enterprises and create jobs. Unfortunately for the private equity industry — which traditionally prizes secrecy — Romney’s candidacy has gotten the U.S. press core digging for any juicy bits of news on private equity it can scrounge up. And it may have unearthed a live one: According to heavily-redacted court documents unearthed by The New York Times yesterday, former shareholders of the giant hospital-management firm HCA have formally accused Bain Capital and several other private equity firms of price fixing. According to the Times report, the documents allege that Bain’s success over the past decade was due in part to agreements with other private equity companies to artificially keep the prices of firms they were bidding on low. Private equity firms generally use a combination of their own capital and borrowed money to take public companies private. After a period of time, the PE firms aim to sell those companies publically to investors at a higher price. So buying in at artificially low prices directly beefs up profits. Writes The New York Times: “The case centers on the “club deals” that became popular during the leveraged buyout boom of 2003 to 2007, a period that the complaint calls the “Conspiratorial Era.” It claims there was a complex web of collusive arrangements involving 11 of the world’s largest buyout firms on 19 deals. In the buyout of HCA, for instance, Bain, K.K.R. and Merrill Lynch bought the company in 2006 for $32.1 billion, then a record. Documents produced by the defendants and filed this week showed e-mails and meetings indicating that other equity firms had agreed to “stand down” and avoid bidding with the understanding that they would be brought into future deals.”</Msg><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1347643253480</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 13:20:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347643354851-44</Id><Topic><Title>Private Equity Firms Accused of Price Fixing in Lawsuit</Title><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1347643253480</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 13:20:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In 1996, an investment group including Bain Capital, the firm then run by Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, sold the consumer credit information business Experian to a British retailer, making a $500 million profit.

But public Securities and Exchange Commission documents filed later by Bain Capital state he remained the firm’s “sole stockholder, chairman of the board, chief executive officer, and president.” Also, a Massachusetts financial disclosure form Romney filed in 2003 states that he still owned 100 percent of Bain Capital in 2002. And Romney’s state financial disclosure forms indicate he earned at least $100,000 as a Bain “executive” in 2001 and 2002, separate from investment earnings.</Msg><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1347644722734</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 13:45:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347645206015-47</Id><Topic><Title>Private Equity Firms Accused of Price Fixing in Lawsuit</Title><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1347643253480</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 13:20:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Freescale Sale Plaintiff Kirk Dahl said in court papers that he and others in the class owned shares in Freescale Semiconductor in 2006 when it announced an LBO by firms including Carlyle and Blackstone. “The prices paid for Freescale were suppressed below prices that would otherwise prevail in a competitive market as a result of the conspiracy,” the complaint stated. The firms formed “bidding clubs” that rigged bids, limited competitive offers and “artificially depressed prices,” according to the lawsuit. Firms that weren’t part of the winning bidding clubs would get minority stakes in the acquired companies or fees as advisers, according to the complaint. “Joint bidding is central to the proper functioning of a well-regulated capital markets system,” the financial firms said. To limit the number of bids, the companies’ managers were offered incentives that included new equity, the plaintiffs claimed. Goldman Sachs, Bain Seek Dismissal of Bid-Rigging Lawsuit By Don Jeffrey - Jul 24, 2012 Individuals and a pension fund that held shares in companies including Freescale Semiconductor Ltd. (FSL), Neiman Marcus Group and Aramark Holdings Corp. sued the firms in 2007 and 2008. Two separate lawsuits were consolidated by the judge, who rejected a bid by the financial firms to move the case to federal court in New York. Firms’ ‘Conspiracy’ “There was a conspiracy among private equity firms to rig bids, restrict the supply of private equity financing, fix transaction prices and divide up the market for private equity services for leveraged buyouts,” the plaintiffs said in their lawsuit. The defendants also include Carlyle Group LP (CG), Blackstone Group LP (BX), Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. LLP, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (JPM), Apollo Global Management LLC, (APO) Providence Equity Partners Inc., Thomas H. Lee Partners LP, Silver Lake Technology Management LLC and TPG Capital. The companies have argued that the plaintiffs have no right to sue for antitrust violations that would be subject to Securities and Exchange Commission regulations.

In other words, it accuses them of basically carving up the universe of private-equity targets like a big pie and doling the pieces out to each other. More profit for everybody, sort of like the drug-dealers' cooperative in "The Wire." The lawsuit against the private equity firms arises from what were known as "club deals" at the height of private-equity buyout fever in the mid-2000s.

It says that another private equity firm, Blackstone Group, thought HCA could have been worth $1.6 billion more. But Blackstone didn't make a bid, and neither did Goldman Sachs or a bunch of other private equity firms, all of which bowed out of the bidding just 48 hours after the Bain deal was announced -- even though HCA had 50 days, during a "go-shop" period, to find a stronger bid. KKR went on to nearly triple its initial $1.2 billion investment in HCA, according to the document.

Blackstone Group, Carlyle Group, Goldman Sachs Principal Investment Arm and TPG Capital each stood on the sidelines and promised not to compete, according to court papers unsealed this week. “Indeed all four [potential competing] firms [Blackstone, Carlyle, Goldman and TPG] called KKR or Bain and agreed not to compete for HCA within 48 hours of the announced deal,” one person on the deal is quoted saying in the unsealed papers. The alleged smoking-gun comments were seen for the first time this week after a Boston judge unsealed court papers in a case where shareholders in HCA — and several other companies — accuse the largest US private-equity firms of colluding to keep buyout prices down from 2003-07. Firms agreed not to bid on certain of each others’ deals, the shareholders allege. The PE firms have repeatedly and strenuously denied the charges. HCA was purchased by Bain Capital, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., Merrill Lynch and one HCA insider. After the deal closed, KKR’s Henry Kravis sent an internal e-mail alluding to the alleged collusion, according to the unsealed court papers. “[Rival PE firms] heeded KKR’s call to ‘step down’ and agreed not to compete for HCA,” read a KKR e-mail, according to the unsealed papers. KKR gave a directive to Carlyle Group to “stand down” on HCA, the complaint alleges.

The explosive claim was made in a court filing yesterday defending the lawsuit brought against KKR, Bain Capital, Blackstone Group and Apollo Global Management along with Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase and five others, The Post has learned. The papers in the suit, which alleges an “over-arching conspiracy,” were filed under seal but sources familiar with the filing described the broadest claims to The Post. The five-year-old case has survived at least 10 attempts at dismissal — the allegations yesterday are an attempt to fend off one last effort at tossing the suit. The shareholders in the 14 companies acquired by the PE firms allege the prices paid were fraudulently low because the PE firms conspired to stay out of each other’s deals. The shareholders have allegedly found e-mails implicating partners at specific firms, sources said. In a related and separate case, they are also claiming several of the firms colluded in the $32 billion 2006 leveraged buyout of the HCA hospital chain. The judge is expected to rule this fall whether to proceed and, if he does, would likely schedule a 2013 trial, sources said.</Msg><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1347658149928</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 17:29:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347658276420-63</Id><Topic><Title>CIA giving AWAY free ON2 shareholders STOLEN products to the "artists"???</Title><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1329758049000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-02-20 12:14:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>9/13/2012 @ 2:52PM |1,301 views They Jail Antique Dealers, So Why Not LBO Artists?

The lawsuit by investors including the Detroit police and firefighter’s pension fund, accuse the buyout firms of colluding in “club deals” to prevent bidding wars from escalating out of control. In a complaint that was filed under seal and placed, in heavily redacted form, in the public record this week, plaintiff lawyers accuse the firms of rewarding competitors who stepped out of the bidding with a piece of the deals after they are won. In one of many examples presented in the suit, lawyers accuse Goldman Sachs of cutting Carlyle group into the buyout of Kinder Morgan in 2006, for example, “with the understanding that Carlyle would return the favor in the future.” Carlyle then “sought to find a place for Goldman Sachs” in its buyout of Community Health Systems, the lawyers say. The private equity firms say this is nonsense, and judges have tended to agree. At first, their reasoning was that stocks, or more precisely, control of a corporation, weren’t products or services covered under the Sherman Antitrust Act. That reasoning was silly, Rock said, so judges retreated to the idea that Securities and Exchange Commission regulations already cover the behavior of bidders in takeovers. Federal law requires buyers to identify themselves and their intentions after they cross a 5% threshhold, for example, and a variety of abusive practices are prohibited so that shareholders get the best deal for their stock.</Msg><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1347659001673</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 17:43:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347659142307-66</Id><Topic><Title>CIA giving AWAY free ON2 shareholders STOLEN products to the "artists"???</Title><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1329758049000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-02-20 12:14:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So Bain’s lawyers were probably on good legal ground when they advised firm executives it was OK to join with other private-equity firms to submit takeover bids, Rock said.

Four sources said the oil major owes a large sum to the National Iranian Oil Co (NIOC) for deliveries of crude, with one putting the figure at close to $1 billion. A debt of that size would equate to roughly four large tanker loads of Iranian crude or about 8 million barrels. "Shell is working hard to figure out a way to pay NIOC," said an industry source, who requested anonymity. "It's very sensitive and very difficult. They want to stay on good terms with Iran, while abiding by sanctions." A Shell spokesman declined to comment.</Msg><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1347662556987</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 18:42:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347663640806-75</Id><Topic><Title>Ben Bernanke-Appointed. by Mr. BUSH</Title><Username>jamesgreaves555</Username><Timestamp>1347582365083</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-13 20:26:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Apparently, you didn't watch the end of Bush's Presidency, the most pathetic in history as he sat defenseless waiting for OBAMA to get in.

The agent taking eToys public is none other than the great Goldman Sachs. The price was slotted to be around $18 to $20, with Goldman Sachs getting $1.50 per share in commission. The stock soared to over $78, but eToys only received $16.50 to $18 per share (depending on which story you read). eToys accused Goldman Sachs of breaching their fiduciary duty on where the rest of the money vanished. See the [eCommerceTimes] story (here) - which states that; The [eToys] company claims Goldman [Sachs] knew eToys' shares were worth more than the US$20 each it priced them at in May 1999. On its first day of trading, the e-tailer's stock price more than quadrupled, peaking at $85, with 13 million shares trading hands. The company also claims that Goldman received kickbacks from clients who benefited when the shares skyrocketed. While only doing less than $200 million per year in online sales, eToys inexplicably went insolvent in only a year. In September 2000, eToys lost its credit assurance rating and a decision to file for bankruptcy transpired. Goldman Sachs &amp; Bain Capital Frauds Schemes in eToys case It appears that the New York Supreme Court is unawares of the fact that Goldman Sachs is benefiting from its own bad faith and that Bain Capital is a co-conspirator. For, what no one in the court or federal systems of justice has looked upon thus far - is the fact that MNAT represents both Goldman Sachs &amp; Bain Capital. This is a serious fraud because MNAT lied about those connections and hand picked their very own choice of who would prosecute Goldman Sachs in the State of New York. Their very own cohort in crime - Paul Traub.</Msg><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1347666703757</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 19:51:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347667010794-79</Id><Topic><Title>You'r telling Stealing millions dollars from a few thousands ON2 shareholders is NOT crime!!</Title><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1275008779000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2010-05-27 21:06:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Bain Capital document says Romney was 'managing member' in 2002 Like this article26 JohnThomas By JohnThomas Didymus Jul 15, 2012 New evidence has emerged that Romney did not end his active role with Bain Capital in February 1999 as he has insisted in order to absolve himself of responsibility for outsourcing of jobs and bankruptcies after that date. The Huffington Post reports that a corporate document filed with the state of Massachusetts, a month after Romney was elected governor in December 2002, lists him as one of the two managing members of Bain Capital Investors, LLC. According to the document, the managing members of Bain Capital were authorized to "execute, acknowledge, deliver and record any recordable instrument purporting to affect an interest in real property, whether to be recorded with a Registry of Deeds or with a District Office of the Land Court." A report by The Boston Globe gives further details, stating that the Massachusetts financial disclosure indicated that he still owned 100 percent of Bain Capital in 2002, and that his state financial disclosure forms indicate he earned at least $100,000 as a Bain “executive” in 2001 and 2002, apart from his investment earnings. But in 2011, Romney in a financial disclosure, told federal authorities that he "retired from Bain Capital on February 11, 1999 to head the Salt Lake Organizing Committee [for the 2002 Winter Olympics]." Acccordingn to Romney, "Since February 11, 1999, [he] has not had any active role with any Bain Capital entity and has not been involved in the operations of any Bain Capital entity in any way." Digital Journal reported that the Boston Globe first raised questions about the exact time Romney disengaged from Bain. A Boston Globe report alleged that SEC filings show that contrary to Romney's claim, he continued to manage the company after 1999.</Msg><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1347667010794</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 19:56:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347667372677-80</Id><Topic><Title>CIA giving AWAY free ON2 shareholders STOLEN products to the "artists"???</Title><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1329758049000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-02-20 12:14:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Interesting Bain Capital Issues Tuesday, September 04, 2012 The president and his accomplices in the McMedia would have us believe that the inveterate profiteers at Bain Capital grew wealthy buying companies and firing the employees, trampling middle-class types like union workers, teachers, and retirees along the way. Delroy Murdock's New York Post article, "Look Who Parks Their Cash at Bain", tells us that by rescuing failing companies and starting new ones the "Bain Crime family" enriched the pension plans of: California State Teachers Retirement Ssytem Illinois Municipal Retirement Fund Indiana Public Retirement System Iowa Public Employees’ Retirement System Los Angeles Fire and Police Pension System Maryland State Retirement and Pension System Employees’ Retirement System of Nevada State Teachers Retirement System of Ohio Pennsylvania State Employees’ Retirement System Tennessee Consolidated Retirement System and the august Oprah Winfrey Foundation Murdock asks why would Demo-friendly government-union leaders and university presidents allow Bain to oversee their precious assets. Interesting question, indeed.

Because the last time I check this country hasn't enjoyed a balance budget since since the time prior to LBJ. Besides Bush has been out of office the past 4 years. So don't you think it's high time you get over it and let go? After all with 4 years already under his belt and with a Democratic Senate as well isn't it also about time NObama mans up and takes responsibility for this mess... One I may add is 10x worse than anything under Dubya. And as far as balance budgets go--well hate to burst your bubble, but hasn't Odumber topped Bush in that category as well to the tune of nearly $5T in half the time, tanked the USD causing gas prices to spike, doubled the previous national debt in one term w/o creating a single job... In fact Jimbo retirees living on fixed incomes (the least able to cope in today's economy I might add) are a 1000x worst off today than they were under Bush, Clinton, and even papa Bush... While the 1% are 10000x better off under this shyster, just ask that crook Jon Corzine.</Msg><Username>funnimone67</Username><Timestamp>1347668937532</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 20:28:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347669154201-82</Id><Title>Grover Norquist Tax Sandbag Killed Our Economy</Title><Msg>We're headed to the fiscal cliff because Paul Ryan killed Bowles Simpson.
