We believe InterDigital’s recent successful appeal with Nokia will be an important catalyst with other licensees. - Valuation: IDCC shares trade at over 50 times our 2012 EPS estimate, which does not include upside from potential agreements with Nokia, LG, ZTE, and Huawei (largely because of uncertainty in timing). Combined, these opportunities generate annual incremental EPS of up to $5 per year and current valuation reflects a conservative view of the prospects for resolutions with unlicensed vendors, especially in light of the company’s recent favorable appeal against Nokia . With more than 18,000 patents (following the pending sale of 1,700 patents to Intel), InterDigital is the third-largest holder of 3G patents and second-largest holder of essential 4G patents. The company therefore has a formidable and defensible position in the wireless world. According to TechIPm, the company holds an estimated 19% of all the essential patents for the LTE standard. Other top players in the LTE space include Qualcomm, Nokia, LG, and Samsung. According to TechIPm, by July 2010 roughly 81% of all 4G IPR was shared among these five players.</Msg><Username>patentsaddicted</Username><Timestamp>1350984143967</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 05:22:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350984614250-7</Id><Title>Romney got his butt kicked tonight 'he's toast'</Title><Msg>Dems still supporting Obama are just naive if not downright dumb. Obama is the most ineffective child prodigy community organizer Muslim Brotherhood leaning traitor ever to disgrace the office. It's because of naive fools like you that landed us here. Romney scored just the right amount of hits on foreign policy to park Obama where he belongs without appearing harsh (as did Obama quite frequently and frankly had a look of startled dismay upon his face throughout the debate as Romney pointed out his serious failures such as the apology tour where Obama visited all the Muslim Brotherhood states but purposfully avoided Israel our most significant ally inthe region.) That alone toasted Obama much less Romney's tactful shifting to the most failed Obama economy. Obama is going to get us killed and Romney was so correct to point out the FACT Obama whispered in the Russian Prime Minister's ear that he'd have more flexibility (to sell out the USA) once the election is over. Come on dems get your heads out of your rumpsters and face the facts Obama has failed and failed in all areas. He's a community organizer for gosh sakes and you fools elected such an empty suit. The final blow came when Romney again correctly asserted he would revive the economy by implementing economic policies that spur business accross the board and not invest in individual companies as did Obama squnaderiong trillions of our tax dollars on many already failed companies such as the infamous Solyndra and bailing out the unions such as GM and Chrysler by bankrupting them, destroying all the original stock and bondholders and bailing out the unions from their massive unfunded healthcare and retirement liabilitities again placing the onus on taxpayers by lifting their burden with Obamacare (the MASSIVE UPCOMING 2014 TAX.) This man is corrupt beyond all measure and anyone not seeing through him at this stage is 100% IMAGE ORIENTED and susceptible to be taken by any crook that presents himself as a SMOODGE OPERATOR like Obama and the Chicago regime.</Msg><Username>omni1tsd</Username><Timestamp>1350984614250</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 05:30:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350988266067-8</Id><Topic><Title>Romney got his butt kicked tonight 'he's toast'</Title><Username>omni1tsd</Username><Timestamp>1350984614250</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 05:30:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You may or may not be correct in your thoughts but the news media and public opinion says Romney looked like a fool last night.</Msg><Username>stinkee_stinkee_ho_hum</Username><Timestamp>1350988266067</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 06:31:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350988535284-9</Id><Title>MITTY PASSIVE - PRESIDENT OBAMA AGRRESSIVE</Title><Msg>http://news.yahoo.com/voters-role-reversal-obama-more-aggressive-romney-passive-042200749.html that kinda says it all googlers.</Msg><Username>stinkee_stinkee_ho_hum</Username><Timestamp>1350988535284</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 06:35:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350991147275-10</Id><Title>cramer-buy buy buy google</Title><Msg>kiss of death,lol.VRNG will take your GOOG downstairs and will spank it hard.</Msg><Username>ninapantyukhina</Username><Timestamp>1350991147275</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 07:19:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350991261002-11</Id><Topic><Title>Romney got his butt kicked tonight 'he's toast'</Title><Username>omni1tsd</Username><Timestamp>1350984614250</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 05:30:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why are Libs so ignorant and Dumb?

Mitt Romney's Stunning turnaround in these past 3 debates Obama has lost support among Jewish women voters. Most Jews are Turn Against Obama across the 50 states, A Jewish Women Focus Group of 7,890 on October 22, 2012 President Obama Was arrogant, angry, disrespectfully, condescending and much to aggressive, did not look very presidential at all. Governor Mitt Romney looked much more presidential, ready to be commander-in-chief. America he said, needs a strong economy in order to have a strong military for our National Security now and in the future. We came away from this debate with a very good impression of Mitt Romney, in that he would be a “ a safe pair of hands.” We feel he’s tough enough to do what’s necessary, but laid-back enough not to do too much and get us into another war. Romney did not attack President Obama's policies, he simply pointed out a few improvements in a respectable way. During the debate Governor Mitt Romney seemed more like the president and Barack Obama more like the candidate and challenger. Governor Mitt Romney was calm, thoughtful, relaxed, steady and looked very presidential. He looked and acted ready to take the job as commander-in-chief. Expressed his views on Iran's Nuclear threat and the USA support of Israel, our good friend and ally. He impressed us tonight, in that a vote for him is a vote for American security, peace and safety, a strong economy, a strong military, millions of higher paying jobs, prosperity and quiet peaceful life for us and our families. The world is much to scary these days; Americans aren’t looking for a scary weak president. Tonight we came away with the feeling that President Obama is more the scary one, in America's weaken relationship with Israel, a closer to Nuclear Iran, our weak economy and the huge 16 Trillion Dollars in Debt, that in itself Threatens our National Security. We can not afford four more years of president Obama's spending and borrowing another 5 or 6 trillion dollars from countries like China. Our jewish women's focus group therefore endorse Governor Mitt Romney for the next president of the United States of America. Obama's Re-Election is very questionable.

Mitt Romney's Stunning turnaround in these past 3 debates Obama has lost support among Jewish women voters. Most Jews are Turn Against Obama across the 50 states, A Jewish Women Focus Group of 7,890 on October 22, 2012 President Obama Was arrogant, angry, disrespectfully, condescending and much to aggressive, did not look very presidential at all. Governor Mitt Romney looked much more presidential, ready to be commander-in-chief. America he said, needs a strong economy in order to have a strong military for our National Security now and in the future. We came away from this debate with a very good impression of Mitt Romney, in that he would be a “ a safe pair of hands.” We feel he’s tough enough to do what’s necessary, but laid-back enough not to do too much and get us into another war. Romney did not attack President Obama's policies, he simply pointed out a few improvements in a respectable way. During the debate Governor Mitt Romney seemed more like the president and Barack Obama more like the candidate and challenger. Governor Mitt Romney was calm, thoughtful, relaxed, steady and looked very presidential. He looked and acted ready to take the job as commander-in-chief. Expressed his views on Iran's Nuclear threat and the USA support of Israel, our good friend and ally. He impressed us tonight, in that a vote for him is a vote for American security, peace and safety, a strong economy, a strong military, millions of higher paying jobs, prosperity and quiet peaceful life for us and our families. The world is much to scary these days; Americans aren’t looking for a scary weak president. Tonight we came away with the feeling that President Obama is more the scary one, in America's weaken relationship with Israel, a closer to Nuclear Iran, our weak economy and the huge 16 Trillion Dollars in Debt, that in itself Threatens our National Security. We can not afford four more years of president Obama's spending and borrowing another 5 or 6 trillion dollars from countries like China.
