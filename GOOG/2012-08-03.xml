Lawyer's orders. Lang seemed relieved. He does't come across like someone who relishes mixing things up inside or outside a courtroom or dissecting the legal maneuverings. He seems to relish being a geek (his word). And surrounding himself with other geeks. What Lang could discuss (briefly) was his new job. He's Vringo's CTO. Meet Vringo CTO Ken Lang, The Mystery Geek At The Center Of The Google Patent Fight By Chuck Salter| August 2, 2012 He invented and patented search methodology that lawyers say Google is infringing upon. But on this day, Lang was free to focus on his next big ideas as CTO of Mark Cuban-backed mobile tech company Vringo. Vringo CTO Ken Lang on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange He may be the central figure in an intriguing patent suit against Google and a handful of other giants, but Ken Lang has remained in the background until now. When I/P Engine (aka Innovate/Protect) filed its infringement suit last fall, he appeared only in court documents. He was the brainy Carnegie Mellon grad student who had patented search-engine methodology in the late 1990s with his buddy Donald Kasak and gone on to start a company and eventually become CTO of the once popular search engine Lycos. Lawyers are arguing about whether Google and others infringed on that patent for key components of their search technologies. But at a key hearing in Norfolk, Virginia, which we covered in June, Lang didn’t visit the federal courtroom. He made a cameo in a photo in the plaintiff's presentation. His patent filings (and his lawyers) did all the talking. Yesterday was the closet thing to a coming-out party for the mystery man. If you watched the opening of the New York Stock Exchange on TV, you finally saw Ken Lang. That is, if you were paying attention. He was the quiet fellow in the dark shirt and suit standing off to the side, just out of reach of the button that purports to ring the bell (This bit of TV theater is automated, I was told). The edge of the spotlight suited Lang.</Msg><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1344003676315</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-03 10:21:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344004154704-20</Id><Title>Same as last week?</Title><Msg>Appears to be recreating last Friday, huge run up, look at chart back to last Friday and then will it drop off again next week?
