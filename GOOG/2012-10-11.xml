With ZNGA trading under its $15 IPO Debut a few months back at a mere $2.37 Per/Share ZNGA is more and more a Buy Out Candidate as "The Street" is looking for FB to get "The Street" excited with some "KEY" Acquisitions as soon as possible. The word is that FB is going to make a BID for ZNGA getting "FULL CONTROL" of the company and branch the company out into EA's Market going forward. ZNGA is at THE TOP of the "FB SHOPPING LIST" and with the PPS of ZNGA at the current levels they figure that they will be able to buy ZNGA at a much lower cost than anticipated via The ZNGA Shareholder Structure. There are two Investment House GORILLAS in ZNGA for over $10 BILLION on The IPO and The Proposed Buy Out will come in around that Price Point as the word on The Street at this current time. Znyga is and always has been set up and poised for EXPLOSIVE GROWTH in 2013. GOOG is also a Potential Buyer and has 'THE DEEPER POCKETS" to keep its Relationship with ZNGA and keep FB at Bay from the 2013 Growth Projected in The Business Model and may possibly outbid FB in its ATTEMPT to snatch up ZNGA at will. 10:50 AM EST 10,11, 2012 (3 of 3)</Msg><Username>berger500financial</Username><Timestamp>1349967520251</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 10:58:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349968180673-51</Id><Topic><Title>Eric Schmidt Does Not Like Patent Wars: Buy VRNG on bad lawyers for Google settling or losing - same who lose to Apple for Samsung!</Title><Username>contezta</Username><Timestamp>1349917536994</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 21:05:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>October 9, 2012 page 16 of docket 695: i/p engine filed suit in this court seeking money damages from defendants for allegedly infringing, directly and/or indirectly, the ‘420 patent and the ‘664 patent by making, using, selling, and offering for sale in the united states systems that i/p engine asserts are covered the parties in this case are the plaintiff, i/p engine, inc., which may be referred to as “i/p engine,” and aol inc., google inc., iac search &amp; media, inc., target corporation, and gannett company, inc., which may be referred to collectively as “defendants.” this is a patent case. It involves two u.s. Patents, united states patent nos. 6,314,420 and 6,775,664. For convenience, the parties and i will often refer to patent numbers 6,314,420 and 6,775,664 by their last three numbers, namely, the ‘420 patent and the ‘664 patent. These patents generally involve systems that combine content and collaborative feedback data in filtering for relevance to a user’s query. During the trial, the parties will offer testimony to familiarize you with the history and development of the systems, which are the subject of this case. i/p engine filed suit in this court seeking money damages from defendants for allegedly infringing, directly and/or indirectly, the ‘420 patent and the ‘664 patent by making, using, selling, and offering for sale in the united states systems that i/p engine asserts are covered by claims 10, 14, 15, 25, 27, and 28 of the ‘420 patent and claims 1, 5, 6, 21, 22, 26, 28, and 38 of the ‘664 patent. The systems that are alleged to infringe are google’s adwords, adsense for search, and adsense for mobile search systems, and aol’s search marketplace system. defendants deny that they have infringed any of the asserted claims of the ‘420 or ‘664 patents. Defendants also argue that the asserted claims are invalid. I will instruct you later as to the ways in which a patent may be invalid. In general, a patent is invalid if it is not new or is obvious in view of the state of the art at the relevant time, or if the description in the patent does not meet certain requirements.</Msg><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1349968180673</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 11:09:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349968183515-52</Id><Topic><Title>Mark Zuckerberg @ (FB) facebook Talking Buy Out Of (ZNGA) Zynga with/ GOOG's Blessings</Title><Username>berger500financial</Username><Timestamp>1349967520251</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 10:58:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Both FB &amp; ZNGA GREEN with Zynga starting to line up on L2</Msg><Username>berger500financial</Username><Timestamp>1349968183515</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 11:09:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349968562374-53</Id><Topic><Title>Mark Zuckerberg @ (FB) facebook Talking Buy Out Of (ZNGA) Zynga with/ GOOG's Blessings</Title><Username>berger500financial</Username><Timestamp>1349967520251</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 10:58:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Can FB Out Bid GOOG?

If a stock is highly liquid, meaning there is a large volume of shares being bought and sold, the Bid/Ask Spread will be much lower. A low Bid/Ask Spread is important to traders because the extra cost that you pay in the spread will eat away at the profits of your trades. For example, on a certain low volume stock, if the Bid Price is $69.33 and the Ask Price is $70.33 the Bid/Ask Spread would be $1.00. If you were to buy 1,000 shares and then immediately sell them using market orders (assuming everything stays the same and not factoring in commissions) your loss would be $1,000 just because of the spread. High volume stocks or ETFs such as MSFT or QQQQ can have spreads as low as a couple cents because huge numbers of shares are changing hands every minute on those securities. The bid–offer spread is an accepted measure of liquidity costs in exchange traded securities and commodities. On any standardized exchange, two elements comprise almost all of the transaction cost—brokerage fees and bid-offer spreads. Under competitive conditions, the bid-offer spread measures the cost of making transactions without delay. The difference in price paid by an urgent buyer and received by an urgent seller is the liquidity cost.

FTC investigating Google's patent licensing policies Silicon Valley / San Jose Business Journal Date: Wednesday, October 10, 2012 The Federal Trade Commission is looking at the way Google Inc. is licensing its patents that are considered standard essential patents that control the way smartphones and tablets work. According to the New York Times, the FTC started an investigation over standard essential patents in June, when they started making appearances in patent cases. ----------- Re: FTC investigating Google's patent licensing policies By casp321.2 minutes 39 seconds ago.Permalink . Would ftc ask vrng counsels about the google patents activities? october 9, 2012 page 16 of docket 695: i/p engine filed suit in this court seeking money damages from defendants for allegedly infringing, directly and/or indirectly, the ‘420 patent and the ‘664 patent by making, using, selling, and offering for sale in the united states systems that i/p engine asserts are covered the parties in this case are the plaintiff, i/p engine, inc., which may be referred to as “i/p engine,” and aol inc., google inc., iac search &amp; media, inc., target corporation, and gannett company, inc., which may be referred to collectively as “defendants.” this is a patent case. It involves two u.s. Patents, united states patent nos. 6,314,420 and 6,775,664. For convenience, the parties and i will often refer to patent numbers 6,314,420 and 6,775,664 by their last three numbers, namely, the ‘420 patent and the ‘664 patent. These patents generally involve systems that combine content and collaborative feedback data in filtering for relevance to a user’s query. During the trial, the parties will offer testimony to familiarize you with the history and development of the systems, which are the subject of this case. i/p engine filed suit in this court seeking money damages from defendants for allegedly infringing, directly and/or indirectly, the ‘420 patent and the ‘664 patent by making, using, selling, and offering for sale in the united states systems that i/p engine asserts are covered by claims 10, 14, 15, 25, 27, and 28 of the ‘420 patent and claims 1, 5, 6, 21, 22, 26, 28, and 38 of the ‘664 patent. The systems that are alleged to infringe are google’s adwords, adsense for search, and adsense for mobile search systems, and aol’s search marketplace system. defendants deny that they have infringed any of the asserted claims of the ‘420 or ‘664 patents. Defendants also argue that the asserted claims are invalid. I will instruct you later as to the ways in which a patent may be invalid. In general, a patent is invalid if it is not new or is obvious in view of the state of the art at the relevant time, or if the description in the patent does not meet certain requirements. -------- Re: FTC hires economist in Google case By casp321.23 minutes ago.Permalink .

DO NOT FORGET THAT ZNGA HAS THIS DEVELOPED FOR ALL SMART PHONES &amp; IS THE DEFAULT POKER (ONLINE CASINO &amp; SPORTS BOOK) ON ALL PLATFORMS JUST LIKE facebook, twitter, priceline............ Did we even mention ZNGA is LAUNCHING IN "ALL" OF ASIA &amp; RUSSIA. RUSSIA ALONE HAS 2 SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES THAT ARE EACH LARGER THEN facebook!!!! This is why mark Zuckerberg was just in Russia for a "HACKATHON". MOST PEOPLE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT OR WHERE ZNGA IS; outside of the 232 million monthly active users &amp; 60 million daily active users.

A spokesperson for the search giant says that there was no partisan tinkering involved in the alternately hilarious or embarrassing results, depending on which side of the aisle you sit. Instead, the gallery is a result of Google analytics, which surfaces images tied to phrases used most often in news headlines and search terms. In this case, the algorithms were responding to the glut of coverage of Romney’s statement last week that he was “completely wrong” to call 47 percent of Americans “victims” dependent on the government.</Msg><Username>liberals_plague_humanity</Username><Timestamp>1349982133282</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 15:02:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349982870188-100</Id><Topic><Title>Why GOOG May Be Doomed..</Title><Username>p.tanner20</Username><Timestamp>1349957871105</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 08:17:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If Goog doesn't get back above 756 and better yet 760 in the next day or two, this nice gap up day is starting to look like a failure attempt on the chart.</Msg><Username>learnedlesson</Username><Timestamp>1349982870188</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 15:14:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349984041305-101</Id><Title>CUR,,,Oversold alert!!

Alwasy remember it creates massive debt loads and the demorcrats indeed signed the Fed Reserve Bank into law 1913 with the sole purpose of debt leveraging our currency. In other words the more debt the better. Low and behold the master maketeer informed the abortion lobby that they should change the debate away from morality for which there would never be a win and change it to a woman's right to choose. BINGO and here we are with abortion a mere form of birth control. Biden, Obama, Hilary Bilary etc all chime about safety of the mother and rape. Do the math and I bet of the 50,000,000 (million babies killed since 1973) I'd bet it's 2% or less.
