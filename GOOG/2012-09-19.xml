The debt and borrowing sums were first reported by the National Review Online and confirmed by ABC News. The campaign borrowed the money from the Bank of Georgetown, according to the report. The move came just before the Republican National Convention when aides had complained they had been running out of primary campaign dollars to compete with President Obama's campaign. At the conclusion of the Republican convention, when Romney officially became the party's nominee, Romney had access to general election funds it had raised. Earlier this month, the Romney campaign announced that it had raised $111.6 million, less than Obama's campaign, which raised $114 million. It marked the first month the Obama campaign has raised more cash than Romney since April, when the GOP candidate raised $40.1 million to Obama's $43.6 million. The news of the debt comes after an already rough week for the Romney campaign, which has been facing demands for more specifics in its proposals and was then criticized over leaked videos of the candidate telling high-dollar donors that 47 percent of Americans are believe they are "victims" and are dependent on government to meet their needs.</Msg><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1348046448258</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 05:20:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348046634038-3</Id><Topic><Title>casp321 remember bill joll thought you like to know</Title><Username>wmhjr99</Username><Timestamp>1337952121000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-05-25 09:22:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Bill Joll FALSIFIED ON2's EARNING report in 2007 when he was ON2's cEO.

By smitheduardo23 2 years 3 months ago They, the enemy, has been able to bribe off the other class actions. From being on the automatic mailing lists of one of them, I now know that this is an entire sector in the legal industry: to bribe off class action law suits so that the law firm takes in payment for shutting up without having to work for that money. Fairness in the legal industry is certainly not capitalised. Google will in their defence use the artistic work performed of the forensic accountant that was hired by ON2 in the latter period of it's existance. 78 thousand pages is an attempted overkill to a destroy motivation to be involved. Yet there still are responsible people in law. Much of that overkill must logically be circumscribed repetition to confuse. Let's hope that for once real fairness will surface rather than a ficticious one. Re: Adding an ON2 Shareholder's one-cent to its OPT-OUT LEGAL battle! By casp321 11 months ago The intention is NOT to casue any more headache or frustration to ON2 Long shareholders or bring-up any non-sense and add-up pages-upon-pages for those might be looking for any relations/cluses. What I think ON2 shareholders can add, that even those from FBI, DOJ, SEC and/or lega counsels would NOT see are some of the possible, yes possible, connectios/relations that ON2 long shareholders had SPENT many times to identify the deals/reltions/connections. Of course these might, just might, help to save time in solving a COMPLEX problem. It is better than NOTHING, when they've DESTROYED ON2's history and MOVED/REOVED/RENAMED/MISSPELLED ON2 products or those involved to HIDE any connction/relation might cause "firing" the "neurons" of those trying to solve the problem. For example, when Mv22ie posted Google Oracle and/or Google Motorola links related to Governmental agencies investigating Google/Oracle and Google/Motorola relations or deals, they "fired" my neurons and "flashed" back the "memory of the related messages posted on Yahoo/ONT/Messages/Board by ON2's Longs and Bashersarguing for or against ON2 prodcts or legal case against Google and O2's Technical staffs, BOD and Management. Monitoring these kind of relations and compiling them in an isolated location, for example, on a SCRATCH Yahoo/Google/Messges/Board, would make it easy for those looking for any clue or RELATIONs among ones INVOLVED in INCREASIG ON2's Short Interest, with more than 18+ million shares, and bringing it down under 500K, in two years, at the time of "merger" announcement. No one can make these kind of ON2 SI, UP more than 18+ million and DOWN under 500K, happen while taking stock PPS DOWN to the "ground" without involvement of those having ACCESS to "proper" sources/resources with EXPERTIES in these kinds of activities. Any legal investigation of ON2 at this time would be under the name of Google, and NOT ON2 I pressume, and ON2 long shareholders might not get any information related to illegal activities of thse INVOLVED with ON2 unless they continue bringing up any "past" ON2 and Google "suspicious actvities to the "present" when locating related public, especially, legal/unproper activites investigatig report taking place. During ON2's shareholders lawsuit, when Google provided thousands of thousands " documents/pages to the Judges and those Counsels involved in ON2 Lawsuit cases with a "plaintiff lead having 100-share or so", it was obvious that they were trying to keep the "legal" teams busy with reading" those thousands of documents/pages while RUSHING the case to the completion. NOW is different time and different Google legal team tactic with dealing the judge's OPT-OUT ruling, but what would serve ON2 shareholders during this "standoff" period is releasing different ON2 products with different ON2 partners/customers/clients bringing up CONFLICTING but "old" issue to get "bigger" shares of the pie. Google/Oracle and Google/Motorla are good example to name.

The grandson of former President Jimmy Carter and a self-fashioned Democratic opposition researcher, the younger Carter had watched countless hours of footage of Republican Mitt Romney and made it a habit to search YouTube every few days for keywords like "Romney" and "Republicans." But on this day in August, one clip jumped out. There was Romney, in an undisclosed location, bluntly discussing a visit to a Chinese factory with substandard conditions. "The hidden camera video — it was all blurred out at the beginning, and it was mysterious," Carter said. "It piqued my interest." Something told him there might be more there than the brief clip posted on the YouTube channel "Anne Onymous." Although not affiliated with any campaign or super PAC, Carter had made it a personal mission to help get Democrats elected in 2012 — and to do his part to push back against Romney's relentless campaign-trail mockery of his grandfather. So Carter, 35, of Atlanta, set out track down the source of the video. He sent a message to the YouTube user seeking details. No luck.

Both Carter and the source suspected it was that firm's factory that Romney was speaking about in the video. "That gave me credibility," Carter said. "They opened up to me a little bit." Soon after, Carter persuaded the source to trust Corn with the full video — on the condition that he keep the source's identity a secret. Corn ran with it, using clues in the video to triangulate when and where it had been recorded. Then on Monday and Tuesday, Corn posted the clips to his magazine's website, sparking a firestorm for the Romney campaign over remarks claiming that nearly half of Americans "believe they are victims" deserving government help and that the Palestinians have no interest in peace with Israel. "James: This is extraordinary. Congratulations! Papa," the former president told his grandson Tuesday morning in an email obtained by the AP.</Msg><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1348070599268</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 12:03:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348070659157-36</Id><Topic><Title>ON2: And COMPROMISING Iranian Yahoo &amp; Google Account</Title><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1331259440000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-03-08 21:17:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Re: ON2: And COMPROMISING Iranian Yahoo &amp; Google Account By casp321.4 months ago.PermalinkGo to topic .

"I've gotten a lot of Twitter messages from people supporting me and saying that it's poetic justice that it was a Carter that uncovered this, considering the way that the Romney campaign has been talking about my grandfather," Carter said.

AMY GOODMAN February 12, 2004 Bush Appoints Iran-Contra Figure To Head Up Iraq "Intelligence" Probe Judge Silberman has been described as a longtime Republican operative and is widely thought to have helped orchestrate Ronald Reagan’s1980 "October Suprise" when Reagan secretly made contacts with the Iranian government before he was elected. It is alleged that President Reagan sent Silberman in the fall of 1980 to make sure the Iranians weren’t planning to give up the US hostages taken at the American embassy, thus creating an "October surprise" that would help reelect Jimmy Carter. Silberman was rewarded for his role in Iran with the judgeship that later allowed him to overturn the conviction of Oliver North for his role in the Iran-Contra affair. ------- AMY GOODMAN: It’s interesting that one of his clerks, one of the clerks for Judge Silberman then went on to the Justice Department and is considered the principle author of the U.S.A.

"The initial comment" he continued, "I think was a little bit off, off key at a time when the nation is looking for calm, and looking for, I think, a message of unity, and some clarity about America's purpose and role in what is a highly incendiary region of the world right now and not looking for a political answer. And they may have gotten too much of a political answer." Huntsman endorsed Romney in mid January, but has not done a single campaign event with the Republican presidential candidate and says he has not spoken to Romney since then. "I've worked for some presidential candidates, the last two or three, you help them when they want help, and some have their own team, and that's perfectly understandable," says Huntsman. Huntsman served as Ambassador to China under President Obama's administration, and says he would serve his country again ... if he were asked.</Msg><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1348078585949</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 14:16:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348078776470-74</Id><Title>jesus.

Here is what I think is happening and why this judge will not be able to wash Google clean after all: I think HONOURABLE Federal Magistrate Judge F. Bradford Stillman, the judge in Vringo-vs-Google-AOL-..., prefered to RULE Markman as he saw the case and retire instead of being uncertain about who or how they might pull his leg before Vringo vs Google complelete its course! No one want to retire that early especially with these coming from Media "that Stillman has no plans for retirement." I should say thanks, many thanks to this judge possibly knowing that it's not easy to maintain the same position when one is swimming against the current. --------- ON2's judge screwed up by letting a "lead-plintiff-with-100-ONT-share" make $450,000 for his counsels but nothing for himself, as they want you believe, and causing a huge damage to ON2 shareholders, and might be in trouble down the road once another case like ON2 bring more attention to her ruling? Oracle's judge tried to make it look better after he ruled against Oracle by asking Google and Oracle to provide the court names of those reporters, "experts", ... under their payroll writing favouable articles about Google or Oracle that might've had negative effect on his ruling, but later on quietly called it quit and "complete? Vringo's judge retires less than two working weeks of Vringo vs Google trial starting on October 16, 2012, and here is the "reasons": US Magistrate Judge Stillman to Retire January 28, 2012 Hislast day will be Sept. 30. The Virginian-Pilot reports that Stillman has no plans for retirement other than to enjoy his family.</Msg><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1348088657060</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 17:04:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348088687800-157</Id><Topic><Title>I bought GOOG because they stood up for.....</Title><Username>laylow1991</Username><Timestamp>1348088034518</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 16:53:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I wan't my constitutional rights.

For some people 100K is a lot of money, for some not. Often when I have a big loss -- I close that position. Usually then now hypothetical loss increases twofold, but then reverses proving two things: 1. Good thing that I existed early. 2. If I waited three years and survived twice the loss -- I would've been proven right and returned my money and then some. But I usually short companies that are fundamentally overvalued (with huge PE and no huge growth prospects) and Google is not like that. PE minus cash is tiny and growth prospects are very healthy.</Msg><Username>sa1212</Username><Timestamp>1348101519783</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 20:38:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348102664553-170</Id><Title>Unbelievable!!!
