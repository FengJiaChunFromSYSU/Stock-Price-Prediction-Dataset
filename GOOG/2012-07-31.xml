The carrier, which offers $19 a month service for talk, text and Web, plans to announce later on Monday that it will carry the Motorola Defy XT. It will be the first US carrier to offer the device.</Msg><Username>tomsongarry</Username><Timestamp>1343710219865</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 00:50:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>11</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343730119381-2</Id><Title>GOOG:- This is interesting.</Title><Msg>Whypennystocks dotcom, is a great site for goog stock, it is a great site with a lot of information.</Msg><Username>tammy6285</Username><Timestamp>1343730119381</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 06:21:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343730386134-3</Id><Topic><Title>GOOG:- This is interesting.</Title><Username>tammy6285</Username><Timestamp>1343730119381</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 06:21:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This is a great site</Msg><Username>khalid5842</Username><Timestamp>1343730386134</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 06:26:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343730474955-4</Id><Topic><Title>GOOG:- This is interesting.</Title><Username>tammy6285</Username><Timestamp>1343730119381</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 06:21:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Fantastic site, I have subscribed to it.</Msg><Username>theclick5842</Username><Timestamp>1343730474955</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 06:27:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343737920614-5</Id><Topic><Title>MSFT to Buy VRNG Patents and Ruin Google?</Title><Username>vrnger</Username><Timestamp>1343592802826</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-29 16:13:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Goog investors would be wise to read up on the vringo lawsuit vs google.

Google delays widely-panned "Nexus Q" orb gadget Reuters – 2 hours 36 minutes ago By Mauro Whiteman SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Google Inc is postponing the launch of the Nexus Q, the Internet giant's first self-designed and marketed consumer electronics device, in a smudge on its budding hardware credentials. The company announced the indefinite delay of the orb-shaped media player device in an email on Tuesday to customers who had pre-ordered the made-in-America gadget, saying it wanted to add more features and functions. It offered a "preview version" of the streaming device for free instead.</Msg><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1343785362539</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 21:42:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343786180981-19</Id><Topic><Title>ON2: Where was Ben in December 2009 to decode Vevo code???</Title><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1326550416000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-01-14 09:13:36 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Originally published July 20, 2012 at 6:27 PM | Page modified July 24, 2012 at 12:31 PM Google's media player device, Nexus Q, not ready for prime time Review: Nexus Q has potential but now it plays media only from YouTube or the Google Play store. You can't watch movies from Netflix or TV shows from Hulu Google built its new Nexus Q around some good ideas, but the digital media player is a pricey half-baked product. The Nexus Q represents the company's first attempt at its own digital living-room device. Consumers can use it to stream movies, TV shows or music to their living-room entertainment systems. What makes the $300 Nexus Q different from other digital media players is that Google designed it to work specifically with smartphones and tablets running its Android operating system. The Nexus Q doesn't ship with a remote control; instead, you have to use your Android device to control it.</Msg><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1343786180981</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 21:56:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343789798957-20</Id><Topic><Title>ON2, Hantro, Verisilicon, Google: Was it spin-in or reverse-merger?</Title><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1335274336000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-04-24 09:32:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>6/27/2012 Suzanne Choney Google Nexus Q is an Android-powered 'social' media player "It's the first device that lets you create social playlists with your friends," the company said in a video shown on YouTube (shared below). The spherical, glowing Q has the guts of an Android phone and near-field communication to sync with phones nearby. It also has a Micro-USB port. It can connect to your TV and your stereo system, or run its own speakers with a built-in amplifier. (Reminds me just a bit of the orb in Woody Allen's "Sleeper" — but that was used for something else.) The Nexus Q will work in concert with Google's app store, now called Google Play, "play it all on the biggest speakers and screen in the house. There are no downloads, no syncing, no running out of space," the company says. Google Play now sells movies and TV episodes (as well as seasons).</Msg><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1343789798957</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 22:56:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343790010817-21</Id><Topic><Title>Hantro+VPx or VP6/7/8??????</Title><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1268182202000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2010-03-09 19:50:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The new system combines a specialized Linux port of the On2 TrueCast Server software with On2's TrueCast Player software.
