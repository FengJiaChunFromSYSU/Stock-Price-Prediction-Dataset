Here is different example: Vringo's Stout Trumps 13 Tech Giants In NTP Patent Suit July 25, 2012 | 25 commentsby: John H. Ford | about: VRNG, includes: AAPL, GOOG, MMI, MSFT, RIMM, S, T, VZ, YHOO NTP Inc. -- the company cofounded by Donald Stout, who is a Vringo (VRNG) director and Chairman of Vringo's intellectual property committee -- announced Monday that it has reached settlements with 13 tech companies. The willingness of all these companies to settle is definitely good news for Vringo. Judges, juries and the infringing companies themselves should now be more willing to agree that patent holders need to be compensated. I don't know the terms of the agreement, but considering that Donald Stout and NTP already extracted $600 million just from Research In Motion (RIMM) for patent infringement, the settlement figures could be staggering. One interesting fact is that there are only eight patents involved in this NTP settlement.</Msg><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1344365885157</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 14:58:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344367214359-18</Id><Title>Android Copy Machines close to Shut down</Title><Msg>Amazing effort by Samsung/Goog to Copy</Msg><Username>kcusstrohs</Username><Timestamp>1344367214359</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 15:20:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344375866856-19</Id><Title>When a PUBLIC company involves in underground CRIMINAL activities???</Title><Msg>When a PUBLIC company involves in underground CRIMINAL activities??? It's obvious that Yahoo admin does NOT have the authority or, for that matter, intelligence enough to sort out every messages or public reports posted on a scratch board for a given message thread unless some from higher authorities, possibly beyond yahoo's own management, asking them to monitor and sensor specific public reports related to some people and companies. I have already listed some of them, people or companies, and provided public published reports enough to name any on them in this message again. What it seems to is that some of those, either billionaires, CTOs, CEOs, BOD, Lawyers, even for that matter even the judge missed the judgment, MIGHT be UNDER INVESTIGATION and they do NOT expect those being harmed to raise their voice assuming ignoring their messages on scrach board will count as a lost voice and make them disappear so they can WASH what was launderd for so long under different pretext and COVER-UP from different agencies. What I can remind them is that using PUBLIC companies shareholders investments and ROBBING them is NOT the proper way of COVERING your underground cRIMINAL activities and is NOT the way to pay your operators by stolen money from these investors because of your calling #$%$ sensitive and secret operations. At least NOT with my money. The trouble you face NOW and the reasons some of your AGENTs have been EXPOSED is that you have dumb running your operation and they no have enough vision to see when enough is enough.
