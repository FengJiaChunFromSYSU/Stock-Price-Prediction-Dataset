Think about our briilliant Founding Fathers and their 'looks and/or gravitas or lack thereof.) Where would they be in this TV land USA of today? Think of poor Lincoln if he were to be so judged by appearance as is done today. This election must be about substance and not who looks the best during the debates. Obama has shown his true roots and his absolute inability to lead. In truth Obama is nothing but 'appearance.' So there's a good chance the SMOODGER Obama will out do Romney in appearance and/or delivery (styles) during the debates but factually the cards are all on the table as to his true inability to lead. Most in the USA today have bought the hype that we are still the most powerful nation in the world, which is scary and highly likely not as true as once may have been. With Iran near completion of a nuke and their intentions quite clear as to their disdain for the USA and Isreal and Russia/China remaining their ally now since the end of WWII, chances are good the 3 of them would love to see us go. What does Obaman do? Tells Netanyahu he has to campaign and cannot meet with him this week regarding this most urgent matter. Now I know there are peace freaks ou there that believe the world is no longer a violent place and war is no longer a threat. That is the height of naivety and surely a deadly mistake. As Joseph Teller (designer of USA hydrogen bomb) stated: 'A nuclear war is inevitable once one of our enemies believes they can hit us with minimal retaliation.' What is minimal to China? Losing 1/2 billion people or even a billion or more for that matter? Then ask yourselves if such is not a possibility why are the Chinese so aggressively building their militaries? If you think it's just for defense you best re-read history to know WAR IS AND ALWAYS HAS BEEN MAN'S REALITY!!! We do not need a child community organizing USA hating Saul Alinsky radical POTUS during such times of obvious turmoil. Add to that the dems alliance with debt as a system of currency manipulation and you must conclude the party is over. The dems Fed Reserve Bank CREATURE (they signed into law 1913) has now debt leveraged our currency to zero intrinsic value just as Ron Paul states. What this is truly about is 100 years of primary democrat party failed control for which their chickens indeed have come home to roost and they spent all our money (SS/Medicare, income taxes etc..) on welfare to lock in democrat votes moving forward. 1913 dem Wilson Federal Reserve Bank CREATURE that has debt leveraged our currency to zero intrinsic value, 1933 dem FDR failed SS Ponzi that was only to cost $.03 per pay, 1964 dem LBJ failed Medicare Ponzi now completely broke necessitating socialized medicine with the death panels to preclude costly care for the boomers now retiring in mass and being told all the money taken from them was squandered on welfare, and now Obama under dem Pelosi Congress more debt increase than all prior Presidents combined in less than 3.6 years.</Msg><Username>obamadungdufus</Username><Timestamp>1347443850928</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 05:57:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347446102723-11</Id><Title>Libya US Ambassador killed and dems spin 'mean ole Romney???</Title><Msg>Wow we is doomed with this current Obama regime.

HUH? First and foremost what leadership? Obama offers no leadership and this is the time for the USA of WWII fame to stand tall and call out these Muslim US haters for what they are. And what is Obama doing while Netanyahu is here and wanting to meet with him? Considering going on the Letterman DUNCE TV show to campaign.

Now for the best part, the stock is under 4 dollars because China is at a 3 year low on the slowdown with a stimulus just days away, oh yeay one more small factor, the richest man in the entire country of China has recently joined the Renn board of directors and said along with Chen they will not rest or be happy till Renn has at least a 100 Billion dollar market cap. This is the next Bidu, after 2 years of manipulation about to blast off like a rocket as the hedge funds have had plenty of time to load up. The rumor is the Billionaire told Chen he would not blast it off with his buddies until Chen is done with his company buyback of shares. This should be completed in Sep sometime because the Oct calls are getting hammered at ask each day no matter what the stock does, up or down.

VRNG!</Title><Msg>Vringo's (VRNG) Sept 12, 2012 Turnaround story from ringtone to a probably-acquired short-lived merger company goes full steam ahead because of the Nokia (NOK) relationship, promise of future 3G patent litigation and the need for Apple (AAPL) to acquire stronger patent presence in the 3G and 4G space, due to the Samsung (SSNLF.PK) 4G lawsuit. If Google (GOOG) doesn't acquire Vringo in short order to preclude a trial, I think Apple does, but for a different end game. I think Apple's well-publicized patent meeting discussions with Google were in direct response to Samsung's case and Google's timeline with Vringo's lawsuit. I also think Vringo's purchase of the Nokia patents may have been a chess move envied by Bobby Fischer, who, if what I say plays out, has nothing on Vringo's management. (To read some of the Vringo v. Google, et al case background of the Vringo case for newcomers, check out James Altucher's comments on Vringo here. Other discussions are here. And even more discussions about the patent war escalation can be found here.) The question in the current timeline to be pondered is why did Google meet with Apple this past week? With the mysterious patent meeting between Apple and Google, I think Apple put Google on notice this week that it intends to approach Vringo and that if Google doesn't acquire Vringo, along with a "Why can't we all get along" doctrine in place against patent infringement suits between related parties (ie, Samsung), then Apple may go "thermonuclear," as Steve Jobs promised. With an Apple acquisition of Vringo, Apple would be the claimant and, therefore, beneficiary behind the case against Google's core business model via Vringo. Even if Vringo/Apple doesn't prevail in court or even if the acquisition happens after an initial loss in court, Apple would ultimately be the client and the court room fodder of intellectual property I believe would be available and invaluable to Apple if in all out war against Google. Remember, Steve Jobs wanted to go thermonuclear on Google since he viewed Android as a product stolen from Apple. Because of this, I found it peculiar that as Apple prevailed against Samsung that Apple and Google would meet this past week in patent discussions. Google and Apple are supposed to be enemies, which is now coming to a head due to their respective futures in the mobile market, but the old saying that "the enemy of my enemy is my friend" comes to mind. So if Apple and Google are meeting, who is the common enemy? While Apple throws out welcomed product designs through a narrow channel, some could argue that its products are lacking in adequate patent support regarding the 3G and 4G space. And while Google may have friends in HTC, LG and Samsung's 3G and 4G patent space, Google, LG, HTC and Samsung may lack in product design originality, evidenced by Samsung's loss to Apple. But, again, who is the common enemy? The announcement that Samsung is now suing Apple over 4G LTE patent infringement as the impetus for their meeting hit me: neither Apple or Google may not have appropriate patent protection for their most important products. They have common ground, but they also have certain roadblocks ahead where they may need each. In short, they are not controllers of their own destinies since they have the money but may lack the patents and relationships to get them there. To answer the question, I think the common enemy is the lack of sufficient patent protection. I also think only Apple has this one perfect moment to get what it needs but will offer a truce for a co-existence of Google and Android in the process and let the market decide in the long-run. The path to this truce, however, may have had to be disclosed in that meeting to prevent further unintended escalation of the patent war. Apple may have figured out the cure to both ills, but the path for Apple may be through Vringo as Apple seeks to get a seat closer to center stage in Apple's quest for patents. Center stage for Apple, I think, is Nokia and I am not the only one who thinks this. But I haven't heard anyone speculate that Apple would want Vringo. And regarding Vringo, all the talk is about Google. For Apple, I think Nokia and Vringo go hand in hand. Here's why: While Apple v. Samsung is a Goliath versus Goliath story, Vringo's case against Google is probably one of the largest David versus Goliath stories in recent history. But that suit just may be the side dish for Apple (for now): the real meal may be in what the Nokia patents mean for Apple's end game. Apple already went through its own Goliath v. Goliath story when it lost a patent infringement case with Nokia last year. Remember, Apple lost to Nokia a 3G patent infringement case, had to pay a meager $500 million one-time, and has to pay royalties estimated by some sources to run upwards of $8 Billion over several years to Nokia, based on a certain amount per phone that is sold. An ironic twist to the recent win against Samsung is that Samsung may have infringed on Nokia's patents in the process of copying Apple's products. Future suit? Nokia is currently in a Windows software turnaround effort that is little more than a bug in Apple's ear for competition - for now. This has destroyed Nokia's market cap to a paltry $11+ Billion - chump change to Apple's $623 Billion market cap. Nokia previously had the largest market share of cell phones in the world and suffered primarily due to the operating system choice. That is partially solved -- maybe. It depends on how well Microsoft's system is received. It took only a couple of years for Nokia's lead to change hands to Apple but the iPhone 5 is rumored to be Steve Job's last baby. Does Apple also want the R&amp;D from Nokia? Nokia's R&amp;D is among the best in the world (except the Symbian software choice). Nokia has one of if not THE largest 4G LTE patent portfolios in the world. Their product development had a tablet design 10 years ago that simply lacked an adequate operating system. Their phones are works of art. Their software stunk. But almost ALL of it gets patented before production. Apple and others have a thing or two to learn about their process of getting so many patents and so much of this into production. What gets used by competitors sometimes more than Nokia itself, sometimes turns into lawsuits: that is why Nokia turned some of the 3G rights over to Vringo -- Nokia has secured two very good legal teams with whom they have a track record in the patent infringement space. As the article explains, Nokia has substantial potential revenues off from Patent Infringement cases and royalties if handled properly. The relationship with Vringo, based on the purchase price of the patent portfolio, appears to be of value to Nokia. Is the relationship also of value to Apple? Apple has $28 Billion in cash and no debt. Both Apple and Google have stock prices in the $660 to $680/share range, though Apple is about 2.5 times the market cap of Google at $623 Billion. Apple could acquire Vringo as a blip on the radar and result in having major leverage against a key competitor. Throw in Vringo's relationship bridging the gap between Apple and Nokia and the threat of opening up a patent war against Google's designs and both historical and pending 3G and 4G products with Nokia's portfolio in the mix, and Vringo could be a prime target for Apple. It also creates a conflict of interest to prevent Stout &amp; Co from going after Apple. My speculation is that the Google suit is an unintended consequence to Apple's current focus but would be an important component to its public image in terms of aggressiveness. Apple wants and needs Nokia's legacy 3G and 4G portfolios but Nokia may have messed Apple up by giving the legacy 3G portfolio rights to Vringo. Now, if Apple acquires Vringo, it would be viewed as all out war on Google's core business. I keep asking myself: Did Apple put Google on notice about their intent at the meeting last week? As Nokia rebuilds itself with an accepted operating system and as Nokia's massive 4G LTE patent portfolio and strategic partnerships (with Qualcomm, QCOM) loom over the industry, I believe, regardless of the status of Vringo v. Google's case, which I don't think will make it to trial, that Vringo is in the position to be acquired by either Google or Apple in short order and Apple wants to strike while Nokia is down in market cap. Apple can't since it doesn't know the terms of the 3G agreement with Vringo concerning Apple's royalties owed to Nokia, but may not want to overpay and give the appearance of thermonuclear war. I think the only way Apple truly gets a leg up and over the 4G and 3G patent war and to eliminate the up to $8 Billion in royalties owed or owing to Nokia is to buyout Nokia and Vringo. If Apple goes after Nokia first, the 3G rights to Vringo are probably not clear to Apple in relation to their royalties. Again, probably part of the discussions between Apple and Google this past week. Apple may have also recognized that they need Vringo's evident relationship with Nokia, which Apple probably lacks based on their past run-ins with Nokia, but why there may be a great match to be made with Vringo, Nokia and Apple working together. Let's face it: Samsung will unlikely offer Apple its patent use unless Apple undoes what it just spent millions to procure in its lawsuit. HTC, LG and Samsung are both proponents for Google's operating system, so Google seems to have greater protection in the 3G and 4G space. When the simple question is asked as to who's left in the 3G legacy and 4G patent space that would entertain offers from Apple, a simple glaringly apparent answer is Nokia and Apple can't get all the 3G without Vringo. If, and this "If" is probably dependent on the tone of the meeting, Apple wants to go thermonuclear, then it backs Vringo's case in appeal as the claimant against Google, whether Vringo wins or loses. Apple would then be going after Google manufacturers for tablet designs and 3G and 4G infringement. It will get uglier if the meeting did not go well. I think Apple wants Google to get Samsung to back-off in exchange for the Nokia and Vringo acquisitions to go unmolested. At $650 million for Vringo for the Nokia 3G rights and the leverage of the future 3G claims against likely offenders as well as the Google lawsuit leverage, Apple could acquire Vringo at a price per share of roughly $6 to $7 per share at approximately 1 share of Apple for 100 shares of Vringo. Then, for 30 million shares or possibly some blend of cash and 30 million shares of Apple to Nokia, Nokia would be at an estimated 80 to 100% premium from current levels. I think the meeting between Apple and Google was for Apple to tell Google to get Samsung off our backs and pay damages, we'll set aside design concerns going forward and, in exchange, we'll make the Vringo core business suit go away.</Msg><Username>letitgrowknows</Username><Timestamp>1347495568601</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 20:19:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347499044124-53</Id><Title>RENN TRIAD RUMORS ON ANONYMOUS TORNET and Whistleblower forums from caterers</Title><Msg>Goog traders, RENN is starting to get how it gets when the crooked specialist can't force down, hold back anymore.
