A stock hitting new high territory is a good sign but its what happens after the breakout that tells you if a run in GOOG will happen in the next couple of weeks. We would look to get long GOOG if 1 of the following 2 things happen: #1 If the breakout hits new highs but fails, pulls back above the old highs level and starts building a base. #2 If the breakout fails and is smacked down all the way back into its base but above the $638-$648 level. This is the level of the last consolidation and can act as support before the 2nd rally attempt occurs. The most favorable of the 2 setups is the #1 scenario where a pullback with at least 2 days will get us looking for a confirmation pattern and can allow us to get in at a very favorable price ahead of a potential big rally into new high territory.</Msg><Username>commoditycyclicalsgay</Username><Timestamp>1345091119289</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 00:25:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345091377984-2</Id><Topic><Title>Lucid observation</Title><Username>ubiquitoustrader</Username><Timestamp>1345083001181</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 22:10:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sorry ubi...

The highly unusual order was issued on Tuesday by U.S. District Judge William Alsup, who said he was concerned that Google and Oracle or their counsel had retained or paid people who may have published comment on the case. The order, issued several months after a jury found that Google did not infringe Oracle patents, hints at the possibility of a hidden world of for-pay press coverage and injects uncertainty into the widely followed case.</Msg><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1345126520695</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 10:15:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345126682048-14</Id><Title>WOW???

"I think the judge is in uncharted territory with this order." Goldman said two potential reasons for the order would be if there were evidence that the jury had been swayed by extensive press coverage of the case, or if the jury had relied on evidence not properly labeled as unbiased, such as a for-pay news article offered as an exhibit in the trial.</Msg><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1345127772421</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 10:36:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345127897621-17</Id><Topic><Title>ON2 SI and 3 pdf docs: They can NOT say they did NOT know!!!!</Title><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1306070069000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2011-05-22 09:14:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ON2 SI and 3 pdf docs: They can NOT say they did NOT know</Msg><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1345127897621</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 10:38:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345127967495-18</Id><Topic><Title>What a SCAM court sysem: with 100-share lead vs 178 million ON2 shares???</Title><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1303700884000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2011-04-24 23:08:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What a SCAM court sysem: with 100-share lead vs 178 million ON2 shares??</Msg><Username>casp321</Username><Timestamp>1345127967495</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 10:39:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345128306266-19</Id><Topic><Title>Overbought...</Title><Username>craigrhart</Username><Timestamp>1345125173021</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 09:52:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>To the extreme, see MACD as well.</Msg><Username>robynrokn</Username><Timestamp>1345128306266</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 10:45:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345128691758-20</Id><Topic><Title>WOW???
