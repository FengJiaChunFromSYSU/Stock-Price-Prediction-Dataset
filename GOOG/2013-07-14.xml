The company is Concurrent (CCUR) and it looks ready to explode to new 52-week highs this week. It is paying a HUGE dividend yield of 6.1%! CCUR was the first company to bring VOD to the market in 2000 when they deployed it for TWC and today, VOD is the fastest growing alternative TV viewing platform in the world - with CCUR's VOD delivery technology reaching 50 million households for a 30% market share. 1/2 of all U.S. TV households now have a DVR, but CCUR is about to make today's DVR technology obsolete with new cloud-based nDVRs. CCUR already deployed a form of its nDVR technology for TWC, which is powering TWC's extremely popular start-over/look-back services. Soon CCUR will begin deploying fully featured nDVR services for its pay-TV clients. CCUR's nDVR technology will allow anybody to record infinite television programs over the cloud, without a DVR box - and be played back on any device - including smartphones and tablets. CCUR closed last week at only $7.88 with a market cap of $68.98 million, cash of $22.37 million, and an enterprise value of $46.61 million or just 0.74X revenues and 6.54X operating cash flow. CCUR's main rival SEAC is about to hit a new 52-week high and is trading for 1.78X revenues and 15.92X operating cash flow. SEAC's valuation ratios would value CCUR between $15.41 and $15.52! Major consolidation is taking place in the cable TV industry and rumors are now circulating that TWC may acquire Cablevision, in order to catch up to Comcast's subscriber base. Cable TV operators are facing more competition than ever before and CCUR's technologies are critical to the success of this $100 billion industry! CCUR's fiscal 3Q 2013 EPS was up 450% from the 4Q of 2012 and CCUR's 10-K filing is coming next month!</Msg><Username>goodwe212</Username><Timestamp>1373831498089</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-14 15:51:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373834683599-2</Id><Topic><Title>Ready to Rally 100% or More</Title><Username>goodwe212</Username><Timestamp>1373831498089</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-14 15:51:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Interesting but the run-up from early 2012, it's a double. Not a problem IMO or not as much of one considering the resistance it hit in February. Average daily volume of 83,000, not enough to do any reliable technical analysis. I don't see the interest building nor the excitement you hope to create. If you want, give your opinion of SAPX, a pink sheet gamble to be sure. You'll need to use a charting site other than Yahoo; maybe Nasdaq, barcharts, bigcharts, stockcharts, or one your broker provides. The only positive I can offer is the prospect of their new hire bringing a portfolio of films or the possibility that insiders are buying in the open market for a LBO. I wouldn't advise anyone taking the gamble with more than 100,000 shares.</Msg><Username>cyclopsfighter</Username><Timestamp>1373834683599</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-14 16:44:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373838382052-3</Id><Topic><Title>Wish GOOG crashes to $400 ... just like AAPL</Title><Username>wallstreetskimmer</Username><Timestamp>1373723187599</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 09:46:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yikes.

On Thursday afternoon at 3:45 hrs...Sell a Jan 2014 or 215 covered call, above market price, that puts $70 to $100+ per share in your pocket. then buy a CHEAP JUly 2013 call not to miss the run on Friday....The sale of the covered call has any downside hedge and pays for the purchase of the July 2013 call. What is not to like in this strategy? Signing off.</Msg><Username>biglefthook_00</Username><Timestamp>1373855935315</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-14 22:38:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
