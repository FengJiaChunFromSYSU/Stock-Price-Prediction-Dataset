Easy money for those Counsels involving in the ON2 shareholders' OPT-OUT. This is Just one scenario of too many cases: For the FUTUTRE ON2's Legal counsels, once they atart OPT-OT, to add to their NOTES: Just remember this IMPORTANT Note: WebRTC [open-sourcing GIPS] was announced on May 3, 2011, long before Microsoft announcing "Microsoft to Acquire Skype" on May 10, 2011. The Media is trying to CONFUSE the DATE and push it, to June, a little after MS announcement to confuse the subjects. Why? ON2 shareholders might be surprised to find it out after starting OUPT-OUT, once the JUdge FINALISEs the case. Google DUMPED GIPS in May 3, 2011 under the name of open-source after Judge OPT-OUT ON2 case in April 2011. Interestingly enough, the LEAD Google lawyer, "expert in MA&amp;A, handling ON2/Google "merger" announced in March 2011 that he is leavng Google for Facebook. The judge MUST have had told the Lawyers involved in ON2 "lawsuit settlement" case about her rulling some time before April 2011, Feb or March of 2011. Also, remember that the RUMOR regarding Google and Facebook discussions about acquiring Skype were also on the News, on May 4 2011, even after Google open-sourcing GIPS. Microsoft to Acquire Skype REDMOND, Wash., and LUXEMBOURG – May 10, 2011 – Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq: “MSFT”) and Skype Global S.à r.l today announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement under which Microsoft will acquire Skype, the leading Internet communications company, for $8.5 billion in cash from the investor group led by Silver Lake.

Why would they hire two different companies as the advisor other than CONFUSING the NUMBERs, when someone finding out the DISCREPANCIEs amoung all of these results, especially when they claim ON2 was the main sources of their ON2-Hantro related finalcial or other information, and later on BEING ABLE to JUSTIFY : casp321 Here is public report on August 5, 2009: Google to Acquire On2 Technologies CLIFTON PARK, NY and MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (August 5, 2009) - On2 Technologies, Inc. (NYSE Amex: ONT) and Google Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG) jointly announced today that they have entered into a definitive agreement under which Google will acquire On2, a leading developer of video compression technology. Under the terms of the agreement, each outstanding share of On2 common stock will be converted into $0.60 worth of Google class A common stock in a stock-for-stock transaction. The transaction is valued at approximately $106.5 million. The transaction, which is subject to On2 stockholder approval, regulatory clearances and other closing conditions, is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2009. Wilson Sonsini Goodrich &amp; Rosati and Potter Anderson &amp; Corroon served as legal counsel to Google, and Credit Suisse provided M&amp;A advisory services to Google. Covington Associates, LLC served as financial advisor to On2 and its board of directors and Duff &amp; Phelps, LLC served as an independent financial advisor to On2's board of directors, and each of them provided an opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the public stockholders of On2 of the exchange ratio in the proposed transaction. Hogan &amp; Hartson LLP and Richards, Layton &amp; Finger served as legal counsel to On2. --------- On August 4, 2009, Duff &amp; Phelps, LLC (“Duff &amp; Phelps”) rendered an opinion (the “Opinion”) to the board of directors of On2 Technologies, Inc. (the “Company”) as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the public stockholders of the Company of the Exchange Ratio, as defined in the Opinion, in the Proposed Transaction, as defined in the Opinion, (without giving effect to any impact of the Proposed Transaction on any particular stockholder other than in its capacity as a stockholder). In the Opinion, Duff &amp; Phelps stated that it had previously provided a valuation of the intangible assets of Hantro Products Oy in connection with its acquisition by the Company. Upon further investigation, Duff &amp; Phelps has learned that it was never engaged by the Company to, and did not perform any services in connection with the acquisition of Hantro Products Oy. As a result, we believe that the reference to such services as disclosed in the registration statement on Form S-4 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 11, 2009 by Google Inc. in connection with the Proposed Transaction should be removed.

Reliable Sources - President Obama called Susan Rice and told her to lie to the Media for the sake of his reelection campaign. " This is not good for our reelection campaign, Romney will go on the attack mode with this Libya Attack Event." Susan Rice told NBC’s “Meet the Press”: “Our current assessment is what happened in Benghazi was, in fact, initially a spontaneous reaction to what had just transpired hours before in Cairo, almost a copycat of the demonstrations against our facility in Cairo, prompted by the video.” President Barack Obama Wants Us To Believe that He Has What It Takes to Lead The United States. He has tried to convince of us this idea that he can deliver "hope and change". His campaign implies that he is a leader, and that he will continue to lead. Yet, when it comes to taking responsibility for events, he, like former President Bill Clinton, take the coward's way out and blame somebody else. Specifically, after the Waco event, where men and woman and children were killed, burned to death, President Clinton blamed his Attorney General, the sick and ailing Janet Reno. Now, after the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, is falling on the sword. CNN reports that Hillary Clinton says that she is responsible for "diplomats". While this may be true to the letter of the law, President Obama is the Commander-in-Chief and is responsible for acts of war against sovereign US territory, which comprise embassies but not diplomatic mission locales. It is still a difference without a distinction. The facts are that four American citizens died, including Ambassador Chris Stevens. This kind of thing does happen, and it is a consequence of being a nation on the world stage. The attack and killings took place on September 11, eleven years after the attack in the World Trade Center.

I did an inverse vertical, where I shorted the 850 calls and bought 875 calls. The problem was that I put in my shorts right before it jumped so I sold them for cheap and within a minute the 875 calls were almost twice as expensive as the 850 calls were a minute before. I bought some 875's out of fear that they would keep shooting up, but then realized this is an anomaly so I started shorting the 850's again. I shorted 8 contracts, but after a few minutes TDAmeritrade canceled my last 5 that I sold at $2.20 each and I ended up with only 3. So I assumed that must've been a glitch which is why they started canceling the sales. I"m counting on it not going above 850 by Nov expiration date.</Msg><Username>reza_safarnejad</Username><Timestamp>1350436003062</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 21:06:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350439322373-82</Id><Topic><Title>$ 800 calls</Title><Username>moneymakeraddict</Username><Timestamp>1350423758431</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 17:42:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hope this helps you. I am long the 720 calls double short the 760 and long the 800 calls you mention. While you see the open interest in the 800 as expecting high volatility, my trade is a low volatility trade with maximum payout at 760 where it was when I opened the trade. At 800 I lose the 7 it took to open the trade.</Msg><Username>johnnov22</Username><Timestamp>1350439322373</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 22:02:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350444656092-83</Id><Title>Google will be MASSACRED!!
