Cost per click would remain the same with fewer click throughs. Mobile or desktop, Google makes revenue " These low-income people never even clicked on goog's ads on traditional desktops, so they can't be expected to click on them on Android phones with smaller screens." So, no effect on Google income. Is there or is there not going to be a huge movement from desktop to mobile? If there is, Google will make the most with their mobile search engine and pop up ads.</Msg><Username>therulersupreme</Username><Timestamp>1358610673000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 10:51:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358612394581-3</Id><Topic><Title>Anyone here ever visit the AAPL board?</Title><Username>merenkov</Username><Timestamp>1358448297136</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 13:44:57 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Apple message board is a beta of sorts. When Yahoo wants to initiate changes to their boards they choose a popular one as a testing ground to gauge the feedback. Though there are some good posts over there, unfortunately the Apple board is now one of the largest collection of #$%$, jerks,selfish and self-centered lowlifes I have ever witnessed (with the possible exception of Craigslist's Rant and Raves section).</Msg><Username>going_broke_fast</Username><Timestamp>1358612394581</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 11:19:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358621906259-4</Id><Topic><Title>Anyone here ever visit the AAPL board?</Title><Username>merenkov</Username><Timestamp>1358448297136</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 13:44:57 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Apple bashers are what destroy the board with filth, lies, and insults.</Msg><Username>atrayu19</Username><Timestamp>1358621906259</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 13:58:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358625519829-5</Id><Topic><Title>Why didn't GOOG plunge today?</Title><Username>jpiggoingdownhel</Username><Timestamp>1358548723530</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 17:38:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Down 7 is 1%.

If that rate has held up, Google would be at about 9.5 million +/- claimed pages now — still below what Facebook is reporting today.
