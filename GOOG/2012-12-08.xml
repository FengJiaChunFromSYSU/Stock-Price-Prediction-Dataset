Most Android devices sold in China have been stripped of Google’s advertising-supported apps and services, as well as its Google Play store for third-party apps and music, books, and video. That means the devices are missing the two main ways by which the U.S. Web giant brings in revenue from the free Android operating system. The CEO of Baidu, the desktop Web search leader in China, said this year that 80 percent of Android-branded phones come with Baidu’s search service, rather than Google’s, loaded on the device… [Google] significantly scale[d] back its operations in 2010 when it took its search business out of the country in a stand against the Chinese government’s censorship.”</Msg><Username>dogeater20088</Username><Timestamp>1355028806718</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-08 23:53:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355029054046-10</Id><Topic><Title>Why Google makes no profit with 70% Android market share?</Title><Username>dogeater20088</Username><Timestamp>1354851844589</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 22:44:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Zero profit from Android in China.
