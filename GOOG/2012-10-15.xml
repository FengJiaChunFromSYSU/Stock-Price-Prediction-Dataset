The sources said the intelligence community knew by Sept. 12 that the militant Ansar al-Shariah and Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb were likely behind the strike. ( YES INDEED PRESIDENT OBAMA LIED FOR POLITICAL REASONS ) Further, an official said, "No one ... believed that the mortars, indirect and direct fire, and the RPGs were just the work of a mob -- no one." Yet a congressional source told Fox News that CIA Director David Petraeus, during a briefing with members of the House Intelligence Committee three days after the attack, espoused the view that Benghazi was an out-of-control demonstration prompted by the YouTube video. According to the source, this was "shocking" to some members who were present and saw the same intelligence pointing toward a terrorist attack.</Msg><Username>jack_welch_obama</Username><Timestamp>1350311221268</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 10:27:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350311432264-23</Id><Title>i hope google doesn't settle with vringo so they can lose in trial and pay out BILLIONS..</Title><Msg>topic</Msg><Username>rgutierrezla</Username><Timestamp>1350311432264</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 10:30:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350312452250-24</Id><Title>it was easy short from $770</Title><Msg>at this point a bit tougher. covering for now.

Google can not prove from all data it has that Lang deliberately delayed filing. His group did not rebuy his patents from other company till this year. They were asking for all these records to prove laches but IMHO it is very very weak based on long time study of patent laws and Supreme Court rulings on this matter. Google's defense not likely to work since new owners came in after. goo.gl/OKwEM The harm of the delay can be shown in a variety of ways. Here, the magistrate judge focused on evidentiary harms and economic harms. Evidence Lost: Troxler founder and CEO died during the interim. He had directed the development of the accused product. Evidence Lost: Time delay has probably faded the memory of the Pine inventors. Evidence Lost: Many documents have been destroyed. (Troxler is a family business – "When the drawer gets full, you toss something.") Economic: In the interim, Troxler has invested millions of dollars in manufacturing facilities and producing the alleged product. Based on the potential validity of some of these arguments, the magistrate judge recommended they be explored at trial. Unclean Hands: Because laches and equitable estoppel are both judged in equity, Pine argued that Troxler's "unclean hands" should bar the company from relying upon those defenses. Particularly, Pine noted discovery shenanigans and filing suit without a good faith basis. The magistrate judge agreed that allegations of "egregious behavior" must be included in any equitable decision. The district court will now decide whether to convert the magistrate judge's recommendations into an order.</Msg><Username>contezta</Username><Timestamp>1350334047972</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 16:47:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350335197514-71</Id><Topic><Title>I am dancing a jig!!</Title><Username>obamasuxcockwithnegrolips</Username><Timestamp>1346262402217</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 13:46:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>upppppppppppppppppp</Msg><Username>nggrobama</Username><Timestamp>1350335197514</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 17:06:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350335517854-72</Id><Topic><Title>after hours low on goog</Title><Username>contezta</Username><Timestamp>1350332899087</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 16:28:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Trying to trick people by posting an out of order trade as a real after hours trade is not very nice.</Msg><Username>uknownadathing</Username><Timestamp>1350335517854</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 17:11:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350335786893-73</Id><Title>Quinn Emmanuel will Embarass google as well as lose.

As to the point that this search tech and these patents were a done deal before the G team were yet Freshman in college and never even came close to the garage yet . Hello! Onward , Lycos had search on over 60 million docs @ this time as they were still smoking in the boys bathroom . It will be brought forth that they were geniuses in all aspects . The goog boys banded together and loved the internet like a garage band . We avg. peeps know as garage bands go from back in the day we had little of our own original material available but we could play the hell out of what had already been done . This certainly is a perfect example of that in the tech sector of days gone by. In those early days of internet nobody cared about patents or if you played off the prior Co.'s tech but if you did it, the laws of infringement under patent law today certainly apply to you in this day and age. It is a multi multi billion dollar industry that does still pertain to the Garage Co.'s that formed before the statute of limitations runs out on patent tech as written law provides protection to intellectual property. As Goog has infringed in my opinion on very many levels of patent tech as I have read all the lawsuits against them in the pipeline from many others , they did what was status quo back in the day but may have to give up a lot of gains up for there past transgressions! Will not appeal to the Avg. American Juror as they Goog has a very arrogant attitude towards it all!
