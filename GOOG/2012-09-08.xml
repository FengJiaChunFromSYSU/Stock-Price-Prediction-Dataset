Aren't the democrats out in mass acclaiming Obama ended both wars (i.e. Iraq and Afghanistan??) Did not Obama say yesterday that by ending the wars he will have money to pass along (redistribute to us?) Of course when he says us he means them (the welfare non working illegal alien group.) But just last week Obama while in Afghanistan stated we are winning but we need to gear up for what undoubtedly will be a long fight. It seems to me they just say whatever they feel will best help them. I work for a defense contrator and know for a fact the US State Dept will have 16,000 employees in Iraq and all those employees will have protection provided by private/ex military personnel (many ex Special Ops that can make more money outside military but do the same job.) Obama never tells folks that only the spin that he has ended the wars. burnpit legion org/2011/10/private-military-firms-and-post-2011-iraq (PUT PERIOD WHERE SPACES ARE FOR LINK 2 periods one after burnpit and one after legion) The only reason Iraq is appearing to wind down is because private firms are replacing military with ex military to give said appearance.</Msg><Username>rldcis</Username><Timestamp>1347106632493</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-08 08:17:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347106829925-2</Id><Topic><Title>GOOG/AAPL correlation</Title><Username>tomsongarry</Username><Timestamp>1343280708626</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 01:31:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>@Garry, It was a good timing to buy GOOG@610, about a month ago per your advice.
