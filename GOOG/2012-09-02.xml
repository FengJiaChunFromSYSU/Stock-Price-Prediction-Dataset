So gear up for the FILTHY RICH GEORGIE GIRL SOROS FUNDED Charlotte show beginning this week then the October surprise they will all have in store to provide more fake economic turn around instilling the ploy that Obamadungdufus is why. HA! Look at the $5.6 TRILLION debt increase in less than 4 years under Obamadungdufus and the FACT that it will most likely go over $16 TRILLION by the time the Charlotte Show ends. You have to be quite dumb to not see all these FACTS (i.e. 100 years of primary dem party control) and your dumbo leaders such as Obamadungdufus, Queen Pelosi, Dingy Harry the Body Reid and the DO NOTHING SENATE, Axeldingleberry...rely upon that FACT, that you indeed are just as STUPID as them!!! Now lets get off to Charlotte and watch all the hate inspired division of the dunce dem party of today! As the Roberts ruling continues to be analyzed I believe his words say it all: 1. It is a tax just as we all surmised from the beginning and 2; most importantly the court cannot protect the citizens from the consequences of an election. So you see, just as I and many said, Obama has indeed changed the country forever in a very bad way. We indeed will now have the UK failed system of socialized medicine, to replace our very outstanding previously profit driven capitalistic form of medicine that being the very factor that made it so great. What this is truly about is 100 years of primary democrat party failed control for which their chickens indeed have come home to roost and they spent all our money (SS/Medicare, income taxes etc..) on welfare to lock in democrat votes moving forward. 1913 dem Wilson Federal Reserve Bank CREATURE that has debt leveraged our currency to zero intrinsic value, 1933 dem FDR failed SS Ponzi that was only to cost $.03 per pay, 1964 dem LBJ failed Medicare Ponzi now completely broke necessitating socialized medicine with the death panels to preclude costly care for the boomers now retiring in mass and being told all the money taken from them was squandered on welfare, and now Obama under dem Pelosi Congress more debt increase than all prior Presidents combined in less than 3.6 years. Yes Justice Roberts is correct that the court cannot be responsible for the consequences of an election, indeed Obama Care is a huge cost and most importantly this decision will cost many more jobs and the USA as once known is now finished. Hopefully Romney can stand on the 10th Amendment which is correct asserting that healthcare in MA was a states issue and this Federal mandate is not but repealing it now will be tough and impossible without Repubs taking House, Senate and POTUS. Without Harry Reid gone nothing will ever be accomplished.</Msg><Username>obamadungdufus</Username><Timestamp>1346609990585</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 14:19:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346612262667-9</Id><Topic><Title>Mitt Romney is liar from a cult , no beer , wine or spirits ( very strange dude)</Title><Username>grouponnewbie</Username><Timestamp>1346512470986</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-01 11:14:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>As Huckabee said 'I have more confidence in a Morman than a man like Obamadungdufus claiming to be a Christian yet openly supporting not only abortion but partial birth abortion as well as fanticide, homosexual marriage etc. etc.' This won't be about religion anyway but rather the horrific failed economy of Obamadungdufus and the Pelosi dem Congress piled onto 100 years of failed primary dem party control all being safeguarded by Dingy Harry the Body Reid and the DO NOTHING SENATE.
