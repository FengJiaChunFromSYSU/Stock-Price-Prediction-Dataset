Cash drops hard in Q1 because the seasonal float from Q4 reverses anyway. If not for the $3B note in Q4, Amazon would have been in a rather uncomfortable position. I'm still amazed that the offering document had nothing on cash position and net working capital at the timing of the offering (but not so much at all the iBank upgrades that followed, particularly from those that did the offering...). Cash position and cash flow matter. Amazon has cavalierly levered up (off balance sheet liabilities, distribution/warehousing that haven't solved the last mile problem, etc). It's cost structure simply isn't what the analysts pretend. Look at GROSS shipping cost as a percent of net sales in the upcoming release. Amazon raised prices for FBA, so net will gain somewhat, but it still cannot solve the fundamental economic tradeoff which continues to move against Amazon. Oh, and Amazon's been releasing all the teasers it can to pump before earnings (Set top box, Ad network, etc). None of it will help solve the cash crunch that will be coming. For those that think Amazon isn't levered, its debt to book is already on par with industry norms.... (and that doesn't include its financial engineering...).</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1366840298935</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 17:51:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366840304014-75</Id><Topic><Title>Tech succommed to hiz ditm amzn leap put strategy - rip tech</Title><Username>sybil_rulez</Username><Timestamp>1366836464976</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 16:47:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sybil, if and when Amazon plunges, puts will have their day.</Msg><Username>ex.goldbug</Username><Timestamp>1366840304014</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 17:51:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366841073331-76</Id><Topic><Title>Tech succommed to hiz ditm amzn leap put strategy - rip tech</Title><Username>sybil_rulez</Username><Timestamp>1366836464976</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 16:47:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Tech, With crack head optionz, sybil typically findz that a stok plungez the monday after the friday that optionz expire.

There is really only one path out that avoids cascading defaults and it has been underway for the past 2 years. Investment is companies with strong balance sheets, globally diversified earnings and reasonable multiples won't get hit hard.

I pointed out that there is a difference between sophisticated players armed with aymmetric information (think of HFT as having radar to understand the shape of demand where others have at best line of sight in foggy conditions) and then exploiting cognitive biases and behavioral investing against John Q. Public. Likewise, the analysts and financial media are presumably more sophisticated and culpable in perpetrating these trading scams. In the case of Enron, it was company fraud.
