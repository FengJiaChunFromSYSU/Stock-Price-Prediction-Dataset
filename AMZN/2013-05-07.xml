First the banks have eased lending standards and second the Israel attack on Syria has significance. For those interested, the below info shall not dissappoint. With the lending for mortgages easing is a sign it is bubbling rapidly. Real Estate has a profound impact of what is to happen on global scale. What the adverserary did in a past generation is to repeat history even now. We go back to the mindset of the adverserary....Then they said to one another, "Come let us make bricks and bake them thoroughly, They made brick for stone, and they had asphalt for mortar. And they said, Come let us build ourselves a city, and a tower(Babylon) whose tops is in the heavens... (Gen 11:3-4) For the city to function they needed building to attract the peoples so the bricks and stone was for the establishment of appealing Real Estate. Asphalt was used as a binding agent and it is petroleum based and so, oil will be the binding agent to get to a new world order. THe USA(Rev 13:11-17) plays a huge role in prophecy and for it to control economies via the NWO, it must first control the oil spout in the Middle East. That's why economic sanctions are used to convert because no country can survive without oil-energy. And he(USA) causes all ...to receive a mark on their hand(econimic) or on their foreheads=spiritual(Rev 13:15). The Japan Fukashima nuclear disaster was to end global nuclear energy expansion. Now we see Israel strike Syria to eventually draw Iran and OPEC into the conflict. We already seen Iraq, Libya and Egypt go down.......Oil is the true currency as we approach a currency collapse, and, what's behind it? You(antichrist) will come up against My people like a cloud, to cover(control) the land. It will be in the latter days that I will bring you against My land=people.Eze 38 15-16 The currency collapse will burst global real estate and the real estate goes back to the Elite.

If all the money keeps coming in even stocks whose fundamentals say otherwise which are part of major indexes and ETFs and are street favorites get propped up. They basically just encourage people to short term trade in stocks like this. If you play with options far out is better than near term, but always factor in what your breakeven price is and if you don't like the BE, don't buy the options. If you are shorting add as it goes up and cover as it goes down around any core you hold. Might it all end badly as some people say here of course it might but when nobody knows and what exactly will cause it no one knows either.</Msg><Username>hapihammer</Username><Timestamp>1367941615309</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 11:46:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367941991296-22</Id><Title>After May options expire</Title><Msg>watch AMZN break down through the 200 dma and down through 240 to put an exclamation mark on it...selling calls</Msg><Username>theinandoutcrowd</Username><Timestamp>1367941991296</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 11:53:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367942403101-23</Id><Topic><Title>After May options expire</Title><Username>theinandoutcrowd</Username><Timestamp>1367941991296</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 11:53:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You are not making any sense here.

My opinion is there should be a 6% flat sales tax that goes to the nation. The US government pays a lot to keep the internet safe. States do not have to pay a lot for infrastructure for these online merchants. Besides sales tax goes to the general fund where it is then used to pay for things that the US government usually subsidizes anyways. Something like half the states run a deficit with the US government. What surprises me is my home state of California actually has a surplus. And yet we have a huge deficit within the state. I think that is wrong when other states run a deficit with the fed but they have a state surplus. Seems to me like the fed and the states need to get more inline with fiscal responsibilities. Amazon will be at a disadvantage to other online merchants in CA, New York, Texas, Florida and several other states. Online tax will help even the playing field for Amazon.</Msg><Username>it_all_goood</Username><Timestamp>1367947231027</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 13:20:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367947233737-40</Id><Title>AMZN plunge on 26 April</Title><Msg>Can anyone tell me why Amazon plunged a massive $23 on 26 April please.

They missed on revs and guided Q2 significantly lower on revs. They also guided to a operating loss, which was completely unexpected. The street reduced its EPS target for Q2 from 22c all the way down to 7c (70% reduction). Full year CY13 was also reduced for both revs and EPS estimates. All of this for a company with a forward P/E of well over 100. I'd say that's pretty disappointing. What is amazing is that they are only down about 6% on continued underperformance to significantly reduced expectations. All in the name of "they will make profit some day".

People who used to enjoy the tax-free online purchases are now have to think a little harder before they bought their 20th pair of pants or 3 pair of shoes if the "tax" discount is not there. The reason the small guys are fried is because they have to pay something like 12-15% of the transaction costs if they are a vendor on Amazon/Ebay so they will loose out by the transaction costs. Other medium to smaller vendors will loose some customers as well. Winners will obviously be retailers or international small time vendors since the shipping fees are negated by the tax. The economy is weak enough as is, any more taxation and you will see spending go down at least for some time. BTW, Amazon doesn't even have the best prices on many items is just that their return policy is second to none.</Msg><Username>tung_5000</Username><Timestamp>1367949087222</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 13:51:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367949093755-48</Id><Topic><Title>AMZN will test $300 in the next several days.</Title><Username>geegenjar</Username><Timestamp>1367945135459</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 12:45:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You will stop posting because the pump and dump will be complete and AMZN will be in full descent mode.

This will be the 2010's version of Enron of there is a market shock, except that the negligence (fraud is a higher standard) will not have been committed by management, but by certain financial institutions.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1367977643763</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 21:47:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367978075144-74</Id><Topic><Title>Look out over yonder from the hieghts of a mkt blowoff top</Title><Username>sybil_rulez</Username><Timestamp>1367610749178</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 15:52:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sometimes it better to keep you mouth shut and let people think you're and idiot, then to open it up and prove it.</Msg><Username>rick3ster</Username><Timestamp>1367978075144</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 21:54:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367978416635-75</Id><Topic><Title>Look out over yonder from the hieghts of a mkt blowoff top</Title><Username>sybil_rulez</Username><Timestamp>1367610749178</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 15:52:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Kind of like knowing the difference between then and than....</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1367978416635</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 22:00:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367978696009-76</Id><Topic><Title>FPE of 80</Title><Username>lived666or12</Username><Timestamp>1367977551664</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 21:45:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Neither the twelve month forward PE (what used to be considered the FPE before WS needed to move the goalposts to pretend stocks are still cheap) nor the 2014 PE will turn out to be 80 or below. The underlying earnings trends are clear and they are being driven by evolving cost drivers. This has been a trading scam and nothing more. The analyst community has been completely complicit in this scam. If they still did fundamental economic analysis and evaluated the cost drivers and trends, they would have already reset price targets into the low 100's.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1367978696009</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 22:04:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
