History is filled with these types who in the end were often laughed at and pursecuted: Moses, Joan of Arch, Jesus of Nazareth, and the list goes on .... Heed to the crazy singh for the dope that he smokes iz good sheit, better than the appache tribes... His visions come to him with clarity and he preachez with conviction.... Heed the word of singh despite that he iz a broke deick that has been fighting the fed on the biggest fu ralley sybil has ever seen of epic proportions.... And through a dollar and lose change into the cup as you pass by the man shouting for you to repent.... It will buy him a meal and you some good karma.</Msg><Username>philandjoel1e</Username><Timestamp>1350499926710</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 14:52:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350500015977-120</Id><Title>Are you ready for an explosion?</Title><Msg>Shorts, are you?</Msg><Username>geegenjar</Username><Timestamp>1350500015977</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 14:53:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350500228483-121</Id><Title>TIC TOC say oh no down we go</Title><Msg>TIC TOC say oh no down we go</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1350500228483</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 14:57:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350500349595-122</Id><Title>If you purchased shares today look around and see who you are going to sell them to.

It seems big time shorts know that they are in trouble, so they cover when they see a significant dip.

The reason is simple the big guys always have concentrated their trades to get better deals when they buy and sell in bulk with GOLDMAN / KKK/ BRIGEWATER/ MORGAN....The higher priced stocks allow them to put big bucks to work quikly. Problem comes when things start to come unraveled in one or more. They can't get out so they tend to try and tuff it out.
