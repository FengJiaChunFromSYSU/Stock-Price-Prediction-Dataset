Yes, folks, remember this is the poster who told us the same thing at $180 many months ago when he first entered short. Tells you how much he knows about "decent investing". When the fundamentals "do matter" and the stock falls from $400 to $380 how will that help someone like him who shorted from $180 or even $245 as he recently tries to claim? Will it "help" him to lose a lot of money instead of "more than" a lot of money?

I first rode AMZN down from 240 to the 175 area last year. Made a health profit. I didn't reenter until AMZN hit 230. I rode it down to 215 and sold all of my OOM puts before earnings, holding only my DITM position. I am gradually increasing my position and will ultimately make a killing on this scam. I always beat these scams because I understand the psychological games being played (behaviorial investing) and I always maintain a sufficient cash hedge to see through the capitulation squeezes. Everyone said the same crap to me about GMCR and then NFLX as a short. Then, when I pivoted and went long GMCR (which, I will note that I haven't heard of any of the major shorts doing that) at $17, I got mocked for being stupid going long a company that would be bankrupt... Yet, I was proved right (what is that, over 90% since I pivoted and went long?). You are a two bit momentum player who simply does not understand the limited economic value capture potential behind AMZN. It is building an infrastructure to dominate distribution of electronic content, yet the consumer will be agnostic as to where it buys its electronic content when everyone has a cloud service. AAPL, GOOG and others will match (or beat since they can) the price that AMZN charges and it will simply have huge overhead costs, an overgrown physical distrbution presence and limited cash flow to support it. Truly, this will prove epic if AAPL and GOOG fight back hard and given that AMZN pulled out a bull whip, it is hard to imagine they won't pull an Indiana Jones and use the revolver...</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1347370053971</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 09:27:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347370164824-11</Id><Topic><Title>NTWK $5.3 UP 33c....BREAKING OUT!!

There are plenty of people that have read my posts on NFLX, GMCR, LULU, CMG, GOOG, AAPL, NSPH that know my track record. What matters is where AMZN will go from here.

"I am fully confident in our highly capable team, reinforced by our talented group of IT professionals, to scale the business quickly and capture a portion of this burgeoning industry, creating an additional revenue driver and further diversifying our revenue mix by geography."

You don't need to check anything. I can tell you. You entered around $180. $180 is "below $240" and fits the criteria of between when you arrived here and "last year". "I did not reenter until the move to 230 earlier this year." That's the same pattern as when you shorted at $180. You tried to short the immediate post-earnings high but ended up riding that up for a big loss on those initial shares. So this would mean you have a loss of $30 per share on your shorts from $230. You also told me that Google would outperform Amazon yet Amazon is up 50% this year and Google only 5%.</Msg><Username>nemesis_editor_2007</Username><Timestamp>1347374095732</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 10:34:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347374124011-33</Id><Topic><Title>This new format sucks!!!

I just have a different time horizon than you. When the markets turn down and when AAPL and GOOG choose to compete on price in terms of selling content to consumers, AMZN will be crushed.

The company's Cloud division Vroozi is growing exponentially as it's revenues exploded in 4Q just reported with 11 Fortune 500 customers already - NTWK just announced another North America cloud business unit. - Larger companies are swallowing fast growing enterprise cloud providers with SAP and ORCL certification and compatibility. The company has guided for up to 30 - 40% revenue growth in 2013 and $1/share net income. In last week's CC they also mentioned that they expect revenues to double/triple from $38 million to $75 - $100 million in revenues. This would equate to about $2/share net income.!!

AMZN that tablet thingy that it sells for cost hoping to make the money on content. Intel dominates microprocessor manufacturing globally, has huge margins and cash flow. INTC is out of favor because it was behind in mobile/tablet, primarily due to power consumption. INTC's FINFET manufacturing technology will provide superior power consumption and a vastly more capable processor and I suspect AAPL will likely adopt it in next gen tablets -- Christmas 2013 -- to further differentiate performance and to diversify away from Samsung. AMZN trades at over 57X EBITDA (and a much higher multiple of true FCF). Intel trades at 4.6X EBITDA. I'm sure Geeg and Nemesis will argue that buying INTC is buying a dead company.

The Fire HD also assaults users with ads occupying the entire screen every time they start or resume using it. You have to pay Amazon another $15, using an obscure setting on a Web page, to escape these ads. And there are pitches to buy more content on many other screens, even those displaying your already-purchased content. I found the screen to be crisp, clear and vivid, though inferior to the superb Retina display on the current iPad. Its resolution is the same as that of the Nexus 7. It also is about the same thickness as the Nexus, though a bit heavier. It is much lighter than the larger iPad, but about 10% thicker. I found its speakers far better than those on the iPad and Nexus. Amazon claims the new Fire has advanced Wi-Fi technology that is faster than the Wi-Fi on the iPad. But in my tests, I couldn’t replicate that. Most Web pages I tried loaded slightly faster on the iPad. And, using two different speed test utilities on two different networks, I found the iPad was a bit faster in almost every instance, occasionally much faster. In my harsh battery test, where I set the screen at 75% brightness, leave on the Wi-Fi to collect email in the background, and play videos back to back, the Fire HD was respectable, if not up to its claim of 11 hours, or as good as its competitors. It lasted nine hours and 28 minutes, compared with just five hours and 47 minutes for the original Fire. That was about half an hour less than the iPad, but over an hour less than the Nexus.</Msg><Username>nje457</Username><Timestamp>1347413579583</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 21:32:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347414916222-108</Id><Topic><Title>Fire HD Review by Walt Mossberg</Title><Username>nje457</Username><Timestamp>1347413579583</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 21:32:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You have to cut losses on your 1K lot of $196 short and core short made at $240 last October, and only then you will do fine with scalping for dimes once in a while.

It certainly isn't what I do? Never less than 50% cash, but closer to 75% now.

How many kids will want the Fire?? As soon as Apple releases the ipad mini? lets see - i think 4 or 5, none? I don't know. This Fire is the equivalent of Sears branding its own tools - great for anyone who doesn't care about having a quality tool and certainly not a business model game change. Gee keep buying your calls - good use of your money. You were buying calls when amzn went from 246 to 170 - now you can buy them when the stock goes from 275 to 175.</Msg><Username>dutchboyinvestor</Username><Timestamp>1347418046916</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 22:47:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347420660971-111</Id><Topic><Title>Fire HD Review by Walt Mossberg</Title><Username>nje457</Username><Timestamp>1347413579583</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 21:32:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The reviews are coming in quite consistent...

Amazon’s executives are hailing the new touch-screen tablet, the Kindle Fire HD, as “the best tablet at any price.” They’re hailing Amazon’s new touch-screen tablet, the Kindle Fire HD, as “the best tablet at any price.” Well, let’s see now. The Fire HD has no camera on the back, no GPS navigation, no speech recognition, no to-do list or notes app. It trails the iPad in thickness, screen size, screen sharpness, Web speed, software polish and app availability. It can only dream of the iPad’s universe of accessories, cases and docks..</Msg><Username>krk_krk</Username><Timestamp>1347422113229</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 23:55:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347422329684-114</Id><Topic><Title>NYT Pogue: More Soot than Fire</Title><Username>krk_krk</Username><Timestamp>1347422113229</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 23:55:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Fire doesn’t come with a wall charger; that’s $10 extra at purchase time, or $20 later.
