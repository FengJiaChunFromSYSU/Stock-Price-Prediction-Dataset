Our price target is based on the average forward 2013 P/E multiple of 13.2X (up from 12.8X in August 2012). For industry comparables see table below. NTWK is trading at 6.4X our FY13 EPS forecast of $0.85 per share. We applied an 11X multiple to our FY13 EPS forecast. We anticipate a richer multiple as earnings momentum builds in FY13. NTWK’s discount to its peers most likely stems from poor 1H12 results. ==== Basis of Forecast Projected sales consist of fees from licensing, maintenance and services, and Vrozzi e-commerce division revenue. Software consulting and implementation services should account for approximately 49% of total sales. We project compounded annual growth in services of 13% to FY14 from FY10 reflecting 80 significant customers in FY14, up from 52, 37, and 28 in FY12, FY11, and FY10, respectively. Growth will be supported by an estimated 30 potential NFS customers located in China, Japan, Malaysia, Thailand, the US, and the United Kingdom. The company is entering FY13 with a $25 million backlog and approximately $100 million in qualified leads. One quarter of the backlog is from four new NFS platform customer implementations that began in 4Q12. In August 2011, NetSol launched its Cloud Vrooz Divisioni, an e-procurement search tool for SAP supplier relationship management (SRM) users. SAP AG is a global vendor of enterprise management systems that has the largest market share (24%) based on a worldwide Gartner survey. Vroozi should provide sales diversification and a higher margin recurring revenue stream. The Vroozi division contributed $1.3 million in FY12 sales. We forecast at least eleven additional implementations in FY12, which should contribute at least $4 million to sales during FY13 and $6 million to FY14. The company announced the launch of a second cloud division in September 2012 offering a new set of products and services that utilize their software development capabilities and significant cloud infrestrusctures We anticipate FY13 and FY14 gross and operating margins will improve to at least 60% and 19%, and 61% and 19.6%, respectively, due to Vroozi and NFS platform sales gains.</Msg><Username>dianakibsion</Username><Timestamp>1347887904627</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 09:18:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347889734772-6</Id><Title>258.75 somewhat critical.</Title><Msg>To people like me who want to go long.

Good, so when your losses go from a little sad to tragic the pain won't bother you as much. Pain is a good indicator; it causes one pause to change directions and do the right thing instead of continuing down the wrong path. Like when a child suffers a minor burn when playing with matches... "Ever had to let 75% of your people go?" Ever make such a mess of business where you had to let 75% of your people go? Borders had to do something like that. And they were up against Amazon. Umm, like you. "I could lose all my money and start over just fine. I'm very lucky." You're conflating the past with the future. Everyone who shorts Amazon thinks they're lucky until the day they get squashed, as your $230 short is in the process of getting squashed right now. "I went to Kellogg in the late 90's when it was ranked #1 blah, blah, blah..." This has nothing to do with investing, as usually, and only serves to illustrate my point that even people who brag and claim to be intelligent can prove absolute imbeciles when it comes to making good investments.</Msg><Username>nemesis_editor_2007</Username><Timestamp>1347890788511</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 10:06:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347890816907-8</Id><Title>CMG moving up quietly</Title><Msg>wonder why CNBC is not talking about the turn around ?

You started a company during the bubble phase, got hit by the 2007/2008 financial crisis, went almost bankrupt, got a grant or something from the government to keep your downsized business, and have been playing with the stock market with our tax money. Is that why you feel lucky? Techstrategy is one of those who benefited from the last bubble (and subsequent bail-out by the U.S. government) we had.

I don't wish bad things upon you nor will I try to be abusive. No doubt, I've made plenty of mistakes in trying to build my business. But, it goes well beyond that. The aggressive industrial policy in Asian nations explicitly targeting technology have structurally altered the return profile and has systematically undermined the emerging technology businesses that have historically powered our nations innovation and productivity growth. As a result, investments in commercializing fundamental scientific innovation has declined significantly in real terms, particularly in the VC sector where everything shifted to social media / apps where a small investment could be flipped to IPO rapidly to leave someone else holding the bag. Unless we reverse the dynamics at work, it will hurt all of us.

I don't consider any of that relevant or reliable. The normal pattern with these kinds of really stubborn shorts is the same pattern. Stage 1: Make up stuff after the fact. Stage 2: After losing lots of money or suffering large paper losses, switch to saying you have only leap options, i.e., you kick the can of your heavy losses down the road.

She had been a perma-bear here for decades but whenever AMZN bounced nicely and stayed up for some prolonged period of time, she came out and said that she covered at the lows before the bounce took place. She got wiped out on April 27th of this year, by the way. She wrote naked calls before the earnings on April 26th. She lost her house shortly after that day and became homeless. She made a brief appearance again before the last earning, July 27th. It was very short-lived, however. She bought two deeply out-of=the-money puts after saving up a portion of her welfare checks before that date, and of course, she got wiped out again. The last time I heard, she was institutionalized. The trauma of losing a house and getting wiped out again in just about three months was just too much for her.

HSBC did something similar recently, and I read this as a negative sentiment on Amazon. If Amazon moves up from or stays at 75% of its recent level of $255.63 (i.e. $191.73) the security pays basically 14% for a year (plus the original par amount). If Amazon goes down from $191.73, the security holder gets a negative return. See Edgar filing below. (edgar root) /Archives/edgar/data/895421/000095010312004790/dp32887_fwp-ps330.htm (edgar root) /Archives/edgar/data/895421/000095010312004204/dp31835_424b2-autocallable.htm Who knows who is buying this security, but when I see someone paying 14% return contingent on Amazon going up, but EARNING money on Amazon going down from $191.73, I think that there are some hedge funds out there ready to burst the Amazon bubble. Maybe my reading on this is totally wrong, but I don't see people paying 14% on anything unless they think it's not going to happen. Maybe this is just some crazy hedging instrument designed by a hedge fund to arbitrage the crazy option values and the actual volatility of the stock, who knows. FYI, I think Amazon has an awesome business model long run, and long-term I fancy it a great investment (as a former employee). But it's recent run-up is completely detached from the economic fundamentals. They are building some great scale-able business models and the Kindle platform (the sub-par Fire aside) is a fat-margin business with great potential, as is web-services. But there are too many opportunities to stumble in the next 3 years to justify a 100X forward P/E multiple. Talent is stretched at Amazon right now, the company is betting in areas that they are out-classed (like tablets), and frankly has too many bets placed. They're going to slip soon (probably when the Fire sells less than they expected) and when the insiders start chattering to the press and blogs like they always do, they stock will fall.</Msg><Username>americanuspublius</Username><Timestamp>1347933378126</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 21:56:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message></Date>
