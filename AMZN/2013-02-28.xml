AAPL, INTC, CSCO and many large cap companies are held back as to sell calls and MOMO scams propped up to sell puts. Since the advent of weekly options, the multiple trends (lower for undervalued companies on a fundamental basis, higher for those overvalued) have accelerated (expansion for MOMO, contraction for actual investments). Looking at changes in short interest, these things are approaching their end. When the MM don't have a lot of free Bernanke Bux via POMO, it is harder to maintain the scam... But, they are getting help through the further repression of real investments. I care because the investors that ultimately hold real investments are seeing their returns suppressed from this scam so that the institutions can realize additional trading profits... This in turn means the capital markets are sending signals that reward malinvestment and value destruction, simply to enable trading profits. It is destructive for the economy....</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1362068538910</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 11:22:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362068723507-36</Id><Topic><Title>Looks like WalMart now being used as source of capital rather than AAPL...</Title><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1362062649025</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 09:44:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>no, it's not just options related. wrong it's liquidity related.

Your downloaded broker statement will look correct in the summary section (interview), but the data gets truncated in the Sched D/8949, which completely screws up your totals and cap gains. If you try to enter by hand in the sched D (and attach broker detail in seperate 8949), it only allows 9 digits sum for transaction total inlcuding cents, so max is $9,999,999.99. While that sounds like a lot, that is only one $40k trasaction per day for 250 trading days. Obviously day-traders do more than that.</Msg><Username>once_on</Username><Timestamp>1362078452624</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 14:07:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362078640321-82</Id><Title>Sell Here IMO</Title><Msg>A short term call only.

AAPL will be using INTC soon enough. INTC is heading higher, regardless of macro stuff because it simply is the only company in the world capable of manufacturing all our high end signal processing / communication chips in a secure domestic location. Ironically, analysts beat the #$%$ out of INTC for investing in 14nm capacity, which is absolutely unique in the world. At the same time, they fawn over AMZN investing in redundant distribution and warehousing capacity and losing money on it.... I said months ago that the strategic implications of INTC's expansion were very different than AMZN's (INTC's hurts TSMC economics...., Amazon's is just wasted expansion that doesn't meaningfully alter the economics of its competitors). Many of the analysts here (particularly ones who cover INTC and bashed its investment in 14nm capacity) should be taken to the woodshed.... Where you see global meltdown, I see a major structural shift and rebalancing. INTC will be a winner. This pair (AMZN and INTC) will also prove a great case study on the intellectual dishonesty on WS, trying to always front run and dump #$%$ on retail or shakeout on good investments. Capital World has done some things that bear extraordinary scrutiny IMHO. After Cash's comments earlier today, I need to start looking into the quant funds to see position changes (I found with CMG that certain quant funds change in positions was well correlated with changes in multiples...). Probably the same scam running here....

Several of the folks on this board have done quite well on it buying in below $1. My INTC calls are 2014 and 2015. The short term simply doesn't matter. The risk is defined and the upside enormous.

Admittedly, long RIMM at $7 has performed better than expected (you can find that in my posting history as well), but I thought its liquidation/IP value exceeded the EV at that price. Geeg, I am a #$%$ trader. But, I read the fundamentals and evolving competitive dynamics as well as anyone (including figuring out the fundamental limitations of Amazon's business model about a year before the analysts will have caught on... ). The reality is that Scamazon is doomed to fall precipitously. The scam is coming to an end.

He is trying to maintain nominal asset prices through an inherently deflationary period so that his masters (the banking cartel) do not have to realize losses. Instead, all the losses are socialized and transferred to the general public through lower real discretionary incomes. It isn't working because he is running into system level constraints. The act printing money to inflate assets also inflates assets that everyone depend upon, which makes for higher cost of necessities for everyone. That, in turn, reduces discretionary income (particularly in the highest marginal propensity to consume segments), which then creates a negative feedback loop in an economy that is 70% consumption... There is a path out of all of this without massive societal disruption (still significant, but not violent) and that brings the global economy back into better balance. Right now, TPTB are choosing the wrong path but are close to realizing that the current approach will not work. The endgame is nearer than people realize.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1362113254070</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 23:47:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
