There is going to be a ton of US families this year facing medical insurance premium hikes in the 60-100% range, along with soaring deductibles to boot. This is going to be an earthquake to many budgets across the country. Junk purchased off Amazon will be one of the first things cut in response. This is going to be an epic short folks, just stay patient.</Msg><Username>kstueren</Username><Timestamp>1364019021011</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-23 02:10:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364034849853-2</Id><Topic><Title>The thing that will kill amazon that no one talks about</Title><Username>kstueren</Username><Timestamp>1364019021011</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-23 02:10:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>this good news AMZN will sell drugs!!! they slready selling dreams now they will sell drugs and the stock will run up becaus no one will stay sober....</Msg><Username>emanuel_dabah</Username><Timestamp>1364034849853</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-23 06:34:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364034903033-3</Id><Topic><Title>How can there be a bad quarter when earnings are irrelivant</Title><Username>retire_yung</Username><Timestamp>1364005191672</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 22:19:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>money will run out</Msg><Username>emanuel_dabah</Username><Timestamp>1364034903033</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-23 06:35:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364044973342-4</Id><Topic><Title>The 'Amazon Law' Is The Signal To Sell Far Overpriced Amazon Seeking Alpha story</Title><Username>thephoenix123</Username><Timestamp>1363985392275</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 16:49:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Without sales tax breaks there is little incentive to shop Amazon except for hard to find products.

Senators voted 75-24 for a nonbinding measure that endorses giving states more power to collect existing sales taxes on purchases their residents make from out-of-state Internet companies. Though the vote was merely a show of sentiment, the one-sided outcome showed that supporters of collecting the levies could prevail should the Senate consider binding legislation later this year. A congressional battle over the issue has been simmering for years, pitting Internet companies against traditional retail stores. Part of what is at stake is potential revenue for cash-starved state governments across the country. An estimated $20 billion in sales taxes go uncollected annually by out-of-state online merchants. Supporters also argue that not collecting the levies is a competitive disadvantage for retail stores, which must collect local sales taxes. One sponsor, Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., said Internet sales taxes should be collected "so those local businesses will have a fighting chance." Sens. Mike Enzi, R-Wyo., and Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., were other chief sponsors. Opponents said the plan would be unworkably complicated, would pressure states without sales taxes to adopt them and would encourage companies to move overseas, where they said sales taxes could not be enforced. "It tramples on states' rights," said Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H.

It improves their competitive advantage in states where they have already lost the fight, since their smaller internet competitors would now have to collect tax also. However, in the other states they would no longer have the advantage over B&amp;M stores. Since they are now collecting taxes in the big states (California, Texas. NY, NJ, etc.), my guess is that they are better off with the new legislation.</Msg><Username>amzn_skeptic</Username><Timestamp>1364061370795</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-23 13:56:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364061915513-10</Id><Topic><Title>Would an internet sales tax hurt Amazon?</Title><Username>gintowin</Username><Timestamp>1364053657434</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-23 11:47:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes, because Amazon margins are already razor thin to non-existent. I will quit buying on-line unless I cannot find the item at a local store or if the price is much lower. That says it all, in my opinion. Similar reasons are why Sears and Penny's catalogs became little used as local stores stocked most of the items. The primary advantage of buying online will be gone. Don't let anyone tell you different. AMZN is a screaming SELL.</Msg><Username>prospec5</Username><Timestamp>1364061915513</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-23 14:05:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364062647751-11</Id><Title>True. .....

Question is bull or bear trap? If bear, this is the last dance. Those that choose to take the money and run (and sell straight through any EOQ window dressing, recognizing fiduciary obligation to fund holders) will be vastly better off. All cartels crater under sufficient stress and we are just getting started on the stress... The Fed thought it could "inflate" away our debts. Turns out there are other constraints at play (as I've been saying for a long time). That's why the confiscation of deposits is being tested in Cyprus.. If it is running out of room on asset inflation, it has to socialize losses some other way to keep banks from recognizing losses. Amazon's scam valuation will not survive what is coming.... That's why the internal imbalance in the market and the great risk off rotation where real investment survive and scams (MOMO junkies) get killed.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1364084299045</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-23 20:18:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
