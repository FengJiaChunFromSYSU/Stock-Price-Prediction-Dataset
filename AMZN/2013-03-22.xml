It is to make money for the investment banking business. No amount of regulation or seperation will ever fix that. It is why they exist. They need to pump a stock just prior to a debt offering, equity offering, a big investor dump, or mgt dump. You knew AMZN was about to offer a large debt offering when all of the price targets were raised on 3 straight terrible Q's with awful guidance (check who pumped the stock vs. which companies managed the debt sale). They had to pump it in their notes becuase they were out on the street marketing the stock like crazy to potential debt investors. Then once day you wake up and $3B of nearly free money flowed to AMZN. This also enables large momo investors to unload on the suckers buying prior to the debt release. Once the deal is done they can let the air out of the bag (what is happening now). Watch how quickly they run from this pig after the drop, and then it will start all over again when AMZN needs more money (probably by the end of the year), the problem is the trick does work too often, like the boy who cried wolf.</Msg><Username>once_on</Username><Timestamp>1363950414541</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 07:06:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363953010566-6</Id><Title>Baggiez and knife catcherz</Title><Msg>Are you ready for yet another day of lower highz and lower lowz?

I'm talking about the profit after you started re-shorting. Don't keep bragging about the profits you made on AMZN last year (around October) or on other stocks which were real bubbles. The average short price of your AMZN short which you started building on November 14, 2012 is approximately $255.23. AMZN was about $254 this morning, so you had a dollar and nickels of paper profit per share. Right now at 252.81, your paper profit is over two bucks a share. Congratulations! A huge win (on paper, right at this moment) after four months of waiting. A way to go, sister.

The big boys can now let all the scams crash because MOMO junkies are short the real investments and long the scams... Someday, people will look back and ask how it happened. How did so again negligently accumulate shares of a company with no net cash, with management having sold huge amounts at prices well lower than this in a period of less uncertainty. "Because of the price action"... The really smart money has used timely technical signals to lead lambs to slaughter. I suspect those who've made the play will sell AMZN hard next week, forcing the followers to buy up lots of shares to hold it for month end window dressing. More than likely, they'll wait until the end of the week when MOMO chasers and indexers will not be able to trim significant positions and then liquidate at EOM, tanking the followers' performance and leading to a new wave of redemptions in passive and herd funds... It may not happen until after earnings, but this stock is certain to crater in Q2. It has no hope of ending Q2 higher than Q1. Those that loaded up in Q1 will prove to truly be the dumb money. Of course, as Sybs always points out, it isn't there money, so I guess they don't care...</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1363989481739</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 17:58:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363990451506-84</Id><Topic><Title>DID YOU KNOW</Title><Username>robertel65</Username><Timestamp>1363979775154</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 15:16:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Robert!

I bought puts today as a sort of hedge against a broader market correction. I am thinking this overvalued situation cannot continue forever. Look at the apple price action and there is a company that makes money. Of course the market can stay irrational longer than my bets can stay solvent. maybe drop 50 next week?</Msg><Username>retire_yung</Username><Timestamp>1364004820840</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 22:13:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364005191672-89</Id><Title>How can there be a bad quarter when earnings are irrelivant</Title><Msg>What would make a quarter bad? margin compression?....none to compress.....poor earning guidance?.. what guidance has there been?...not concerned with earnings so f off next question please.....slowing revenue growth.......like below 20% ....it's there now..gosh, what a mystery</Msg><Username>retire_yung</Username><Timestamp>1364005191672</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 22:19:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364010262896-90</Id><Title>Tech...</Title><Msg>I tried to respond to your post and could not. I even tried to respond to Geegee's and could not. Same for Sybs, ex-goldbug. The only way I can post is to start a new topic. The good news is that the spammers can't respond to their posts over and over again either. Have you noticed that those 4 posts that were responded to every 30 minutes have fallen behind? There was one that was up to 100 messages! - PJ</Msg><Username>pjlouie13</Username><Timestamp>1364010262896</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 23:44:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
