I'm 90% cash as of right now. Picked up 5 DITM puts, Nov. because I don't think this escapes earnings without getting a huge haircut. Like I said before, even if they even beat, their PE will swell up to 400+. No one in their right mind pays 400X earnings for a retail stock....e-retail or otherwise. I assume they run this into earning which is why I chose to wait. I expect some volatility for the next 2 weeks so I will short the rips, and cover on dips. But would like to beholding 20-25 puts by the 22nd. "enormous upside" now your talking! Is this the stock you had eluded to in a previous post? Definitely e-mail me, I'm very curious. Btw, are you still long csco? I was thinking adding some with perhaps some INTC.

This is just the start of the incumbents recognizing how to crush Amazon through effective pricing strategy. Amazon will end up dominating the lower value density, higher shipping cost as a percentage of total cost of ownership items. Apple is matching in eBooks.

Probably still top 5. I haven't checked in awhile. It was ranked #1 when I graduated... I think he is a good CEO. And, I think he is taking advantage of massive malinvestment to secure as much LT value for Amazon as is possible (which will still be WAY lower than today), not unlike I thought GMCR management was securing as much LT value when it was over 100 while knowing that it would hit 40 within a year (at 17 I went long for the ride up to 30 and got out). Having said that, I think the latest forays will go down as some of the most profound strategic mistakes in history. Getting into the hardware business was a mistake and invited EVERYONE to come after Amazon hard at the same time. Just watch, it will be attacked by Apple, Google, Oracle, WalMart, Best Buy all at the same time and all at a time when it has overextended its leverage. It would take awhile to outline the full analysts of the economics, but simply stated, AMZN cannot/will not justify its valuation regardless of the ST moves. When I was at McKinsey, we laughed about Webvan. The economics didn't work. And, it was essentially trying to replace one of the most competitive and efficient portions of the economy -- our distribution infrastructure, which captures relatively limited value (look at the market cap of JBHT, UPS, FDX).

They rape vendors for 15% commissions on most products, 8% on electronics. They force vendors to work for almost nothing by putting the lowest price on each product page. Then if they see a good selling product, they buy it direct and undercut all the vendors on their system. They penalize vendors for not fulfilling with them. The Prime acct only works if Amazon is fulfilling the product. They are now handing out loans to vendors only securing the money with product that Amazon fulfills. They are spending millions on new warehouses that cost a lot to maintain including employees, utitilities, shipping materials, etc. Their margins are roughly 1% now without any real overhead. They are now forced to collect sales taxes from many states and growing every day. This will definitely affect their sales. They will start losing most smaller vendors after this year. Any vendor that is willing to work their tail off to make $1 is a fool and will go out of business. Amazon does the customer rating system that is so biased that you can lose your store with one bad rating. Just find a competitor that is cheaper then you and buy their product and then give them 1 star. We have an Amazon store and have gone from an average of 5 to 8 orders a day to 1 to 2. People are out of money and Amazon will be just as vulnerable as any brick and mortar store, especially at over 300 times earnings. This economy is getting ugly and just because Amazon is the biggest, doesn't mean they will grow their profitability. When the depression is realized, those expensive warehouses will choke them hard. The stock is on a run, becuase everything else out their is breaking lower. It's now strictly a momentum play and will eventually blow up like the rest of the market.....</Msg><Username>mofreemoneyforme01</Username><Timestamp>1349373285432</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 13:54:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349373727258-123</Id><Title>Keep buying need to get close to 264.11 soon the SPY needs to break its old high or double top , double top watch the whole market drop</Title><Msg>Keep buying need to get close to 264.11 soon the SPY needs to break its old high or double top , double top watch the whole market drop</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1349373727258</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 14:02:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349373751168-124</Id><Title>THE LONG AMZN/SHORT AAPL "PAIR TRADE CONTINUE TO WORK LIKE A CHARM!

The following is an excerpt from one of my favorite books: What you believed about value and your reasons for believing it may be of highest quality, but if the market doesn’t share your belief, it doesn’t really matter how “right” you are based on your superior reasoning process or what you believe to be the quality of your information, because prices are going to go in the direction of the greatest force. The point here is that right and wrong as you may traditionally think of them don’t exist in the market environment. Academic credentials, degrees, reputations, even a high I.Q. don’t make you right in this environment as they would in society. Traders, acting on their belief in the future by putting on a trade, are the only force that can act on prices to make them move. Movement creates opportunity to make money, and making money is what trading is all about. This is also true for the hedger trading to protect the value of his assets. Each individual trader will define what market condition represents enough of an opportunity to put on a trade for whatever reason suits him. Regardless of how wrong you think he may be, if the net result of the collective actions of all the traders participating is moving prices against your position, then they’re right and you are the one who is losing money.

OK, I chose TD Ameritrade for a number of reasons. 1st, one guy told me last month that "Some brokers let you have a 'virtual' account so you can practice trading." I asked both him and another guy to recommend one, but they were too busy or something... 2nd, someone answered my question from my first post and told me that "AmeriTrade offers ThinkorSwim platform and it has virtual mode." 3rd, I did some research and found that Barron's ranks ameritrade #1 in the "Best for Novices" section, and #2 in the "Best For Long-term Investing" category!! 4th, I couldn't check for online brokers' financial strength, but I saw some commercials for ameritrade in the past, so I think I safely assumed it's big. 5th, There might be something better out there, but I am a novice, so it should be good for me and I was tired of waiting around. I wanna start trading! My account should be all set by tomorrow or Monday at the latest. Sooooo exciting~!

Google (GOOG:$768.05,00$5.55,000.73%) and the Association of American Publishers (AAP) said on Thursday that U.S. publishers can decide whether they want their books made available through Google (GOOG:$768.05,00$5.55,000.73%) or not. Google Books allows users to browse up to 20 percent of the books in its library and then purchase digital versions through Google Play.

I still think it is massively over valued, but it is nowhere near as compelling as certain other stocks at this point. I like to make money on the shorts, but I also enjoy the challenge of seeing and articulating the forward looking dynamics that will lead to breakdown. Amazon MAY have 1 quarter left (assuming no anakysts asks about daily sales ex-kindle and new product launches pre and post tax collection), but the big tech (AAPL, GOOG, IBM, CSCO) who have vastly more cash are coming after them and big retail (WMT, BBY) realizes this is the best time to hit back hard. Couple that with the end of Bush tax rates (lame duck will let it expire regardless of who wins so that R's can keep to "no new revenue" taxes against a bigger revenue base and D's can say HNW people are paying more) which will cause any sane investor to take profits and Amazon is REALLY up against it. When I shorted GMCR at 115, I said I thought 40 within a year was realistic. It hit 17 (although I went long from 17 to 30). I am serious when I say AMZN will be below 100 by year end 2013 -- regardless of whatever "money printing" scenario one chooses. It probably won't fall fast. But it will lose 60% from here. There is a lot of "fuzzy thinking" taking place amongst amazon longs.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1349395583206</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 20:06:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349397361005-227</Id><Topic><Title>Google settles lawsuit...

You shouldn't gamble, you know. We don't know when that "some point" is, do we?

Right. Shorts never admit that they've lost the latest round. They don't know when to throw in the towel and start all over.
