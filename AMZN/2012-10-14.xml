But strengthening exports to the United States — up 5.5 percent in September compared with the same month a year ago — could also increase trade frictions at a politically touchy time for both countries. Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee, and President Obama have competed this autumn to present themselves as more willing to confront China on trade issues. China’s own Communist Party leadership has been wary of appearing too conciliatory toward the United States ahead of their Party Congress, which starts two days after the presidential election in the United States on Nov. 6 and is expected to produce a new slate of members of the ruling Standing Committee of the Politburo. After months of gloom, Chinese exporters are starting to voice hope about demand in the United States.</Msg><Username>sokhzhrov</Username><Timestamp>1350193610961</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 01:46:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350214025623-2</Id><Title>Hey stupids: this pig iz in the slaughter house about to get hacked up</Title><Msg>Sybs gonna get some chops, bacon, and tenderloin....

The huge mistake in this case is that taxes, particularly real estate taxes because buildings are not mobile like most other assets, will be going up big time. Amazon's real estate tax burden will skyrocket going forward as other commercial real estate drops in value while amazon just established the "market value" for its space.

Welcome back to reality. There is absolutely no reason for any investor to buy the stock up here. Someone defended it at 200 after last earnings. Maybe they will again.

You see, there was no reason for this stock to fall below 248.</Msg><Username>geegenjar</Username><Timestamp>1350270354430</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 23:05:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350270815660-37</Id><Topic><Title>GEEGENJAR sorry to break this to you AMZN is trading in the 241's after hours and going lower always remember that lower highs = lower lows to come</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1350073381535</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 16:23:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No luck AMZN is just going a lot lower and fast.
