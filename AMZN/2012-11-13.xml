Investors should care. "Everybody knows that AMZN is an expensive stock"? Then why buy it? I would be especially worried about the forward PE estimates for next year, with the economy slowing. Acting like a 100 PE is a "bargain" when rivals sell for PEs less than 1/5th as large seems ridiculous. But what if the 100 PE never materializes.

Good to see you here... Have to make a little more money first :-) And, have to build the track record a little more... Been right on several big wins (and a little earlier, but the brand of the big boys broke them), but anyone can get lucky a few times. I'm trying to prove out a slightly different model -- one where someone who writes/acts who provides analysis or advice actually puts a material portion of his/her wealth on the line. The entire model of playing with OPM is #$%$ and broken. If any of these sell side analysts were forced to have 25% of their wealth directed into companies they cover and unable to sell until price targets were achieved, not one would put ANY money into companies Amazon. By the way, a few of the plays we discussed earlier are getting ripe as well.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1352814801724</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-13 08:53:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352816067166-7</Id><Topic><Title>A very serious question; no flaming, please.</Title><Username>geegenjar</Username><Timestamp>1352753963599</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 15:59:23 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Generally, AMZN generates a ton of cash in Q4. But, with more of the sales being product being sold at cost (you don't really get the advantage of negative float on product you sell at cost...) and with the new monthly Prime (many people will sign up for monthly rather than annual before the holiday season), AMZN will lose a significant source of cash flow and digital content sales will take longer to ramp... I said awhile ago and I was completely serious that AMZN has spent like a drunken sailor and made itself vulnerable to a downturn. And yes, I mean raising capital (whether debt or equity) vulnerable. Cramer and his ilk bash GRPN, but its cost structure scales down better than AMZN's. Institutional longs would be very well served to sell here, buy there and reserve cash for GRPN for the future. It not only serves but dominates a more unique niche (and doesn't have Apple, Google and WalMart attacking it on every front)... But, no one invests anymore. It's all about trying to knock others out which actually perpetuates the malinvestment and misallocation of resources. And still they wonder why investors keep pulling money from the market...</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1352816067166</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-13 09:14:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352816105444-8</Id><Title>iPad3 $379</Title><Msg>On apple web site.

Amazon went directly after Apple's core business and opened a business model competition. Further, with its stupid anti-trust play on eBooks, it guaranteed that Apple can choose to sell eBooks at cost or even a loss (its loss leader versus AMZN's hardware loss leader), which given the immense number of iPads out there would hit Amazon's core source of cash flow VERY hard. That would be the nail in the coffin. Oh, and did I mention that Google doesn't like AMZN very much and can do the same on all Android and Chrome devices (Chromebooks are killing it right now... will show up soon). Open, cloud based eBooks standard will put AMZN into a world of hurt. WalMart and Best Buy matching prices on high value density items (where there is a store and service to support any problems) will create a selection bias in AMZN orders, pushing up shipping cost relative to item profit (and since shipping will be free for $7.99 a month Prime) will also hurt Amazon...

Everyone has to grow the f' up. We are going to have to pay more taxes. We are going to have to cut spending, especially as it relates to entitlements.

So why did you initiate your INTC position on September 11 and kept adding calls as INTC kept sagging? "And yes, I'm doing okay elsewhere." AAPL and GOOG down from their all-time highs.

I never have, but I might even change my favorite short candidates if all the chatter on limiting deductions holds. I cannot think of a faster way to absolutely obliterate the "nascent" housing recovery than to essentially eliminate the mortgage interest deduction, which is what the proposed caps would effectively do for any home worth a few hundred thousand or more... It will affect the builders first new buyers will be willing to pay far less for homes in an era of capped mortgage interest deductions. But, it will ultimately kill existing homes sales and all real estate prices in the process... For all those that believe a compromise will make everything okay, you might want to start thinking of issues like this. The money is going to come from somewhere. In the proposed case, it will largely come from upper middle class and lower upper class families (but it will work out just fine for the .1% who could scale charitable giving back and would benefit from keeping the existing top rates on all income and for those who pay little to no tax today) compared to the default increases.
