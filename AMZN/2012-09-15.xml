Solve for X..." What's the point of solving for X when the equation in meaningless? Here's one correct way to set up a set of two equations: Eq. 1: C = $135 * y, where C is the total cost of the purchase Bruce made 3 years ago, and y is the total number of shares he bought then. Eq. 2: $260 * x = C + $40 * (y - x), where x is the number of shares Bruce sold at $260. Solve for the ratio of x over y. x/y = 175/ 300 = approximately 0.5833. So Bruce sold about 58.33% of the shares he bout at $135 three years ago. However, this is based on the assumption that he hasn't bought and held any additional shares after the initial purchase at $135 a share three years ago. If my memory serves me correctly, he has bought more shares much below $260 on several occasions at least, and he made profits on all of them as well along the way. I don't know if he sold all of those shares he bought for short to mid-term trading purposes. He may have accumulated more shares in the last three years.</Msg><Username>geegenjar</Username><Timestamp>1347687277346</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 01:34:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347690785320-5</Id><Topic><Title>Bernanke is skull #$%$ shorts and retireez</Title><Username>philandjoel1e</Username><Timestamp>1347666119075</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 19:41:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes, sybil is ready for margin callz becauze they just occurd thIs week - sybil had none....

I will note that your second equation is wrong based upon the information that was provided (he said he'd make $40 a share if everything he held goes to zero, which is not what you've modeled. Equation 2 should be $260*x=C+40y because he said he'd make $40 per share on the original purchase even if all remaining shares went to zero). Regardless, it was simply meant to illustrate that our friend Bruce wisely took the majority of his winnings off the table (which even your calculation shows and is the bigger point so that we do not get lost in minutia). Kudos for doing so. I want longs to do well. I don't want them to make the mistake that some made with NFLX or GMCR and see the majority of their "wealth" vaporize quickly because of a misplaced belief that the scam will continue working into perpetuity.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1347712997703</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 08:43:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347713859431-10</Id><Topic><Title>How many knuckleheaded dopes could possibly be left buying these levelz</Title><Username>philandjoel1e</Username><Timestamp>1347625711837</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 08:28:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Although the market has become a rigged casino, I am taking a calculated risk where the distribution of potential returns is skewed massively in my favor. Because my system employs a massive (never less than 50%) cash hedge, I have no problem riding this up as high as they take it. The behavior here isn't white as unnatural as some other stocks (which are clear short capitulation squeezes), but close. Amazon needs massive incremental growth in its user base or it is hosed. The threat of apple on digital books is massive. Look at Apple's stats on iTunes users vis a vis Amazon Prime / Kindle device users. Apple's installed base of readers is growing way more rapidly than Amazon's. Amazon has never faced competition and diminished profitability in its core business and cash flow machine, but it will going forward.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1347713859431</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 08:57:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347714793462-11</Id><Topic><Title>Sold some at $260</Title><Username>barbaraspratling</Username><Timestamp>1347672442581</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 21:27:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Have you been practicing on the organ?</Msg><Username>philandjoel1e</Username><Timestamp>1347714793462</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 09:13:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347716095328-12</Id><Topic><Title>Here is a report on this company (AMZN)</Title><Username>edythebbm86995</Username><Timestamp>1347551671220</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-13 11:54:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>thanks!</Msg><Username>dorothaorz777979</Username><Timestamp>1347716095328</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 09:34:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347717421714-13</Id><Topic><Title>Sold some at $260</Title><Username>barbaraspratling</Username><Timestamp>1347672442581</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 21:27:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So Bruce and Nemesis are one and the same...
