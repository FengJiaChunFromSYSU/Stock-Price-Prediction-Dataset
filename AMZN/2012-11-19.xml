I agree with tech and PJ here 100% that that 2017 sales number is virtually impossible - an increase of 120B!). One thing to add - when an analyst does that analysis, he/she has to assume an expected return for shareholders until the terminal year (2017 in this case). If he applied a 25 P/E to that 2017 EPS, he gets a target 2017 price of $278.50 (25 x $11.14). If you assume a P/E of 25 in 2017, you should expect a shareholder return of 25% each year until then. If you back out 25% a year for 5 years, you get a 2012 target price of $91.26. That is what AMZN stock should be today if you expect $120B in incremental sales over the next 5 years and a return on that. Amazingly today, shareholders only expect a 4% annual return to get to $278.50 in 2017 from today's price to take on the risk of AMZN tripling sales over the next 5 years (while tripling their net margin at the same time)! Another view of an amazing imablance. You are better of buying treasuries!</Msg><Username>once_on</Username><Timestamp>1353330366095</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 08:06:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353332139755-8</Id><Title>YEAH BABY YEAH!

Just to be clear, i believe we are at the start of a 2 year bear market. On the DOW it started Sept 2012 and will last until Sept 2014. Numerous reasons, but the main reason was the close election was stimulating the economy. Now that the election is over, the only stimulus that I can see is lower gas prices. When Obamacare kicks in in 2013 (which I am for), Sick people will have to pay a higher deductible and people without health insurance will have to pay higher taxes. This is disruptive. Same thing happened in 1935 when Social Security taxes kicked in, and they were only 1% back then.</Msg><Username>edison20</Username><Timestamp>1353354777404</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 14:52:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353354804424-164</Id><Topic><Title>INTC has been a horrible investment for you but I won't short it: You better hope we don't go into a rea bear market while you kee buying dips this early</Title><Username>nasdaq_6000_baby</Username><Timestamp>1353353235463</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 14:27:15 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>INTC has taken significantly capacity offline to migrate to 14nm trigate.

I can take it. It forces me to be mentally tougher -- to take the abuse and reaffirm my conviction. I'm not a trader sybs. I am testing a broader investment thesis and methodology that have proven out over several years. I've taken plenty of hits along the way, but the upshot is that what I do will scale exceptionally well as time goes on. I'm not going to let a few folks that act like 5th grade wannabe cyberbullies distract me from that...</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1353359880094</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 16:18:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353363753616-185</Id><Topic><Title>ATTD October News,Distribution Agreement Announcement, 2200% GAINS POSSIBLE, UNDERVALUED, CHEAP@ 0.0008 BUY,READ</Title><Username>dollarmultiplier</Username><Timestamp>1351010103807</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 12:35:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Attd is going to be very fruitful in the next 90 days</Msg><Username>bigprofittrade</Username><Timestamp>1353363753616</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 17:22:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353365667342-186</Id><Topic><Title>AMZN is one of the top picks and trying a wrap to climb back up</Title><Username>lopezmason109</Username><Timestamp>1353331662113</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 08:27:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>like a fresh air your post runs into my heart through the window of my PC.Thanks for being so articulate.</Msg><Username>richard.burnett64</Username><Timestamp>1353365667342</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 17:54:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353366435920-187</Id><Topic><Title>Tech, the retards are hog piling on top of you and your tradez</Title><Username>philandjoel1e</Username><Timestamp>1353356638360</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 15:23:58 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ok, tech .... as alwayz - sybs just trying to help you out....

My biggest positions remain undisclosed because I am testing whether my silent positions outperform the ones I post on these message boards. Right now, that seems to be the case. If that remains the case through end of month, you won't have to worry about verbose posts from me because I will cease to post at all on the message boards (not going to stop investing by any means -- things are playing out largely as I expected). I've learned from your trades / read of the technicals (and H/T tip Cash as well). But, at this point, I see little value in providing perspective for folks like NAS, GeeGee and Nem. I suspect that will leave you the target of the bashing... I'll always be happy to correspond via my Yahoo Mail account with those of you who have been decent and are genuinely trying to do the right thing (e.g. PJ)... Lastly, you are right that options will crush most people. I've had to learn the hard way. Taken some wild rides. For the record, what NAS was really trying to obscure was the fact that I called the trade that the option scalping algo trade had been playing -- beating Apple and Google down and holding AMZN up over the past few weeks. That's why AAPL and GOOG were up WAY more than AMZN today and will continue to show strength well beyond Amazon. I now understand the way the game is played pretty well and have learned to do with options what you do with the underlying... Buy after others get squeezed out and capitulate. But, the time element of it makes it much easier to screw up. Oh, by the way, Tiger apparently took at 9.9% stake in GRPN. Looks like one of the best seems to be seeing the same thing as I do. In the green and sitting on 100 Jan $2 call contracts. Have a good one.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1353368533950</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 18:42:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353369176308-189</Id><Topic><Title>Thanks Sybs...</Title><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1353368533950</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 18:42:13 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No problem...
