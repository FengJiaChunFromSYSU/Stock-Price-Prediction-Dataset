Don't you understand, this is already in the price. Stocks discount future results. In the case of Amazon, future sales have been discounted many times over, with the absurd current and forward PE. Amazon has yet to demonstrate it can monetize sales to build profits. Let us say it will---how many years of profit gains would it take to get 'Zon down to a rational PE level? Even if we assume the BEST case for future profits (I don't), Amazon would probably have to fall below $125 for a correct discounted price. But what if the profits DON'T materialize? Amazon could easily fall below $100. Amazon is clearly in "bubble valuation" territory, as absurdly overvalued as any of the examples last seen right before the 2000 "tech wreck".

But, that growth IS slowing (49% to 43%) despite massive investment in revenue growth: 1) loss leaders stacked on loss leaders -- Kindle, Kindle Fire, Prime; 2) several more new products than last year via full kindle platform refresh; 3) a vastly more aggressive TV advertising campaign -- I've seen far more Amazon commercials than Google, Apple or WalMart. That has to be adding up. As I said, eBay has done NO advertising that I've seen. Yet, its growth accelerated from 12% to 36% YOY, but wasn't included since it is a "marketplace" instead of a retailer. A marketplace whose merchants don't yet have to collect taxes -- which is why Amazon is pushing the Main Street Fairness Act while trying to evade taxes that it has agreed to collect by financing and maintaining inventoring, driving web traffic through advertising, processing orders, and fulfilling them yet claiming they are not "sold" by Amazon...

Headlines are all that matters in this business. The fact that internet sales are soaring is reason enough not to short this. In other words, don't fight the trend my friend. Another stock benefitting from an Amazon partnership is Riverbed (RVBD). If you do go short this, do a pair trade and go long RVBD. You can thank me later.</Msg><Username>rimmdiva</Username><Timestamp>1353901467261</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-25 22:44:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353901528909-70</Id><Topic><Title>Life is good...</Title><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1353819578157</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-24 23:59:38 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I probably will, but certainly will adjust my strike if there is another #$%$ vertical move upward. In terms of employees smiling, I do not doubt that they are. Of course, they've likely also come to believe that cash flow doesn't matter. The competition for Amazon is just starting to get serious. I also hope they BUY shares (and hold them).

Price matching? ****** Holiday sales growth was led by several industries which include: - Department stores continued to offer compelling deals and promotions that drove sales to grow by 16.8 percent over Black Friday 2011. - Health and Beauty sales increased 11 percent year over year with consumers once again choosing to pamper themselves this holiday - Home goods maintained its momentum this year, reporting a 28.2 percent increase in sales from Black Friday 2011. - Apparel sales were also strong this holiday with Black Friday numbers showing an increase of 17.5 percent over 2011.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1353903248205</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-25 23:14:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353903629551-75</Id><Topic><Title>Kindle gets hosed by iPad big time</Title><Username>stockstar17</Username><Timestamp>1353901603085</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-25 22:46:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I meant to say as strong as other categories... The point is that "online" is not cannibalizing traditional retailers to the extent that is being sold... Online is still only 10% of total and Dept. Store online basically expanded at the same rate as other online... Furthermore, Dept. Store online average transaction size increased much more rapidly than the other categories.... Another sign that traditional retail is getting better at fighting showrooming on big ticket, high value density items...</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1353903629551</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-25 23:20:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
