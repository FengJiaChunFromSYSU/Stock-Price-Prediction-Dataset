I took a chance being short at the end of the 3rd quarter, as a number of fund managers bought in simply for window dressing.

One may think that the purpose of all of his many posts is to somehow have an influence on the stock price action so he can end up making a profit. Well, we all know that can't be. Nobody can influence the stock price by posting here. Why not? Because the stock price bid-ask action is controlled by the largest shareholding and money holding institutions and moved at their discretion. It is thus silly to think that by an individual trader's comments on a message board that an institution is going to read said comments and then act on the basis of such a post. So what is his purpose in posting here? To make himself look like a famous guru to a bunch of total strangers on a message board whom he will never meet in person? Not likely, and kind of a waste of time, right? So, what I think that his end game goal is is that he wants to prove to anyone who reads his posts that he will be ultimately "right," not so much about his ability to make a profit (like, big deal if he does, i.e. who cares?). Rather, his ultimate goal is to claim that he is right about the "economic disaster" situation, i.e. if and when stocks do collapse, he will then claim to be a genius, and then proceed to his real goal: Once he's "proven right" he will then get everyone if his readers to say, "wow, what a genius sybs is," and then he'll go on to promote his real end game goal of blaming the Jews for the disaster.

Soon if enough of the sell side decide to start telling the truth and doing real analysis AMZN and the B&amp;M's will be valued a lot more alike. Especially when they realize and admit that there is no there, there when it comes to AMZN's fake mantra of investing for the future. It's a lie and pretty much fraud in my mind. There's a ton of companies who invest heavily in the future and are profitable all along.</Msg><Username>hapihammer</Username><Timestamp>1381353661825</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-09 17:21:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381354511856-38</Id><Topic><Title>Retail visionary</Title><Username>jungle_humor</Username><Timestamp>1381351336066</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-09 16:42:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yep, after putting the squeeze on all the brick and morterz by way of tax advantage and loss leader</Msg><Username>sybil_rulez</Username><Timestamp>1381354511856</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-09 17:35:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1381355281601-39</Id><Title>tom it gaps up</Title><Msg>amazon has always gone up after a dip...always...this is a great buying opportunity!!</Msg><Username>ritinleo</Username><Timestamp>1381355281601</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-09 17:48:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381355404358-40</Id><Topic><Title>where is the bottom on amzn this week</Title><Username>xdon69</Username><Timestamp>1381350197897</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-09 16:23:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>290-285</Msg><Username>emanuel_dabah</Username><Timestamp>1381355404358</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-09 17:50:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381359953500-41</Id><Topic><Title>Retail visionary</Title><Username>jungle_humor</Username><Timestamp>1381351336066</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-09 16:42:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yep ....
