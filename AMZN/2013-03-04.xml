Upset customers, seller and buyers, crashed the computer system at the call center with all their calls. The sellers were not able to reach seller support directly and had to call regular customer support to be transferred, call wait time reached well over 10 minutes. Over 10 minutes for a company that answers the phone within 1 minute even during the holiday season. When you got thru all they would say is that their computer is being upgraded( code word for crashed) and they can not view your account.

Realistically, March will be the last quarter it will work and then Scamazon will freefall. This has nothing to do with QE. This has been an option scalping scam that got so disconnected from reality and had such a big market cap that they had to pull some BS like this. There are real buyers for AAPL because the math works and will continue to work. This is simply a ponzi in disguise.

That the buildout was a belated attempt to improve its inferior cost structure in a world of inexorably increasing oil prices. So, I understand the impact of oil prices better than you and most that cover this stock. But, one has to dig a little deeper to understand WHY oil prices are falling. It relates to the state of the consumer. A weakening consumer simply isn't good for Amazon. In fact, it is much worse for Amazon than the financial community and pumpers like yourself understand because none of you have a firm grip on activity based cost analysis to get at the true profit drivers. If the analysts were intellectually honest, this would have tanked long ago. Instead, they are helping friends dump #$%$ on faceless retail buyers on index funds. I suppose getting Vanguard's attention on the scam that is being pulled might create some institutional resistance to it., but otherwise, we'll have to see it all break down before the real SHTF... In short, your falling gas prices will not help because they are falling from demand destruction, not supply increase (despite what the media would like you to believe). The long term trajectory will be inexorably higher absent recessionary periods.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1362417410335</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 12:16:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362417511591-62</Id><Topic><Title>AMZN CEO Buying Shares!</Title><Username>kirk.gallardo</Username><Timestamp>1362154528025</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 11:15:28 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>thanks for sharing!</Msg><Username>helenbrown20</Username><Timestamp>1362417511591</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 12:18:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362417696177-63</Id><Topic><Title>Amazing!!

I will make damn sure that the next time it tries to raise money, there is a clear fact base on the reasons for its lagging fundamental performance and the true leverage / risk involved.

Apple blew through the $425 resitance like nothing - that was supposed to the hard stop, and I thought would end the roatation. I took a look at the % of apple money outflows that have moved to AMZN and tried to figure a top, but with $425 in the rear view mirror, net stop could be either $400 or next $350 (ouch) .. which would place AMZN near $325. At those levels, AMZN EV will be 75% of AAPL's !!!!!!!!!</Msg><Username>once_on</Username><Timestamp>1362433301792</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 16:41:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362433768402-150</Id><Topic><Title>Paging PJ and gang</Title><Username>cash_back_7</Username><Timestamp>1362342116781</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-03 15:21:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>i was right. what a horror for bears.</Msg><Username>cash_back_7</Username><Timestamp>1362433768402</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 16:49:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362434836828-151</Id><Topic><Title>Research Firm DOWNGRADES TO SELL</Title><Username>thomasdickson984</Username><Timestamp>1362131739471</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 04:55:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Amazing report</Msg><Username>bratzbrandon</Username><Timestamp>1362434836828</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 17:07:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362435499919-152</Id><Title>While you dolts were ignoring the support . . .</Title><Msg>levels at the 50 day . . . and volume too . . .

Amazon ready started to lose momentum and break down, so they had to accelerate the selling of AAPL to paint the tape for Amazon and knockout AAPL longs in the process. They are just delaying Amazon's massive drop. It cannot be prevented. Once: as to why I think it will reverse, folks will have to be insane to be short AAPL or long AMZN at these relative valuations heading into the next earnings call. A fair relative valuation on fundamentals would be closer to 10:1. The relative enterprise value is about 2:1 right now. There aren't many opportunities to meaningfully reduce risk and increase upside simultaneously. Right now, they are pushing to capitulation in both directions. Once it happens, the fall here will be epic....</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1362443032298</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 19:23:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362443998337-159</Id><Title>MakerBot. ...3D printer</Title><Msg>Remember that AMZN owns big chunk of this good private owned company.
