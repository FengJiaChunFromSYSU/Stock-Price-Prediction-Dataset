In a bear market everything goes down. INTC = 13, AMZN = 100, CMG = 80, AAPL = 350. Estimates based on technical estimates. Reason for bear market is lack of stimulus spending. The post election sell off that we are now seeing is just a warning shot. There will be an end of year Santa Claus rally. As you can see my independent TA estimates match your FA. But unless youre hedging, it makes no sense to me to be buying anything when everything is going down. I havent bought a thing in over a year. Tried shorting AMZN but was unable to predict short term moves. Still unsure of best way to do it. I asked you several months ago, but you never replied. Do i buy a bear fund, short a stock (borrowing might be hard), Buy puts (otm,atm,itm?), or hedge long and short.? Hedging makes little sense to me. Intc could drop 30%, amzn 60%, net gain = 30%. Why not just short amznfor a 60% net gain?</Msg><Username>edison20</Username><Timestamp>1352645971281</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-11 09:59:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352646449755-4</Id><Topic><Title>what do you think?</Title><Username>katiaelfrink701</Username><Timestamp>1307970169000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2011-06-13 09:02:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good job guys</Msg><Username>winsentmortin360</Username><Timestamp>1352646449755</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-11 10:07:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352646721640-5</Id><Title>Why cant sybil reply to numbskull edison?

There is a simple answer and a complicated one. The simple answer is that I believe INTC is RELATIVELY undervalued in this marketplace. Unless we literally have an all out crash (and I mean fast liquidation), the capital will slosh back and forth in the system to create maximum pain along the way. The MOMOs have created their pain and then some. But frankly, it is VERY risky for funds to create that pain now because everyone knows that they are a house of cards without any fundamental support and no fund manager wants to explain how he/she could be so negligent as to hold or increase a position in the current context. If so, the capital will flow somewhere. I think any responsible fund manager is using AMZN stock as an overvalued currency to buy stocks that are relatively undervalued world class companies with huge cash balance, huge cash flows and huge margins (there is a reason that INTC, AAPL and GOOG fell further, first and faster from the highs. ROTATION.). Furthermore, the short interest is now piled up in stocks like INTC and GRPN which means the easy money to be made is there via a sellers' strike which forces weak shorts to cover on lower volume. That game will be much harder to play in the MOMOs that are well below their historical short interest levels and literally have asymmetric event risk. The more complex answer is that everyone talks about inflation and deflation as if it is monolithic and uniform. It is not. It is relative. What one experiences is a function of where one sits in the economy. I think I have a pretty good handle on relative inflation/deflation will affect different consumer segments and businesses over time, both domestically and internationally. I think AMZN will be a loser in that environment and INTC will be a winner. One must think not just about the direct effects, but the indirect effects (system level interaction effects). We'll see how it plays out, but I am willing to put my own money (not other people's money) where my mouth is. And, I've generally been right on intermediate and longer term time scales. Finally, I think it is insane to have any portfolio that is not hedged.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1352649067397</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-11 10:51:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352654585503-9</Id><Title>Kill the grpn thread ...

But, you do have to have long positions to properly hedge. I'm in a ton of cash, but the Fed's goal and what is really meant by financial repression is to accomplish deflation without a dexline in nominal asset prices. The world's central banks are coordinating to accomplish just that. If they were to succeed, or to fail in a hyperinflationary spiral, your cash plus short approach would, in aggregate lose. Having said that, given that you are short a scam that will get hit hard regardless of the inflationary pathway, you'll do just fine. I choose to construct a portfolio that is robust to all scenarios while allowing for/ enabling supranormal returns under the most likely conditions. We have different philosophies, strategies and time horizons. Both can do well as long as we remain internally consistent and disciplined in executing our approach. Good luck.

Such valuation readjustments usually occur rapidly, not gradually if market history tells us anything. The herd moves in, the herd stampedes out. That is Wall Street in a nutshell. The negative mention in the latest Barron's ( Nov. 12 issue, p. 42) could be a catalyst for more "readjustment" to a more reasonable price and valuation level. Amazon to match the PE of other tech stocks like Apple, Google and eBay would have to fall 75% or more. A more conservative correction could be in the 30-40% range, to the mid $100s, either rapidly or gradually.</Msg><Username>ex.goldbug</Username><Timestamp>1352673939924</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-11 17:45:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352677447096-21</Id><Topic><Title>Kill the grpn thread ...

AMZN is overpriced. You are incorrect on most of the other comments. 1. It is a very simple fact: A nation cannot tax itself into prosperity. Reason: Pretty soon, more are sucking off those of us who work and pay taxes. Prosperity results from more productivity. BTW, that word is mispronounced by some on TV who are not too smart. The o is a long o and ryhmes with produce, not product. Dont' people know it is derived from produce? I guess they just don't think much. 2. Corporations, yes even the "rich" ones should not be taxed heavily. Were you ever hired by a poor corporation? If so, your job was not secure. Your use of the word, "progressive" reminds me of those who use the word "choose" when they are really saying abortion, i.e.:killing !! 3. The primary reason we are having and will continue the obama crash is due to his heavy tax policies. Those who have a profit on AMZN and many other stock will be taking their long term gains this calendar year. I would recoommend they get on the stick or they will not have any gains left. 4. Marijuana is for airheads and others who rely on the rest of us to do the thinking. 5. If a country does not have a strong military, they will not remain a major world power economically. 6. We need to eliminate our need for oil from terrorist nations. Every thinking person knows we need to drill off shore and in NE Alaska. All our enemies such as Iraq can figure out what their leverage is after that. Yes, that may reduce our requirement for military to some degree.

It doesn't surprise me a bit that this crowd thinks my investment in GRPN is misguided. But, make no mistkake, Groupon is neither a bad company nor is it overvalued. I believe GRPN was the fastest company to ever reach $1B in revenues (if not, it is very close). For all the GRPN basing, it isn't coming from the customers. They are growing and their average number of transactions are growing. Some merchants experiment and don't come back. So be it. They aren't going to a competitor. All the GRPN bashers make the same mistake that the MOMO longs do here. You are taking the price action to be the ultimate arbiter of a company's worth rather than a short term, highly volatile measure of groupthink. It's behavorial investing at its worst. I'm done discussing it because, necessarily, my thesis is forward looking and will take time to bear out. But, mark this post. GRPN's economics will prove sustainable. No other daily deal company, outside of Google, will be able to make the economics work. GRPN will adjust the discount % and revenue share over time. GRPN will capture value from transaction processing and other merchant services and GRPN will be worth 3X more than today within 2 years. I'll take all the taunting you all can dish. At some point, a wise institutional long is going to dump a 1% of AMZN stock, pocket $1B and buy 25% of GRPN stock for less than $0.5B. Hold the rest as cash (which will outperform AMZN) in case of a need for a secondary/PIPE and use that half billion as protection. Whoever does that will be massively ahead because AMZN is going to crash soon enough anyway. All it would take it is 1 strong institutional long, and GRPN is close to an all-time bottom... I know everyone disagrees. So, we'll look in a year. All of my calls are always forward looking and playing for a minimum 6 month horizon. Now back to your regularly scheduled bashing that ignores GRPN's record growth, positive FCF and UNIQUE market position in local service sector commerce.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1352681265252</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-11 19:47:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352685252596-25</Id><Topic><Title>Kill the grpn thread ...

GRPN built a business with ~40MM paying customer with about $2B TTM revenues in about 4 years. It is generating cash and, critically, has achieved critical mass in most domestic markets and is on its way to doing so internationally. Most people do not appreciate the density driven nature of the opportunity -- it is about deal/market liquidity. None of you would trade on a platform that only executed a few trades a day. No company would list its stock on such a market. It is why GRPN competitors have failed so miserably despite everyone saying there is no moat. They are wrong. The local liquidity in the deal marketplace is the moat and it is significant because the sales and QC costs of building out a market are very large. But, once overcome, they are sustainable and provide differential returns (the second player has to overcome the self reinforcing loops of GRPN's already dominant platform, offering lower fees or something else to bolster the value proposition). There's no compelling reason (and certainly none that GRPN couldn't immediately match and overcome) for merchants to choose another provider. It's easy for everyone to say its a POS. I don't see many other businesses that have built 40MM paying customers in 4 years, that blew past $1B in revenue and that generate cash. These guys had guts and not only created but protected LT value with very aggressive growth. I'm out. I encourage all of you who are so certain that GRPN is a POS to short it and try holding it until it goes to zero.
