What do you think about Sears third party selling? I like idea what amazon is doing third party sellers, great innovation by Jeff Bezos. Bread and Butter of Amazon business. Electronics products the number one selling item. If Sears developed a platform for e-commerce third party sellers and also sell there own products this would reinvent there business. The convenience of shopping from your home. Look at all small businesses across America that need to use a brand name to sell products.

Let's be honest, nobody trades like that with not stops: Sybil's a fraud taking it to the limit with making up those tickets trying to back up carrying millions. Only way to know is let someone of authority look at the data collected vs the actions of the person/afiilations behind the id and see if the tickets match.

I think their printing is being directed to companies they hope will build out infrastructure that lessons costs ahead. That's why analyzing AMZN on earnings today, is a big mistake still. As the Fed blows out the balance sheet, AMZN keeps going up, lately more agreesively and relentlessly. P/E analysis just doesn't work and way too superficial. Which makes the whole process of Bernanke's actions getting Jeff Bezos going toward being the richest man ever at this rate. Someday, maybe earnings will be more scrutinized, just hard to know when. That's just my view. Hopefully , to not make it a farce, Bezos doesn't become the richest before the company starts pulling in money to retained earnings somewhere ahead. Then, perhaps Bernanke has gone too far in playing favorites.</Msg><Username>nasdaq_6000_baby</Username><Timestamp>1374004312294</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 15:51:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374004566042-166</Id><Topic><Title>Sybs lookin reeeaaaallllll hard at this pig and well.....

In case you haven't noticed Amazon is not price competitive on most grocery items so there is some margin there. My guess is that Amazon is targeting two groups. The first is young urban professionals whose time is valuable. They're willing to pay more for groceries for the convenience. The second group is restaurants. When I was in Seattle last year I saw a large Ammie truck down by the piers delivering to restaurants. There's margin in wholesaling better quality food. I suspect Amazon has found a way to reduce delivery costs by using their own trucks and vans. Am I confident the Amazon grocery program is going to be successful? Of course not. Bezos uses his company as a giant test tube. Some experiments work while others don't. I do think this program has a better than 50-50 chance of making it.

Past bubbles show how reckless it is to do it. So a lot is riding on this policy. And it's getting aggressive here: GOOG toward $1000( at least backed by pretty high earnings run) AMZN over $300, PCLN neainrg $1000, oil at $105, gasoline futures over $3, rates rising, and non-stop Bernanke intervention still there. Seems like same easy money as the past, but this time all based on suppressing rates for so low with top price buying of US bonds. When you buy those Treasuries as close to 0 % as the Fed has along the curve of maturity, your paying top dollar to get those conditons. So rates might hold the key: Fed chose not to clean the system but to relever with even more aggressive paper deluge.</Msg><Username>homeytheclown03</Username><Timestamp>1374011581329</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 17:53:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374012372317-188</Id><Topic><Title>AMZN is now running up disregarding the prices/sales ratio : 140/64 2.19 now</Title><Username>homeytheclown03</Username><Timestamp>1374009050387</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 17:10:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>very hard to say where it is in that all: 5-10 years, closer, farther: whoever thought here, you'd see AMZN +300/shr, but still "Building business" for earnings ahead?

He parachuted in on GMCR and said NOTHING that wasn't obvious (as I posted virtually his entire short thesis on the YMB in the months before him...). Not much different for CMG. Nonetheless, I do not begrudge him success. I just despise the malinvestment that these float jam scams engender... I don't think he'll need to parachute in this time since we're heading for a crisis that will make everything before it look tame... "Fed is the Problem" Article on ZH by Rajan makes the point that I've been making for the past 5 years "There are two ways these calculations can go wrong. First, financial risk taking may stay just that, without translating into real investment. For instance, the price of junk debt or homes may be bid up unduly, increasing the risk of a crash, without new capital goods being bought or homes being built." Bottom line is that the casino known as the stock/bond market creates no value, yet Fin sector profits have gone from ~1.5% of GDP to over 5% of GDP in about 20 years. When value creation approximates zero and value capture is 5% over GDP, it can only lead to destabilizing outcomes over time...</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1374030021857</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 23:00:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374030838355-213</Id><Topic><Title>techstrategy are u here brother</Title><Username>cash_back_7</Username><Timestamp>1374016600164</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 19:16:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I wish I had more time to post, but I'm working on several very cool companies and not sleeping much these days as it is... Frankly, none of my fundamental analysis has changed (although gas prices increasing will exacerbate the inherent flaws in Amazon's "middling" strategy), so there's no real reason for me to post any more. Those who think this will keep climbing, you just got a warning sign from TSLA which cratered AFTER being added to the Nas100. The entire game is to move against fundamentals and dump crap into passive ETFs over time (aided by rebalancing and QE hype). There is NO fundamental support for this stock. It isn't an inflation or hyperinflation hedge (what would happen to consumer purchasing power or fuel prices in said environment?).
