Amazon stock is of no interest to the short-term fundamental value gambler. More of these investors probably have a longer-term growth outlook.

OK let 's forget about PE now. Just talk about the its operating cash flow. It has around $5B positive cash flow in the last 12 months. Assume it does not do any investment, so, the max income is $5B for whole year, which is still not enough to support $160B market cap company. There are many companies with this market cap can make more than $10B profit even after spending on billions in investment.</Msg><Username>ling.chen</Username><Timestamp>1383114805967</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-30 02:33:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1383123941701-6</Id><Topic><Title>is AMZN overvalued ?</Title><Username>blackcombgrouse</Username><Timestamp>1383106624268</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-30 00:17:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>no AMZN is very very cheap here!!! this is going to 1000 in 2-3 months reasons are FED printing money policy you never know what is the up side limit of bubble, but you know that bubble tend to blow up soon or latter GL for longs which think that AMZN will make lot of money....</Msg><Username>emanuel_dabah</Username><Timestamp>1383123941701</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-30 05:05:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1383127934362-7</Id><Title>Saaaawwwwweeeet geezez!

I have shorted NFLX hundreds of times......several times in the $120 to $160 range......and COVERED between $70 and $80.......so what's your point?.......that I MADE MONEY? You are CORRECT sport........I DID make money in those shorts. Thanks for the compliment. But the best short in NFLX, which you neglected to mention, was when I shorted AND BOUGHT PUTS in NFLX at $280.......and I POSTED THAT TRADE........and COVERED at $80.00.......and I POSTED THAT TRADE. So keep trying to discredit me, sport.

Or as long as revenues go up regardless of the expenses it is all good in the long run? From an article today: "Amazon can’t produce this kind of cost differential in groceries, because grocery stores rely on free labor — yours — to do all the laborious bits of fulfilling orders. You wander around the store with your cart, pile it all in, compare the prices of various brands of frozen chicken tenders, and these days, you may even be your own checkout girl. Then you drive it home to your house, unload the car and put the groceries in the kitchen. In order to deliver your groceries, Amazon has to pay someone at least $10 an hour to do all that work for you.</Msg><Username>kenji100</Username><Timestamp>1383152371383</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-30 12:59:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1383152650045-111</Id><Topic><Title>Time for a fun filled game of "guess the close"</Title><Username>sybil_rulez</Username><Timestamp>1383151012632</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-30 12:36:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"why wont u die" Thats not a valid guess.</Msg><Username>sybil_rulez</Username><Timestamp>1383152650045</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-30 13:04:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1383152789801-112</Id><Title>Hi folks - sybil here to help you out</Title><Msg>Scamazn iz about to swing positive now if you wanna cover soon....

Long-term over-all margins have been estimated to be in the high single digits eventually. For groceries you might try a proxy around say what Walmart or Safeway makes on that category. I'm sure Walmart's margins are much higher for some lines (electronics) than for perishables in the grocery lines. I'm also sure that for some items Walmart has negative margins (loss leaders). People will order other stuff along with groceries the same way they currently buy general merchandise on the same shopping trip at a Walmart or Target.

Amazon does it all. The strategy is to make your life simple so that eventually you trust Amazon to change your oil, do your taxes and pick up your kids from school. Eventually they will get there. Just another decade of losing money with soaring stock prices for those who see the full potential. In 10 years, when Amazon is at 1200 dollars per share, and flat making money - their income will dwarf Switzerland's gross national economy and Voila - overnight - Amazon will be making 30 dollars a share profit every 1/4. I should mention that with such thin margins - any and I mean any wrinkle in supply chain will crush Amazon with enormous losses.

The fundamentals don't seem to matter much. Amazon increases its sales by starting new businesses. Any business can do that. You can do that. In fact, you can do it until you are so deep in debt the bubble bursts. Amazon's bottom line, its net worth (net tangible assets) hasn't changed for years, so the price per book just keeps growing. Finally, what is the point of doing so much business if you never make a profit?

In AMZN's case, the sales dollars are TAKING dollars from the bottom line , yet the market is valuing them more than they would for other companies in the market. A very interesting set of cirumstances right now. So much for what 'scale' would do for AMZN up to now, though the market right now seems "wowed" by it all. This is part of the Einhorn "riddle" of AMZN he made of couple of years ago.
