Carter was president from 1976 to 1980.... Are you saying that the market that we're in is like the late 70's? That would be awesome! The market increase 10x from 1980 to 2000. While there are plenty of problems, there are a few reasons for optimisms... First, the usa is just starting to tap into an incredible energy supply. This will help give us a competitive advantage. Second, there are signs that housing is recovering. If it does, gdp and employment will have a nice tail wind. Agree with you that QE could drive big problems with inflation.</Msg><Username>tail_risk</Username><Timestamp>1368394205524</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-12 17:30:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368397099860-17</Id><Topic><Title>Tech, The current markets are more like the 70's than any other comparitable era - sys a student of market history</Title><Username>sybil_rulez</Username><Timestamp>1368393119360</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-12 17:11:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No, stupid.

You and Tech are really the only posters I read, expect for the occasional off the wall geggee post. Anyway, I am not nearly as confident in any of my predictions. One thing I'm confident in is that long term predictions are almost always wrong. Who really knows when this thing turns??? One thing that we both agree on is AMZN is an over-valued pig. One thing we don't agree on is options are crack. I hope to profit mightily off puts. I made a couple bucks the last earnings report. Hopefully I'll have a boat load of puts when it crashes. In all truth though, I've lost more $$$ that gained in options. We will see if patience pays off.
