All other YOY comps were not good... The story doesn't add up. "Margins" are increasing. Yet fulfillment cost and gross shipping cost have increased as a % of net sales (which somehow the analysts overlook). Shipping cost as a percent of net sales only has declined because of internal revenue transfers from Prime (which is a loss leader in itself).

Selling books through the mail was also said not to be hard to do. Or selling ebooks (Sony did it before Amazon, but how are the doing today?). What matters is not whether something is hard or not, but who can do it better. Amazon did on both of those counts and dominates the market now in those areas. It is not like analog radio. A playlist can be downloaded to your car's hd if your tolerance for occasional lack of streaming is low. It isn't really a service per se. It simply expands and rebrands what Amazon users already have. The part of it that is a service is after you get to a certain limit and I think for music right now it is 250 (non-Amazon) songs (ripped or from iTunes converted, etc.) you pay fees for more storage space. But any songs you add from Amazon come with storage free of charge. So I can see already that shorts, once again, don't get it. More than a service, it is simply a way to get consumers to buy from Amazon rather than iTunes and others who are not offering as good a service. Of stealing growth from iTunes, which shorts used to think (still do?) had a lock on digital music. As for family use in a car, who cares? Most people using the service are probably going to be alone in the car, commuting. Your gripes remind me of the rabid luddite shorts who used to say that people liked the touch and smell of paper and ebooks would never catch on.</Msg><Username>nemesis_editor_2007</Username><Timestamp>1360857650466</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 11:00:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360857751547-74</Id><Title>next week markets will correct amzn</Title><Msg>will be down big I added to my amzn at 269 thanks long bagholders</Msg><Username>xdon69</Username><Timestamp>1360857751547</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 11:02:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360858022662-75</Id><Topic><Title>Does any of the bulls even know what cloud on your radio suppose to be?</Title><Username>ehsani97</Username><Timestamp>1360854491192</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 10:08:11 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Physical books had exceptional fundamental economics, particularly when Bezos started.

Google is a search engine to them no matter what Amazon shorts say Google "can" do (technically). iBooks failed because it was a closed system with overpriced books. Amazon stared Apple down and Apple blinked and lost. They went with the closed system because they needed it to sell their high margin hardware with. They had no other choice. Consumers did not want that, as Amazon had to have known. Having high margins is a kind of curse in this way.

This is why you invest heavily or take heavy losses at a crucial stage of any new business in order to lock in customers and gain early share dominance. Amazon could see in advance how things would play out because they track consumer behavior and discussions 24/7 and mine that data very well, whereas Apple is simply a hardware maker and Google is just the owner of some fancy search algorithms.

This if for content retailing. They don't know enough about this kind of consumer behavior and don't have the means to learn. This is why they could say no one reads any more and that ebooks would never amount to anything. Now, after the fact, they are following Amazon's lead. Apple may have a lot of money, but if they don't know what to spend it on and how it won't do Amazon shorts any good. Amazon may have less room for error but then they are playing with a full set of data on customers. This is like my playing pin the tail on the short donkey with you being blindfolded and me not. I can easily just walk over to the target and pin it. Zero room (even) for error, but zero errors made. I can give you a million times as many chances (Apple's cash advantage) and maybe after bungling around for a few hours you'll get it. But the party will be long over by then. You conflate "a cherry picked set of fundamentals" with a full set of data about expansion cycles. Instead of looking at say Year 1 to 5 of the previous cycle you cherry pick as your starting point Year 4 or 5, the peak of one cycle, and on top of that, omit the implications of that previous cycle from your projections about the current cycle.

Apple sells 3 or 4 products. Amazon sells millions. They don't know about content retailing. That they missed the boat on ebooks is pretty much proof of this. Apple simply sells their own product which is a high ticket item so they get categorized as a "retailer" but they aren't one in the same sense that Amazon is. Amazon can follow you all around their site seeing what reviews you read, when you do so, what you purchase across a wide variety of consumer products, not just the 3 or 4 product lines that Apple sells. All kinds of discussions go on on Amazon's discussion boards about all these millions of products. Apple has no community like this to track sentiment with. When was the last time you logged on to iTunes or read or posted a review there? Probably almost never, zero and zero. Jobs cited some data about how people don't read any more when he famously said ebooks would never amount to much. Probably fed to him by some underling. This is how Apple works. They are followers, when it comes to content trends, not leaders. You're confused about producing 2-3 kinds of devices with fancy edges and colors as "knowing consumers" and Amazon's total retail skill sets. Another bungle was the price fixing scandal. Only a company that did not understand customers at all could have undertaken such an ill-advised course of "retailing". Apple knows about "design" and about "high margins"; they don't really know much about retailing content. People used to buy their content simply as a consequence of having already bought the fancy hardware. But now that even a lowly near cashless entity such as BKS can produce a sufficient device (Nook) to steal share away form them, this content/hardware combination and it's future don't seem quite as bright as it once was.</Msg><Username>nemesis_editor_2007</Username><Timestamp>1360865118195</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 13:05:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360865150298-142</Id><Title>I see $284+ today now!</Title><Msg>Just saying it.

It will recognize that and chance paths. And, the DOJ is doing it a favor... It should "settle" and arrange for an iTunes match on all Amazon purchased content and match prices. Publishers would capture more value from the matching fees and would get more competition for Amazon. Most products we purchase are NOT high involvement products where review are necessary.

"What's The Big Deal? Some investors might be able to ignore all of this and say just wait and see what Amazon can do in the future. I'm suggesting that this isn't the same fast growth stock it has been in the last few years. Think about it, Amazon is reporting 48% slower growth in merchandise, 58% slower growth in digital sales, and they have 72% more employees than just a year and a half ago. The big deal is, everyone points to Amazon as the future of retail efficiency and profits. Analysts were surprised by Amazon's gross margin in the current quarter. I'm not sure why, as their gross margin of 24.13% is still lower than Wal-Mart at 24.94%, and was lower than Amazon's full year margin of 24.75%. The real model of online efficiency is eBay and their nearly 70% gross margin. The Bottom Line Even if Amazon meets analysts targets, shares trade for almost 180 times 2013 projections and 73 times 2014 estimates. Considering the company missed estimates three of the last four quarters, these estimates should be questioned. At 4.39 times their growth rate this year, and even 1.78 times their growth rate next year, the stock carries a significant premium. Looking at the last year and a half, Amazon's sales are slowing, their fixed costs are growing, and investors have happily continued buying the shares. Amazon is a great business, but not a great investment at these prices. There is a difference between the two, and I'm afraid some investors are going to learn this lesson the hard way."</Msg><Username>kenji100</Username><Timestamp>1360869280795</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 14:14:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360869354693-171</Id><Topic><Title>AMZN should buy CSTR</Title><Username>jdr52683</Username><Timestamp>1329243527000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-02-14 13:18:47 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No.</Msg><Username>kenji100</Username><Timestamp>1360869354693</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 14:15:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360869401046-172</Id><Topic><Title>congrats to today's dipbuyers around 265-6 : looks like AMZN is back into that mode on a daily basis after the earning report correction</Title><Username>nasdaq_6000_baby</Username><Timestamp>1360865648860</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 13:14:08 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You see? amzn rocks again and again!

"In a letter, Paul Misener, Amazon’s VP for global public policy, said, “I am writing to thank you for your bill, which will allow states with simplified rules to require sales tax collection by out-of-state sellers who choose to make sales to in-state buyers.” Amazon has been considered a prime example for why tax reform is needed. Since it was founded in 1994, the retailer has taken extraordinary measures to avoid collecting sales taxes nationwide, although more recently its stance on the subject has been softening. It now collects taxes in more than half a dozen states. Most recently, it agreed to start paying sales tax in Pennsylvania, Texas, California and Connecticut.

Amazon is for it. As the largest 1P internet seller, Amazon will be forced to collect taxes by every state eventually anyway (the states should just direct their pension funds to pull all direct and indirect investment in Amazon until it collects taxes). So, Amazon wants to make sure all other etailers of significance have to pay taxes as well. It knows having to collect taxes while other etailers of TVs and big ticket items not having to would have a very significant adverse impact on its business. The bill is far from a done deal. In fact, the threshold for exemption is one of the key issues for debate. Personally, I'd like to see it at the $500K level PER STATE rather than all out of state.
