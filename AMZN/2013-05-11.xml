Its like an eerie calm before a catastrophic storm - like a tornado... The skiez are dark with tingez of yellow and green, and the birdz are quite. The bullz are laying down on the ground, pigz are nustled away in shelterz, the bearz are hungry but quite, the wolvez are quiety looking out, and the sheep are scared. Into next week we go.</Msg><Username>sybil_rulez</Username><Timestamp>1368313603344</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-11 19:06:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368315511081-2</Id><Topic><Title>All iz quite on the front linez</Title><Username>sybil_rulez</Username><Timestamp>1368313603344</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-11 19:06:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Amzn may crumble with a whimper rather than a bang.

They closed it above the 50 DMA. If the IBD scam stock crowd has their way the markets will continue to melt up even with the indexes well above their 50 DMA and 200 DMA. Volume has been light the last few up days with a distribution day on Thursday. Lots of economic data this week but I'm not sure that will shake the markets one way or the other. Might be a few decent pullback days soon but that could me this week or next month. If neither this might be 1995 or 1999 all over again.</Msg><Username>hapihammer</Username><Timestamp>1368317567796</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-11 20:12:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368318193945-4</Id><Title>The sheeple get stale F13 institutional holdingz reports this week</Title><Msg>It will be for q1 2013 robot action. while fido and cap world robots can crunch live data az it occurez on the exchange in nanosecond fashion and steer to price points using opmz, sheeple get fed SEC reports that are 45 to 135 dayz stale.... Thats fair, no rigging the game here...

If neither this might be 1995 or 1999 all over again." Thats what they would like the shorts to think to ring out a round of panic covering, but alas the conditionz are much much closer to a twisted (and much worse) senario to 1975-1980 than that of 1995 - 2000. Generationally, macro economically, and the wealth divide never being greater puts in a very precarious position rather than one of optimism where the boomerz fueled a new technology telcom and internet bubble.... Our better dayz lay much furtger down the road, and therez a big #$%$ in cravass between here and donw the road. It aint no 1995, son.</Msg><Username>sybil_rulez</Username><Timestamp>1368318962401</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-11 20:36:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368322474282-6</Id><Topic><Title>All iz quite on the front linez</Title><Username>sybil_rulez</Username><Timestamp>1368313603344</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-11 19:06:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Definitely not in terms of the economy but possibly in the way the market is reacting for now.
