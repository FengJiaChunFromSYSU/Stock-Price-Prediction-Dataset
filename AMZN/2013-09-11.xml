Scary in my mind. You have 4 below then you have the whole Enterprise software group including CRM, NOW and especially WDAY. CRM keeps growing at a nice 30%ish rate but is losing money with a worsening balance sheet. NOW I don't know well at all but it has crazy multiples and WDAY is growing substantially but trades at about 38 times trailing sales and isn't projected to make money for years. I think lots of ETF action will have these jammed into 401ks and the like. There always seems to be a way that Retail is left ultimately holding the bag.</Msg><Username>hapihammer</Username><Timestamp>1378909564434</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-11 10:26:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1378910107886-13</Id><Topic><Title>what's amazing to me is to watch days like this where AAPL with solid Balance sheet gets crushed while</Title><Username>buy_bubblestocks</Username><Timestamp>1378908749825</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-11 10:12:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's been so over the top with the valuations that even if they are the future: great companies, when are they horrible buys? this market is filled with momemtum chasing monkeys on low volume for so long. Meanwhile WS says to get back into stocks. In the early 1970's, you had a similar market that created the Nifty Fifty: great companies but stupid values that turned into a disaster. Let's be honest: the Fed never shows one ounce of a concern for the bubbles the easy money makes: they even promote it.

Indeed. What's such a blatant lie is hearing Berannke talk about 'price stability." This isn't price stability, it's similar to what happened in housing and tech stock before: price instablity on too easy money. And the cost of it is up to $3.7 trillion dollars on the Fed balance sheet now: of alot of bond bought below 2 %. If Berananke ran a bond fund, it would have blown up and been bankrupt. It's one thing to protect the low end, but you don't let it happen again and again like were seeing. But you are right, it can blow up into a even bigger,more unstable bubble. But you can rest assured, that the leaders of these companies getting chased toward 1000 time earnings now, or N/A are banking gains as the stocks get chased to even more nonsense. This is Bernanke's idea of "wealth effect": the rich lock in and get more rich with every bubble made and protected.</Msg><Username>buy_bubblestocks</Username><Timestamp>1378911157376</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-11 10:52:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1378911355992-16</Id><Title>and meanwhile, as multiple are chased in these highflier and being blow out to the upside, rates back up even more</Title><Msg>in the past, that's been very dangerous.

The overall quality of jobs is not good. Mom and Pop that may have been trying to invest in fixed income are getting hosed and maybe getting pulled in or will be pulled into the market at or near a top. Thanks Bernanke. You seem kind of clueless Ben, especially when asked the direct question about whether you are helping Wall Street and not Main Street. I believe Ben's answer was something like "Not at all". What!!!???? I believe this whole experiment is just speeding up the polarization of our economy, i.e. the haves getting more and the have nots getting less.</Msg><Username>hapihammer</Username><Timestamp>1378912563563</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-11 11:16:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1378913262534-18</Id><Title>carl owns apple LOL</Title><Msg>LOL</Msg><Username>xdon69</Username><Timestamp>1378913262534</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-11 11:27:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1378913446249-19</Id><Topic><Title>what's amazing to me is to watch days like this where AAPL with solid Balance sheet gets crushed while</Title><Username>buy_bubblestocks</Username><Timestamp>1378908749825</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-11 10:12:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm just commenting on the valuations, they're beyond explainable. From a trading angle, no doubl strategies are working over and over to the upside, which is show by getting to 300 + earnings multiple now: that's very rare to see outside the tech bubble of 2000 as I commented on below: top of Jan 1973 has a lot of big cap multiples get to near 100: but not 300 or more like we are seeing in the tech higherfliers of today. When it stops working, perhaps even getting cut in half won't make much sense to any traditional metrics on these stocks. of course, they might keep working as long as Bernanke is backing the market with monthly billions. Not sure that's anything close to longterm stiability, it certainly didn't end well in the past. So I will keep an eye out for when it does.</Msg><Username>buy_bubblestocks</Username><Timestamp>1378913446249</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-11 11:30:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1378914063640-20</Id><Topic><Title>what's amazing to me is to watch days like this where AAPL with solid Balance sheet gets crushed while</Title><Username>buy_bubblestocks</Username><Timestamp>1378908749825</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-11 10:12:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yeah I know it's different this time in terms of the FED action but I would have sincere doubts about said MOMOs staying hyper elevated as the plug is being pulled on QE.
