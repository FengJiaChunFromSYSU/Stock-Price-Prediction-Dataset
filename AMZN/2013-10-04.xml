A dozen amzn managers stand around with a half dozen temp managers watching over this #$%$ up system. I ask management why? Because the post office charges too much to sort. Day 2, I ask an amzn manager why we sold 65B in merchandise and lost 101M. Answer: that has to be a lie.

You seem to ask reasonable questions so for now, I'll assume you are legit. I wasn't referring to you as part of the 3rd grade wannabe cyberbullies. Anyone who has seen the relentless personal attacks of Geeg, Ski, Nas, Nem for about a year knows I do not have a thin skin. I remain civil even as they often act like children.... In the past (NFLX, GMCR, CMG), the personal attacks reached similar feverish pitches right before the stocks imploded... As to your question about what I think I have been correct on, the answer is fundamental business performance -- the things that cannot be manipulated by HFT algos and the broader float jam scam. My predictions on revenue and earnings trends (along with last year's need to raise capital) all bore out and were based upon the underlying cost &amp; profit drivers of the business. Nonetheless, the stock price (which is just one big manipulated float jam scam) has moved in direct opposition to its underlying fundamentals, so I've been hit hard in the "price is truth" world even though it is a complete house of cards / ponzi that will evaporate very quickly. I never expected CapWorld to pull the crazy Ivan and those quants Cash refers to below to pile in. I've taken my lumps in the market over the past 24 months, particularly the last year. But, I'll be just fine when the music stops playing (and it will). The moral hazard taking place today makes 2008 look like chump change. Systemic fragility has never been higher. When the music stops, those playing these games won't be so fortunate.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1380919201608</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-04 16:40:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1380919590831-71</Id><Title>Tech, do you biew sybil az a fvck in cyber bully?</Title><Msg>Well do ya?</Msg><Username>sybil_rulez</Username><Timestamp>1380919590831</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-04 16:46:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380919944765-72</Id><Topic><Title>Tech, do you biew sybil az a fvck in cyber bully?</Title><Username>sybil_rulez</Username><Timestamp>1380919590831</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-04 16:46:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Do you have multiple alias disorder?

Despite what you implied, I do not encourage people to short. I convey my analysis of the underlying fundamental economics. And I call this for the trading scam that I believe it to be. But, how they invest is their decision, not mine.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1380920572530</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-04 17:02:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1380920895233-76</Id><Title>GO TSLA!</Title><Msg>LOL</Msg><Username>el0ver</Username><Timestamp>1380920895233</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-04 17:08:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380930347125-77</Id><Topic><Title>GO TSLA!</Title><Username>el0ver</Username><Timestamp>1380920895233</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-10-04 17:08:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Now thats a crackhead stock that fmr iz making a MINT on.
