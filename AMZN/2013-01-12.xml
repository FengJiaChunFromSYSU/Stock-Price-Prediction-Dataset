You order everything from Sears and JCP catalogs. A company operating for about 20 years is allowed to make no profit and still trade at 3100 PE. They are waiting for all retailers like Sears, JC Penny, Kohls, Target, Best Buy to go bankrupt so that they can sell you on catalog. No tax collection ( I know it is changing), and unfair anti-capitalistic practices and forcing everybody to order from the catalogs and creating huge unemployment is morally wrong. Amazon wither make $27 a share now or go bankrupt. It is just a matter of time before this becomes a huge political issue. Get out now. Bezoons and his hedgies are going to loose this ponzee scheme. The real revolt is brewing. It is morally important that amazon goes banrupt so that people can have jobs and anti-capitalistic practices end. A lot of people comlain that they get screwed by the conterfiet stuff they get from amazoon and later realize that it it conterfeit. It is high time to short this pig and break the scheme. Otherwise all traditional reatailers are going to go bankrupt and you get to try everything out of a catalog. First warning.

People thought at $100 , it would no go to $120 and 80 times earings, at $150, 100 times , earnings, $200: 300 times earings: you get the picture: if it can go to $270 now on 150 foward earnings: there's not much it can't do: it's in the midst of blowing the market cap to the upside while expanding the multiple: and it has no bounds with the amount of liquidity around. Is it dangerous? sure? but putting a bounds on how far it goes is just a guess. And, I don't think anyone saw it making it to here: 270/shr with limited earnings: most thought the earnings would have to follow with the stock. That hasn't been the case.

First, there is a BIG difference between being a content distributor and a publisher. You are absolutely correct that Amazon has lost any truly strategic focus and is trying to do everything (which invariably leads to others who are focused doing everything better). In an era of cloud based digital lockees (see Ultrviolet...), no one needs to buy everything from Amazon. As to to self publishing and production, books are a limited market opportunity. Video content is much bigger... There happens to be a slightly more advanced platform with a user base about 2 order of magnitude (2.5 OOM?) larger than Amazon's Prime where people already spend more hours on the site outside of anything but Facebook. What is it you ask? It is called YouTube. A Google property and Google is investing some of its massive ($15B RECURRING) cash flow into more professional production and theme oriented channels.... I have friends that are developing new channels for YouTube... As I said long ago with NFLX, the cable operators will simply move to making their money on access to bandwidth in the home. They'll get their toll. Amazon and Netflix customers are still going to have to pay for the bandwidth to get that content into the home... Google, OTOH, happens to have a strategic asset that it bought for pennies on the dollar almost a decade ago (whereas Amazon spends record amounts to build new "state of the art" distribution facilities that others could easily build/replicate). Building today what Google bought would take Amazon's complete market cap... This strategic asset will also prove to be a key differentiator in the medium to long term for the enterprise cloud, especially now that we are seeing the vulnerabilities in Amazon's offering...</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1358011962916</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 12:32:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358012356334-44</Id><Title>Here's the part wherevyou just ignore the pumperz, and let it play out</Title><Msg>you've argued and reasoned with them over the last 4 months and made some nice swing tradez az the pigz and the entire market stage has been set up for the big kahuuuna....

Notice Friday that bonds on 10 year reached 1.93 % in the premarket and then backed off. Bernanke's balance sheet is so huge and distorted with gov't bond debt now that it could easily rock the markets in any sudden shift in rates. Somewhere in there lies the risk of the "huge QE" game Bernanke has played with goosing the US market: they turned themselves into acting like a leveraged hedge fund. More risk than you will ever hear from the mainstream media. This week must have unearthed Bernanke somewhat as yields are threatening to spike out of the top of the range. With huge carry balances on the Fed balance sheet, that would be bad news, not good news, for all "propped up " markets. Thats why you get stock market selloffs from time to time, trying to keep others besides Bernanke's printed money in the bond market, now that his balances have become such of huge % of the bond market and GDP. Your Central Banks is not supposed to act like a hedge fund here. In 2009 at suppressed prices? ok to support it. Now at PE's like AMZN at 150 times some foward BS number and after bloating Fed balance sheet from $800 billion to almost $3 trillion? dangerous to implosion on any sudden market jolts.</Msg><Username>im_too_hipp</Username><Timestamp>1358012492558</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 12:41:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358012552971-46</Id><Topic><Title>Third party sales</Title><Username>johnalexgordon</Username><Timestamp>1357999044687</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 08:57:24 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Actually, you aren't far off there.

I've hinted at several of the others for months (and recently Tim and Paulo have published related article and SA -- kudos to them...).

That works for a while, but no longer. The turning points: Sales Tax 1. AMZN is losing a huge 8-10% margin advantage in the US 2. In Europe, movements are afoot in multiple countries to go after AMZN corp structure to, yes, grab AMZN sales tax. Online Sales 1. BBY has proven that they can go toe-to-toe with AMZN online wise. BBY online sales increased 4-6% in California, Texas, Pennsylvania where AMZN had had to collect sales tax. The point here is folks can see that with an infusion of money and effort, BBY stands a very very good chance of taking back what AMZN had taken from them. There will be folks who will be more than willing to take this route and go up against AMZN. Cloud space In response to GOOG's challenge, AMZN had to drop their AWS pricing by 25%. This is huge for a company that runs on vapor with practically no margin. Discount Pricing Multiple retailers matched AMZN pricing over the Holiday. TGT recently announced they will match AMZN online prices EVERY day, all year long. Politically Mall of America in Minnesota recently decried attempts to tax fashion and clothing. They suggested: tax AMZN sales. This is just one among many voices that have and will speak up against AMZN predatory model. The retail world, consumers, local economies do not benefit by having just one AMZN. Can you imagine the world producers having to deal with just one guy? Nope, they want to have multiple outlets for their products.</Msg><Username>stock_lol</Username><Timestamp>1358023585906</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 15:46:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358023626841-65</Id><Title>lol!! quite ovious that q_lockeed is ex_goldbug: how many different ID's are you gonna create? lol!</Title><Msg>Inspecter Clousseau saw that one in one view and cracked it.

You are making the same mistake every analyst has made. The relevant metric is gross profit per item delivered. The customer came to the website with the intent to purchase and doesn't care if it is from Amazon or 3P (at least in states where tax is not being collected -- in other words for now). So, Amazon can either earn say 20% gross margin on 100% of the retail selling price or 100% on the 3P listing fee... Unless that amounts to 20% of the purchase price, Amazon is missing out on gross profit potential. I am intentionally oversimplifying. But, it should communicate the fallacy.

It took 45 days of steady declines to go from 298 to 208. the magnitude of the price drops grew once it hit 208. in one day it dropped from 208 to 169. Then it went from 169 to 109 in 25 days. Then it went from 109 to 79 in a couple of days. So what does this mean??? Well, it may take a while for amzn to drop 100, 150 or more.

Due to herding effects, the former can be very wrong for a long time, which is why most are afraid to short this scam. i focus only on fundamental economic value capture. Amazon captures little. Its prospects for capture more in the future are far more muted than pumpers like you get, because you lack either the rigor or the intellect (or both) to figure it out. Actually, Amazon rallied while Apple (and Google) took a dive because it was the only way for the big players to unload a pile of Amazon dung (people will look back at this as the revenge of the active managers, because it was a pretty sweet play).

Earlier someone today someone posted that they might take a long position in AMZN if it hits $200. I'll tell ya what, if it hits $200, or even close, it will continue to tank. Never short a stock that is hitting new highs and never go long a stock that is dropping fast. That's a painful and costly lesson I learned way back when. It still holds true. If AMZN gapped down to $235 Monday morning, I would say short the snot out of it, you didn't miss the complete show, because $165 is in the works.

The conventional wisdom is that it has a superior cost structure that bricks and mortar retailers cannot compete with. In that regard, the conventional wisdom is thoroughly incorrect. It absolutely had a superior cost structure for physical books. But, for much of the product now being sold on Amazon, it has an inferior one... The economics depend upon the nature of the good and the nature of the purchase. In reality, the lions share of "retail" is not well suited to etailing... The relative economics of etailing is actually past its peak -- and it isn't just due to tax collection. Few understand that point. But that is because they are not properly modeling the economic tradeoffs involved.

Most analysts conflate more growth of mobile with an increase in Amazon's profitability. In reality, Amazon's profits are no different when a product is ordered via PC than a tablet or phone. It's all a bunch of hype... The unit economics that matter are driven by other things... Like all bubbles, this will end badly. The humorous part is there is almost no aspect of Amazon's business has increasing returns to scale and huge margins that did offer some justification for the bubblicous valuations of the tech boom. We are different pal. I focus on real economic returns. Not speculative momentum investing.

My only point is that shorts are always talking about the downside reaction about to come and then are wrong time and time again. I just believe AMZN is the most supported and loved stock by Wall Street right now. It's even separted over the last quarter from AAPL. I don't know what will pull it back. Even the periods of pullback like 2008 were just that, pullbacks. One thing that helps AMZN compared to widely held stocks is that Jeff owns about 19 % of the compnany while another big part is owned by funds: I havn't checked in awhile but it was about 89 % is tightly controlled long. So it's easy to squeeze the shorts who short the common and we know how put buyers do in it. It's just not been an easy short to make money in over a longer period of time. Add to that the liguidity ssue of the Fed gving money to the banks daily that give the support to it the most: doesn't show any signs of weakness to me.

I keep asking myself how this stock has run so far given its deteriorating fundamentals, loss of competitive advantage, poor quality free cash flow, several disappointing reports over the last year, the list goes on. I know there are some that think that amzn will increase margin in the future while maintaining rev growth. This is a faith, pure and simple. There rev growth is correlated to razor thin, to negative margins. Increase the price and customers will move on. I don't understand how analyst from leading i-banks can increase their target price based on 1) the hope that amzn will increase its international rev buy spending billions on infrastructural or 2) there web service will dominate in the future even though competitor like goog, orcl, etc, are slashing prices on this commodity service. These scenarios are more a product of imagination than a deep financial analysis. I am perplexed. How does this happen?</Msg><Username>johnalexgordon</Username><Timestamp>1358039592070</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 20:13:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358041428073-123</Id><Topic><Title>a failure of the markets</Title><Username>johnalexgordon</Username><Timestamp>1358039592070</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 20:13:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>irrational exuberance z</Msg><Username>indian8788</Username><Timestamp>1358041428073</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 20:43:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358041968007-124</Id><Topic><Title>a failure of the markets</Title><Username>johnalexgordon</Username><Timestamp>1358039592070</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 20:13:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Because Wall Street has lost sight of the fact that trust is absolutely essential. The professionals understand behavorial investing. They understand not only that most people will capitulate when a stock moves sufficiently far against them, but how far it needs to be moved into the absurd to make it happen. HFT trading has taken behavioral investing to a new level of absurdity (and there is a reason that most MOMO companies are consumer facing -- it leverages the consumers trust in the brand and experience to pull off the MOMO scam). They constantly churn retail investors who think in terms of fundamentals and, in the process, diminish the number of people who will trust the market and will be willing to put new capital to work there... As I said earlier, the dynamics described above are used to shake "weak" longs out of extraordinary investments (think AAPL at 312 trading at 15X FE and 12X ex-cash with nearly 100% YOY earnings and revenue growth) and to constantly "weak" shorts out of overvalued scams (like this one). Weak translates to retail/general public/non-institutional. These incessant games on both sides violate most people's sense of justice and fairness and therein lies the rub. Ultimately, people have a well developed intuitive sense of relative value because we as individuals make microeconomic tradeoffs every day. The nonsensical nature of the relative valuations in the marketplace is what is leading to the breakdown of trust and the incessant outflows of the market (institutional money may rotate from bonds, but retail will continue scale out, leaving whatever institution doesn't sell holding the bag....). The cult of equities is dying because the big boys choose short term trading profit over engendering the public trust, without which the financial markets will enter into sure secular decline (people will invest in homes, physical assets and local private companies... money will flow to where trust and tangible value resides). When the big boys decide to absorb some short term pain and let these scams die, then and only then will the financial markets regain the trust of the public and become healthy again. That is when money flow will return and the markets might have hope. to date, they haven't shown the willingness to do the right thing and realign valuations, so Sybs might prove right with his predictions for the S&amp;P.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1358041968007</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 20:52:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358043010000-125</Id><Topic><Title>a failure of the markets</Title><Username>johnalexgordon</Username><Timestamp>1358039592070</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 20:13:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's the world of the wolves.</Msg><Username>stock_lol</Username><Timestamp>1358043010000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 21:10:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358043030922-126</Id><Topic><Title>a failure of the markets</Title><Username>johnalexgordon</Username><Timestamp>1358039592070</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 20:13:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you make a lot of good points. i never made the connection between momo stocks being public facing. are you writing that the big boys are working together to take out dumb retail investors? that seems like a stretch. personally, i don't know the reason. i'm guessing that there is some positive feedback loop where the "winning" stocks just keep going up because they are winning... but, on the other hand, it seems weird all the buy recommendations that came out last week. these analyst are very smart. they have to know that the music will stop at some point.</Msg><Username>johnalexgordon</Username><Timestamp>1358043030922</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 21:10:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358043380174-127</Id><Title>Amazon has sell written all over it!</Title><Msg>It's so obvious!

They simply think out of it as getting out at the highest average price, which is accomplished by forcing weak shorts to eat what should be winners and weak longs to eat what should be winners. In the short term, it leads to higher trading profits and better fund performance. In the long term, it destroys the trust in the system. Everyone is trading on technicals, which is inherently self reinforcing and has badly distorted the market (and the collateral damage is that it leads to malinvestment in the corporate sector, thus lower real productivity growth thus lower LT employment and wages). The challenge is "how do you fix it"? Smaller institutions have neither the ability nor the incentive to change. It will only happen with Fido, CW, Vanguard, SS and others actually absorb short term risk and do the right thing... As to the analyst, those are sell side guys. Their job is to get you to buy the stock... I've said many times the best way to call their BS would be to make them allocate 25% (min) of their annual compensation across their coverage universe and make them unable to change a position without publicly first changing price target and recommendations. Not one of them would risk 25% of their annual comp (let alone their wealth) in BUYING Amazon at these levels to hold for 320 or 330. But, since they are recommending that others put somebody else's money at risk, it is easy to make those calls...</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1358045513255</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 21:51:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358045647460-133</Id><Topic><Title>100 pt Drop in a Second</Title><Username>stock_lol</Username><Timestamp>1358011922586</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 12:32:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I would not be surprised if this stock gapped down $50 at the open after the next earnings report. We know that the longs loaded up in anticipation of blockbuster holiday sales but it is very likely that the earnings results are going to be very disappointing based on what we heard from competitors like Target and Best Buy as well as the lower than expected internet sales figures from Comscore. AMZN stock is setting up exactly like GOOG did before their earnings report. Analysts were upgrading GOOG and telling investors to buy right before their poor earnings last quarter. Lots of pundits were saying "buy". GOOG had moved up about $50 in a short time time period just prior to earnings. I shorted GOOG prior to their last earnings report, but I sold a put at a lower strike because the premiums were too fat to ignore. I made a good return but not as much as I could have if I only shorted. Anyway, at some point AMZN is going to be taken to the woodshed like pretty much every MOMO stock over the past year.</Msg><Username>aapl1000</Username><Timestamp>1358045647460</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 21:54:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358045692624-134</Id><Topic><Title>"Again, you conflate short term price movement with fundamental economics" not al all: the trend has been up since 2000</Title><Username>nasdaq_6000_baby</Username><Timestamp>1358030012853</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 17:33:32 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Your first sentence says it all.
