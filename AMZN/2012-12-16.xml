(Frankly, there are plenty of converters to EPUB format already available, but it isn't an easy seemless experience yet). Once they do so, the playing field is level for all eBooks platforms. Tablet owners will shop and buy from whoever offers the best price because the content will be able to be viewed on any device, including legacy content. At that point, Amazon loses it advantage on eBooks and existing device share, not legacy ebook share, becomes the best predictor of platform dominance for self publishing. Amazon's monopoly WILL come under threat in the near future.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1355640466367</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 01:47:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355640889190-3</Id><Topic><Title>Time to address the "digital content" profit fable...</Title><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1355579451275</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-15 08:50:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Had Amazon not gone after Apple and Google's core businesses, they probably wouldn't have headed in that direction.

If you could cc: some of your substantive posts from this board on SA, maybe set up an instablog there, that would be helpful. I too find the yahoo board a pain to navigate after the redesign. Anyway, to add to this subject, "Digital Goods", the very stuff at which Amazon is supposed to be uber-dominant may turn out to be its Achilles heel and undermine its absolute dominance in the physical books segment notwithstanding it efforts to build all sorts of moats. Digitization of books is a net negative for Amazon as the logistics for eBook distribution is much easier than for the physical version where Amazon managed to smother its B&amp;M competitors by virtue of price, inventory depth and breadth, order fulfillment, payment processing and a great online platform for review and discovery. But with eBooks, an author/publisher (like JK Rowling has done) can with relative ease set up its own electronic distribution infrastructure and manage to reduce Amazon to a mere "affiliate" with a "commission model" which would be at a fraction of its present "distribution model"/ "agency model" revenue modus operandi. Independent book review sites, along the lines of Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango for movies, could easily substitute Amazon for reviews &amp; discovery. Amazon might be hoping to get in front of such developments with its own publishing imprint program and establish a moat with its proprietary format and AmazonPrime but it would be hard put to duplicate the dominance it achieved with physical books. And talking of censorship, there is growing awareness about this with respect to ebooks and that may prompt ebook buyers to look for agnostic alternatives to Amazon, Google, iBooks etc. This from an article on BusinessInsider last month "Why I Hate E-Books": "When you pay for an e-book, you haven't bought the book at all. You've bought a license, permission to read certain words in a certain order. It's a pretty one-sided deal. And just like a driver's license, it can be revoked. Consider what happened in July 2009 when Amazon remotely deleted George Orwell's 1984 from users' devicesâ€”yes, I'm not kidding, Amazon censored a seminal work about censorship..."</Msg><Username>krk_krk</Username><Timestamp>1355669263011</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 09:47:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355669502925-10</Id><Topic><Title>Bots are warming up for the sell program</Title><Username>ex.goldbug</Username><Timestamp>1355538067769</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-14 21:21:07 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Looks like the daveyw43 ("skiidady") the d'ckless clown loves the attention and wants more rebuke....he has masochistic side to his sick need for validation.

Most do not get it. Look back at my posts from Mid 2011 on NFLX. I pointed out the same fundamental strategic flaw for NFLX back then (have a Master in Engineering Management, so I am quite familiar with inventory optimization theory and practice) aggressive migrating from its structurally advantaged arena (due to tail inventory/retail space costs) to one where it held no long term distinctiveness. What no one realized (and I have yet to see anyone point out but my posts on the topic) was that RedBox forced the migration by disrupting NFLX's customer value proposition of its business model. NFLX crushed Blockbuster because it was fat, dumb and happy with very low GMROS (almost all rentals were new releases, yet floor space dominated by the tail). NFLX upended that. Then RedBox upended NFLX by putting kiosks with the most popular movies in strategic locations for the top 10% of titles (then added kiosks tactically to optimize returns by location). NFLX's value proposition was destroyed, but for a time customers paid just like unused health club memberships... Until NFLX had to raise prices because other streaming bidders were driving up content costs (thus value migrating to the content owners, as predicted, from distributors). Amazon is actually is a FAR worse position. The competitive set (Blockbuster) was incompetent. RedBox was well managed, but small with limited ability to scale the model (because of CapEx payback periods) rapidly, especially with streaming on the horizon limited the rate of disruption. In contrast, Amazon took out all of the easy competition long ago. Now, it is facing the toughest retail competition in the world (TGT, WMT, and COST -- ignore BBY as it is really only a distribution channel for selling warranty and service at this point...). Then, it arrogantly went after Apple and Google's core. No, they are fully warranted in turning the tables on Amazon. Any move by DOJ to stop either of them would have ZERO grounds (in fact, DOJ wen't after Apple for the opposite...). On the physical side, the math doesn't work and it going to get MUCH worse. Amazon has effectively created many selection biases that have altered the underlying customer base (much as NFLX did with its hybrid plans) and economics. Smart retailers can and will exploit the product/category TCO to essentially have Amazon be the source of choice for all product where its model is uneconomical... The price matching on high value density consumer electronics is just the start.. If you look at my posts on NFLX, GMCR, CMG, GOOG (which I nailed long when everyone was saying to get out as it dropped from 625 to 473) and AAPL, I've always stayed true to fundamental economic analysis augmented by a deep understanding of competitive strategy.
