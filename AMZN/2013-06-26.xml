Increasingly they were sold by weight while still in the ground, with only a promissory note to indicate details of the bulb including its weight at planting and when it would be lifted. .... The bulbs themselves, the delivery of which was months away were not sold, only these paper promises. ..... Tulips grown from seed could take five to ten years to produce the flower, those from offsets from three to five years to become flowering bulbs themselves. Because a tulip bulb might produce only one or two offsets a year and then only for several years before mother bulb itself died one with offsets when lifter obviously increased in value. But a grower could not afford to sell a particularly valuable bulb too soon. To do so would limit the ability to produce any more of that variety - which is why particularly desirable bulbs always were in short supply. ...... At the height of the tulip mania, most transactions didn't even involve the exchange of goods, but became highly speculative. ..... Any payments that were made usually were at the fraction of the original price, typically less than five percent. ..... The mania did affect the social contract of the community, and the reputation of men, their credit and honor. When the market was most frenzied, it was the seller who was expected to deliver the promised goods but who often failed to do so in hope of finding a better offer. .... After the crash, it was the buyer who defaulted refusing to repay the debt or even to attend the lifting, which was the only way to verify that the bulb was the one specified by the contract. ... The perceive beauty of the flowers themselves, no doubt, was altered as well.Tulips once appreciated for their aesthetic pleasures had become commodities to be sold by the florists who could NOT deliver them to buyers who could NOT pay for them.</Msg><Username>junkfood_pe</Username><Timestamp>1372220132428</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 00:15:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372220564116-2</Id><Title>Of course libor rate was fixed</Title><Msg>Big deal rates are fixed world wide by central banks.

The first getting out of this game will get the first mover advantage, the rest will be smoked. You can count on it, wages and jobs (the right kind) is the back bone of the economy, everything else is just a game played by shills. The international investors buying real estate here will also be smoked again (see the Japanese in the 80's and 90's).</Msg><Username>tung_5000</Username><Timestamp>1372286016369</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 18:33:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372286265746-116</Id><Topic><Title>I have a bad feeling about tomorrow . . .</Title><Username>geegenjar</Username><Timestamp>1372271724402</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 14:35:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And what insightful reason do you have to justify such a ridiculous move</Msg><Username>unfadeablexix</Username><Timestamp>1372286265746</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 18:37:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372287450962-117</Id><Topic><Title>I have a bad feeling about tomorrow . . .</Title><Username>geegenjar</Username><Timestamp>1372271724402</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 14:35:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You know how strong the resistance at 278 "felt" throughout the day.

The moral hazard that permeates the sector would have been wiped out. The right solution is to realize losses and write off bad debt (debt restructure rather than trying to "inflate it away" through monetary policy), but the banksters would feel the pain rather than everyone else, so the Fed will do whatever it can to preserve nominal asset prices via inflation. The Fed will fail because the distribution of wealth and income makes the tax on middle and lower class families from QE food/fuel inflation overwhelm the "wealth effect" for the majority of the population. And those are the folks with the highest marginal propensity to consume, which adversely affects aggregate demand. Absent record transfer payments that fall below the radar screens of most people, we'd already be in a far darker place. We are on the cusp of the greatest loss in confidence ever, simply because the gov't has let the Fed run the show and the Fed is ONLY looking out for its bankster owners.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1372301029970</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 22:43:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372301824358-132</Id><Topic><Title>KRE Regional Banks new Highs</Title><Username>gregbent</Username><Timestamp>1372268507564</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 13:41:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>i don't get it. why are u getting yourself worked up because of some brainwashed individual. most of the population has been brainwashed or plain dumb and what the difference anyway. no one is really seeing the iceberg - the government spending bubble on levels is coming shortly. at the cost of property owners, of course.</Msg><Username>junkfood_pe</Username><Timestamp>1372301824358</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 22:57:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372301839750-133</Id><Title>SHORTING AMAZON-IF AMAZON LOST 25 CENTS PER SHARE NEXT QUARTER GUESS WHAT THE PRICE WOULD BE?</Title><Msg>At least $275.00 per share- jeff bezos and american funds are prime market makers the other players are small potatoes. when is amazon going to pay a dividend to shareholders?</Msg><Username>smartybob569</Username><Timestamp>1372301839750</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 22:57:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372302830209-134</Id><Topic><Title>KRE Regional Banks new Highs</Title><Username>gregbent</Username><Timestamp>1372268507564</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 13:41:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Which is why I would only invest in real estate selectively, with an eye toward muni and state finances.

As long as value capture is structurally misaligned with value creation (via financial sector distortions), things will continue to get worse. We need real innovation (science based, particularly for energy) to increase efficiency and productivity.
