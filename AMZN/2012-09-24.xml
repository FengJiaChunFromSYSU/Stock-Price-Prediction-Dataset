I want to get some profits and use them to keep growing what I have. I don't really have a "horizon" (not sure what you mean by this), but I want to start now and just keep going. I'll try not to lose any money of course, however I know that'll be hard. I can afford to lose it all, but I don't want to add any more to my account for the next six months. Thanks in advance for any advice! ~Jenni</Msg><Username>sparkle.jenni</Username><Timestamp>1348459410609</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 00:03:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348460092672-2</Id><Topic><Title>New girl here...

There are 2 main camps here. There are bulls, who like Amazon, and there are bears who don't like Amazon. The bears like to "bet" that AMZN will go down, and it seems like they are trying to actually affect the price with their posts. It really is pathetic, no one will affect the price more than a penny. We bulls have all made good money. The bears point out that Amazon makes very little profit even though they have been in business 15 years. The fact is Amazon spends all their profit on new fulfillment centers and video content. The bears are frustrated and sometimes they show it.</Msg><Username>brucetheharmonicaguy</Username><Timestamp>1348460092672</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 00:14:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348465786707-3</Id><Topic><Title>New girl here...

Ok, to answer your question about spotting idiots, there are 2 camps on this board, bulls who like AMZN and think it's a good investment (such as myself), the bulls are people who actually own AMZN stock. Then there are bears, who think AMZN is priced too high and will fall. There are ways to "bet" that a stock will fall in price (such as "shorting" the stock or buying "puts"), and the bears, (also called shorts, while bulls are also called longs) use these techniques to bet that AMZN drops in price. Now, as you've realized, Amazon is a great company and you (and I) believe they have a great future. Some bears find and invent all kinds of crazy reasons that Amazon is not a good company, then call them Scamazon and such. But, as you know, they're not scamming, you order something, they send it, you can send it back, they're a good company. So they say it's over-priced, and by many measures it is. But, it's "over-priced" because it's a good company that people want to own part of. We bulls have done quite well, I bought at $136. Bears have done badly, and their frustration over-flows on this board. You asked "Do you think I should buy AMZN now?" I agree with everything David (disciplined_speculator) said. You said you have $2,500 that you want to increase for your future, but it's ok if you lose it all, and you think it will be hard not to lose money. It's easy not to lose money, just don't risk any. If you want a stock to "buy and hold", I agree that AMZN would be good, but not at this price. Do you want to be an "active trader", or do you just want to buy and look at it in 10 years? Active traders can do much better than "buy and hold" people. I first bought AMZN 3 years ago at $136. I sold some at $227, bought more at $180, sold more at $260, and I still have half my stock, but my average cost per share is minus $40. That means if it goes to zero, I've still made $40 per share for what I still own. It's fun and easy to do this, but you have to file income tax on it (unless it's in an IRA or something), and you have to spend time following it. It's a great hobby, and you could end up with a few bucks when you retire. I don't have a lot, but believe me, it's great to have a few bucks when you retire. Or you could buy a big house and rent out rooms to other gen-x people and have a positive cash flow, I don't know. If you want to "buy and hold", I'd urge you to be patient, because the lower you buy at, the more shares you can get. If you hold out for $250 you can get 10 shares, $225 you'll get 11. At your age, I don't think you really know what your investment needs are, you don't know how your life is going to play out. But still, I like AMZN for you, but wait for the right price. We'll tell you when it's a good time to buy. I was on this board ranting and raving last December when it was $180 / share.</Msg><Username>brucetheharmonicaguy</Username><Timestamp>1348465786707</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 01:49:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348466713200-4</Id><Topic><Title>New girl here...

You asked if now was a good time to buy AMZN and some of us are saying no, for lots of reasons. But you are on the right track. I think AMZN is a good long term stock to just buy and never sell. When you go to retire, you will receive more in dividends each year than you're total investment. I am 60 years old. When I was 25 a broker told me that the best time to buy is two years after the presidential election. I found this strange advice, but when I have followed it I have been rewarded, and when I didn't, I have been spanked, hard. This rule doesn't always work. In 1986 I kept waiting for stocks to drop and they just kept going up and up. So I waited while all my friends were getting rich. And then in Oct 1987 the market plunged. All my friends were poor and I was buying stocks at bargain prices. You will be rewarded for being patient.</Msg><Username>edison20</Username><Timestamp>1348466713200</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 02:05:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348467996308-5</Id><Topic><Title>Latest Barrons warns of high "Gann Crash" risk next week</Title><Username>ex.goldbug</Username><Timestamp>1348337340950</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 14:09:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Bad dog!</Msg><Username>ex.goldbug</Username><Timestamp>1348467996308</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 02:26:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348468055478-6</Id><Topic><Title>Latest Barrons warns of high "Gann Crash" risk next week</Title><Username>ex.goldbug</Username><Timestamp>1348337340950</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 14:09:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes.

Today NTWK is a much stronger company with far more revenue sources including new Cloud Divisions. Unlike 2010, NTWK today has the flexibility to deliver reliable software products and services not only from Pakistan but also from excellence centers located in Bangkok, Beijing, the US, and the UK. The float today is 1/10 of what it was then and 2013 revenues are expected to breakaway into the mid $40 million for the first time in company history. During 2010 (and 2007) NTWK's market cap reached over $100 million on 50% lower revenues of what is projected for 2013. During the September 4Q CC NTWK officials stated that revenues are expected to reach $100 Million in 2015 up significantly from the $38 Million reported in 2012. They also expect margins to continue to go up as the high-margin Cloud divisions keep continuing exponentially to revenues. MUST READ ……This Week’s Analysts Comments on Upgrade: We project 13% annual growth to FY14 from FY10 reflecting 80 significant NFS legacy customers in FY14, up from 52, 37, and 28 in FY12, FY11, and FY10, respectively. The new Vroozi Cloud Division contributed $1.3 million in FY12. We expect at least $4 million in FY13 and $6 million to FY14 Our price target is based on the average forward 2013 P/E multiple of 13.2X (up from 12.8X in August 2012). NTWK is trading at 6.4X our FY13 projections. We are forecasting EPS of $0.85 per share. We applied an 11X multiple to our FY13 EPS forecast. We anticipate a richer multiple as earnings momentum builds in FY13. The company guidance calls for $1/share net income in 2013. NTWK is entering FY13 with a $25 million backlog and approximately $100 million in qualified leads. One quarter of the backlog is from four new NFS platform customer implementations that began in 4Q12. In August 2011, NetSol launched its Cloud Vroozi Division, an e-procurement search tool for SAP supplier relationship management (SRM) users. SAP AG is a global vendor of enterprise management systems that has the largest market share (24%) based on a worldwide Gartner survey. Vroozi should provide sales diversification and a higher margin recurring revenue stream. The Vroozi division contributed $1.3 million in FY12 sales and is expected to grow to $4 million in revenues in 2013 NTWK announced its 2nd Cloud Division last week offering an array of products and services to capture a greater % of the cloud applications in North America. The company is implementing this division using their significant software development capabilities and infrastructure. === MORE NTWWK HIGHLIGHTS: - Company projects Doubling/Tripling revenues and net income by 2015 - Significant Institutional investor ownership and growing - Insiders bought over 5% of the Outstanding shares the last 2 years and never sold a single share - Total share count is only 7.5 million shares.

Hey, that's not very nice! I read your explanation of what "shorting" and "shorts" are, and they seem to be the opposite of me. I think AMZN will keep climbing, like you said you think too. I did a google search for what a "sock" is, connected to trading or the market, but I couldn't figure out what that meant... Something insulting I'm guessing, from your tone. However, you gave me such helpful information and advice! Wow, you spent time to help me, so thanks a bunch! :-D To answer your question: "Do you want to be an "active trader", or do you just want to buy and look at it in 10 years?" I am looking for some excitement, so I want to be an active trader. I'm not interested in just buying and holding, that's why I don't even want to wait until it falls to $220. That seems far away to me... I checked the "historical prices" and the last time it was $220 was Jul 26th! I see AMZN has been steadily climbing up since then. It seems to go up for a few days and then drop a little and then start going up again. That's the kind of exciting movement I'm looking for. But like everyone is saying, I better wait a little, huh? Before I jump in... OK, I'll keep waiting til you guys tell me it looks like a really good time to buy. Oh, I think it's kinda strange that people who work in the stock market are called by animal names! hahaha~ I'm from Cal, so I'd much rather be called a "bear" (cool and tough and beautiful) than a "bull" (stubborn, ugly animals), but there's nothing I can do about it... :-) I like the idea of buying a big house and renting out rooms!

Billionaire hedge fund manager Ray Dalio appeared on CNBC this morning and warned of potential social unrest and what it could mean. Dalio said (via BI): I don't know whether we're beyond the point of being able to successfully manage this. And I worry then about – social disruption. I worry about – another leg down in the economies – causing – social disruptions. Because deleveraging – can be very painful, it depends how they're managed. But when people – get at each other's throat, the rich and the poor and the left and the right and so on, and you have a basic breakdown,that becomes very threatening. And for example, Hitler came to power in 1933, which was the depth of the Great Depression because of the social tension between the factions. So I think it very much is dependent on how the people work this through together and worry about the social elements. This is not the only major player I have heard this from. There are others who believe the die is cast and that it will be near impossible to get out of the current environment without major unrest (in the U.S.), and once the unrest hits, it is unclear what will emerge.</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1348501312239</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 11:41:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348501513104-29</Id><Topic><Title>253.75 somewhat critical . . . again.</Title><Username>geegenjar</Username><Timestamp>1348500653030</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 11:30:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If shorts here can refrain from buying for a couple of hours, I should be able to buy AMZN calls cheap.

In an effort to keep most of your money and also make good sound solid growth, you probably want to go for a basket of goods such as a mutual fund or ETF. Look for ones that have a solid growth and invest a little each month that way you are not buying on the top or the bottom. So for example, let's say you find a mutual fund that sells for $100 a share, buy some now, and some later. The great thing about mutual funds is you can buy half shares. So for example if it goes down 50% the next time you buy another $100 worth you will be buying 2 shares. If it goes up to $150, the next time you buy, you will be buying 2/3 of a share. Individaul stocks are closer to gambling than baskets as most people get burned on them.</Msg><Username>jnwhigh</Username><Timestamp>1348501778830</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 11:49:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348501803018-32</Id><Topic><Title>253.75 somewhat critical . . . again.</Title><Username>geegenjar</Username><Timestamp>1348500653030</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 11:30:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nothing happening?

Operated activity was focused on the northern block of Evi during Q1, where LPR drilled eight wells in a single section. All eight wells are now on stream and initial rates indicate no signs of interference between wells. LPR has regulatory approval for up to 16 wells per section in certain sections at Evi and has plans to initiate a pilot of up to 12 wells per section in H2. Notwithstanding certain step-out wells that did not perform as expected, we believe LPR ultimately has the opportunity to double its current 500 well location inventory and surface up to ~$9/share. As well managements guidance For second half of 2012 was for 90$ wit with a differential of 12 meaning they only expected to receive 78$ a barrel for oil vs. The 100$ we are getting today. Wti at 92 Edmonton par wit premium of 7.50$ That is a big deal especially when oil accounts for 70% of rev. At current cap ex and prices we will be fc positive in q3 with 1 rig in evi, I suspect we will add back the second one and ramp up into 2013.....and if we sell off some ng acreage, then add more evi......look out ....this stock came public at the wrong time and forest shouldn't have dividended out the ownership....there is no short interest, no interest, completely unknown which is great for us in at these vast discounts.

But I will never buy another stock on the NYSE no matter how much I like it or think the future is bright! And please everyone if you think you will like a China stock on an American exchange, send them the proof and the statistics of how you will go nowhere but down for 2 or 3 years straight no matter how good of a company you are if you foolishly choose to list on the NYSE! Look at RENN, a brilliant CEO who went to Yale and his company is 9 companies in 1, one is better then groupon, the other better then znga, the other has faster growth and a brighter future then facebook with 5 billion newbies coming online in China right in the agegroup RENN has locked up with its social network, 11-29 But even after doing every single thing right, CHEN made one mistake so huge it trumped everything positive he has done the last 2 years. It does not matter that he recently added the richest man in the entire country of China to his board of directors! Does not matter the Triad mafia is rumored to want to run renn to 50, 30 in Oct alone. Chen has had all his buddies hold off buying till he is done with the buyback. Well he is done but the huge mistake Master Chen made in all his brilliance, he listed or was talked into listing a China ADR on the NYSE, notwithstanding that no China stock has ever had a bright future or run way up on the NYSE, but many have on the Nasdaq! As smart as he is Master Chen if he left this decision up to an employee under him and that person was stupid enough to think they would get the same odds of the future of the stock price as they would get on the Nasdaq,nope. You see on the NYSE, a real short squeeze gets halted where the crooked specialist lets all his friends cover before the stock goes higher, thus cutting the tremendous force pushing up by 4/5ths or 80% Also the specialist does what Goldman wants on the NYSE, this is illegall but Goldman placed their own guy as the CEO of the crooked subpar exchange NYSE. This means if the stock can withstand trading at 25,with not many sellers or buyers, 25 is where RENN wants to trade. One big guy can say I want 5 million shares or 10 million at 4 dollars and the specialist can force it right to 4 in a week or two. He can also keep it at 4 for as long as he wants and the only way he will move it is a massive force because he wants all the retail traders to sell so he can buy and then sell those same shares at 100 a share 6 months or a year, year in a half down the road. Also citi has a giant position to cover, the Triads and the Billionaire who has openly said he will not be happy as a shareholder until RENN has a minimum of a 100 Billion dollar market cap, they will help Citi to cover that position but the specialist in RENN is so buddy buddy he will make it as easy as he can on CITI, even if it means dumping all the shares he has greedily accumulated the last 2 years straight, chart is straight down with severe manipulation! If the FED was to pop RENN and DANG to 50 or 100 that would seriously stimulate the economy because dang 35 to 5 and RENN 28 to 4 are so tight, both with crooked specialists! Be careful here AMZN is about to drop like a rock either 150 or 200, these kindles are not going to sell if you ask me!
