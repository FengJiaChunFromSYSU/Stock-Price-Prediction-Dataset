You will want to SHORT az much of this pig stok on the monday AM before 10:30 EST az you possibly can. Its going in the TANK next week with the entire market, possibly even flash crash market circuit breaker shut down style.. Once you open a short position, immediately set a limit order to cover at the LOWEST price that your brokerage platform will allow under SEC rulez - typically 50% of the last trade price.... When the market collapsez, ckt breakerz will trip and then reopen multiple timez like a reclosure on on a power line. By the 2nd time of comming on line, your cover orderz will trip .... You must have your limit cover orderz preset because You will not be able to execute tradez manually, you will not be able to reach your broker - the flash crash comming will be worse than the phat phingured phlash crash of may 2010 and it will be given a new name and reason for the crash. During the hourz and dayz to follow the markets will "recover" in a setup for the big kahuna - it iz at this time you'll want to reopen covered sharez plus new sharez with the 'illgotten' gainz of covering a flash crash for the final, more permenent market drop... Do not set limit coverz, rather continue to add short az you gain margin gun powder on a controlled, but dramatic, drop of pigz into the teenz and lower. DO NOT USE OPTIONZ for they will not work, they will not be honored in the meyhem and they will fail to trade az they should. We have arrived - it iz time .</Msg><Username>sybil_rulez</Username><Timestamp>1376142995082</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-08-10 09:56:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1376144391871-7</Id><Title>bezos selling?</Title><Msg>Am I the only one concerned by $300 million + of selling by Bezos?

He had to sell hiz free sharez for 2 reasonz: 1. Just az ceo's and financierz across the globe cooridinated a coincidenral buy on march 9, 2009 with the guidance of unpublished meetingz in feb 2009 with the OB, the Cabinet, key senatorz, treasury, SEC , and the fed to 'save' the broken system and transfer the wealth of the many that were led to panic sell to the few that bought with implicit and explicit extraordinary backing of the US gvt, so too are they coordinating 4.5 yearz later the massive roping in of the public on a 'recovery' to UNFVCKINLOAD their stock for another MASSIVE wealth transfer....MANY if not ALL ceo'z of major publically traded companiez are DUMPING at this very time. Other financial institutionz and connected individualz that make their money by bringing companiez to the scam public markets VIA the IPO are slinging theze IPO's to the market az fast az they can get them out the door to unlock their illiquid private equity by converting it into sheeple public dollarz at 10 - 100x the real value of theze startups. 2. Bezos, one of the few beneficiariez of a broken system of publically traded markets, needed to raise cash by liquidating shareholder equity in a MASSIVE dump of free sharez to buy a media outlet with which he can keep hiz name clear along with justifying illgotten gainz of a ponzi scheme in an effort to protect himself from the madsez that will wont blood az this stock prints in the $teenz. With the strategic purchase of a politically centered post He can generate spin needed to control the massez and influence congressional, presidential, and gv't office head outcomez to cover hiz ars.</Msg><Username>sybil_rulez</Username><Timestamp>1376146366736</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-08-10 10:52:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1376149690872-10</Id><Topic><Title>BRK-B is like AMZN with 100% principal guarantee!!!!!!!!!!!!!</Title><Username>itmisc2006</Username><Timestamp>1376107934933</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-08-10 00:12:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"BRK-B is like AMZN with 100% principal guarantee!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
