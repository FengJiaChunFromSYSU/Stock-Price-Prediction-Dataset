Well, the retail business does have a great deal of value, but not what the stock price indicates. The primo valuation has been given to AMZN because of its "Cloud" business, which has grown rapidly and has the largest market share in the industry. This is a very high p/e business due to its growth rate and investor enthusiasm over the sector. AMZN's cloud business has not however helped much with AMZN's overall profits. Now, Microsoft has attacked this market with a vengeance and is taking away huge market shares. MSFT has already captured 25% share and analysts say that this figure is going to 35% pronto. This is a huge negative for AMZN and positive for MSFT. Look at the two stock prices. MSFT isn't going up because of its PC activities. Now AMZN will be losing its primo rating and valuation from the cloud sector. The retail business while growing does not provide much support for the share price. This story is unfolding rapidly, but like APPL and Samsung, it will take several months to full play out. Over that time, look for AMZN shares to take a beating.</Msg><Username>thedeathrace</Username><Timestamp>1367332682467</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 10:38:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367333011394-59</Id><Topic><Title>Did AMZN announce a stock buy back program?</Title><Username>notallowednukes2000</Username><Timestamp>1367332643640</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 10:37:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How can?

Have you ever seen a story that tells the details what those floor traders are actually doing all day long in precise details?</Msg><Username>samueldavid1234</Username><Timestamp>1367337438108</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 11:57:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367337713512-82</Id><Title>Suddenly, BBY is the best buy..</Title><Msg>me guess, AMZN is not making any shiat.</Msg><Username>osulinn</Username><Timestamp>1367337713512</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 12:01:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367337810750-83</Id><Topic><Title>Idiot shorts never made a dime shorting Amazon</Title><Username>ben_bertanked_me</Username><Timestamp>1367332200561</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 10:30:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm in shorted at $253.95, that's what you get for putting in a market order.</Msg><Username>zbc407</Username><Timestamp>1367337810750</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 12:03:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367337886818-84</Id><Title>was this the dead cat bounce that you were all waiting for, it seems</Title><Msg>we have already hit the high of the day and bar of a major nasdaq move up thanks to apple, this stock may have reached the highest value it is ever going to reach from this day on.</Msg><Username>ehsani97</Username><Timestamp>1367337886818</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 12:04:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367337979621-85</Id><Topic><Title>Let the word go forth</Title><Username>threepennyopera1066</Username><Timestamp>1367336336352</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 11:38:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>...and the rich get richer, and their complaints about the welfare state get richer still in mixed proportion of hypocracy...did you hear about the US Congress quietly reversing (quite recently) its much touted legislation (of last year) that prohibited members, and their staff, from profiting on inside information aquired in closed meetings and confidential documents.

It gets bid up because of the ARBITRARY decision to bid it up by those with enough money to make the price go up. Well, not completely arbitrary. There is some perceived self-interest on the part of the bidder upper. That is, such a person wants to prove the masses that one cannot expect a stock to go up due to fundamental rationale and analysis, and thus everyone needs to pay someone else with "mystical wisdom" to buy the "right stocks" for them at the "right time." That's it, period. That is what got the likes of the fundamentally bankrupt AMR bid up from $1/share to $40/share, even while oiil prices were soaring (and yes, AMR eventually went bk, but not before eliminating the "naysayers" by way of driving up the stock prices and squeezing out the naysayers first). Worse, the likes of NWAC got bid up from 50 cents/share to $6/share even AFTER it was already bk! Then there was GENI that got bid up from $5/sahre to $50/sahre, and almost never had a down day in two years, despite the fact that "everyone" on the GENI board was continually saying that the company was a scam. And on and on and on and on. It's all about the upbidders trying to prove to the masses that fundamentals do not mean anything, i.e. you cannot buy and short stocks based upon doing your own fundamental analysis, i.e. you need to pay a guru to do it for you.

Btw, you know MSFT owns Windows and SQL Server right? A large number of cloud servers do make use of, you got it, Windows and SQL Server.

Leading and losing money is simply you burning money to light a path for the competition to know how they can beat you. Yes, you have a certain customer base, but all key customers would have already planned to ensure their platform are cloud agonistic.

What do you think will happen to accrued liabilities (gift cards) if the economy really starts to weaken? Higher rather of redemption coupled with slower sales growth or negative sales growth. Increases in days payable and accrued liabilities provided almost $2.7B since Q1 2012. Despite that, Amazon had to raise $3B in Q4 2012 to avoid a real cash crunch (the offices only needed half of the raise...). There are so many glaring issues with Amazon's current economic model. I truly wish all the pumper analysts had to invest 25-50% of their wealth in scams like Amazon until they changed their rating to sell (at which it could be redeployed to a "buy"). There wouldn't be one buys rating on the Street at these prices. But, when playing with other people's money...

And I was taught to never judge someone else if you are not in their shoes.</Msg><Username>samueldavid1234</Username><Timestamp>1367372203769</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 21:36:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367373078267-155</Id><Topic><Title>Let the word go forth</Title><Username>threepennyopera1066</Username><Timestamp>1367336336352</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 11:38:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This stock is wounded, without a significant catalyst to boost it back above the 50 dma, it is only a matter of days before the big boys are well positioned to take it down.</Msg><Username>theinandoutcrowd</Username><Timestamp>1367373078267</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 21:51:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367373990397-156</Id><Topic><Title>S&amp;P painted an all time high just in time for May and the Fed Minutes come out, probably stating 'robust growth and a recovery in housing'</Title><Username>sybil_rulez</Username><Timestamp>1367370372475</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 21:06:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I don't think so I think markets will be strong in may an most of june an good time to short may be in july</Msg><Username>xdon69</Username><Timestamp>1367373990397</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 22:06:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367374612437-157</Id><Topic><Title>S&amp;P painted an all time high just in time for May and the Fed Minutes come out, probably stating 'robust growth and a recovery in housing'</Title><Username>sybil_rulez</Username><Timestamp>1367370372475</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 21:06:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"I don't think" Thank God.</Msg><Username>rickrude58</Username><Timestamp>1367374612437</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 22:16:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367374909001-158</Id><Topic><Title>Geegee iz such a fvck in retread</Title><Username>sybil_rulez</Username><Timestamp>1367355455676</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 16:57:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Do you read anything into those last few minutes?"
