Save it for our friends Nem, Nas6K and Geeg. Sybs, you did do some damage to your credibility calling for the hyperbola and then claiming to play the opposite. But, by and large, you are consistent in your message and approach. I warned you the were going to go after a correlated MOMO squeeze to get the last shorts before the breakdown. I suspect Sybs will be partially right. The GS DK trades are what is coming. The rules will change for those that have the power. All asset classes are a little bubbly, but financial assets will take the majority of the hit. Within that, the TBTF mafia will force most losses elsewhere. I encourage those of you who are seeing what is really happening in the markets to raise cash to invest in PRIVATE companies with IP/unique capabilities geared toward fundamental needs not going away. The Street will clean up its act when we start investing in ourselves and real productivity rather than trading scams and other value destroying activities.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1377367735495</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-08-24 14:08:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1377369955450-5</Id><Topic><Title>Those that laugh last, laugh the hardest of all fvck erz</Title><Username>sybil_rulez</Username><Timestamp>1377287020992</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-08-23 15:43:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nasdaq6000 seems to have gone away Tech.

"Winning judgments for intellectual property infringement can have big upside. Apple (AAPL) won a $1 billion judgement against Samsung in August 2012 for mobile phone IP. Vringo, Inc. (VRNG) took over $30 million and 3.5% royalties from Google Inc. (GOOG) for Internet search advertising. VirnetX Holding (VHC) was awarded a $368 million judgment against Apple for mobile phone IP and also won $106 million from Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) for virtual private-network technology. Just last month, Document Security Systems (DSS) took a hefty bite out of Novell, Inc. over an infrastructure software disagreement. Soon another patent fighter will enter the picture - Local Corporation (LOCM), an online media company connecting local businesses to customers through digital marketing with a network of 20,000 websites that reaches over 15 million viewers. A menu of its services includes business and product search functions, web-hosting, search engine optimization, social media, and mobile advertising." But one correction is necessary it this part of the article: Local Corp had 35 million Monthly Unidque visitor in the average of every month of this year, not only 15 million: About 22.5 million in the average on the flagshipsite and 12.5 million from the network.</Msg><Username>flankenking</Username><Timestamp>1377374029583</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-08-24 15:53:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1377386282053-10</Id><Title>Sybs gonna pimp cashback out to the mean streats of detriot to hook some 20 blowjobz</Title><Msg>60/40 cash, and you'll have a bed and some eats, but fall short of 500 bux and you'll get tge back side of a strong pimp hand.</Msg><Username>sybil_rulez</Username><Timestamp>1377386282053</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-08-24 19:18:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1377390550889-11</Id><Topic><Title>SHORT THIS PIG, STUPIDZ.</Title><Username>sybil_rulez</Username><Timestamp>1377284256691</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-08-23 14:57:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The FDIC is not going to protect anyone.

There'z enough leverage in derivativez no to make '87 look az sacremtonious az a cathlic church bingo parlor on a saturday afternoon. With the onset on levered etfs, the swaps, the cdo'z, and the endless push of option - weekleiz and minute by minute binary scamz, there simply isnt enough cabbage on the planet to cover theze bets... They will not be honored when the sheeeiot hits the fan...
