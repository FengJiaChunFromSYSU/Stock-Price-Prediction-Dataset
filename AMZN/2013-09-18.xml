It would not be possible wihout the easy money. And the Fed, whether right or wrong, seems not a least concerned with bubbles that it makes. In fact, many of the members have commented on the fact that they can't identify bubbles until after the fact, and then deal with them, which is complete BS in my opinion. They supply the "crack" that allow it all. Somewhere along the way the over the last few decades, the Fed stopped ever taking the punchbowl away from speculative excess builtup. In fact here, they appear to pull out even more ways , via QE balance sheet expansion( which is paper currency devaluation) in order to keep the punchbowl spiked. In fact, it shows that the Fed was created by JP Morgan types in 1913, in order to bail out /buffer the rich holding assets at the expense of anything else. Your argument of reaching a higher moral ground is one of failure up to now. There was absolutley no morality in how Geithner /Bernanke bailed out bad bets and continue to use the QE function to goose,in many cases, risk taking assets.</Msg><Username>buy_bubblestocks</Username><Timestamp>1379504247583</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-18 07:37:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379504847090-5</Id><Topic><Title>Techstrategy: let's be honest: the sepculative behavior you comment on all is possible b/c of the Fed's easy money</Title><Username>buy_bubblestocks</Username><Timestamp>1379504247583</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-18 07:37:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Fed is doing the bidding of its owners, not the public or taxpayer's interest, on that I agree.

You seem to always be a Fed apologist on this point. This isn't a new phenomena to this bull. It's happened in past instances as well. The market wouldn't be able to have such leverage speculation if the Fed, via Keynesian Crackonomics over the top, didn't act like a gambling parlor owner instead of a responsible Central Banks Institution. Even these weekly options instruments are born out of the fact that the Fed supplys the crack that allows them to be "born." I'll agree with you on the Fed merely being a pawn to it's masters, the banks and Wallstreet. Whatever the case, we're wll into, what I'm seeing, as the second biggerst asst bubble in the Nasdaq that I've ever seen. And it looks like it's about to go seriously parabolic. It certainly might here.</Msg><Username>buy_bubblestocks</Username><Timestamp>1379505601289</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-18 08:00:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379505736777-9</Id><Topic><Title>Techstrategy: let's be honest: the sepculative behavior you comment on all is possible b/c of the Fed's easy money</Title><Username>buy_bubblestocks</Username><Timestamp>1379504247583</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-18 07:37:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This is just the world's largest casino.

And IOS 7 rocks. AAPL should at least go back to $520's in the next 5 days, still 30% off the 52 week high $705. Then everything will sell off in October. But that is another story.</Msg><Username>blust35442</Username><Timestamp>1379549034042</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-18 20:03:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379549246775-148</Id><Topic><Title>Big money going into AAPL AH--Tomorrow AMZN will B sold off-everybody love IOS 7 and 5s</Title><Username>housedoctor66</Username><Timestamp>1379548774010</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-18 19:59:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Looks like a dead cat bounce to me.

I agree with your take. Its refreshing on these message boards. A nice break from people erroneously bashing one another. Between us neophytes on this board, ideally I think we shoud be banded together to go against the machinery that is WS and simply have caring and compassion for fellow investors/traders. Although, I did just read parts of Yogananda's book - that does tend to engender normal feelings towards fellow man.</Msg><Username>mairbooks123</Username><Timestamp>1379549486163</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-18 20:11:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1379552375580-150</Id><Topic><Title>SHORTS!!!!

Go away, and do everyone a favor of ridding your slimy self from therse boards. And the way, unlike your leverage nonsense trades, I'm not that short in AMZN again yet to have to cover , unlike your fake leverge trades you put up the last year here, fakely saying you make "coin". You're full of it and everyone knows it. Your probably work for some slimey brokerage house making copeis b/c you sure don't have a clue how to trade. You would have been broke b/c you never covered just levered up on one fake trade after another, and that was a year ago into some of the bigggest up moves in the stocks you shorted I've ever seen. So I know you are a fake. And then, you have the nerve to come here and try to give advice of what others should do, do yourself a favor, pull the flush lever, to flush your crap down the toilet.</Msg><Username>buy_bubblestocks</Username><Timestamp>1379552375580</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-18 20:59:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1379552492564-151</Id><Title>I Told You $310 by Friday . . .</Title><Msg>Now it's time to put some puts.
