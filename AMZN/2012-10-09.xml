They were "told" that because solid state drives consist of memory with far fewer mechanical, moving parts than hard disk drives, they will last forever. They got wiser and finding out that that ain't so. The memory used in these devices have limits as to how many times they can be written. Consumers have gone into a boycott. So many solid state drives manufacturers have been forced to slash prices (cutting in half) and they're still not moving well. These days, you can often find 240 GB solid state drives for about $120-130 on sale.

This is the 4th qtr mindset here? In other words, he's saying the bubbles will chased while selling the reasonable values , and widening the gap to more ludicrous levels. As far a GOOG, while it doesn't have a outlandish valuation, it's not cheap after a 200 point run from August, and Now get the Cramer stamp of aproval to the "masses." It's amazing how Cramer plays these RSI games over and over: what has been working keep buying games. Sometimes that method can run into trouble for him: like in year 2000 in recommending Nortel and other stocks that had outlandish valuations. He's throwing risk to the wind here with this timing. The market has for a very long shown no fear to the point where the players forget about what they are buying things at.</Msg><Username>party_bistro</Username><Timestamp>1349789647740</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 09:34:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349789794768-17</Id><Title>INTC $15 within 3 months.</Title><Msg>I see $12 in 2013.

The analysts , who all had AMZN earnings growing way past there, started to change their story that the downturn was due to "investing" in expansion. Now that puts into question the "capitalized items" of that expansion as most of those costs would be and should not have affected such a turndown in earnings. Never focused on. Never has mattered. Just the foward earnings growth here on an 82 cents lower base than the $2.53 peak. Thus, the 110 plus multiple on foward earnings and over 300 on backward.

It will absolutely decline in real terms. The Fed and global central bank put is simply trying to make it a steady and not destabilizing drop. I think they will have succeeded. Having said that, it is still uncertain as to whether the market will decline in nominal terms (although for the overwhelming majority of companies WS has been pushing people into are highly likely to decline in nominal terms as well). Certain companies, like INTC, are exceptionally well positioned to succeed and could skyrocket in the future in some relatively probable scenarios. Further, INTC has firm dividend support that will grow in nominal terms... 3) I've learned how "they" play the game and how to profit from it on different timescales.

I wasn't aware of the ability to short back in 2001, wish I did. But your wrong about all stocks. As the markets collapse, long only funds need to bury money somewhere. Preferably stocks that pay a dividend, has some growth and isn't losing 10% a week. Once they find those stocks other money that has to stay invested will pile into it. Kinda like how these growth stocks all become momo stocks because there are not enough growth stocks for all the Fed printed money. Shorting will probably be the way to go but if you want a hedge, a few good long stocks isn't a bad idea. Tech holding INTC from 22 to 44, would be like you shorting AMZN from 260 to 130. I think Tech hits his mark first...even in a down market. - PJ p.s. It could of been NASDAQ6000. At least Gee posts his trades real time.</Msg><Username>pjlouie13</Username><Timestamp>1349826321950</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 19:45:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349826904920-214</Id><Topic><Title>under 250 ?</Title><Username>rimm_dn</Username><Timestamp>1349811368473</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 15:36:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good luck to you as well.
