My point is that markets are not monolithic. Within any sector, some make money and some lose. It depends upon many things. Owning land in Detroit hasn't been a good thing. Owning it in North dakota has. You've torn into the idea of me investing in energy related companies, essentially calling it stupid and flawed, based upon a high level belief that energy markets have peaked (based upon fracking spreading). I'm not going to rehash, but there are many reasons to believe that certain forms of energy with continue to gain in nominal, of not real, terms while other assets classes get hammered. By the way, food is also energy dependent (much of the yield improvement has come from increasing energy intensity of production). And, for large part of the world, water will increasingly be as well... Happy to have you lecture me on options and trading. But, at the least, you should know by now I do my homework on fundamentals. Sure, if we have a collapse in financial assets, energy will get hit as it did in 2008. But unlike then, oil won't head into the 30's. All the tight oil players will be well before that...</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1381672185440</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-10-13 09:49:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1381673209742-8</Id><Title>Market was anticipating a deal in Congress</Title><Msg>With talks broken down, the market will put pressure on these guys to get one done by the deadline, Oct 17th.

And, despite what may seem to be the case, I am willing to change my point of view as the FUNDAMENTAL facts / unit economics change. Energy and bandwidth are rather different of course. One is necessary for survival. One is not. One has nearly monotonically increasing unit costs while the other has experienced exponentially decreasing unit cost. One is inherently digital while another analog. SInce you know 1 so well, you will well know if shape of the net increase in global production versus investment in production curve... You must also understand the wildly different cost structure for tight/oil fracking versus offshore/deep sea or artic production. And, of course, as Cash alluded to earlier, surely you have modeled the population (all those Baby Boomers not going away anytime soon) over time and net energy consumption per capita as a function of national wealth (cross sectional analysis to better predict international demand effects)... Lastly, I'm not investing in primary energy production Sybs. That's not where the opportunity lies... You are accurate in your assessment that I am focused on what should be not what is. I despise the markets as they currently function. Not only do they no longer add value, due to the incessant "pain trade" (all driven by HFT/algo scalping aided by infinite leverage of TBTF/PD/POMO) the market is constantly sending value destroying "market" signals. As Cash said in a prior post, I should trade more actively to make money. But, my primary focus in on trying to do things that CREATE value and capture a reasonable share of it, rather than capture value without creating any. That is my "mistake". When others too recognize that the way we change the system is too vote our values with our wallets (both as consumers and investors), the games will end. I am serious when I say that AAPL, GOOG, WMT, TGT and others should pull all business from any firm underwriter in AMZN's next offering.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1381678272166</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-10-13 11:31:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381679086020-14</Id><Topic><Title>Another Quote</Title><Username>come_on_jeffb</Username><Timestamp>1381676039201</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-10-13 10:53:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>FWIW, Google is MUCH better positioned to enter the Telecom space. Sybs refers to that bandwidth buildout that crashed. Google bought TONS of dark fiber for pennies on the $. It also bought MOT who has plenty of IP around whitespace management. When all the anti-trust attention turns to Amazon (and it is starting to get more interesting in Europe. AAPL will be arguing that the Koh perverted anti-trust law in her ruling as Amazon is the monopolist -- which is a reasonable POV. And, the new Jeff Bezos book account of the Quidsi deal should put everyone on alert to Amazon's true nature...), Google will be able to get more aggressive rolling out the balance of its strategy. Installed my Chromecast yesterday... Looks like Google will have a $35 top selling product into the holidays. Nice way to blunt Amazon Prime video (both by including Netflix while laying the groundwork for its own subscription service and maybe shopping delivery bundle). I'd like to see a Chromecast bundle for $79 with its own subscription (Google has plenty of resource to match or exceed AMZN's non exclusively licensed library) and free 2 day shipping. All the volume that it takes away from AMZN will hurt it big time this holiday season as it has massively ramped all fixed costs...</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1381679086020</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-10-13 11:44:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1381682156033-15</Id><Title>techstrategy: FWIW: you're a fool if you listen to a buttplug clown such as Sybil: no matter what</Title><Msg>just notice his posting the last few months: nothing but resorting to windblowing horsecrap, depending on what the markets did the day before: then miraculously making "bigging coin" on all of it.

If I was, I would be sending the analysis of what Amazon's model is doing to the revenue side of state pension funds across the board and highlighting that they are undermining their own sustainability by supporting a sales tax evader (which is why Amazon just built in Kenosha to serve Chicago and NJ to serve NY) and also enabling these games by putting money into financial institutions that are creating an artificially low cost of capital that enables an even more aggressively predatory loss leader model, which amplifies the adverse effect on their local tax bases as it causes businesses lacking access to Amazon's artificial cost of capital to lose sales and many to go out of business. The institutions are playing with OPM and using it against them... If the state pension funds got it and pulled funds from those institutions directly and indirectly enabling this scam, this scam would be done. Kaput. As I said, I'm focused on doing things that create real value. Trading doesn't. It redistributes that which has been created. I use Amazon as a lens to track the disconnect between underlying fundamentals and money/asset flows. And, I document things to test how my fundamental (not stock price related) predictions hold up versus what plays out because I am positioning for success in the real economy, not the financial one. You all can mock all you want. I'm playing for what comes next. I've been early and it has been painful. But, it is coming and I will be here to benefit when it does.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1381683549358</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-10-13 12:59:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1381683800139-18</Id><Title>An intelligent conversation with nasdaq6000 iz an impossibility</Title><Msg>You'd have a better chance at talking to hemeriod laden ars hole.</Msg><Username>sybil_rulez</Username><Timestamp>1381683800139</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-10-13 13:03:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381684607661-19</Id><Topic><Title>An intelligent conversation with nasdaq6000 iz an impossibility</Title><Username>sybil_rulez</Username><Timestamp>1381683800139</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-10-13 13:03:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>he has been this way since he bought (claims) at 240 and sold at 170.
