I've definitely felt massive pain. But, I am correct on the play that is being made. Rather than do the right thing and let the air out of the bubbles slowly, the TPTB further extended the imbalances. They are playing the infinite leverage game against everyone else who doesn't have access to it. Real investments have been taken down and scams inflated. Rebalancing has put more #$%$ into retail hands via passively traded index funds. But, all it does is setup for a MUCH worse correction. They've run the momentum scam market wide, so now the entire market will have a MOMO breakdown, though the huge short interest and low valuations in real investments will protect them. Scams like Amazon won't recover, even as the USD gradually loses its safe haven status (the only thing propping the markets up know is that Europe and Japan are worse...). The collateral damage will be trust in the financial markets -- what was left will be gone... The upside is the velocity of money will increase as people start to invest in real things and locally again rather than putting all of their "money" into JPM's (and other banks') excess reserve hedge fund...</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1365868385604</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-13 11:53:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365877554925-3</Id><Topic><Title>Sybil the random shorter.</Title><Username>geegenjar</Username><Timestamp>1358353735337</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 11:28:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sybs is a troll, I doubt if he/she/whatever trades.</Msg><Username>brucetheharmonicaguy</Username><Timestamp>1365877554925</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-13 14:25:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365877730318-4</Id><Topic><Title>How come they rarely ever bid up MY stocks?</Title><Username>samueldavid1234</Username><Timestamp>1365799196090</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-12 16:39:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Maybe your stocks are losers.</Msg><Username>brucetheharmonicaguy</Username><Timestamp>1365877730318</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-13 14:28:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365878181269-5</Id><Topic><Title>techstrategy's INTC position . . . so far . . .</Title><Username>geegenjar</Username><Timestamp>1349720938921</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 14:28:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Axiom.....
