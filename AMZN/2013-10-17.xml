Is this true. If it is, why are so many people buying the snake oil?" 'People' arent buying snake oil, robots are though az they are stuffed with other peoplez bernanke bux that lack moral hazard. They are doing this to wipe put the bandwaggon of shorts and kill the creak head optionz buyerz against bot priced premiumz. This will continue az long az bernanke continuez to manufacture bernanke bux with endless easing. By doing so, bernanke freez up 'bank' (prop trading desk) capital to drive up bit coin and grow big beautiful tulips. 'Banks' have decided that farming tulip bulbz while underwriting risky bond debt at rediculously low interest rates to guyz like bezos and hastingz iz a better business than spending it in a real economy, because the real economy iz actually very leveraged and very weak and will be so 'for an extended period of time'. Hopefully this answerz your question. Please note that this doez not mean that amzn or any other flying pig will tank 'today' or 'tomorrow', so 'timing' such a bet with crack head put optionz or 3x margin leverage shorts will make you insolvant long before your bet iz found to be correct. The markets will tank and the flying pigz will eventually rain down from the sky with enormous SPLATS to the ground, but only when the bandwaggon of shorts haz been murdered and NOBODY iz looking or positioned for a crash.</Msg><Username>sybil_rulez</Username><Timestamp>1382009623438</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-10-17 07:33:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1382010582932-7</Id><Title>A message to the bandwaggon of shorts and crack head put buyerz:</Title><Msg>Pig stox are going to FLY into december az they defy imagination and logic.

The game the CBs must play to is try to accomplish relative revaluation in a stable way. But, they cannot because "investment" funds are no longer acting like investors. They are selling premium and letting traders control everything. Works until is breaks and then it fails catastrophically, this time likely in a systemic fashion if investors do not start acting like investors again...</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1382026155583</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-10-17 12:09:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382026468252-41</Id><Topic><Title>The DOW will be up 80 today.</Title><Username>geegenjar</Username><Timestamp>1382022565884</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-10-17 11:09:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Nas and SP500 are rallying, the Dow is not a good indicator.</Msg><Username>pruinvstr</Username><Timestamp>1382026468252</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-10-17 12:14:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382026596671-42</Id><Topic><Title>Will Amazon ever make a profit again?</Title><Username>all_one_poster</Username><Timestamp>1382021014639</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-10-17 10:43:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'll likely explain more this weekend.

AMZN has achieved almost 80% of it's rise on thin market trades, either pre or post market. Let's see tomorrow if GOOG news holds for AMZN.
