Amazon. It spent $960 million (part of a $2BB buyback program) to buyback 5.3 million shares in 1Q12 The previous quarter, 4Q11, it spent $277 million buying back 1.5 million shares. And the share count? Essentially flat at about 450 million. The buyback program might be a sign of the difficulty in getting the market to soak up the unrelenting supply of newly vested stock being flipped else suffer its price cratering when its unmanipulated market clearing price ends up at a fraction of its present one. Something like a central bank's sterilization operation. The big whale institutions seem to be already loaded to their eyeballs with this crap scrip and aren't biting anymore if you look at their net holdings which have been almost flat to actually some unwinding &amp; deck chair shuffling while the float has been creeping up. The way the price has been spiked by I suspect circular trading amongst the cartel on fiction metrics is perhaps a desperate attempt to sucker in bystander investors and ease the logjam.</Msg><Username>krk_krk</Username><Timestamp>1344172411000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 09:13:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344175475000-6</Id><Topic><Title>Amazon Might Not Be the Growth Engine Investors Think</Title><Username>Younessi</Username><Timestamp>1344080480000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 07:41:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>excerpts and comments: "Amazon's earnings are expected to total 83 cents a share this year, rising to $2.47 next year and $4.60 in 2014. " what's amazing and consistent in the "walking down" of earnings by analysts is that the numbers above were already supporsed to be attained in the last earnings cycle. Maybe not with the stock price, something already went wrong and ironed over by the support network. Of course, these forecasts could prove conservative. Suppose the highest 2014 estimate on the Street today, $8.03 a share from Mr. Kirjner, turns into the consensus estimate over the next two years. For today's stockholders to enjoy a 10% year.." $8.03 by 2014? really? still a 30 multiple but you gotta doubt making higher numbers when they couldn't make lower ones in the last earnings cycle. Meanwhile, you made billionaires more over of the insiders on the back of Bernanke easy money. Maybe somewhere in that, lies a problem with America.</Msg><Username>party_bistro</Username><Timestamp>1344175475000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 10:04:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344175559000-7</Id><Topic><Title>Amazon Might Not Be the Growth Engine Investors Think</Title><Username>Younessi</Username><Timestamp>1344080480000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 07:41:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>not lost on the balance sheet composition.</Msg><Username>party_bistro</Username><Timestamp>1344175559000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 10:05:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344177055000-8</Id><Topic><Title>Believe</Title><Username>ashienjus430</Username><Timestamp>1344167423000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 07:50:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>great trading tool</Msg><Username>sigmundnht747</Username><Timestamp>1344177055000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 10:30:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344177877000-9</Id><Topic><Title>Believe</Title><Username>ashienjus430</Username><Timestamp>1344167423000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 07:50:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>spammer.</Msg><Username>gguybbycc</Username><Timestamp>1344177877000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 10:44:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344180906000-10</Id><Topic><Title>This is interesting</Title><Username>joannanvg384</Username><Timestamp>1344176356000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 10:19:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Clear videos</Msg><Username>sarinanlc944</Username><Timestamp>1344180906000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 11:35:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344186005000-11</Id><Topic><Title>Amazon Might Not Be the Growth Engine Investors Think</Title><Username>Younessi</Username><Timestamp>1344080480000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 07:41:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Between the end of this year and next, a bunch of sales tax laws from the States will kick in and some shoppers have indicated that they will turn else where. Starting with CA in Sept 15. It will be the trend and eventually all states will be doing this. Amazon's edge is about to end and I for one shop at Amazon due to not paying sales tax. Sometimes buying items that I don't need. Now I will likely cut back on my purchases or go to Ebay and buy my items from the mom and pop shops there. It's a draw situation for states like California as it's local affiliates will be loosing sales to offset the increase in sales tax revenue while is a losing situation for Amazon. The issues have already started since last July so it's not exactly news. While the news have been partially priced in, my feeling is that the tide will likely change if the next earning report or two would reflect the lost in revenues and earnings. Ebay will probably be the winner in this ordeal. Amazon and Chipotle (more so) will be great short prospect in the near future.</Msg><Username>tung_5000</Username><Timestamp>1344186005000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 13:00:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344191249000-12</Id><Title>Riccaro Money Flow Quotient repeats strong buy on AMZN.</Title><Msg>Based on inflows of new monies and positive technical analysis.</Msg><Username>rbg5r</Username><Timestamp>1344191249000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 14:27:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344199682000-13</Id><Topic><Title>Amazon Might Not Be the Growth Engine Investors Think</Title><Username>Younessi</Username><Timestamp>1344080480000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 07:41:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Who cares?

Right now a major theme seems to be profit taking on a pop and I want to see if I can do OK at that play in my IRA, where as you point out there is no other good way to play the downside. Right now I have an "ultra pro" (2X) ETF for small caps -- ticker SDD. It was down 5.19% Friday with the rally before I got in. Just looking for a swing trade and will take it if it gives back half of Fridays gain at any time next week. AMZN is a good stock for swing trades now and I was in and out last week and could have done a couple more trips if I was watching closely and pulled the trigger.</Msg><Username>go_ahead_make_my_bed</Username><Timestamp>1344207824000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 19:03:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344209758000-16</Id><Title>Technical Analysis on AMZN</Title><Msg>AMZN could be in a rising channel, with resistance at 246 and 251 before slow stochastics get overbought.

I didn't know they were buying back the shares that the insiders and the institutional investors were selling. Why don't they just give their employees a raise instead of playing this options game? So essentially, AMZN is manipulating its own share price while the cash supply is falling and the earnings are shrinking.
