Amazon can payoff all debts and still have plenty of cash left. Reiteration, my point was Amazon borrowed money for investments, not for its operating expenses (THAT IS A VERY GOOD THING). Also, marketable securities was $3,759M and interest incomes from it would offset some of interest expenses. Tax avoidance? If you think Amazon is illegally evading taxes, please report them to the IRS. Depreciation is a non-cash item and already paid for via CapEx.

I can tell this, my career is in FP&amp;A (financial planning and analysis). I do understand a lot about financials. Whatever message shorts are trying to convey, it will not fool me. From what I am seeing, It will not fool many people. If you are really an investor, I am sorry I do not share your sentiment on Amazon. From the financials and other sources (information is out there, all you need is to search and read it), all I see is Amazon management is position the company to take it to the next level (this could be a painful journey for shorts). Time will tell. Granted, P&amp;L needs improvement and there are plenty of room to improve. Balance sheet and statement of cash flows look great.

Obviously you did not look at 10K/10Q to get the answer you seek. As of June 30, 2013 Cash and marketable securities balance was $7,463M Debts balance was $3,042M Why are you worry about Amazon debts--it is for investments. Amazon can payoff all debts and still have plenty of cash left ($4.4B left). 2) "Where are those operating cash flows coming from?" Certainly not from printing money. This is their earned incomes from operating activities in cash basis. Yes timing may be off by a quarter, but if you look at past 5 years (2008 through 2012), cash inflows were $1.7B, $3.3B, $3.5B, $3.9B and $4.2B. What is not to like about it? P&amp;L did not reflect that because on non-cash items. We all can speculate future cash flows differently. From what I am seeing and hearing from different sources, Amazon is position itself to take the business to the next level. How it fare out, only time will tell. Expansion of Lab126... Rumor of new products (set-top box, android console and regular/3D/Kindle smartphones)... Filed trademark application for name "Firetube", possibly for a set-top box...

You seem to be the only one on this board I can have a productive discussion with. 1) "...event of a sudden shock to sales would be a tail risk..." I complete agree with you. As of June 30, 2013, current ratio of 1.1 indicated Amazon has ability to payback it's current obligations. Acid-test ratio of 0.7 indicated Amazon cannot pay it's current obligations. Amazon is somewhat dependent on inventory. It is not unusual and is understandable, since Amazon is a retail business. Yes, it could be a problem for Amazon if there is sudden shock to sales. It could happen any time soon because of government shutdown. If that "sales shock" happened, it is because of the market (which is uncontrollable and all business is impacted by it), and not of Amazon business model (which is controllable). The shutdown will be short-lived, otherwise both parties has to answer to the American people, as well as international partners. 2) I understand that current cash inflows is not up to your expectation, but it is not at a level that warrant for anybody to say that Amazon is doom to fail. Amazon can improve it significant by increasing products margin--that is pure gravy for Amazon. 1% increment to product margin will add about $500M to operating income. Anyway, good luck with your endeavors.

It has a negative cash conversion cycle, where it cillect before paying, but if sales actually drop, cash outflows can/will exceed inflows (redemption of gift cards, unearned revenue that does not generate cash will increase as a share of total). In a shock, the value of the inventory drops significantly. It is not liquid, would either be liquidated or Amazon needs another offering.

I agree with you. Amazon is dependent on inventory to meet it current obligations as it clearly shown in the acid-test ratio of 0.7. It also understandable too, because Amazon is a retail business with hugh inventory. For past 5 years or more, did Amazon have such issues described in your post, especially all of the market fluctuations and storms happened during that period? No. I am not saying that it will never happen. The risk you were describing is an inherent risk of that any retail business, especially with hugh inventory. I am sure that risk is known to Amazon management. If payable was a problem or a potential problem, why would Amazon repurchased common stock ($960M in 2012, $277 in 2011). Amazon can improve cash balance by increasing product margin (current margin is about 12%, which is low and unhealthy). 1% increment to product margin will increase operating income by $0.5B. Let's us speculate on the outlooks. To me, it is very interesting and it could be turning events in a year or so for Amazon to be at higher level in terms of market capital. We all know that Amazon is expanding its R&amp;D (Lab126), hence many new products will be introduced. Amazon is aiming to capture other market shares (but with what?). We are not just talking about products revenue, but also services revenue (an unexpected one). I am waiting to see how it unfold in a year or so. Clues are out there.
