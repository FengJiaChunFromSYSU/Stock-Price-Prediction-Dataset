That is one thousand trillion dollars! The entire GDP of the planet is estimated at $66 trillion dollars. And somehow, in the infinite wisdom of Congress in 2008, we falsely and naively believed that a $750 billion transfer of wealth (i.e., Bailout #1) was magically going to save the economy and the collective futures of the American middle class. In short, the debt created by futures speculation is approximately 16 times greater than the sum total of the entire wealth on the planet! And we think we are going to climb out of this? Let’s take a moment and discuss the derivatives debt. When George W. Bush left office, a gallon of gas was $1.57 per gallon. The rapid increase in the price of fuel during the years since Obama took office is a goldman sachs us treasurygood example of the destructive nature of the derivatives market. Most of the price gouging which resulted in unprecedented increases in gas prices, and record oil company profits, was due to speculation in futures market especially by Goldman Sachs which just happens to be former Treasury Secretary’s Henry Paulson’s old company. Paulson told Congress in 2008 that if they did not acquiesce and fund Wall Street, there would be blood in the streets and martial law would have to be declared. Congress had their hand on the chicken switch and allowed the US Treasury to be raped by these criminal bankers. Today, the derivatives market is again collapsing, despite unlimited rounds of bailouts (we presently are on QE Unlimited). Derivatives are not anything of tangible value such as stocks, bonds, etc. They represent the ultimate illegal money game in which paper derived from other paper, such as futures and options, has served to bolster the balance sheets on Wall Street. Futures and options are exchange traded derivatives, but the largest group of derivatives is not even traded on the exchanges. These are called “counterparty derivatives” and consist of such financial entities as mortgage backed securities and credit default swaps. And as a reminder, the Federal Reserve is printing $40 billion dollars each and every month to purchase mortgage backed securities. Why? Because after the collapse they want to own hard, tangible assets, not useless cash. This action, alone, tells you that the bankers are saying that the American economy has hit an iceberg and is sinking fast. The Federal Reserve is metaphorically purchasing all the life boats and are leaving the rest of us to drown. "One Quadrillion Dollars" “One Quadrillion Dollars” As I previously stated, it is estimated that the total derivative exposure of the financial system is between one quadrillion and one and a half quadrillion. A quadrillion is 1,000 trillion dollars and it has largely collapsed. What does not get widely reported is that each one of these derivatives transactions required the underwriting of a bank with a high credit rating. This house of cards effectively collapsed the banks who are living on borrowed time along with bail-outs and cash infusion from the Federal Reserve and the outright theft in such debacles as the MERS mortgage fraud, the MF Global theft, and of course the $40 billion dollars being spent each month on mortgage backed securities</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1381842398948</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-15 09:06:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1381843342776-5</Id><Title>Singh iz out at the curb shouting death and destruction at people while geegee panhandlez for hiz next crack fix</Title><Msg>They are out early after a nights stay in the dumpster behind taco bell.</Msg><Username>sybil_rulez</Username><Timestamp>1381843342776</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-15 09:22:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1381843529217-6</Id><Title>Relax, shorts.

The result was anger, confusion and sometimes, outright panic, as shoppers left their full shopping carts in stores, and departed their favorite general retailer in a daze. However, while most outlets that accepted EBT were experiencing a one-day, non-recurring hit to their EPS, several Walmart stores in Louisiana decided to brave through the Xerox-induced blackout for several hours by eliminating the spending caps on EBT cards, leading to nothing short of shopping stampedes. The result, as CBS reports, is that "Walmart and local police in Springhill and Mansfield ... were called into the stores to help maintain order Saturday as shoppers swept through the aisles at two stores and bought as much as they could carry." CBS explains: Walmart workers phoned their corporate headquarters to ask how they should handle all the shoppers with unlimited, government-funded spending limits, and were told to keep the registers ringing. "We did make the decision to continue to accept EBT cards during the outage so that they could get food for their families," Walmart representative Kayla Whaling told KSLA. She added that Walmart was, "fully engaged and monitoring the situation and transactions during the outage." Shoppers gave mixed reactions to the incident, with one man in the Springhill store told KSLA it was simply "human reaction" to stock-up when given the opportunity. Shopper Stan Garcia was more critical of the unscrupulous shoppers, however, saying that taking advantage of the brief glitch in the benefits system amounted to "plain theft. That's stealing, that's all I got to say about it." The police disagreed: Police spokesmen in both locations told KSLA that no arrests were made during the spending sprees. After all, why arrest when all the public is doing is taking advantage of government generosity taken to its logical extreme: unlimited spending cards funding by either other taxpayers or America's creditors, the largest of which is now the Federal Reserve. Isn't that what the Fed enables Congress to do on a daily basis anyway? Naturally, once the glitch was fixed, the stampede quickly ended: Amateur video taken on shoppers' cell phones shows dozens of shopping carts, piled high with merchandise, abandoned in the aisles of one Walmart after the announcement was made that EBT cards were once again showing accurate spending limits. There's that. Or perhaps it was all just a test run for what will happen when the Fed</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1381859413421</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-15 13:50:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381859463247-27</Id><Topic><Title>YES LION BROADCASTING IS RAORING "RIOTS IN USA WILL UNFOLD IN 2014 NEXT" FRAUD STREET CASINO WILL GO UP IN FLAMES</Title><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1381859413421</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-15 13:50:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>USA 99% HAS TO HANG HOME GROWN FINANCIAL AL QAEDA LED BY BANKTER TERRORIST: We're Witnessing One Of The Greatest Failed Experiments In Economic History - It All Ends In The Collapse Of The Dollar USA 99% HAS TO HANG HOME GROWN FINANCIAL AL QAEDA LED BY BANKTER TERRORIST: We're Witnessing One Of The Greatest Failed Experiments In Economic History - It All Ends In The Collapse Of The Dollar HIGH TREASON CRIMINALS RULERS HAVE SOLD USA 99% LIKE SHEEPLE TO BE SLAUGHTERED IN BANKSTERS SLAUGHTER HOUSE</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1381859463247</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-15 13:51:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1381859515782-28</Id><Title>Stox dont know if they're comming or going and neither doez the useless streaming media flow</Title><Msg>Sybil haz seen and heard newz flow across the board in the last day: "Stox rally on debt resolution talks" "Stox flat on indecisive debt talks "Stox drop on failed debt talks" What an absolutely STUPID endlessly circular newz cycle.</Msg><Username>sybil_rulez</Username><Timestamp>1381859515782</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-15 13:51:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381859526419-29</Id><Topic><Title>YES LION BROADCASTING IS RAORING "RIOTS IN USA WILL UNFOLD IN 2014 NEXT" FRAUD STREET CASINO WILL GO UP IN FLAMES</Title><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1381859413421</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-15 13:50:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>LION BROADCASTING PREDICTS BANKSTERS WILL BE CHASED AND HANGED BY ANGRY MOBS ALL OVER THE PLANET INN 2014 For a brief moment, Obama and his banker bosses met the world and the world punched Obama in the mouth.

The gold pain trade, designed to attack speculative gold longs using asymmetric infinite leverage, instead played into the hands of our creditors (export nations) and enabled them to accumulate much more gold much more rapidly. While our "Investment Funds" generated a lot of paper gains by playing float jam scams like this one, our nation's creditors (ex-Japan, which is hosed itself...) were accumulating gold. The gold will remain when the confidence game fails, the hypothetical market caps of scams like this will evaporate in a nanosecond.
