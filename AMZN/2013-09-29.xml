The more populous states are collecting sale taxes from Scamazon. But Ebay's customers still enjoy tax-fee shopping. Ebay is usually the lowest price leader when it comes to small purchases that are less than $300.</Msg><Username>nje457</Username><Timestamp>1380473389743</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-29 12:49:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380474423719-28</Id><Topic><Title>Lackluster new book reader sales</Title><Username>rocketman2001ab</Username><Timestamp>1380451227145</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-29 06:40:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I was looking for advertisement for the new kindle book reader and I could find none in best buy or hh greg ad</Msg><Username>rocketman2001ab</Username><Timestamp>1380474423719</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-29 13:07:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380474624571-29</Id><Topic><Title>Bounce off the 50dsma for the majorz</Title><Username>sybil_rulez</Username><Timestamp>1380473041782</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-29 12:44:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>i certify u are plain stupid</Msg><Username>cashback_7</Username><Timestamp>1380474624571</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-29 13:10:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1380475951810-30</Id><Topic><Title>complete nonsense from you again Sybil: you give reasons why short will be killed as Fed continuing printing</Title><Username>buy_bubblestocks</Username><Timestamp>1380460977022</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-29 09:22:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sybil is annoying but the truth is Amazon, Netflix, Linkdin, etc. all have the same charts; skyrocketing price and dropping volume.

They all get to report great returns for the year which brings in even more money.

About to read Faber's latest via ZeroHedge, but the lead in suggests he's seeing EXACTLY what I am. The entire financial sector is the bubble. It creates very little value these days (because it is all trading of liquid assets rather than investing in productive ones), yet captures quite a lot. It should have shrunk several times before this, but WS managed to shift (because regulators/DOJ/politicians failed to do the right thing) the pain elsewhere via bailout and QE (which is simply giving the banks the money first, where they benefit from the Cantillon effect) to the middle and lower classes and the elderly (no return on savings). The financial sector has become too large to continue its parasitic ways (capturing vastly more than it creates) without killing the host (stable society). Gee, NAS, Nem and all of them can talk all the smack they want. There's only 1 path out of this and that involves a realignment of value to that which is actually productive. Doesn't matter whether it happens through deflation or inflation. The future belongs to those who create it, not to those trying to inhibit it.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1380505766342</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-09-29 21:49:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1380507603156-42</Id><Title>Wouldn't it be nice to actually have a market that would Correct.</Title><Msg>And not this pinned up JOKE of a Freak show this country has led for over 6yrs and counting all due to Obumer and the DEMONcrats.
