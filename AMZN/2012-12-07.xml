They have held Amzn down and back for 3 or 4 days, they will let it go today, any new shorts will see what the Amazon longs mean by steamrolled. The Amazon Pe will soon need to be refigured as Amazon makes more money then it ever has in so many new Areas, the Kindle, they are selling more then even Amazon thought they could or would, they have closer to 11-17% of tablet share now. And more and more Amazon is stepping on both Apples and Googles toes. Also same dollar amount of sales in Goog and AAPL were being changed immediately into the same dollar amount of AMZN shares bought, both hedge funds and mutual funds were doing this,then retail traders started copying, I expect more of the same today, if you want to see proof as the whole world knows it is a lock that Amazon takes out its 52 week high possibly today but next week for sure. Just watch a goog quote box right next to an amzn and aapl and you will see the proof after you add up what the share amounts add up to dollar wise. AMZN market cap is cheap if you compare it to GOOG and AAPL market caps.</Msg><Username>nanotechmillionaire</Username><Timestamp>1354890675530</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 09:31:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354890999614-19</Id><Topic><Title>New Short here</Title><Username>sunlandscapesva</Username><Timestamp>1354888576063</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 08:56:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm not long but think I can provide the long case in a nutshell.

The apps going crazy for Amazon is a big hint that they sold a chitload of Kindle Fires because they had the perfect pricing point and parents loved how you could block all the bad stuff from kids. Bezos is smart and now Goog and AAPL don't get mentioned without Amazon also being mentioned and usually its to the effect of an Amazon is right up on Apples or right up on Googs #$%$! I keep trying to help the newbies, the reason the Jan 300's 310's 315's and 320's have not been moved up hardly at all while all the other calls go up everyday is because the market maker is going to move them up all like ten cents or 15 cents and take them from all the sellers and then move them up a great deal as we bust right through our 52 week high! All somebody has to do is by say the 300 or 310 315 320 and in just a few days they will triple their money, they will all be a dollar a piece as we get into January and get closer to Amazons 314 target price from the pros. Also you can expect a gap up of 40 points which puts AMZN at around 350 after Jan 31st earnings. When AMZN moves, it is everyone buying at once and Hedge Funds, Mutual Funds, and Institutions fighting over share with Financial advisors, daytraders, retail longs and swing traders fighting with overseas buyers!</Msg><Username>dramatic_move_up</Username><Timestamp>1354892089983</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 09:54:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354892260574-29</Id><Title>So much for that 'rally'.

AMZN will be between 295-314 by Jan 15th and 340-350 after the gap up Feb 1st following the largest sales # ever in the history of AMZN, the most Kindles sold, most content, most intems, deliverys, all records. Pe's will be adjusted. Perhaps a level I can reach you on is that less then 2% of the Amazon float is short, for a pe this high that is simply incredible. Amazon has decided to take up to 30% of Ebays business, (that means they will do it and you should add ebay puts to your Amazon calls. I have read their model and plan to lure auction sellers and private sellers for cheaper and put them in two categories and reward the best ones with low interest Amazon loans, it is simply brilliant. As brilliant as they dominate cloud that #$%$ off google something large, the way they sell tablets much to apples resentment, the way they sell movies, games much to Netflix's curiosity, the way they sell products that effect Wal Marts and Targets bottom line and how their pricing causes Wal Mart and Target much hassle. The market has long forgotten to care about Amazons pe and sees them raise 3 billion for the 1st time in over 10 years and competitors fear what Amazon will do next The way Amazon notices a new place for easy profits and for them to dominate, wouldn't you fear them? I mean they attack you with stealth and you don't know you were attacked till you read the story on yahoo or see the press release about Amazon and your company and how Amazon has decided to jump into the area you considered your specialty, that was until Amazon decided to make it Amazons specialty.</Msg><Username>namfong43</Username><Timestamp>1354920270246</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 17:44:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354920627686-139</Id><Topic><Title>Watch what happens when capital gains selling hits</Title><Username>ex.goldbug</Username><Timestamp>1354910334501</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 14:58:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>On "fastmoney" options today, they agreed, saying the cap gains selling in Apple could shift to Amazon next week. 20% down or more.</Msg><Username>bob.bull99</Username><Timestamp>1354920627686</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 17:50:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354920930539-140</Id><Title>Amazon--Easy come, easy go--capital gains will be taken</Title><Msg>Certainly no dividend support to keep people from selling, and not enough money for a meaningful special.

Listening to Fast Money, they want in AMZN as much as they can get of it, they are just trying to make some sellers so they can be big buyers, GOOG and AAPL sold off big today as did pcln, AMZN did not sell off, also 2 different guys said to short AMZN and the other just said to sell it. No way it is this close to its 52 week high and does not smash right thru it. Also I short but would never short AMZN, all this stock does is collect shorts by making the stock look like it is fizzling out, they do this by holding it back a few days at the same price or 50 cents down a day but then all the sudden it is up 5 then 10 or 12. AMZN is due for one of its up 10 or 12 days and anybody shorting here is just helping to propel it higher and sooner then it normally would have gotten their. The new Amazon move to take Ebay customers is a new cash cow for Amazon, they have a lot of new cash cows starting to click and Amazons cloud gets more and more popular each week and month growing faster and faster. AMZN is going to be 300 or higher the 1st week of January, why would it stop at its 52 week high? The incline is not as steep as last time and much more solid and stronger. The capital gains selling in AAPl is tremendous because the gains have been also. Amazon is a different situation because Amazon is up lately and the new buyers are here to stay until at least after earnings January 31st.</Msg><Username>interactivebrokerssucks20soon</Username><Timestamp>1354922064988</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 18:14:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354922959437-142</Id><Topic><Title>Amazon--Easy come, easy go--capital gains will be taken</Title><Username>bob.bull99</Username><Timestamp>1354920930539</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 17:55:30 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>They are wrong, this is the best quarter for Amazon and any capital gains sellers who sell in 2012 would immediately buy Amazon back Jan 31st. Goldman and a few more Hedge Funds want some weight in Amazon but no weight is available without pushing the stock up. It is perfectly normal for Amazon to not do that much the 1st 3 quarters of the year and then for the stock to go bonkers or way up from NOV, DEC, and January, Jan 31st is earnings but this earnings will be the best ever with black friday online sales up 25% and Cyber Monday up 35-40% for online sales. Kindle sales are going nuts, apps up 500%,content sales up like crazy, six times the kindles sold as last year. Since Amazon has been in existence, they never had sales #'s like this quarter will be, Wall Street is going to flip when they see the sales and revenue #'s, selling wine, diapers, everything that nobody feels like going to the store for and all those new Amazon prime memberships, tons of them.</Msg><Username>gruen7</Username><Timestamp>1354922959437</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 18:29:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354924096615-143</Id><Topic><Title>Watch what happens when capital gains selling hits</Title><Username>ex.goldbug</Username><Timestamp>1354910334501</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 14:58:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wow, what a rambling bunch of utter garbage......please place the gun in your mouth and cleanse the earth of your profound stupidity.</Msg><Username>panichomo2</Username><Timestamp>1354924096615</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 18:48:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354924197873-144</Id><Topic><Title>Cloud = Bubble</Title><Username>bezosghost</Username><Timestamp>1354896311076</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 11:05:11 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Between all the posters the hedge funds have posting to try to get the ones not sure about Amazon to sell and all the longs that are not just long but adding weekly and trying to seem like shorts that are here bashing non stop, they know that if they can get people to sell, the hedge funds and market makers will buy those shares and move the stock price up The more bashers show up on this board with new id's, the better for the true longs and that much higher this stock is going. AMZN is going much higher then its previous 52 week high, remember it did that before it had 3 billion cash extra at almost a zero interest rate, air conditioners going into its distribution centers and awesome new prime real estate as well as several cash makers firing on all cylinders as Amazon keeps invading competitors comfort spaces, if Amazon sees a place to make cash, it doesn't matter who you are they are going to step on your toes. Just ask google, ebay,apple,wal mart, netflix,coinstar,overstock, online wine sellers, best buy, and anybody else Amazon slaps around on a weekly basis.</Msg><Username>crvin31</Username><Timestamp>1354924197873</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 18:49:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354927079086-145</Id><Title>Geezuz chryst - paid pumperz just came crawling the fvck outta nowhere</Title><Msg>Bunchez of strong buy idiots never seen before to pumpidity pump pump the every last fvckin dime fmr, llc can ring otta this pig before letting it go to the slaughter house....

That's why I always anchor on fundamentals and maintain long positions -- to #$%$ relative valuations and the sustainability of a move. I don't know if it is next week or next month, but Amazon's underlying economics are hosed. The Tech Titans led by Google (many of the senior execs are ex-McKinsey people, so I know how they think and have been able to predict its competitive responses pretty accurately) are going to inflict a LOT of pain on the "digital" side of Amazon. Google can beat Amazon on prices on everything cloud and Amazon will feel asymmetric pain (how are those AWS revenues going to look YOY with a 25% price cut and new competitors from all sides cutting into market share?). On the physical goods side, WMT and TGT are simply more efficient for many product categories. Amazon is literally destroying shareholder value daily with its excessive expansion and lack of focus. Books had a very different TCO. High end electronics had high value density (although price matching in retail and the collection of taxes has eliminated the consumer value proposition), but that play is largely saturated. Amazon has created selection biases all over the place (via stacked loss leaders) that will prove to be its undoing... I know you think I write too much, but I do it to help good investors who are short this stock to maintain perspective through the behavioral investing squeezes. Suffice it to say that I will be adding to my position should this continue to trend up next week. If there were any justice in this world, we'd wake up Monday morning with this back below the 200DMA at 220 and see margin calls all over the place for the speculative longs. The institutional longs seem to be afraid to do the right thing and just let these bubbles burst, but it would be the best thing for the market and for them long term. Until they let these so, capital will not come back into the market... Have a good weekend Sybs.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1354938833565</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 22:53:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
