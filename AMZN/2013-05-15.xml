As one writer had written that may hit an all time high right before they go bankrupt. The only thing I can say is that does have a chance to succeed but I think the odds are more against them with increasing content costs, the likelihood they will hit a wall in terms of adding subs and current negative free cash flow and thus fake real earnings (accounting gimmickry). They would need to add subs consistently and would need a better revenue model or the ability to increase costs without subs bailing.</Msg><Username>hapihammer</Username><Timestamp>1368626246725</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 09:57:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368626429273-14</Id><Topic><Title>Action: Sell Short</Title><Username>sybil_rulez</Username><Timestamp>1368625557841</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 09:45:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hapi, This iz a gift short from the very trading godz....

Really this is more of a farce of course. Ex items they made a plug NICKEL and NEGATIVE FREE CASH FLOW of $42M Pro Bull Case would be dependent on: - They show they can consistently increase subs well above the 30M level. - They show that they have pricing power by increasing subs costs several dollars without losing an offsetting number of subs. - They can decrease content costs going forward. - Making money doesn't matter. Stocks can run up for years hiding losses, taking more debt on off balance sheet, etc. I'm somewhat being sarcastic here but not totally. If supported by the right crooks, anything's possible. Pro Bear Case: - Valuation, priced for perfection assuming everything goes according to plan and then some. - Most pay cable channels have had trouble getting beyond the 30M domestic subs level. CEO Hastings long term plan has the most conservative long term number at something like 54M subs. Although Netflix has a cheaper monthly cost to the consumer than HBO, this seems like a stretch. - Content costs will increase and not decrease. - Whitney Tilson says $400/sub is cheap when cell phone companies are more like $1000/sub. This is an idiotic statement since a sub can't be valued the same way obviously from industry to industry. A cheap cell phone plan is close to $50/mo vs $8/mo for Netflix. The average cell phone bill is undoubtedly higher Just using back of the envelope math here, a Netflix sub would be worth $160, no where near $400. - Netflix best money maker is the DVD business which is a negative growth area with lots of competition. - More and more companies joining the same space so pricing power will be limited at best. - TIMBER action will most likely happen at some point soon. In an ironic twist House of Cards is what be what they are talking about after this latest collapse, tying the show to this real life house of cards.</Msg><Username>hapihammer</Username><Timestamp>1368628766419</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 10:39:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368628786330-27</Id><Title>Sybs not sad, just curious az to why geegee iz posting hiz nonsense after he said</Title><Msg>"If she doesn't test even $297.21 within the next several days, I will stop posting here."

The anti-fundamental trade hit a feverish pitch today that smacked of desperation... AAPL shorts are stacking up... They even brought out some jacka$$ today who said AAPL should be at $240 (humorous given its cash position) based upon ROIC analysis (gotta love it when analysts are penalizing companies that deliver high ROIC by investing only in truly strategic assets and capabilities rather than taking Amazon's approach of investing in redundant distribution infrastructure in a manner that does not materially change the cost to serve). Anti-AAPL, anti-gold, anti-intc... non stop propaganda from CNBC and other financial media sources to bash anything that looks like a reasonable valuation on fundamentals. Cheerleading for what are unquestionably trading scams (like Tepper, there are a lot of people who have to get out of these scams while the getting is good...). The AAPL/AMZN divergence is back up to record levels... All it takes is one enterprising fund to literally dominate performance and crush everyone else's in one fell swoop.

It looks to me at this point that it be gold that leads to the systemic crisis because the FED and TBTF/SIFI/BB continue to try to break it down when trust in those institutions is GONE.The games taking place right now demonstrate why no one trusts the financial sector anymore, making gold an essential asset in the portfolio. Physical demand is not abating and will not abate. We've already seen technical defaults in gold (settlement with paper rather than bullion). It will get worse... There will either by significant defaults on contracts, or there will be a reversal and parabolic ascent. Just wait here. The real economy is not strong. Amazon will see its gift card redemptions accelerate and its average order size/shipment decrease, especially amongst "Discount/Value Prime" (the new cohort which is joining Prime based upon multiple stacked loss leader versus "High Value / High Purchasing Power Prime" which joined because they would save money on large volumes of purchases).

I'm sure this will do wonder for the future stock market in the US. The first world has been living beyond their means and on the back of the third world for much of modern history that many third worlds countries are starting to wise up and starting to form their own alliances and trade blocs i.e. BRIGS. Non stop QE can only bring the demise of the dollar as the reserve currency faster as people trust in FIAT are beginning to fade. The FED knows this. However, they are but an instrument for the Federal government and the big banks. In the end, it is fitting that their own greed for compensation and year end bonuses will destroy the system that gave them all this wealth destroying their own elitist status in the process. Some smarter elitists will survive and maybe part of the new global governance experiment. This could happen even with no conspiracy theory due to the product of globalization.</Msg><Username>tung_5000</Username><Timestamp>1368655111626</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 17:58:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368655561978-83</Id><Topic><Title>Wait for $220 for next support...WMT warning not good</Title><Username>shares245</Username><Timestamp>1360978173779</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 20:29:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>264.50 was not enough to drive this monster to 260 and lower.

This thing will either be propped up a while longer or will go the route of Apple or worse. Since it's too big, there is no place to unload anywhere so I'll go with the propping option as long as the market keep reaching new highs. it will be okay as long as the insiders doesn't sale en masse. Since hitting almost $250 in 2011, it has gone practically no where in the next two years while the market is at an all time high. It's a sign that institutions are holding a dog but can't liquidate without serious losses so the extend and pretend will have to go a while longer when the revenue is still growing 20%+ . My guess is when growth drop to the teens, they will run for the exits even faster than Apple especially with no earnings to show for. We maybe a quarter or two away from this scenario if the current economic conditions show no signs of improving or getting worse.

Check out the growth in days payable. Between increase in days payable and increase in gift cards, Amazon's has inflated its cash by about $2.7B. Should the economy materially weaken (especially if we did have a shock), the unwind of that $2,7B would be rather difficult right now (pushing current ratio below 1...). If all the gift cards / accrued liabilities were to be redeemed, Amazon would need to have a distressed offering... And all this despite raising $3B in LT debt in Q4 (which puts debt to book equity at industry norms). This scam is running out of cash to perpetuate itself...
