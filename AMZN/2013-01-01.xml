She'll be wiped out with AMZN this year, though. She hasn't made a penny since November 14 last year shorting AMZN. She's been getting deeper and deeper into a trap and she doesn't know it. She's totally clueless.</Msg><Username>geegenjar</Username><Timestamp>1357087065071</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-01 19:37:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357092042014-6</Id><Title>Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Hey Sybs</Title><Msg>Sybs, I think the big boys think like you do. They keep playing their option games with one eye on the bond market. The minute it starts and the music stops there will be a massive rush for chairs. It WILL be fast. Any guess at what causes the domino effects? You would think buyers would be drying up by now but they keep scooping them up.....I don't get it. - PJ p.s. SAM off the table for now. Need gun powder for NFLX and CMG, can't believe those 2 are flying north again.</Msg><Username>pjlouie13</Username><Timestamp>1357092042014</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-01 21:00:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357095806037-7</Id><Topic><Title>Does Sybil really have millions of dollars in short positions?</Title><Username>beauty.seeker32</Username><Timestamp>1357013789477</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-31 23:16:29 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Geegee crawlz out of hiz bomb shelter with a cup of koolaid in one hand while beating hiz meat with the other.
