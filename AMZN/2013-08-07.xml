Even without the expansion, Amazon was going to be forced to collect taxes because it has gotten so large, where smaller and specialized players will not draw the attention of state governments. So, if it doesn't pass, many online competitors will enjoy the same tax subsidy vis a vis Amazon as it had versus brick and mortar. That will have a huge impact on big ticket, high value density items (saving 10% tax on $1K purchase) and leave Amazon with low value added, low density items (which incidentally is why Prime's selection bias is a tail event waiting to happen as well).</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1375879169318</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-08-07 08:39:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1375880243884-12</Id><Topic><Title>AMZN CFO and VP also are dumping shares</Title><Username>ling.chen</Username><Timestamp>1375747317035</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-08-05 20:01:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Best Buy has been doing well over the last year, that means Amazon's business model avoiding sales taxes is unwinding as more and more states catch on to how many $$$ they're losing and how many bricks n' mortar stores and employees Bozos is putting out of business</Msg><Username>slotsrfixed</Username><Timestamp>1375880243884</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-08-07 08:57:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1375880945735-13</Id><Title>You will mis the biggest move ever on a stock (SEEK)</Title><Msg>facts</Msg><Username>ricardoriicurr</Username><Timestamp>1375880945735</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-08-07 09:09:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1375881141509-14</Id><Title>Not one downgrade after earnings.......</Title><Msg>Guess people thought the earnings release and forecast were positive for the company!</Msg><Username>getalife443</Username><Timestamp>1375881141509</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-08-07 09:12:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1375881768287-15</Id><Topic><Title>Longs look to aapl to see the future 700 to 380 in the blink of an eye</Title><Username>ditzil</Username><Timestamp>1375833524976</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-08-06 19:58:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I beg to differ.

The market severely punished them for this." First off, the market for one stock is not the same for another. Apple attracts a different type of investor. And the way the CEO manages expectations is different. Apple's shareholders were conditioned to be short-term oriented partly due to Moore's Law and product cycle and partly because their advantage in one product cycle was always short-lived it was easy for others (Samsung, etc.) to copy enough of what Apple did in innovation to render them close to generic in the next cycle without true innovation. Expectations for continuous innovation were too high. They failed to meet those expectations. Without Jobs this does not come as a great surprise to some. Amazon has managed expectations in a different way with a much longer runway and large investment cycles of several years rather than 18 months. "the market has ignored a model that has no proven record of earnings in favor of trusting that as revenue increases earnings will follow." Actually, they do have a good record but if you are short-term oriented then you haven't been around long enough to be able to discern the pattern. See my next reply to nanobrain techstrategy for the details on this.</Msg><Username>nemesis_editor_2007</Username><Timestamp>1375886946020</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-08-07 10:49:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1375887061451-35</Id><Title>bezos = leftykwr</Title><Msg>Fox busted the skumbag last nite, said he was a bigtime oskumbo supporter.

DNDN in 2009 went 4 to 25 after earnings, then trapped the whole world in seconds from 37 to 4....Let that sink in to how many are stuck and imagine over 3 years of Hedge Funds loading, then picture bets like this going on. Somebody just whacked at ask 50 Jan 2014 20 calls, that is about as risky bet as you can make options wise, unless you have followed Dendreon over the years, you know really followed it, they really have some bright staff indeed, and the market respects them, they do not hype dndn stock ever or complain as the hedge funds manipulate it and treat it like a stepchild but when they explode it and its do, all Dendreon friends and family must buy in cause 25 will be here soon. Remember they watch to see how Mr. Wall Street reacts and then Kaboom! Then they all buy on margin, smart people who say have 5 or 10 grand to play with can buy 4 times that on margin, if they are really smart they have set a margin buy at like 5.05 because 5.00 to 5.04 is gone in a half second if you want weight or size. Good Luck, I have 5500 sh DNDN and 3000 MAKO robotic surgical, NamFong has about 5 times that amount in DNDN and 10 times that in Mako....I'm good yet still I follow Fong everytime watch the weight on the bid grow in dndn the rest of the day, that is a big hint when bid is 300 or 3000, ask only 50 or 200.... If Biotech was not where all the hot money is rotating to,(just following the hedge funds lead) I would say biotechs with proven success and future profit like say MAKO also at 700 million insulting cap, both could be taken to 45 3 weeks after they open at 25!</Msg><Username>dramatic_move_up</Username><Timestamp>1375897570777</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-08-07 13:46:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1375898508848-54</Id><Title>AMZN web site still broken?</Title><Msg>I notice some areas of the web site are still down...are they upgrading again or are there more serious problems?

You will see this if you examine the previous two cycles prior to this one, but of course since it won't fit conveniently into the template you've devised to prop up your position with, I suspect you will not bother with this exercise. Amazon has the benefit of the largest richest data set from hundreds of millions of online shoppers on which to base its forecasts. I'd suggest Santos would understand what they were planning for and why so much capacity needed to be put in place at such a pace.

Not one spec of substance. Give me something, anything other than name calling and silly posts. How many more times do you think Amazon's earnings will be revised down for 2013 and 2014 and where do you think they will actually end up. I have no idea except I'm fairly sure they will be lower than the current estimates. When will it matter? I don't know when but eventually it will. My portfolio is more long than short so don't worry about me. Worry about your portfolio if you can't even tell me why you are long. What's your investment thesis here? Is it that the stock always goes up? Do you care about fundamentals? What fundamentals are you concentrating on here? Did you read the articles from Timothy Phillips and Paulo Santos?

If we head into recession, then it will have locked in massive fixed costs into an environment of contraction. Couple that with the impact of gift cards and working capital changes and you have a recipe for disaster. 2) Blindly looking at similarities with previous "cycles" is a classic affirmation bias. There are a great many material difference in the macro/global context. Operating cash flow margin should be increasing and not increasing if your claims were true... It isn't. Here's the "awesome" performance on that metric: 2012 6.84% 2011 8.12% 2010 10.22% 2009 13.44% 2008 8.85% 2007 9.47% 2006 6.55% 2005 8.63% 2004 8.18% 2003 7.45% On a TTM basis, it is 6.77%, which is very close to decade lows. In 2013, it is negative and AMZN will need a MASSIVE Q4 for it to be positive for the year. Impartial readers will find that the operating cash flow margin tracks much more closely with my analysis than your "investment cycle" BS. The reason is that Amazon is RESPONDING to the changing cost structure that has moved against its business model (based upon fundamental economics) and is trying to reduce the disadvantage over time...</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1375914328106</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-08-07 18:25:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1375914425764-86</Id><Topic><Title>Must be agonizing for AMZN shorts to watch.......</Title><Username>getalife443</Username><Timestamp>1375895817249</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-08-07 13:16:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sounds about right once_on, , i.e. forget about the numbers, fundamentals smundamentals, i.e. again, pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.</Msg><Username>hapihammer</Username><Timestamp>1375914425764</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-08-07 18:27:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1375915208312-87</Id><Title>To the dreamers</Title><Msg>When they take out 295 on the close this thing is in for a large relentless slide to below 200 over the next 3 months.</Msg><Username>penystoc</Username><Timestamp>1375915208312</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-08-07 18:40:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1375921432865-88</Id><Topic><Title>Must be agonizing for AMZN shorts to watch.......</Title><Username>getalife443</Username><Timestamp>1375895817249</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-08-07 13:16:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>once.....you losing your shirt too like hammer?</Msg><Username>getalife443</Username><Timestamp>1375921432865</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-08-07 20:23:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1375923864464-89</Id><Topic><Title>Must be agonizing for AMZN shorts to watch.......</Title><Username>getalife443</Username><Timestamp>1375895817249</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-08-07 13:16:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Another stellar post from the new board moron getalife443.
