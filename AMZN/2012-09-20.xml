But his much I've figured out. Amazon built the Kindle Fire to keep their name name out in front. Otherwise the Kindle just becomes another app on the Apple iPad and eventually loses to Apple's marketing. Amazon is building local distribution centers because it adds real value for resellers. Any business can set up a web site and ship things from their warehouse (and avoid sales tax). Amazon's future isn't in competing with their resellers but in offering them a service that adds value. As long as overall sales increase, paying sales tax becomes a necessary evil. A national sales tax would benefit Amazon. Side topic: CMG. Earlier this year I said the time to short CMG was when the 100 and 200 day moving averages have crossed and the stock has rebounded 50%. The magic number is $360. CMG is currently at $345 and the rebound is tampering off. Higher food prices and more competition don't hurt. But the real reason to short CMG is it's a long way down to $80 from $360. The other restaurant stocks havent risen as much, so they have less to fall.</Msg><Username>edison20</Username><Timestamp>1348134070551</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 05:41:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348137623982-4</Id><Topic><Title>Why Amazon Did Not Go Local Before 2012</Title><Username>nemesis_editor_2007</Username><Timestamp>1348092867540</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 18:14:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You are clueless about retailer balance sheets. If AP etc. were such a big deal Walmart would have gone out of business ages ago. As for Apple and Google suddenly swapping their DNA and eschewing super fat margins so they can get into content price wars that just ain't gonna happen. If that were a viable option Apple would have never colluded and broken the law in their price fixing scam. Nobody uses Google for buying content. Google is a search engine period. They don't/can't do anything else, they don't have the competence to do anything else. Amazon bet the farm? Where have you been? Perpetual cycles of cash building up and growth spending are what they have been about since Day 1. This did not start with the current expansion cycle. You have obviously not done your homework adequately. That's the history of Amazon, the most aggressive investor in company growth in the history of modern corporations. That's why the multiple is always so much higher than other companies. Investors like growth; they award companies that just sit on their cash (Apple) very, very lower multiples, much to the frustration of many shorts who are just the kinds of suckers who invest in the Apples and Googles and complain about why their multiples are so, so low.</Msg><Username>nemesis_editor_2007</Username><Timestamp>1348137623982</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 06:40:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348137911037-5</Id><Topic><Title>AMZN not a SELL until its PE exceeds 1000!</Title><Username>ershon911</Username><Timestamp>1348107515565</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 22:18:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>when Market starts to drop.

So what? Why is that the measure of anything. If you have less opportunity or are constrained by a conservative board then you simply spend less, and grow less. Isn't "fantastic" a little over the top for mid-single digit margins, btw? "amzn 's margin is horrible during their expansion" No kidding. This joker thinks that when you spend aggressively somehow you're supposed have high margins at the same time. The one has nothing, absolutely nothing to do with the other. The purpose of the spending is not to generate high current margins, it is to generate huge profits once those investments mature, much greater than if you'd simply sat on all that cash and done little or nothing with it. "the stock is priced on phantom margins." A common misunderstanding of the blundering shorts who shorted from $230 and lower. The presuppose that people price stocks according to past margins cherry picked by shorts. But when investors value the company on the sum of ALL its future cash flows, then suddenly it is "phantom". Too bad, for shorts, that the market has never, ever for any prolonged period of time agreed with the former and much, much more often priced the company according to the latter.</Msg><Username>nemesis_editor_2007</Username><Timestamp>1348138150133</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 06:49:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348138602230-7</Id><Topic><Title>Amazon Buyers ARE THAT STUPID</Title><Username>basicknowledge</Username><Timestamp>1348076850652</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 13:47:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Fund Managers won't care about the money where they put into.

I guess analysts realize that X% of the consumers will actually buy the device on the spot and Best Buy will make some profit off of that, so no need to ask anything. Especially since the accessories like cases and stuff come with steep margins for Best Buy, too. "Cannot imagine it will be too long before others realize that they can make money selling tablets that do not enable their competitors..." iPads enable all of Best Buy's competitors just the same. Last time I heard it was one of the favorite things iPad users do with their tablet. Long onto Amazon and shop till they drop. I guess this way Best Buy understands that millions of people have no interest in iPads and just want Kindle Fire so they can make a little bit of a profit on those few Fires they do sell. If Best Buy really wanted to stop enabling competitors they would just stop selling PCs and cell phones all together. I mean you how hard is it for you to get to Amazon's site from any of those devices?</Msg><Username>nemesis_editor_2007</Username><Timestamp>1348157569499</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 12:12:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348157671995-61</Id><Title>Shorts, are you sad?</Title><Msg>She just doesn't go down, huh?

The fundamentals are screaming SELL, SELL, SELL to them but they are deaf, ignoring the great danger. Most of the patsies (AMZN bulls) here are so infatuated with this stock that likely they will continue to believe the story (hype), encouraged by new "buy" recommendations put out by managers fading the rally (I've seen this all before) and ride this stock all the way down to where they bought it, probably adding losing positions encouraged to do so by some clown on CNBC (so-called "buying on weakness") thus guaranteeing them a huge loss as well. The cascading downfall in the price of this stock is going to be a site to behold. It is the classic internet bubble stock ALL OVER AGAIN. Watch the charts then when it is falling 10-20 points every minute, for what will seem an eternity to aforesaid "bulls" while mutual fund managers scurry like cockroaches looking to push the sell button.</Msg><Username>ershon911</Username><Timestamp>1348158358315</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 12:25:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348158483466-70</Id><Topic><Title>Shorts, are you sad?</Title><Username>geegenjar</Username><Timestamp>1348157671995</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 12:14:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>...just watch.</Msg><Username>ershon911</Username><Timestamp>1348158483466</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 12:28:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348158672709-71</Id><Topic><Title>Shorts, are you sad?</Title><Username>geegenjar</Username><Timestamp>1348157671995</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 12:14:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm game, shorted at $262.50 but will stop out at $261.50 if it climbs back.

Can’t Post Here…. NTWK is poised to stage a significant breakout any day now.....today's mini breakout is just one more white candle on a beautiful upward trend === Most Recent Analyst Research (last week): We project 13% annual growth to FY14 from FY10 reflecting 80 significant legacy NFS customers in FY14, up from 52, 37, and 28 in FY12, FY11, and FY10, respectively. The great majority of them in China and the rest of Asia where NTWK is the undisputed preferred software provider of every major public and state-owned car company in the region. It's global alliance with Mercedes Benz has resulted in over a dozen multi-million implementations in the region and many more in the pipeline Globally The new Vroozi Cloud Division contributed $1.3 million in FY12. We expect at least $4 million in FY13 and $6 million to FY14 Our price target is based on the average forward 2013 P/E multiple of 13.2X (up from 12.8X in August 2012). NTWK is trading at 6.4X our FY13 net income projections. EPS forecast of $0.85 per share. We applied an 11X multiple to our FY13 EPS forecast. We anticipate a richer multiple as earnings momentum builds in FY13. . NTWK is entering FY13 with a $25 million backlog and approximately $100 million in qualified leads. One quarter of the backlog is from four new NFS platform customer implementations that began in 4Q12. In August 2011, NetSol launched its Cloud Vroozi Division, an e-procurement search tool for SAP supplier relationship management (SRM) users. SAP AG is a global vendor of enterprise management systems that has the largest market share (24%) based on a worldwide Gartner survey. Vroozi should provide sales diversification and a higher margin recurring revenue stream. The Vroozi division contributed $1.3 million in FY12 sales and is expected to grow to $4 million in revenues in 2013 NTWK announced its 2nd Cloud Division last week offering an array of products and services to capture a greater % of the cloud applications in North America.

They're simply trying to put a finger in the dike that will do nothing to hold back the huge flood of marketshare transfer over to online sellers led by Amazon. Amazon shopping apps exist on every kind of device. Not selling Kindle's is more of an empty symbolic gesture. The real telling thing is how it took this long for Walmart to realize what Amazon was doing with Kindle. Shorts think that online shoppers are dumb; that they "want" to pay more money to retailers like Walmart, that they "happy" to pay higher prices to publishers for e-books. That retailers like Walmart can simply corral consumers. And the double talk from shorts is hilarious. When Amazon was selling Kindles at Walmart it was "bad". Amazon was supposed to (according to shorts) lose money by selling more units at negative margins and then having to share revenues with a third-party so losing even more money. And that ads on Kindles were a real turnoff to users and users all hated it. But now we are supposed to believe them that somehow actually Kindles enticing users to buy other things from Amazon was a huge success and that somehow Walmart's moves now in not selling any more Kindles will hurt Amazon. That Kindle users actually do want to see the ads and that they are a great success at getting customers to buy things at big margins. Big margins? Why of course, because why else would Walmart be worried? Techstrategy told me that Walmart did not mind going toe to toe with Amazon in a price war, after all. That they were going to bleed Amazon to death since Amazon did not have enough cash. So the Kindle ads must have been generating huge profits for Amazon, otherwise you'd think Walmart would be happy to sell customers Kindles if it really were true that the Kindle strategy was only going to hasten the "bleeding". And here's another point. Shorts told me that Kindles don't matter anyway. Nobody buys them. Everyone only wants an iPad or a Nexus7. Those tablets get much better reviews. If this were so then why would Walmart care about what Amazon was doing on the Kindle front? So what if Kindle customers were to buy less from Walmart? The number must be so small and the death of the Kindle to be so near why bother? How could the effect even register in any material way? (Unless shorts are completely wrong about the success of Amazon's Kindle strategy I mean). See how ludicrous this short double talk is? Just cracks me up!</Msg><Username>nemesis_editor_2007</Username><Timestamp>1348182350344</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 19:05:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348182671845-145</Id><Topic><Title>Shorts, are you sad?</Title><Username>geegenjar</Username><Timestamp>1348157671995</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 12:14:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Apple gives a hoot about crushing Amazon for selling tablets at a loss and probably phones next year.

Amazon and Apple. Amazon is very expensive at 300 times, and Apple is very cheap at 16. As long as there is no destructive technology out there to compete with Apple, Samsung comes to mind, I see Apple going to 1000 and higher. Look at it this way. Should Apple declare a 3 for 1 stock split, the share price would be lower than Amazon selling at 16 times earnings, and we would feel more comfortable buying it. It isn't expensive, but high priced. That's a big difference. There is a good reason that Amazon sells at a premium to Apple. The reason is that Amazon has a scary model, and what happened today with Walmart is confirmation. Today Walmart announced that they will no longer sell Amazon products. When have you heard the words Walmart and competition used together. Target? Walmart doesn't fear Target. The closest competition based on the current business model to Walmart is Costco. Some years back, Walmart said so, and they were right. Then. Now it's different. Think of it this way, Throughout this country and abroad, you see Huge Walmart buildings, Expensive buildings with costly help, expensive real estate, and real estate taxes up the ying yang. The buildings remind many people of the small businesses that Walmart has replaced. The mom and pop businesses if you want more effect. Amazon on the other hand, aside from their distribution centers that we never enter, or do business at, lives in the sky. They have, and will destroy as many businesses as does Walmart without the obvious prescience. Amazon has put to rest Borders, and digging the graves of Barnes and Noble, and Best Buy as we post. We price it with our smart phones, then order it at Amazon. And to add insult to injury, Amazon is creating its own products. Amazon has become a giant that will be hard to stop, and it's p/e will shrink, unless investors like myself and those who get it don't allow the earnings to catch up to its ever escalating stock price.</Msg><Username>richel22000</Username><Timestamp>1348184070986</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 19:34:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348184274617-147</Id><Title>More of Techstrategy's Double Talk</Title><Msg>"Apple gives a hoot about crushing Amazon for selling tablets at a loss and probably phones next year.

You keep posting reviews about other tablets being better. If they're so much better then why does Apple care? The sales must be insignificant, right?

Let's do so: 1) Shoppers have always been able to order from Amazon and other etailers via PC or iPad/Android app. Now they have to collect sales tax going forward. The value proposition is diminishing, not increasing, even though you wish it were different. 2) I know it is difficult for you to understand because you seem to only be capable of superficial thinking, but hypercompetitive business practices (e.g. price wars) can be and often are bad for all parties involved over the long term. The ST lift is offset by "commoditization" and deflationary expectations which make it harder for businesses to extract value over the long term. 3) WalMart pulling the Kindle is strategic. As you've said, Amazon's website is available on any computer with a browser and connectivity and it has an app for every major mobile OS. As such, pulling the tablet at this time wasn't about limiting the consumers reach per se. It was about reducing Amazon's distribution and thus increasing its required marketing cost in advance of the holiday season. It is also about increasing promotion of competing platforms where AMZN's product is an App rather than a portal... You commented the other day that the right time to expand was when Amazon had cash. Well, the right time for all of the competitors to hit Amazon is now that it has already committed its cash to Kindle Fire / HD, as it begins to collect sales tax and as the economy approaches a recession via the fiscal cliff. I'm honestly surprised that Best Buy hasn't done the same yet because Best Buy is likely most impacted by showrooming... 4) WalMart has already recommitted to everyday low prices and certainly will match Amazon prices, particularly with digital content which is incremental growth for WMT but core and necessary cash flow for AMZN. Apple can and should match on content as it has already done on some publisher's ebooks. I am actually hoping that Apple launches a subscription eBooks model that upends Amazon altogether, but I don't expect it. 5) Your logic is so flawed so many places -- it makes you a good pumper because it takes a lot of work to correct all of your misleading statements....WalMart would not know what margins the ads were generating for Amazon. Frankly, there has been too little time to draw any definitive conclusions. What is does know is that it has no reason to help promote Amazon product and does have an incentive to have Amazon with capital tied up in excess Kindle/Fire/HD inventory... The more successful Amazon's tablet competitors, the less capital Amazon will have to fund any expansion and the more vulnerable it will be if we do enter recession (which despite the constant propaganda to the contrary is highly likely since private sector GDP has been in a recession already... Only gov't spending growth has maintained aggregate GDP growth...). Thus, WMT's incentives are aligned with Apple, Google and others to focus selling non Amazon tablets and readers. Amazon screwed up on launch timing. It needed to because it had to hide the impact of collecting sales tax and the best way to do it was to juice revenue growth with a new product launch. But, in doing so, it launched the Kindle too early for the holiday cycle and too late for the back to school cycle. Now, Apple iPad mini, Google Xoom and many other Android based tablet makers will get an extra product launch cycle before the holidays, with full knowledge of Amazon's price point and specs. They can steal the excitement and put Amazon into a world of hurt with a well timed blow... I'm not going to waste my time responding to you anymore. I will simply create new threads for people to read since it is clear your only objective is to misstate and mislead and bury real insight in a volume of crap...</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1348186272414</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 20:11:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348188006458-152</Id><Topic><Title>More of Techstrategy's Double Talk</Title><Username>nemesis_editor_2007</Username><Timestamp>1348184274617</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 19:37:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Let's be clear. You are the one with double talk. I've stated clearly that while I think consumers will still purchase Apple tablets because of the vastly superior ecosystem coupled with the leverage of existing content and devices, Amazon's business strategy to destroy the profit pools from hardware will anger Apple and it would be shocking to me if Apple doesn't hit back hard on many fronts. The value at risk for Apple is sufficiently large (because it more in PROFIT per tablet than Amazon charges...) that it will hit Amazon hard in its core. We've already seen that it is matching prices on eBooks (at least for some publishers and I expect all publishers eventually). We've also seen that it has subpoenaed Amazon in conjunction with the eBooks anti-trust case. Soon, it will move to the IP front. There will absolutely be a price sensitive segment consumers who choose to purchase the Kindle. It expect it to sell north of 10MM tablets a year. But, it still won't generate any meaningful cash flow... Class is dismissed. I'm done wasting my time with you...

Best Buy should be the next one. Also I don't think we need to wait too long for the big drop. I was looking at earning estimate going forward....
