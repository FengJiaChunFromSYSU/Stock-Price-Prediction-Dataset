In 2000, are you saying CSCO was correctly priced to it's future when it ran to 82? or that AAPL at 7 in 2003 was relecting it's future run to 670+? Stock prices can overshoot /undershoot: at 5.51 in 2001 AMZN undershot it's avg, at 101 in 2007 and 90 in 2008, it overshot. Doesn't have to reflect anything about the correct future PE ahead. The stock where it is today doesn't tell you anything about whether it's overshooting/undershooting earnings ahead but it certainly is pricing in bigger earnings than it ever had in the past. Every spending announcement it has had has been celebrated and I'll take it you don't even know what the licensing numbers are for EPIX content. So the stock is up on the profections that these deals will turn into signficant earnings. The when and how much have been way off in the past.</Msg><Username>party_bistro</Username><Timestamp>1346781594981</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 13:59:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346781896708-108</Id><Topic><Title>Easy to go $260 before week ends. buy on dip</Title><Username>stupidcat0</Username><Timestamp>1346779153698</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 13:19:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>how much you are buying here?</Msg><Username>checking_here</Username><Timestamp>1346781896708</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 14:04:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346781910962-109</Id><Title>Will SEPT be a Smartphone, Tablet rally ?</Title><Msg>Lots of happening this month</Msg><Username>jgiled</Username><Timestamp>1346781910962</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 14:05:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346782008665-110</Id><Topic><Title>LOL!!

I'm saying that at the time, according to PE addicts like most shorts here who tell me PE has something to do with share prices, those prices would have reflected valuations most people thought indicated the future value of those stocks. Whether they were right or wrong is not relevant since today no one can know the future results of Amazon as it will actually play out. We can only go by what people perceive. If they perceive that projections are too conservative they will pay a higher price than what those projections indicate. "Doesn't have to reflect anything about the correct future PE ahead." Then maybe you shorts need to shut about PE then. "The stock where it is today doesn't tell you anything about whether it's overshooting/undershooting earnings ahead" But it can certainly indicate for those who believe in PE discussions that people are expecting it to well overshoot at some point in the future if not the next earnings report. That is what sets the price, not what the actual results will really be in retrospect. Investors don't have time machines to that with. "it certainly is pricing in bigger earnings than it ever had in the past." This is the dumbest tenant of you idiot shorts. That future earnings could not be much bigger than they were in the past. Of course they will be. Many times over. "Every spending announcement it has had has been celebrated and I'll take it you don't even know what the licensing numbers are for EPIX content. So the stock is up on the profections that these deals will turn into signficant earnings. The when and how much have been way off in the past." Obviously the marketplace is not using the same narrow timeframe you shorts are. Investments in deals do not necessarily have to generate significant additional earnings in a short amount of time. So to say they have been "way off in the past" is a perception of maybe only you and one or two other dumb shorts.</Msg><Username>nemesis_editor_2007</Username><Timestamp>1346783488464</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 14:31:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346783545136-119</Id><Title>AMZN Weeklys calls getting weak.</Title><Msg>Something is funny here.</Msg><Username>geegenjar</Username><Timestamp>1346783545136</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 14:32:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346783618611-120</Id><Topic><Title>Sybil has big fat coin and makes ballsy tradez, therefore ....</Title><Username>philandjoel1e</Username><Timestamp>1346783471699</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 14:31:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Sybil is a fake and a broke donkey that posts to yahoo" I think that is more the case.

And when has this ever not been the case? So what? Apple produces tomorrow's generic hardware products. They're always one step away from being wiped out by imitators who can easily reverse engineer any product they put out. "I don't even read what they paid for EPIX content as if it matters little." It does matter little. EPIX and any reaction to it goes way beyond simply one deal. The reaction is simply to Amazon's whole ecosystem. The EPIX deal simply magnifies the market's anticipation of the larger event: the announcement(s) to come later this week.</Msg><Username>nemesis_editor_2007</Username><Timestamp>1346792883873</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 17:08:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346794017277-159</Id><Title>When are you dopey fux gonna learn</Title><Msg>Middleman distribution of any product or service iz an easy entry, low margin business where seemingly limitless "growth markets" quickly evaporate....
